Fiscal Year 2022 -2023 marks the third and final year of our current MHSA Three - Year Plan (FY 20/21 -22/23) . This Plan Update captures our efforts and outcomes from the previous full fiscal year, FY 20/21 and looks forward towards FY 22/23 in terms of budging and programmatic changes. This past yea r has seen numerous memorable events which have shaped our collective experience. It is with hope and purpose that I know our communities will weather any upcoming difficulties and remain strong in service to the many diverse and culturally enriched commun ities here in Alameda County. As the Director of Alameda County 's Behavioral Health department , I invite you to explore our new Plan Update and provide public comment through our various forums. Our client experiences, data from many sources, and our ow n local community voices affirm that there is an ever -increasing need for mental health services. To that end, ACBH believes that joint efforts with our system providers continue to offer critical services to Alameda County's residence and we will continu e to pursue the expansion of services to meet this growing need. I am pleased with the continued success of many of our programs and encouraged by the plans further expand our system and outreach methods in new and exciting ways that elevate the ideals of health equity and cultural humility . Some of the areas that we are especially honored to support include: 1) Our increased efforts to expand services for the new Afghan arrival community. With the fall of Kabul in August 2021 and the influx of Afghan refugees, ACBH increased its capacity to provide mental health services and supports to this severely traumatized community. 2) Secondly, I'd like to highlight our new MHSA Innovation proposals to serve adults with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) who have been involved with the criminal justice system. It is our goal to support this community through a continuum of peer and clinical services for individuals and their families with the goal of diverting individuals away from the crim inal justice system and preventing recidivation. As one community member stated in our listening sessions, \"When I was doing time, my whole family was also doing time\" . 3) And finally, we invite you to explore some of our continued efforts to expand upon services to our diverse populations including services to African American , Youth and Transitional Age Youth, and unhoused individuals. Please see the Changes section of this Plan for more details. Although we are all living through unprecedented times , ACBH is here to support our clients and family members while holding the spirit and core values of MHSA: Community Collaboration , Cultural Responsiveness, Consumer and Family Driven, Wellness Recovery and Resiliency, and Integrated se rvices. We continue to invite your feedback and look forward to ongoing ways to promote partnership and community engagement. We look forward to advancing these values, and the activities and programs listed in this Annual Plan Update. Together we can make a difference. Together we have hope. Sincerely, Karyn Tribble, PsyD, LCSW, Director Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services 8 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Alameda County Behavioral Health Mission and Vision MISSION Our mission is to maximize the recovery, resilience and wellness of all eligible alameda county residents who are developing or experiencing a serious mental health, alcohol or drug concern.

Community Collaboration Services should strengthen partnerships with diverse sectors to help create opportunities for employment, housing, and education. Client, Consumer, and Family Involvement Services should engage clients, consumers, and families in all aspects of the mental health system, including planning, policy development, service delivery and evaluation. Integrated Service Delivery Services should reinforce coordinated agency efforts to create a seamless experience for clients, consumers and families. Wellness and Recovery Services should promote recovery and resiliency by allowing clients and consumers to participate in defining their own goals so they can live fulfilling and productive lives.11 TOP HEADER MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Executive Summary 1 Executive Summary Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBH ) is pleased to present the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Annual Plan Update for fiscal year 202 2-23. The Annual Plan is based on data from fiscal year s 2020-21 and 202 1-22. This report is the final fiscal year report of the MHSA Three -Year Program and Expenditure Plan ( Three -Year Plan) covering fiscal years 2020 -23. The Three -Year Plan began July 1, 2020, and has been updated annually for fiscal years 2021 -22 and 2022 -23. The Three -Year Plan and Annual Plan Update describe MHSA funded programs including; the program purpose , the monies allocated to fund these programs , and the measures taken to evaluate plan effectiveness and ensure that the programs meet the Mental Health Services Act requirements . The Plan is comprised of five components : Community Services and Supports (CSS), Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI), Innovation (INN), Workfor ce Education and Training (WET), and Capital Facilities & Technology (CFTN). California's Mental Health Services Act MHSA is funded by levying a one percent tax on personal annual incomes that exceed one million dollars. The MHSA, known as Proposition 63 , was passed by California voters in 2004 and provides increased funding to support mental health services through five components for individuals with mental illness and inadequate access to the traditional public mental health system. Mental Health Services Act Expenditures The importance of MHSA support is well known to our department, as it's currently 24% of the overall ACBH budget. For State Fiscal Year (FY) 22/23, ACBH set aside up to $ 173.5 million in budget authority, which is an increase of 23% over the previous fiscal year of 2021 -22. ACBH has been able to increase this budget level due to increased allocation amounts from the State and unintended carryover from the previous year's budget where not all of the budget was spent due to multiple fact ors including workforce shortages and staff vacancies, slow project start -up, and continued service/engagement issues due to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19). Within the past few years all counties in California have experienced increased MHSA allocatio ns due to the success of the California economy. However, it should be noted that the MHSA funding stream is highly volatile with a tw o-year lag of final allocation amounts; so, while counties are currently receiving stable or increased allocations year o ver year it's important for ACBH to monitor the allocation estimates closely and adjust funding as needed so that as much funding as possible can be used in the communities of Alameda County. At this time, it is projected that the FY 22/23 MHSA allocation will closely mirror the allocation from FY 21/22, however there are additional increases being estimated for FY 23/24 and FY 24/25. These increases will be reviewed during next year's Community Program Planning Process as ACBH develops the next MHSA Three Year Plan. ACBH strives to balance community need in collaboration with fiscal responsibility so that there is not a fiscal \"cliff\" where dramatic reductions will be needed and vice versa as much funding as prudently possible is allocated to mental health services within Alameda County. As an example of this accountability, ACBH has developed two budget workgroups (one for county staff and one for contracted provider/peers/family members). Within these workgroups MHSA spending strategies/guidelines will be discussed and recommendations will be made to ACBH Leadership. This will take place Spring 2022. 12 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2 MHSA Community Program Planning & Stakeholder Engagement Process Exhibit 1 provides an overview of Alameda County's ongoing Community Program Planning Process (CPPP). Alameda County utilizes five MHSA principles to guide planning and implementation activities and employs a range of strategies to engage stakeholders at all levels of planning and implementation. Our CPPP provides a number of opportunities fo r a 14-member MHSA Stakeholder Group (MHSA -SG) and other representatives to participate in the development of our Plans . During fiscal year 2019-20 and 2020- 21, MHSA increased the membership of the MHSA -SG by 27% and i ts underserved /unserved demographics (including Transitional Aged Youth representation) by 250%. Exhibit 1: Major components of the MHSA Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) Despite health factors precluding our department from convening large in -person forums due to COVID - 19, ACBH has been committed to identifying creative ways in which to engage the community and various stakeholders over the course of our planning efforts. The CPPP for the Annual Plan Update is informed by activities conducted during the Three -Year Plan CPP P. The Three -Year Plan CPPP consisted of more than 1 4,069 community input invitations via a social justice public relations firm, social media, e -mail request s, and creation of a new Community Input web page with 2,145 new users. A community input survey was translated into 7 threshold languages with 627 unduplicated completions , which was a 14 % increase from the previous CPPP survey completion rate in FY 17/18. In addition to a combined 17 focus groups facilitated during the CPPP for FY20/23 Three -Year Plan (198 group participants ) and FY21/22 Annual Plan Update (45 participants) , MHSA coordinated a larger CPPP between October 2021 - January 2022 , facilitat ing TAY forum s for young men of color (60 attendees) , a \"How to Read the MHSA Plan\" webinar , and 18 listening sessions with 307 total participants. Each listening session represented an important cross section of Alameda County populations in accordance with data from the Three -Year Plan CPPP (See Appendix B-4 for CPPP findings) . Some reoccurring themes include : Isolation and lack o f community ; workforce need Address the response time in systems such as ACCESS More services for the African American community across the lifespan Supports and activities for the LGBTQ community, particularly the transgender 13 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 community of color and sex workers Need for increased language capacity, especially for Asian communities More peer support services Address insecure housing utilizing Full-Service Partnerships (FSPs ) Support the reentry community with services to divert people from John George and Jail Cross -Component findings : Factors Related to Expenditures : Expenditures to sup port an enhanced behavioral s ystem of care through Community Services and Supports comprises 76 cents out of every Mental Health Services Act dollar. This proportion is in keeping with Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5892, which specifies the percentage of Mental Health Services Act monies to be expended on each component. Local Trends Impact Report : Even though Alameda County is growing, the number of children is decreasing and overall the county is aging . Women comprise 51% of the county population, and is home to the second -highest number of veterans among Bay Area Counties. COVID -19 and unemployment and homelessness rates represent indicators of the overall economic health of Alameda County that are related to an increased n eed for public mental health services. Examination of the impacts of the shelter- in-place policy on unemployment , housing and homelessness, and environmental data over time suggest that MHSA funded providers are called upon to serve more people in need , especially as the pandemic health emergency continues. Program Update and Changes Significant changes from the FY 2020-23 Three -Year Plan incorporated into the FY 202 2-23 Annual Plan Update are in response to the CPPP and operationalized through a three -pronged departmental lens: that of Alignment, Communication, and Organizational Structure. Specifically, we have determined it to be critic al for the success of our MHSA strategies and program s to both be reflective of our community needs and supported through departmentwide organizational improvement strategies. Our CPPP and implementation of this Plan Update will primarily focus on our Alignment with county, agency and departmental mission, vision, values; improving Communication (internal/external stakeholders); and improving our Organizational Structure and service delivery. In February of 2021, our focus on enhancing our care delivery system was expanded to help chart our departmental course is it relates to the direction, guidance, and set of principles that will shape our transformational efforts towards quality impr ovement. We believe these metrics to be in line with the fundamental values of the MHSA, and now represent five key areas: Quality, Investment in Excellence, Accountability, Financial Sustainability, & Outcome -Driven Goals . We are pleased that this foc us and our dynamic efforts relative to system improvement will continue to support the work and critical areas supported through our MHSA planning efforts. Several critical areas were identified and prioritized through the planning process and focused on a spectrum of behavioral health services and support needs. A variety of key cultural and community - centered strategies, supportive housing and crisis stabilization programming, and engagement and support strategies which target persons most challenged by serious mental illness were prioritized. Including, but not limited to : 14 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Transform community -based Service Team and Case Management programs to Full -Service Partnership (FSP) model Assigning additional resources to multiple PEU programs that have been historically underfunded, transitioning from the Innovation (INN) plan element to Prevention & Early Intervention (PEI), address health equity, and/or address them es identified in recent CPPP Increased funding for INN Community Assess ment & treatment Team (CAT T) and three new INN proposals Expansion of the Alameda County Loan Repayment Program (ACLRP ) and transition to the state - funded Regional Workforce Education a nd Training Partnership Program (RP) Workforce Education and Training staffing expansions in accordance with data from recent CPPP Increased funding to support a n ew Medical Respite bed expansion project Augmenting the African American Wellness Hub Complex with and additional $8/8M in non - MHSA funds. Funding to support the development of a new billing s ystem, which will be linked with ACBH's future electronic health record General System Improvement Efforts Performance indicators for MHSA, including the FSP Programs and Prevention and Early Intervention component have been updated for FY20/21, and include performa nce measurements and outcomes. The MHSA plan and plan element evaluation reports are included in Appendices C and D. In addition , a new Performance Management section contains a summary of quality assurance and improvement strategies. Additional funding has been identified for the replacement of the current billing system, improv ements to the ACBH web -based data and outcome reporting system called YellowFin, and newly created reporting dashboard on Full Service Partnership (FSP) clients that covers hospitalizations, housing, incarcerations, primary care linkage, employment, education, cost, and data quality. Closing In summary, ACBH has aggressively approached its CPPP process in a manner designed to eliminate as many barriers as possibl e to promote inclusive outreach and engagement. Our resulting MHSA Annual Plan for fiscal year 202 1-22 is reflective of a Departmental recalibration and attempt to regard our valuable stakeholder feedback with a commitment towards Alignment, Communication , and Organizational Structure. Our goals are to create a basis for future efforts that represent a variety of stakeholder and community needs such as culturally -relevant, clinically pragmatic, and community - centered support and care. We are pleased to p resent our process, plans, and commitment to the future of our county with you at this time. 15 TOP HEADER MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Summary Of Changes From Previous MHSA Plan Update (FY21/22) I.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY 21/22) Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBH) began implementation of its MHSA Plan upon receiving approval of our Community Services & Supports (CSS) component plan from the California Department of Mental Health in 2007. Subsequently, ACBH received approval of four additional component plans: Prevention & Early Intervention (PEI), Work force Education & Training (WET) Capital Facilities and Technology (CFTN) and Innovative Programs (INN), which account for the full MHSA funding received by Alameda County1. 16 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG PLAN UPDATE FROM FY 21-22 Transition of Service Team Case Management Model to a Full-Service Partnership Model In FY 22/23 ACBH will be initiating the change process to transform the community -based Service Teams and Case Management programs into the Full -Service Partnership (FSP) model in order to increase system capacity and team centered quality of care for our clients who have a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). The FSP model is a comprehensive and intensive mental health program for adults with severe and persistent mental illness. FSP utilizes a \"whatever it takes\" field -based approach using innovative interventions to help people reach their recovery goals. Clients must be approved by ACBH Acute Crisis Care and Evaluation for Systemwide Services (ACCESS) for services. Referrals to ACC ESS can come from sources including but not limited to family members, behavioral health care providers, primary care providers, and psychiatric hospitals. Clients 18+ may also self- refer to ACCESS. All Client are 18+ years old. The ACCESS line can be reac hed by dialing: 1-800-491- 9099. INITIATE PRIMARY CARE INTEGRATION MODEL WITH ALAMEDA HEALTH SYSTEMS (AHS) ACBH and AHS will begin to develop and implement a primary care integration model for specialty outpatient mental Health services in AHS' Ambulator y Clinics. The program will serve as a bridge for connecting behavioral health beneficiaries to the larger Alameda County Behavioral Health Care system. The goal is to support unique, new patients who've fallen through the cracks and need linkage to the larger system of care. Ultimately, keeping beneficiaries stable in the community and significantly reducing their need to utilize physical healthcare settings for issues that are behavioral health in nature. This project will be listed under workplan OES D # 25: BH-Primary Care Integration Project in the next MHSA Three Year Plan. EXPANSION OF THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE & LAND LORD ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM formerly known as the Landlord Liaison/Rental Assistance Housing Program Due to the ever present and increasing housing needs of ACBH clients, ACBH will work with the HCSA Office of Homeless Care and Coordination (OHCC) to expand the current number of rental subsidies from 465+ households to 1,165+ households (an increase in 700 + households). This support will facilitat e the following landlord liaising efforts, which include: Unit acquisition Outreach and engagement of new landlords Risk mitigation funding to retain units Landlord incentive funds Collectively, all households served within the Landlord Liaison program will continue to be connected to Housing Community Supports (tenancy sustaining services) to sustain their housing. Overall, the program currently reflects a 98% retention rate of perm anent housing. EXPANDED CAPACITY FOR CO -OCCURING RESIDENTIAL SERVICES Due to the continuing need for co -occurring residential services for ACBH clients, ACBH will be developing and expanding its capacity for these services with a services as needed (SAN) contract with the agency Everwell.

EXPANDED CAPACITY FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY CRISIS LINE & COMMUNITY EDUCATION PROGRAM Due to the increasing number of crisis calls that ACBH's contracted provider, Crisis Support Services of Alameda County, is receiving on the suicide prevention crisis hotline ACBH is expanding this contract so that there will be increased capacity for th eir call staff, more training and additional phone lines and workstations. MHSA funding will also be used to expand CSS' language capacity in its Community Education Program. CSS will recruit and hire a hire a full -time Spanish speak ing staff to conduct o utreach and deliver direct services, such as suicide prevention education and Mental Health First Aid presentations and trainings. There's a significant need for these services in the Spanish speaking community as data shows that in 2019 the second leadi ng cause of death for Hispanics, ages 15 -34, was suicide. Additionally, in 2019, suicide attempts for Hispanic girls, grades 9 -12, were 30% higher than non -Hispanic white girls in the same age group. Overall, it is the hope that this expansion will make much needed Suicide Prevention services more accessible to a vulnerable population, especially during the pandemic and the related stressors to mental and physical health and wellness a. Contract Changes to Multiple PEI Programs In FY 22/23 ACBH will support contract augmentations to several PEI programs for the following reasons: Historically underfunded, Are moving from INN to PEI and/or Will address themes identified in the recent Community Program Planning Process (CPPP). These augmentations align with the department's priority of increasing community health equity. The activities include additional resources for Transition Age Youth (TAY), outreach and support for African American family members, new community healing circles to reduce isolation, support for the African American focused Speaker's Bureau, expansion of the African American Women's Health and Wellness project, supports for individuals who hear voices/special messages, mental health apps for multiple community groups, expansion of the Health through Art program , expansion capacity for suicide prevention through the text line and increased bi -lingual staffing for outreach and mental health supports for the Afghan and Middle Eastern com munities. ACBH identified this funding through fiscal analysis where it was determined that the PEI budget could expand due to increases in the current PEI revenue (state allocation) as compared to the FY 21/22 budget. a. Augmentation of Approved INN Program in FY 21/22 The Community Assessment & Treatment Team (CATT) was approved by the MHSOAC on October 25, 2018 and after an in -depth planning process CATT had a soft launch on July 21, 2020 with a team in Oakland, San Leandro and Hayward, respectively.

INNOVATIONS (INN) 19 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Proposal 2: Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services The Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services is a collection of four (4) projects, of which three are peer led and one is family focused. The project specifically seeks to support mental health consumers who are justice involved by helping them transition back into the communit y following an arrest or incarceration, identify and address the issues that led up to their arrest and/or incarceration, and connect with mental health and other services to support them in their recovery and reentry journey. This project also seeks to build the capacity of family members to advocate on behalf of their loved one with a serious mental illness who has become justice involved. As a result of these projects, we expect that individuals will experience fewer episodes of arrest and/or incarceration and will have increased participation in ongoing mental health and other services. The included services are: Reentry Coaches. WRAP for Reentry Forensic Peer Respite. Family Navigation and Support. Proposal 3: Alternatives to Incarceration Project The Alternatives to Incarceration project is a collection of three co-located services that are intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from the criminal justice system into the mental health services. This project specifically seeks to divert individuals from incarceration in three primary ways, 1) when a mental health consumer who is forensically involved begins to exhibit early warning signs of a crisis with behaviors that may lead to police contact, 2) at the moment of police contact that may result in arrest, and 3) when the person has fallen out of compliance with their probation or parole and is subject to re -arrest. This collection of services seeks to provide services that prevent individuals with mental health and crimin al justice involvement from being booked into the jail. Services include: Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment (CRT) Arrest Diversion/Triage Center Reducing Probation/Parole Violations (RP/PV) Although WET and CFTN have completed their ten -year block grant period from the Mental Health Services Act at the end of FY 2017/18 ACBH is committed to continue WET activities through the transfer of funds from CSS as well as other strategies like the Regional Par tnership listed below. a. Alameda County Loan Assumption (Repayment) Program Expansion The Alameda County Workforce Education and Training (WET) local Loan Repayment Program (ACLRP) is in the process of transitioning into the State -funded Regional Workforce Education and Training (WET) Partnership Program (RP). In September 2021, Alameda County opted to participate in the WET RP, funded by the State Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), formerly called the Office of Statewide Health Planning and IV. WORKFORCE, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING (WET) PLAN UPDATE FROM FY 21-2220 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG PLAN UPDATE FROM FY 21-22 Development (OSHPD). OSHPD's five-year WET county funding allocation is effective from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2025. The total OSHPD grant allocation for Alameda County is $2,102,701 from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2025. This funding will increase the number of loan repayment recipients Alameda County will be able to support as well as allow for additional local WET activities. Please see the WET section in the Plan Update for additional details. b. WET Staffing Expansion During the recen t Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) workforce issues and concerns were highlighted in every session. In order to begin to address these concerns and identify solutions, the WET unit will be expanding by three new staff positions. This will help to increase infrastructure and provide department wide training support and other workforce development functions to ACBH staff and contracted CBO providers. The WET unit intends to begin the hiring process starting from July 1, 2022. c. Graduate Stipend Intern Program Expansion ACBH currently offers up to 20 stipends for graduate level interns as a workforce recruitment and retention strategy, and to increase workforce diversity. The stipends are awarded to graduate interns placed in ACBH and contracted communit y-based organizations, and who are linguistically and or culturally able to serve the underserved and unserved populations of the County. In FY 22/23 ACBH will add 15 additional intern awards, for a total of 35 possible awards. More information on this program can be seen in the WET section of this Plan Update. Additional workforce projects are also in development as the topic of workforce, financial incentives, peer support services and training were top issues highlighted during the most recent CPPP Listening Sessions. More information will be available in the next MHSA Three Year Plan FY 23/24 -25/26. a. African American Wellness Hub Complex Update (CF5) ACBH, in partnership with the Alameda County General Services Agency (GSA) department, continues to work on the development of the African American Wellness Hub Complex (HUB). ACBH Leadership has increased the MHSA contribution to this project from the original amount of $ 6M to $10.7M. The funds for this project have been as: in FY 20/21, F Y 22/23. The ACBH Office of Ethnic Services, in partnership with the ACBH Building Facility Manager and GSA identified an outside architectural team who completed their final Space Needs Assessment report for the African American Wellness HUB. The report presented three viable options and limitations for the procurement of the HUB. The partnership continues by exploring and examining the inventory of County owned facilities for the HUB and other potential suitable sites. In addition to the ongoing exploration of space and facilities, ACBH is also creating a video to chronicle the years long effort to build a wellness center that focuses on the mental and behavioral health needs of the African American community. V. CAPITAL FACILITIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL NEEDS (CFTN) 21 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG First articulated in the African American Utilization report commissioned by the department in 2011, the African American Wellness Hub co ncept came about as a direct result of community feedback and collaboration with ACBH staff. This 5-minute video aims to briefly tell the story of the origins of the project through the reflections of some of its early architects, current contributors and community leaders who will speak to the benefits and long term impacts the facility will have on the African American population it seeks to serve. More information will be available on the progress of the video and either a land purchase or building purc hase/renovation as it becomes available and will be posted on the MHSA website and in the next MHSA Three Year Plan (FY 23/24 -25/26) b. New ACBH allocated $3M in MHSA CFTN funding for Medical Respite bed expansion projects in Alameda County. The Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) unit under the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) is developing a new medical respite project called Oak Days utilizing these funds. Oak Days is currently running as a non- congregate emergency shelter with 40 beds set aside for very medically fragile clients who have complex physical and mental health care needs. To be eligible for one of the 40 beds at Oak Days clients must meet ALL THREE of the following criteria: 1. Functionally compromised (which includes both physical and mental health issues) 2. Complex chronic condition (including mental health) 3. 8 or more ED visits, or 2 or more inpatient in last year (psych ED visits and inpatient psych admissions are included in the count) These beds were created to meet a need that doesn't exist. The majority of start -up costs have been provided through Alameda County's Whole Person Care Program, but there is currently a need for the provider to purchase a Home Health Agency Lic ense. This is a one -time expense that will allow the agency to pay for caregivers with Medicaid funding and will open up other medical respite opportunities for Alameda County. c. MHSA Technology Project (TN1) ACBH has utilized CFTN funds to support the following Technological Needs (TN) Projects: Development of new billing system: ACBH is now partnering with the vendor Streamline Healthcare Solutions, LLC, to formally initiate the effort to provide a fully integrated billing system on the SmartCare Platform to replace INSYST (our department's current registration and billing platform). Streamline and the integrated SmartCare Platform will incorporate all of the functionality necessary to ensure staff and contracted providers work together within and across organizational boundaries. This platform will help to advance the effective delivery of behavioral health care for our clients and the communities we serve. SmartCare will also provide our system with options to resolve system challenges and facilitate enhanced flexibility for data sharing.

The total amount of CSS funding used for this purpose shall not exceed 20% of the total average amount of funds allocated to that County for the previous five years.MHSA Funding For Fiscal Year (FY) 22/23, the following items are important to note regarding the MHSA Budget : ACBH set aside up to $1 73.5 million in budget authority (sum of line B) , which is an increase of 23% over the FY 21/22 budget of $140.6 million (see above information by component). o This budget increase includes : Transforming Service Teams to FSP , Contract augmentation for PEI programming , NEW Innovation INN projects (3) as mentioned below, Additiona l staffing for the ACBH Workforce and Primary Care Integration units , New partnerships with local hospitals, Expanded rental subsidies and land lord engagement activities, Additional funding for the African American focused Wellness Hub, Additional Graduat e Stipend Awards , and 3% COLA to MHSA funded programs and supplemental contract augmentations. The carryover listed for the INN component will be attached to three new INN projects: o 1-Peer Focused web -based DBT Training ($2.6M over 4 years), o 2-Clinical Forensic Continuum ($13M over 5 years), and o 3-Peer/Family focused Forensic Continuum ($8M over 5 years). Upon State approval of the FY 22/23 MHSA Plan Update, these funds will not be available for other projects. You can read about these more under INN . The Dept of Finance has estimated that the FY 22/23 MHSA county allocations will be relatively flat, however increases will be seen in FY 23/24 and FY 24/25. o Additionally, it's significant to mention that finalized MHSA allocations have a 2 -year lag time where revenue expectations can change. Moreover, external events such as the global COVID -19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and supply chain issues all have possible effects on MHSA revenue, all of which can make the fund volatile , causing future plann ing to be somewhat lengthy and complex . 24 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE -

Compared to other Bay Area counties Alameda County residents have the lowest median household and per capita income ( Table 2 ). While the median rent is the lowest among the Bay Area Counties, Alameda County has the highe r rental rate compared to Contra Costa, Marin, and Santa Clara counties , meaning a higher percentage of residents do not own a home. Additionally, 50% of red of those that rent spend 30% or more of their income on their rent, this means that the rent they pay is burdensome. Alameda County also has the second highest percent of people in poverty for all ages and for children. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program for low-income individuals that provides help with purchasing food and beverages. Alameda County has the second highest percent of households that receive SNAP and many ACBH providers report that they connect their clients to food resources1.

During the MHSA Community Program Planning Process, the top concern that survey respondents named for all age groups was housing and homelessness and persons experiencing homelessness were one of top three groups that respondents felt were n ot adequately served by the ACBH system2. Multiple populations were overrepresented in the homeless populations, veterans (9% versus 5%) compared to the overall Alameda County population and adults with serious mental illness when compared to the United States population (32% versus 5%). Compared to the general Alameda County population the unhoused population has a higher percentage of Black /African Americans, Two or More Races, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander ( Figure 4 ), and Hispanic or Latino (22% versus 17%).

Environmental Health California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has created the CalEnviroScreen 3.0 model4 to assess pollution burden and population characteristics that increase vulnerability to pollution among census tracts throughout the state. The pollution burden is measured through the averages of environmental exposures and effects. Population Character istics are measured through the average of sensitive populations and socioeconomic factors components. The total score is calculated by combing the pollution burden and population characteristics. Below is a map of the 2021 CalEnviroScreen results for Alam eda County ( Figure 5 ). Briefly, the areas with lower burden and vulnerability to pollution are green and the neighborhoods with the highest are red. Areas of Oakland, San Leandro, and Hayward have the highest burden of pollution and vulnerability to pollut ion.

COVID -19 produced a variety of challenges to CPPP activities and required an immediate response to address implementation barriers as a result of social distancing regulations and disruptions to programs and services. The MHSA CPPP -SC has identified the following three key implementation challenges: Admi nistrative barriers , Resource Disparities , and Community Stress ors. The MHSA CPPP -SC focused on reducing public outreach and awareness campaign barriers related to social vulnerability factors such as poverty, lack of access to technology to complete onlin e surveys (e.g. computer, internet); lack of transportation access to provider sites where surveys were proctored, and fragmented communication and messaging.

This is two of their success stories of Circa 60 FSP partners (clients). An 82-year -old partner who struggles with intimate partner violence, with a high level of hospitalizations. We were able to offer her partner support and housing while she participated in intimate partner violence treatment. She was able to return home successful and limit the harm she was causing her partner. This client got diagnosed with COVID -19 and utilized the safer ground spaces in order to self -isolate. She was able to use the resources offered by the county, and made a full recovery. This speaks to the importance on treating the whole system , and highlighting the importance of natural supports. Circa 60 also continued providing services in the community throughout the pandemic educating all partners, providing masks, hand -sanitizer and making sure they have the ability to socially distance. A 71 -year -old client has a daughter in a different FSP. The two FSPs combined to host a family dinn er with both participants and other family members.

Founded on the Principles of Wraparound, Alameda Connections provides unconditional care that is family centered, individualized, culturally responsive, and strengths -based. Our approach focuses on supporting young children and their families by providing services in the child and family's natural environment, including in the home, at school/daycare, and in the commun ity. Our program hopes to reduce stress for caregivers and facilitate positive, healthy parent/child interactions and relationships; strengthen families by enhancing natural supports and providing help with navigating service systems; provide developmental guidance and behavioral coaching to families to promote healthy development and emotional regulation; connect families to resources in their communities; and provide crisis intervention and concrete assistance with problems of living. Target Population: Alameda Connections serves the youngest Alameda County children (ages 0-8) who are experiencing difficulties in school and/or may need intensive support services to stabilize.

Language Capacity for this program and number of people served in each language : English (20) and Spanish (2) III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Obviously the COVID 19 pandemic continued into this past fiscal year which had a significant impact on our s ervice delivery model as well as direct referrals from providers in the community. Referrals were slow to come in, primarily because most pre school aged children were not enrolled in preschool programming through the pandemic. The therapeutic nursery s chools, primary referral sources, closed or had very low enrollment. Half way through the fiscal year we began to serve more families and youth in person in the community. Telehealth was a valuable tool for many families and treatment team members but, i t wasn't nearly as efficient or effective as in person, face to face work. Our families and kids needed to be seen regularly, in person so, we were able to adapt our treatment delivery model to safely see families in their homes (or backyards, porches, et c.). The strain of the pandemic also exacerbated the mental health challenges of the parents we serve. Many of our families were just struggling in so many ways. Stable housing, which is always challenging, became much more of a focus of our treatment a s many of our families face housing insecurity. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Here are a few stories submitted by our Care Coordinators that highlight some of the interventions provided by Connections and the successes the youth and family were able to achieve during the course of treatment. \u0003(Clients' names have been changed to protect identity.) 60 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG \"Roger\" was referred to Wraparound due to aggressive and disruptive behaviors that put him at risk of losing his placement in preschool and in daycare. Roger also struggled in the community as he would present with impulsivity and intense temper tantrums. Roger was under his grandmother's care and was experiencing repetitive grief and separation from his biological mother who suffers from add iction. With high behavioral needs and a lack of natural support, Roger's grandmother was no longer able to continue with her full -time job. Roger was receiving individual/dyadic therapy from another nonprofit agency. The Wraparound Care Coordinator was able to immediately collaborate with Roger's individual therapist and coordinate Family Team Meetings to address Roger's biggest challenges. Roger's grandmother was a strong advocate for Roger and promoted his strengths, but she felt unsuccessful in suppor ting him when he was triggered. The Wraparound Care Coordinator worked closely with Roger's grandmother to better understand Roger's behaviors, reduce caregiver stress, and practice co -regulatory strategies. Additionally, they worked together to develop pl ans around visits from Roger's biological mother. The Wraparound Care Coordinator also collaborated with Roger's grandmother and his school team during the development of Roger's 504 plan. Although Roger was bright, easy to engage, imaginative, and coord inated, he struggled to be safe with his body, follow directions, and accept support when feeling distressed. The Wraparound Support Counselor met with Roger consistently for a year and a half (virtually and in -person through COVID -19) to build rapport and practice pro -social, communication, and self -regulation skills outside of the home and in community settings. The Wraparound Support Counselor supported Roger through enormous feelings following his mother's visits as well as the grievance of his father's death from an unexpected event. The Wraparound Support Counselor also assisted Roger to positively engage and develop a friendship with a peer at a park. With the help of Team Roger (Roger's grandmother, therapist, support counselor, care coordinator), Roger has developed the superpower of reflecting on his behaviors and pausing to think before acting! Roger and his grandmother enjoy the daily practice of reflecting on the highlights of his day as well as what he could do differently. Roger's grandmother reported that he has independently shared with her, \"grandma, I was mad and was going to (unsafe behavior), but I made a better choice.\" He is also earning rewards in school for listening and follow instructions. Roger's grandmother is proud of his growth and feels ready to return to her full -time job. She thanks wraparound for \"being so effective in helping him, and me, understand himself, his world, his life and experiences, and how it affects his behavior.\" Roger and his grandmother can now enjoy many a ctivities together \u2014going shopping, playing at the park, fixing things in the home, making plans for the day/week, etc. He is also spending time with extended family members who describe him as a \"cool kid!\" . Our Wraparound team has been working with a fou r-year -old boy, \"Aaron,\" and his family since August of 2020. Aaron, his younger brother, and his mother had been living in a transitional housing program for several months, which combined with the pandemic, had caused Aaron's challenges to increase. Afte r having witnessed domestic violence between his parents, Aaron struggled with symptoms of post - traumatic stress as well as a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Attempting to attend virtual preschool and obtain therapeutic services virtually while livi ng in a co -housing situation greatly increased Aaron and his family's stress. Aaron's mother's application to receive SSI benefits had been denied and she was behind on the portion of rent she was required to pay for her housing program. She was caring ful l-time for both of her children and unable to work. Aaron's mother is an immigrant who struggles to navigate systems and the stress of COVID had taken a toll on her mental health. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES61 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Our Care Coordinator quickly began to collaborate with Aaron's mother to d etermine how we could best support Aaron's needs. She offered in -person (with PPE & outside) to support both mom and Aaron. Our support counselor worked with Aaron during individual rehabilitation sessions on identifying and expressing his feelings, social skills, and developing regulation skills. We worked to support getting ABA services for Aaron in the home as well. Our Care Coordinator consulted with Bay Area Legal Aid to understand how to appeal Aaron's SSI denial. She collaborated with multiple provid ers to obtain letters and documentation of Aaron's disability and helped to draft the appeal. Our Care Coordinator helped Aaron's mom apply to be paid as an In -Home Support Services provider to Aaron. She also worked with mom to apply for a COVID housing r elief program to cover all back -pay that she owed to her housing program. Most importantly, our Care Coordinator provided invaluable emotional support to mom during this time, helping her to develop her own coping skills and self -care strategies. During ou r monthly Family Team Meetings, we spent ample time allowing team members to share the strengths they had witnessed in Aaron and his mother which seems to fortify Aaron's mother to keep moving forward. Over the course of the past 10 months, Aaron's mother won her SSI appeal (which included receiving retroactive payments), is now being paid as an IHSS provider for her son, and she is up -to-date with her rent. Although they are still living in their transitional program, the team is confident that mom will be able to transition to long -term housing within the next few months due to her more robust income level and the numerous low -income housing applications we've helped her to submit. Aaron has been able to receive regular support from our program as well a s in-home ABA service. All team members report improvement in Aaron's behaviors, including increased ability to transition, accept limits, follow directions, and engage pro -socially with others. Our team hopes to be able to continue supporting Aaron and hi s family for the next few months to be able to return to in -person school, as well as to settle into more permanent housing. \u0003 V.

Language Capacity for this program and number of people served in each language : We have 2 staff (Parent Partner and Youth Partner) who speak Spanish. We had 5 youth/families where Spanish is spoken in the home, exclusively by the parent (usually the youth spoke and/or understood English) . III. FY 20/21 Challenges: The three main areas of challenge are for our program are: staffing, impact of COVID and the general impact of excessive paperwork demands. These main issues are inter -related in many ways. Three clinicians left their position during this fiscal year, two of whom left shortly after they became licensed and one left before their year hire anniversary. COVID seems to be causing an over all work force shortage, making it harder to fill open positions. We were fortuante to recently hire a new clinician so that we are at full capacity with 2.5 FTE clinicians but staff turnover is negatively impactful to our youth and families who are weary to trust social service providers. COVID -19 continues to challenge how we prefer to conduct business. Staff and families have been very understanding and we have been doing in -person visits on porches or backyards and taking walks to do the visits in sa fer ways. We know that the transition back to in -person schooling will be very difficult for many families. Youth have been able to set their own schedules and families have a hard time setting these important structures in the home. The excessive paperwo rk demands is also a continued issue for providers. Staff indicate that they spend about 30 -40% of their work time doing tasks to satisfy the demands of paperwork (including Medi -Cal and MHSA requirements) and it has lead to clinicians leaving their positi on. Some indicated that they were reconsidering their career choice in this field. While staff complete the required MHSA forms (3M, KET), we do not get the aggregated data back after submitting the information and the questions are more geared to adult/T AY needs. 64 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: From the incentive measurements, we fully reached 2 out of the 3 areas. We averaged meeting 4 visits per month with each youth at 86% (full goal was 80%) and we had no service gaps in 92% of ou r youth (full goal was 90%). We missed the goal for follow up visits within 5 days after a discharge from an acute care. We were at 79% and the partial goal was 80%. Several visits took place at day 6 or had some attempts to reach out to the youth/family t hat was an informational note. Additionally, we do not get notification regularly when a youth is admitted to acute care. In these instances, a lack of engagement issue is the primary work that we are attempting to strengthen. We had 1 family that was v ery reluctant to use our services. The youth has psychotic symptoms and the parent is trying to understand how to help their child manage safely when these symptoms are present. When they entered our service, they were unhoused. The youth's symptoms made i t hard to stay with friends and family for any length of time. They also had difficulty staying at homeless facilities due to our client's behaviors. The family ended up sleeping in their car. Using Flex Funds, we were able to house them in a safe neighbor hood by paying for the deposit and first month's rent. The parent is employed and able to pay the rent ongoing. Flex funds were also used to help the parent purchase a used car to get to and from work. She is working with the wrap team on better understa nding and meeting her son's mental health needs. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: We are very concerned about the longterm impact from COVID -19 protocals, especially the impact on educational and social skill gaps. Most of the youth in our program have struggled acaedmically and likely lost a significant amount of gains during the remote learning period. We are concerned about our youth and family's well -being and attempt to encourage those who are eligible to get vaccinated. Fred Finch has been takin g serious steps in addressing racial equity in our operations. We currently have staff participate in Affinity Groups to learn more about the impact of privlidge for white identified staff and to help provide a voice for staff who identify as BIPOC. The EB W program attempts to use individual, group and staff meetings as well as monthly trainings to give space to this important topic. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: We are contracted to serve 20 youth at a time. We hope that our current s taffing allows us to maintain this level throughout the full fiscal year. VII.

The majority of services are provided in the community. The program provides clinical case management, crisis intervention, individual rehab, peer mentoring, medicatio n management, IPS employment support, housing assistance, collateral support for families, and skill building and socialization groups. Target Population: The STAY Program target group is Transition Age Youth ages 18 to 24 with serious mental health condit ions. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20 /21 b. Number of clients served: 67 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program and number of people served in each language : Participants' language needs were as follows for FY 20 -21: 1 participant is monolin gual Spanish - Speaking; 5 are bilingual English and Spanish -Speaking, 1 participant is bilingual English and Vietnamese, and 1 participant is bilingual English and another undisclosed language. Participants' families were primarily English -speaking with o ne participant's family monolingual Spanish -Speaking and one participants' family bilingual English -Speaking One bilingual English/Spanish -speaking Peer Mentor remained on staff for the duration of FY20 -21 and the bilingual English/Spanish -speaking Clinica l Supervisor started in June 2021. One bilingual English/Spanish -speaking clinician worked temporarily in December 2020. One part -time bilingual English/Farsi -speaking clinician worked temporarily October 2020 -January 2021. When in collaboration with parti cipants and families, services are offered in their preferred language in person or by language link interpreter. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: COVID -19: Overall, the primary barrier to program implementation was COVID -19. For about 2 months of FY 20 -21, Al ameda County was in a Shelter in Place order. Although the program continued to provide in-person services, participants were often not open to this due to concerns of health needs. Also, there was a clear impact on the implementation of housing and employ ment/education services due to COVID -19 in that employers, educators, and housing agencies moved to primarily digital platforms, causing a barrier to participants' engagement in these services. Hiring shortages: The STAY team has been understaffed for all of FY20 -21. For most of the year, the team had 4 of 7 clinicians positions filled, 1 of 2 peer mentors, and 0.4 family partner. An RN was hired in Spring of 2021 at 0.4 FTE. Overall, there have been more non -clinician applicants than clinicians, which imp acts the programs' ability to increase program caseload size. 68 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Housing shortages and disruptions in services: At the start of COVID -19, shelters decreased their census size in order to ensure health and safety of occupants. Also, collaborating agencies exp erienced difficulties in obtaining timely construction permits, and the explanation for these delays are impact COVID -19 had on governing agency's ability to do inspections in a timely manner and complete repairs on time. One participant was displaced for the majority of FY 20 -21 due to a fire at their apartment for these reasons. Coordinated entry: Changes occurred in FY 20 -21 with regard to how Coordinated Entry was managed through partnering agencies. This presented a challenge to staff in the FSP as w ell as participants. Phone calls were made to coordinated entry through 211 and attempts were made to connect to Coordinated Entry list through the partnering agency center, and many times, staff and participants were asked to try again, call a different n umber, or come another time. At least 2 STAY participants were unable to connect to Coordinated Entry when the attempts were made, despite several attempts, due to residing in a treatment facility past the 90 days allowable by HUD requirements. Coordinat ion of Care: Coordination with psychiatric hospitals has improved due to county alerts indicating when a participant has presented to psychiatric emergency. Also, coordination directly with the social work supervisor has increased collaboration with social workers at the hospital. At the same time, social workers on the units continue to have a difficult time returning calls and coordinating. Also, subacute placements have a difficult time responding to inquiries, impacting response time and ability to coor dinate strong discharge plans. Lastly, COVID -19 restrictions impacted visits to these facilities when a unit experienced an outbreak, which further impacted collaboration and contact. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: \"Improve the ability of clients to secure and maintain stable permanent housing in the least restrictive and most integrated living situation appropriate to meet their needs and preferences\" . At the end of FY 20 -21, 28 participants were residing in stable living environments that matched their current level of needs and preferences; these included board and cares, independent living homes, family or friends' homes, or their own permanent housing in which they have a lease. These individuals resided in the same place for at lea st 90 days. 9 of these participants were in their own subsidized permanent housing. Of these 9 participants, 4 receive Housing Choice Vouchers through a special program for former foster youth, 2 reside in Berkeley at a Project -based site, and 3 reside in their own units in collaboration with a third -party housing services agency, such as Abode Services or Building Opportunities for Self- Sufficiency. \"Reduce client hospitalizations and utilization of emergency health care services for mental health and phy sical health issues\" . One of STAY's goals is to reduce the inpatient hospital rate and recidivism rates for program participants. Of 26 hospital discharges that occurred in FY20 -21, only 15% experienced recidivism in 7 days, and only 27% experienced recidi vism in 30 days. The STAY team was able to follow up with discharging participants within 5 days of discharge 83% of the time by phone or in -person in order to ensure continuity of care. 80% of participants in the STAY program reduced the number of psychia tric emergencies, inpatient, crisis stabilization utilization. \"Connect clients with ongoing primary healthcare services and coordinate healthcare services with clients' primary care providers\" . One of STAY's goals is to address all aspects of wellness fo r the participant, including connection to healthcare and primary care. In FY 20 -21, 87% of participants were connected to primary care, and 80% of participants had at least two visits in the years' time. All participants are screened for health and nutrit ion needs at intake, and all participants who do not have COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES69 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG an established primary care provider at that time are referred to Rising Harte Wellness Center/Native American Health Center. Personal Client Story: One participant in the STAY program for several y ears has solidified permanent housing and stability of symptoms over the course of their involvement in the program. This participant has also expressed interested in gaining skills in baking, and due to the impact of symptoms and life pressures, has not b een able to address this goal fully despite starting a program a few years ago. The STAY employment specialist who has been collaborating with this participant on work and education goals for several years was able to address her needs and goals, while als o prioritizing her capacity and preferences - supporting her in going slow, taking breaks, and continuously persisting to address this goal over time. By continuing to show up and offer support, and through this participants' readiness and resiliency, the participant restarted the program and completed it this year! This participant is now serv - safe certified and has graduated the baking program, which is a huge success, two years in the making! V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: The projection of clients for FY 21/22 is related to staff and hiring opportunities over the course of the next year. In order to increase program caseload size, the program will have to complete 2 intakes for every 1 discharge, and clinician hiring impacts the ability to complete intakes, assessments, and treatment plans across the program. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: 75 VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: In the final month of FY 20/21, the STAY team implemented a rotating schedule of Outreach Perso n of the Day to better cover the immediate needs of participants and to outreach more readily to those who have struggled to engage or have been referred. FY 21/22 will be the first year to have this rotating schedule as a part of the program infrastructur e. Care Connect - the STAY team now has access to Alameda County Care Connect, the centralized portal for several social services agencies in Alameda County. This likely will have impact on STAY's ability to coordinate care with other providers in the pa rticipants' lives. Up until this point, coordinating with healthcare and housing have been impacted by participants' own recall and impact of symptoms on communication. Having access to this portal will likely have a positive impact on case management prov ision and engagement across the program because staff will be better able to actively engage around connection with these agencies and services. 70 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Metrics % of FY 20/21 FSP clients that achieved the metric Reduction in Hospital Admits * 63% Reduction in Hospital Days * 82% Reduction in Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) /Crisis Stabilization Days* 80% Reduction in Incarceration Days* 58%, this increases to 86% after 2 yrs of service Increase in the number of days Stably Housed* 35% Primary Care visit within the previous year 71% With a vocational goal who are employed 11% Received a follow up visit within five days after a mental health hospitalization or crisis 84% Average of four or more visits per month per client 75% *The metrics above measuri ng \"reductions\" are looking at FSP clients served in FY 20/21 who experienced one of these negative events (crisis, hospital admission, and incarceration) prior to enrollment in an FSP compared to the first year of FSP enrollment .

Language Capacity for this program and number of people served in each language : English and Spanish III. FY 20/21 Challenges: As the pandemic continued this year, PAIGE team continued to go above and beyond to meet participants in the community, in office spaces, and via digital platforms to ensure their needs were being met. One of the biggest challenges continued to be accessing and outreaching in psychiatric care settings and jail. Historically loc ked settings are an opportunity for intensive engagement and trust building to prepare for reentry and support in the community. However, this year continued to have many barriers to outreach and engagement efforts; though PAIGE team was able to use unique and collaborative strategies to continue to meet our partners where they were at in their recovery and goals. Another challenge was ability to engage families in TDMs due to COVID -19 protocols \u2014we were able to host a few team meetings using in -person, int ernet, and outdoor settings, though families overall struggled with follow through. PAIGE team continues to encourage wraparound and TDMS as a significant part of the model and innovative techniques have helped pull in families that may have otherwise stru ggled with attendance. PAIGE team also experienced significant staff turnover (transferring internally, medical leave, and leaving the agency) which put a strain on the program as a whole. Though the team banded together and participant & programmatic need s continued to be met. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: PAIGE team participants have overcome a lot in the past year. Entering into the year during the pandemic, participants identified PAIGE team as one of the few resources they could continue to rely on during the chaos. The pandemic created increased barriers in the system for participants to access resources that they could previously manage independently, such as social 72 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG services, DMV , social security. PAIGE team was able to minimize barriers and enroll/transfer Medi -Cal, SSI, and access to DMV services for participants, where they otherwise were unable to follow through. PAIGE team was able to support participants with employment with IPS throughout pandemic and had many success stori es linking participants to jobs at Tesla, Good Eggs, Amazon and educational opportunities. Primary care and medication management were also great accomplishments of the PAIGE program this year \u2014with many clinics closing to in -person services, PAIGE was able to offer advocacy, support, and our medication services to ensure participant needs were addressed. Client Story: One incredible success story is about a participant who we began serving in 2019 who struggled with managing psychosis symptoms, substance u se, and was in and out of John George frequently. He had lost his parent in his adolescence and while he was in custody his fiduciary was forced to sell his family home which caused him a great deal of distress and anger due to the loss. PAIGE team opened the participant following an episode where he was in locked settings for over 7 months (Villa, JGPP, Santa Rita). He had difficulty managing severe psychosis symptoms, agitation, assaultive behaviors which resulted in recidivism in these crisis and crimina l justice settings for most of 2019. In 2020 he began increasing engagement with PAIGE team and would regularly come to Hedco for drop -in support, though was ambivalent about medication and continued substance use which resulted in homelessness and ongoing interactions with crisis services. Despite his struggles, he continued to meet with PAIGE, reach for support, and explore barriers to his engagement with recovery in a meaningful way. His trauma history led to challenges with attachment and testing PAIGE or BACS around abandonment as well. Between May 2020 and December 2020, he had more than 22 encounters with crisis services and 3 with criminal justice. This participant utilized Amber House as a support, while PAIGE program and Amber worked collaborativel y to meet participant where he was at and continue to develop creative strategies to engage him \u2014whatever it takes. It was this collaboration that led to this participant agreeing to and accessing an injectable to manage his psychosis symptoms. He was able to identify that his substance use was directly linked to trying to self -medicate the voices, and that he wanted to change his life. This participant has had zero interactions with emergency services in over 7 months. He has been able to successfully manag e his psychosis symptoms and engage in therapy to explore his trauma and grief, in addition to developing and enhancing coping tools, independent living skills, and communication skills. He currently takes his monthly injectable, and sought additional prn to manage breakthrough symptoms. He is enrolled in an intensive online cyber security program that he attends independently 5 days a week. He researched this program and has been following through, and upon completion will lead to full -time employment. Thi s partner has benefited from BACS collaboration through use of Amber House, PAIGE, and The Henry Robinson as his support system. He is currently at the top of the waitlist for BOSS Meekland permanent supportive housing where he will be able to continue to work on his independent living skills. Overall the PAIGE team reduced the number of partners that were re -hospitalized, by providing wraparound services 7 days a week with a passionate and dedicated team. PAIGE team exemplifies what it means to provide c ollaborative wraparound care, coordinating with family, friends, landlords, hospitals, and clinics from the start of services with participants and timely in the event of crisis or support needs. The Wellness Centers have also been an asset to the team, wo rking closing with HRC staff to link participants and their families to the support resources they are interested in. As COVID -19 regulations begin to lift, PAIGE team has supported participants in accessing vaccines, COVID tests, and has begun to offer gr oups for participants to engage. PAIGE recently had a field trip to an A's game where participants and their families were invited to attend in order to enhance the connection to community. PAIGE team continues to be looked to as a model program for reduci ng barriers and utilizing creative engagement strategies in order to support youth in accomplishing their goals.

FY 20/21 Additional Information: PAIGE team had some fluctuations in staff during this year, which they were able to take on with stride. P AIGE team was able to continue supporting 40+ participants with half of the staff deemed appropriate in the RFP. The team was able to onboard, train, and integrate new staff utilizing the opportunity to reengage participants that had been struggling to mee t. PAIGE team has great comradery as a program and all members are passionate about serving TAY and embracing the \"Whatever it Takes\" approach. PAIGE team is collaborative and supportive of one another and the youth and has been able to successfully implem ent the daily schedule in ACT model, ensuring participants meet with 2 -5 different staff monthly, and typically minimally 2 meetings a week. The team is not afraid to step in or step up when needed and the participant outcomes demonstrate this success. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: 70 VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: The PAIGE team would like to increase primary care linkage and increase the number of live in -person stakeholder meetings each partner has each month which have b een impacted due to the pandemic. We would like to get more natural supports involved and engaged in each partners treatment plan. PAIGE has exemplified response to emergency hospitalizations and will continue to build relationships and reduce barriers to collaborative discharge planning by working very closely with John George Psychiatric Pavilion, Villa Fairmont, Jay Mahler, Woodroe, Amber House, Refuge, Casa De La Vida, ILA homes, and HSP board and care to be involved in all steps of discharge planning a nd will continue to do so during this fiscal year. PAIGE team would like to move back towards a model where groups are planned and a calendar is produced monthly to encourage participant attendance and voice in groups. PAIGE will work this year to implemen t at least 2 groups per month and one social event to encourage community building, interdependence and support. 74 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Metrics % of FY 20/21 FSP clients that achieved the metric Reduction in Admits* 91% Reduction in Hospital Days* 97% Redu ction Services (PES)* in Incarceration Days* 68% Increase in the number of days Stably Housed* 47% Primary Care visit within the previous year 70% With a vocational goal who are employed 6% Received a follow up visit within five days after a mental health hospitalization or crisis 84% Average of four or more visits per month per client 83% *The metrics above measuring \"reductions\" are looking at FSP clients served in FY 20 /21 who experienced one of these negat ive events (crisis, hospital admission, and incarceration) prior to enrollment in an FSP compared to the first year of FSP enrollment.

The Greater HOPE Team also continued to navigate additional s afety protocols around COVID, linking participants to vaccines and COVID testing as well as access to primary care while working to protect their safety. We also have had some participants and staff test positive for COVID as well as experience exposures and quarantine in the last year which has caused additional staff shortages throughout the year.

Visits to the jail were discontinued, so our strateg y with those referrals changed as well, to the jail's short -session videoconference system. We made an effort to reach out to all jail clients referred to us, even if the circumstances normally wouldn't merit an SSI application, because they were so iso lated at the jail during COVID It was in many ways easier to reach clients than when we had to physically travel to the jail, but because the paperwork had to travel separate from the interview, it was more difficult to get a claim started. Social Se curity claims processing slowed considerably. Cases where there was not enough medical evidence for a favorable decision had been on hold for months as the fiscal year started, waiting for a remote hearing or remote exam to be scheduled, a process in whi ch all but the most obviously disabled clients did not get a reasonable timeline or the same chances of convincing a decision maker of their need for benefits. Clients, like everyone, tended to avoid healthcare settings if not having COVID symptoms, so building a record of disability was more difficult. We worked with our evaluating psychologists to try to bridge this gap, but it took them a while to pivot to remote exams. Phone exams would allow only a fraction of the usual battery of exams to be gi ven, and although by July we had two psychologists providing remote video exams via Teams, but it was initially only available to clients with their own phone or computer to participate. At this writing, phone and video exams and phone and video hearing s are still the only options for our clients. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Our clients enjoyed over 80 favorable disability determinations in the fiscal year, despite the severe slowdown of decisions that resulted from SSA's operation al changes in the pandemic. Another three cases had favorable outcomes without a disability determination: we helped a client obtain proof of birth to qualify for age related benefits, helped another stop an SSA overpayment from lowering his monthly ben efits, and one client became employed to the extent she no longer needed or qualified for disability benefits. Case Study: We appreciate most the stories where a client is initially suspicious or otherwise not comfortable with HAC or the services we pro vide. Because of the nature of disability cl aims - long and COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES81 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG quite personal the relationships we have with clients often change over time. Mrs G. had a severe and longstanding personality disorder, diagnosed as early as grade school according to her records. Her 'maladaptive' patterns of interaction had remained stable over time, and like many with her diagnosis she had held a number of jobs, but none for long. She did not see her own part in the loss of jobs or relationships, but by the time she reached us she had seen so many relationships with employers, friends, family, and service providers end badly that she had no reason to think it would work out any differently with HAC. Her attorney's position was, \"Yes, she is difficult to work with. And she's not going to like me, but I'm going to get her on disability anyway, because she deserves my help as much as anyone.\" And she did. Her attorney, R, gathered all her medical records as soon as their initial meeting was over and obtained a detailed letter of diagnosis from her treating provider. She submitted these and earned the ultimate success for the client, a win at the initial stage of the process. No disappointing denial, no length appeals. Mrs. G. knew that most people were denied at the initial stages of the process, and seemed almost pleased, but continued to have a distrustful and antagonistic relationship with her attorney even as they went to the Social Security office to finish the claim and start her benefits rolling. With her first check, Mrs. G, who had been living in her car, rented a hotel room fo r a week to shower and rest comfortably. However, her small dog that lived in the car with her was not allowed, and threatened to get her kicked out of the hotel. R. offered to look after the dog while Mrs. G stayed in the hotel. It was not part of her job, but she loved dogs and wanted to help Mrs. G. Mrs. G. distrustfully accepted. She came to the office each day to visit her dog, making sure the dog was cared for, and admonishing R for various things. On the last day of the stay, well -rested with her dog intact and seemingly happy, she presented R with a greeting card, containing a sincere thank you message written inside. It was completely out of character, and as such it was incredibly touching for all of us, especially R. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: This depends on the rate at which Social Security decides cases and the portion of those decisions that are favorable. It's hard to project this because of continuing pandemic i mpacts, but based on the past two years we would expect to serve a minimum of 400 clients. That includes approximately 250 cases still pending from the past FY, and new cases up to our maximum capacity under this contract of 560 rolling. VII.

III. FY 20/21 Challenges: The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic presented significant challenges to service delivery in FY 20/21, particularly in ways the pandemic affected communication with clients . For instance, clients often rely on publi c libraries or other public spaces \u2014which were closed for months \u2014to access their email. USPS delays in processing mail particularly affected homeless clients who use General Delivery and made obtaining necessary signatures more difficult . Clients sometime s do not have a stable address, move in and out of Santa Rita Jail or medical facilities, and experience periods of homelessness. All of these issues slowed services and delayed communications between staff and clients. The closure of Social Security Ad ministration (SSA) offices due to the pandemic also presented a unique set of challenges. BayLegal s taff effectively transitioned to submitting most documents to SSA electronically. However, the SSA field offices are understaffed , the offices are generally closed to the public except for limited appointments , and hearings were held virtually . Clients have the right to an in - person hearing, so they had to consent to a virtual hearing to progress their case. BayLegal worked with clients to ensure they c ould attend virtual hearings and brought clients into the Oakland office as needed to attend hearings in special conference rooms retrofitted to comply with all safety protocols. Despite these challenged, staff continued to obtain positive outcomes for clie nts, including initial approvals, successful virtual hearings, on the record decisions, Appeals Council and federal court remands, and effective policy advocacy with SSA and CDSS. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: BayLegal served 328 clients 356 cases in FY 20/21. BayLegal closed 169 cases: 7 cases assisted clients with advice and counsel, 19 cases assisted clients with brief services, and 143 cases assisted clients with extended services. Of extended service cases, 109 cases assis ted clients with Administrative Agency Decisions, 9 cases assisted clients with court decisions, 15 cases assisted clients with extensive services not resulting in settlement or court or administrative action, 1 case assisted a client with a negotiated set tlement with litigation, and 9 cases assisted clients with other COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES83 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG extensive services. Clients with closed extended representation cases received the following benefits: accessed client's rights to the justice system, including obtaining jurisdiction over a threshold issue, obtaining standing for a client, and preventing wrongful jurisdiction; obtained, preserved, or increased disability , age-related , and maintenance benefits ; and obtained other access to justice such as a referral or other monetary benefit. Monetary benefits for clients from back awards and lump -sum settlements, reductions or eliminations of claimed amounts, cost savings, and benefits totaled $2,622,214. BayLegal's ACBH contract, Section IV Contract Deliverables and Requirements sets the f ollowing goal: 15% or fewer cases will be closed without obtaining benefits for the following reasons: loss of contact, insufficient merit to proceed, change in eligibility status, or client withdrawal. BayLegal's rate for cases closed without obtaining b enefits due to loss of contact, insufficient merit to proceed, change in eligibility status, or client withdrawal was 11%. BayLegal successfully accomplished this goal. BayLegal's ACBH contract, Section IV Contract Deliverables and Requirements sets th e following goal: achieve an SSI/SSDI allowance rate at least equal to that of the national average approval rate. In the SSI Annual Statistical Report, 2019, the national 2018 allowance rate was 43.5%.4 BayLegal's FY 20 /21 allowance rate for closed case s was 73%. BayLegal successfully accomplished this goal. The client story below illustrates the work funded by this grant. *Client name changed to protect confidentiality: Quondra D.* was living in temporary housing but was not in a supportive environment. After an incident, she was arrested and sent to Santa Rita Jail. BayLegal had previously helped Quondra obtain SSI benefits and her attorney once again stepped in to help her obtain benefits once she was released. Quondra's attorney worked with he r social worker and the Public Defender's Office to determine her release date and set up housing and other social services. Quondra's attorney reviewed medical and eligibility documents and filed for SSI benefits. When Quondra was released, BayLegal and her social worker had already set up housing for her and connected her with Bay Area Community Services Homeless Engagement Action Team to provide further support. Quondra's SSI application was approved with nearly $5,000 in back payments covering the ti me from when she was released to when her application was approved. Quondra is now in a supportive environment, is stably housed, and is able to take care of herself. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Cases with the Social Security Administration (SS A) and the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) are generally moving more slowly due to the ongoing pandemic. SSA and DDS are both understaffed and SSA field offices are generally closed to the public. Cases with DDS are sometimes stalle d awaiting a consultative examination that DDS staff has been unable to schedule due to the lack of in -person appointments, or client or clinician objections to an in-person appointment. Despite these challenges, BayLegal continued to advocate for its c lients. In part with BayLegal's advocacy, SSA established \"vulnerable population liaisons\" in field offices to help facilitate applications and address barriers to processing claims, appeals, appointment of representative, and other forms as part of SSA's COVID workgroup. In September, SSA plans to roll out a new online tool to make it easier to establish a protective filing date or application lead similar to California's GetCalFresh.org tool. BayLegal hopes that these changes will increase service acce ss for its clients and result in more benefit 4 This is the latest national allowance rate published directly by t he Social Security Administration. https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_asr/2019/ssi_asr19.pdf. 84 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG awards.

PROGRAM NAME: Housing Solutions for Health Program Description : The OHCC coordinates a range of housing programs and services for individuals with a serious mental illness and their famil ies. Together these investments focus on achieving the following core goals: 1. Increase the availability of a range of affordable housing options with appropriate supportive services so that individuals with a serious mental illness and their families c an \"choose\", \"get\", and \"keep\" their preferred type of housing arrangement; 2. Minimize the time individuals with a serious mental illness spend living in institutional settings by increasing and improving working relationships among housing and service p roviders, family members, and consumers; 3. Track and monitor the type, quantity, and quality of housing utilized by and available to ACBH target populations; 4. Provide centralized information and resources related to housing for ACBH consumers, family members, and providers; 5. Coordinate educational and training programs around housing and related services issues for consumers, family members, and providers; 6. Work toward the prevention and elimination of homelessness in Alameda County. Target Popu lation: MHSA funded programs under the OHCC focus on helping individuals with serious mental illness in Alameda County to live in the least restrictive and most integrated setting appropriate to meet their needs. OHCC efforts focus primarily, but not excl usively, on helping individuals experiencing homelessness and those with prolonged stays in institutional settings. Age Group: Adults 18-59 years old; and those over age 60 years old I. Specific program categories that operate under the OHCC include: 1) Long- term housing subsidy programs and housing partnership support contracts that make it possible for individuals with serious mental illness to live in permanent supportive housing and licensed residential facilities; 2) Short -term housing financial assistance to help individuals with serious mental illness to obtain and maintain housing with one -time and short -term payments of security deposits and rent; 3) Supportive services linked with permanent subsidized housing to create \"permanent supportive housing\" options for individuals to live in community -based rental housing settings; 4) Temporary housing programs for individuals with serious mental illness experiencing homelessness to be sheltered and supported while they work to return to permanent housing; 5) Street out reach and housing navigation services focused on helping homeless individuals with serious mental illness living in public places and emergency shelters to return to permanent, safe, and supportive housing as quickly as possible; 86 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 6) Supporting an affordable housing search website and news alerts related to current housing opportunities relevant to people with serious mental illness and extremely low incomes; 7) Referrals, coordination, clinical consultation, training, and oversight of a network of more than 450 licensed residential facilities and permanent support housing slots countywide; 8) Housing education and counseling sessions at ACBH -funded Wellness Centers and other community locations; 9) Landlord Liaison Program recruits and works with landlords and proper ty managers in the private rental market settings to acquire safe, decent and affordable housing countywide and retain units securing long -term housing for clients who have previously had barriers to locating affordable housing or maintaining long term ten ancy; 10) Staff involvement and financial support toward countywide efforts focused on addressing homelessness; 11) MHSA affordable housing project application preparation in partnership with nonprofit affordable housing developers. Program Outcomes & Impa ct: FY 20/21 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: of Clients Served: MHSA -funded housing service programs reach at least 1,500 people with serious mental illness each fiscal year. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: How Well Did We Do? Number of activ ities or services utilized : more than 442 households received long -term housing financial assistance and supportive services to keep their housing, 60 households received short -term housing financial assistance, over 88 stayed in MHSA- funded temporary hous ing, and more than 600 received housing -related services including outreach, navigation, or permanent supportive housing services. Due to decompression relating to pandemic mitigation efforts, temporary housing sites operated at lower occupancy during fisc al year 20/21. % Retention Rates: permanent housing programs supported by the OHCC have maintained housing retention rates of around 86%, temporary housing exits to permanent housing have remained around 43%. Challenges: The pandemic has proven to add challenges to those experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness and accompanying household members. Due to risk mitigation efforts, temporary shelters operated within decompressed capacity limits to support social distancing and health measures. Addi tional on-going challenges facing include rapidly rising costs of housing within the County. The number of individuals experiencing homelessness has nearly doubled between 2015 and 2019 with an estimate of over 8,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night - http://everyonehome.org/everyone -counts/ . The costs of housing impacts many of our service providers and their staff who cannot afford to live in the community where they work. Several of our programs have underutilized budgeted funding due to challenges with hiring and retaining staff members; this was notably experiencing during the last fiscal year. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES87 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Coordinated Entry System: The County's Coordinated Entry System (CES) for addressing homelessness, formalized in 2017, underwent planning and transitions to an updated system intended to improve provision of services and prioritize of need. These changes were a result of extensive stakeholder feedback, alignment with System Model ing efforts, and improved efforts to reduce racial inequity in homelessness. Increased collaboration and coordination will be needed to ensure the maximum effectiveness of CES. Much larger investments in affordable and supportive housing are needed by multiple levels of government to ensure individuals with serious mental illness have a place to call home. Permanent Supportive Housing - Success Story ACBH has provided landlord services since 2013 at a permanent supportive housing site in Oakland. Follow ing a series of challenges, including incidents of violence between residents, Housing Services staff joined with the onsite service provider, and property manager to organize a comprehensive response. Through collective action, the partners leveraged exis ting relationships to integrate county crisis services and law enforcement to engage in a proactive plan of action to intervene with the high risk behaviors and outreach to residents to offer connections to mental health services. The team also initiated d esign and building modifications to enhance the safety of the physical environment. Frequent check -ins to ensure supportive care at the site for residents and staff continue among the collaborative partners. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: Is Anyone Better Off? FY 2020 -21 Impact: One of SAMHSA's four key dimensions of recovery (health, home, purpose, and community) is \"home.\" Stable, safe and supportive housing reduces emergency and crisis service utilization, increases access to quality outpatient services, and improves overall health outcomes. The OHCC worked collaboratively with cities, other county departments, and affordable housing developers to secure $54 million from the statewide No Place Like Home (NPLH) Program (Round 2 funds) for creating more supportive housing for homeless individuals with a serious mental illness. This funding will help create and support 111 new housing units set aside for the target population in buildings with 256 total affordable units. This allocation is in addition to the $43 million allocation in the state in Round 1 of NPLH. These new opportunities will be available in the next 2-5 years. During FY 19-20, ACBH completed an expansion of its subsidized residential care beds (locally referenced as the Housing Support Program - HSP), with the addition of three tier levels of care, developed based on acuity of need. Additional funding helped the program grow from a maximum of 250 clients to a maximum of 300 with funding for higher levels of support for some clients with extensive physical health care needs in addition to mental health needs. During FY 20-21, a total of 251 individuals were served within 16 licensed facilities. Housing Support Program - Success Story Through successful efforts and collaboration, an HSP pro vider was able to share an innovative approach to bed bug mitigation efforts. Following concerns of bed bugs at the facility, the operator coordinated with County vector control to address the vector concerns, while utilizing a cost -effective heat treatmen t response, which resulted in full eradication of the bed bugs. Through further collaboration efforts, the operator later lead a best practice training with fellow operators. To date, this resolved the vector issues at the property. 88 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG The Alameda County Independent Living Association (www.alamedacountyila.org) continued its efforts to raise the quality of room and board housing for seniors and people with disabilities in the County. The number of members that meet quality standards continues to grow and currently reflects 25 ILA certified sites. ACBH resources helped Alameda Point Collaborative to secure and plan for the development of a recuperative care and supportive housing project in the City of Alame da. The project will have 80-90 permanent supportive housing units for seniors ages 55 and older with disabilities including serious mental illness and 50 recuperative care/medical respite beds. Residents in the City of Alameda voted to support the project moving forward and the project secured some additional local and private funding to keep the effort moving forward. More information about the project can be found at: http://caringalameda.org/ . State funding of $15M was approved by the Governor, adding critical resources during a crucial time in addressing a medically vulnerable population experiencing homelessness. ACBH resources continue to support the implementation of countywide and coordinated match ing to permanent supportive housing opportunities through an effort known as Home Stretch (http://everyonehome.org/our -work/home -stretch/ ). In the upcoming fiscal year, there will be over 120 new additional permanent supportive housing opportunities created through a combination of additional HUD, No Place Like Home, and ACBH MHSA housing resources. The Landlord Liaison project has led to a growing number of Landlord participants. This has been an integral effort to secure monthly rent payments, security deposits, risk mitigation funds which may be used for damages in preparation for new tenants. Additionally, a dedicated landlord hotline supports landlords with housing expertise that may be utilized for crisis needs, property management needs and problem solving. Staff triage the calls and provide immediate problem solving based which may include immediate response to an emergency (e.g. property management or behavioral); next day schedulin g of property management or other service; or scheduling of non-urgent follow -up.

They can, at times, access language capacity of other Telecare program staff in case of emergency. These languages include Spanish, Khmer, Urdu, Taiwanese, and Cantonese. III. FY 20/21 Challen ges: The most significant issue during this FY was the COVID virus and response coordination. The CC program had all partners living in congregate licensed homes. We supported our housing partner's with education for staff and residents about hand washin g and COVID 19 health and safety info. We were able to quickly purchase and distribute items like hygiene supplies, games/activities, food, and emergency items to provide to individuals in an effort to support them sheltering in place. We were also able to support some of the homes in accessing PPE - face -shields, gloves, face masks. The overall response to the COVID crisis from the county, our community partners and Telecare were massive and protected our partners from the spread. For partners to rem ain eligible for conservatorship in the community, there is a requirement of living in a licensed board and care setting. The limited number of affordable licensed homes in Alameda County or homes participating in the HSP program and their availability, impacts our partner's ability to participate in the program. This program would benefit from additional options and access to licensed board and care homes in Alameda County. 90 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Is Anyone Better Off?

The CC staff's continued work with partners around accessing resources and educating around COVID has allowed staff to support many partners in getting their vacc ination to increase the safety of all members of our community. Personal story: When \"Jane\" was initially referred to the CC program, she had been at Villa Fairmont Hospital for a year. Prior to that hospitalization, Jane had lost her housing, relapsed o n alcohol, lost connection with her family due to problematic behaviors, and been victimized in the community. When she joined the CC team, she was interested in maintaining her sobriety, reconnecting and repairing relationships with her family, as well a s exploring educational and employment opportunities. She engaged with the team and developed positive therapeutic relationships with all staff on the team. She has been able to maintain her housing over the last and build community supports with staff a t the B&C home, increase her visits with her family and repair those relationships.

FY 20/21 Challenges: The most significa nt issue during this FY was the COVID virus and response coordination. The AOT program had several partners living homelessly in congregate camps which were believed to be particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus. We mobilized quickly and were able to get 4 people into hotels within the first week of the shelter -in-place orders. We were able to quickly purchase and distribute items like pre -paid phones, hygiene supplies, games/activities, food, and emergency items to provide to individuals in a n effort to support them sheltering in place. The overall response to the COVID crisis from the county, our community partners and Telecare were massive and saved lives. Another significant challenge we face in the Bay area is access and availability o f quality, affordable housing. It is a significant barrier for AOT partners who want independent housing but have limited or no income and are not able to afford housing. With limited shleter options and no clear or accessible flow from shelter to affordable housing, individuals struggle with maintaining housing. Is Anyone Better Off? IV.

Personal client study: When \"John\" was initially referred to AO T for evaluation, he was in acute crisis at John George. He had become physically aggressive with his family due to his unmanaged psychosis and paranoid thoughts. He was sleeping outside because the family was fearful of having him in the home. John ini tially had limited interest in engagement with the team but could identify some goals for himself - improving his relationship with his family and getting a job. The team worked to support him with these goals specifically and that allowed us to build a s trong supportive relationship with John. He began to accept our support more readily, started and maintained medications, was allowed back in the home with the family, he developed stronger coping skills, and secured employment with a local store. John c ompleted 3 terms with the AOT team, demonstrating his increased commitment to his mental health, and was able to step down to a lower level of care in the community when he graduated from the AOT program. He continues to work with his new team with the su pport of his family, as well as maintain his employment. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: AOT program continues to work with community law enforcement, acute hospital settings, and the courts to identify and assess eligible individuals for the AOT p rogram. Working closely with our county partners, we have reached and maintained our census expectation over the last year. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: AOT will continue to w ork with our county partners to maintain our 30 -person c ensus. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: The AOT program has no projected changes, however we continue to respond to changing community needs during this pandemic.

The CHANGES FSP provides comprehensive evidence -based treatment and support services using the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) service delivery model in which services are delivered by an integrated team including case managers, a vocational specialist, a peer support speciali st, a psychiatric nurse practitioner , and a nurse. The CHANGES FSP provides the following services : mental health services including individual and group rehabilitation, medication support, nursing support, and targeted case management. The latter service links the individual consumer to needed resources and supports in the community such as housing, benefits, and medical/dental services. Individuals assigned to the CHANGES FSP team can expect to meet with a team member at least twice a week. Additionall y, 80% of the team 's services are delivered in the community. Target Population: The CHANGES FSP serves adult Alameda County residents, 18 years of age or older, with serious mental health conditions or significant functional impairments in one or more major areas of functioning, who are at high risk of re-hospitalization and/or frequent users of acute psychiatric services. The CHANGES FSP has a strong reputation for working effectively with individuals with co- occurring mental health and substance use conditions. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20 /21 a. Number of clients served: 124 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program and number of people served in each language : English (123 clients served) and Spanish (1 individual served) . We also h ave the capacity to serve Hmong and Samoan speakers although we don't currently have any in among our members. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: The two chief challenges our program faced in the past year were staffing retention and hiring, and adapting to a s ervice delivery environment defined by Covid -19 restrictions, safety precautions, and outbreaks. The latter challenge impacted our access to our members in jails, hospitals, CRPs, and congregate housing sites. It complicated hospital discharge consultatio n and coordination, and created another obstacle to service delivery to clients living in the community. And it especially increased the difficulty of conducting effective outreach and engagement to difficult to engage members. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Nearly half of CHANGES members have a chronic medical condition and we have made a commitment to make sure they get the medical care they need and deserve. One of the program's major successes in the past year has been in the gai ns many of our medically vulnerable members made in keeping routine and follow -up medical appointments, and in getting specialized treatment, including surgery. For example, one member had had a large hernia for over five years. His chronic homelessness a nd active addiction were both obstacles to him getting corrective surgery. In the 94 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG last year the CHANGES team helped him get placed in a SNF, which was his first period of housing stability for over 4 years. This was achieved through close partnering with the SNF management and staff, including much advocacy on the client's behalf after numerous AWOLs. Living in the SNF, and with the support of the CHANGES staff, the client was able to achieve sobriety, which in turn allowed him to get the surgery he neede d. The persistent support and strong advocacy of CHANGES nurses and case managers helped another client get much needed surgery. They helped the client move from pre - contemplation to action around treatment for her condition. They advocated with the medi cal provider when the client would miss an appointment. And the team's RN educated the client's B&C staff about their role in preparing the client for surgery by following pre -operative instructions. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A VI.

How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20 /21 a. Number of clients served: 115 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program and number of people served in each lang uage : This past fiscal year, STRIDES provided services to one partner in Spanish (all other partner services were provided in English). In addition to English, STRIDES staff are able to provide services in Spanish, Khmer, and Cantonese. We utilize a certif ied language line for all other languages. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Ongoing COVID -19 difficulties from FY19 -20 brought on similar challenges this fiscal year. While our staff continued to maintain and provide COVID -19 focused services and outreach, including screening and educating partners on safety and sheltering in place, learning to provide service while wearing PPE, learning to provide service by telephone and telehealth, linking with new community services such as COVID Motels, engaing with partner s through the use of art, poetry, music, journaling, book clubs, and Telecare's own Recovery Centered Clinical System workbooks, etc ., many partners became increasingly more restless after spending an entire year primarily in their residences. As soon as community -based drop -in wellness centers opened (including BACS HedCo/Townhouse) and day treatment programs (Fairmont Day Treatment and Highland Day Treatment), partners were quickly provided resources to attend and/or get referred to these programs. Additi onally, through a collaborative effort between several Telecare programs within our building, Case Manager - Substance Use Specialist staff began providing Seeking Safety groups in community congregate homes where many of our partners reside. Lastly, there were ongoing challenges with limited housing options, especially for partners who are traditionally not successful in congregate living and/or have been through many housing placements. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: As mentioned abov e, in order to support our partners who became increasingly more restless during this pandemic, as soon as as community -based drop -in wellness centers and day treatment programs became available, our partners were quickly connected to these programs. Throu gh a collaborative effort between several Telecare programs within our building, staff began providing Seeking Safety groups in community congregate homes where many of our partners reside. As soon as COVID vaccines became available for our partners (eithe r in their respective congregate homes or through County/State resources), there was a robust, immediate effort to provide education to and support all partners to get vaccinated. This also includes hosting our own Telecare vaccination clinic in our downto wn Oakland office to increase accessibility on March 30th. We have also 96 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG been working with our Corporate office to discuss how we can continue accessing COVID -19 vaccine doses in our offices to host smaller clinics - especially to target our drop -in, hard -to-reach, transient partners. To address ongoing housing challenges for partners who have struggled to maintain housing and/or live in congregate settings, we increased our collaboration with various local motels who would accept our partners on short notic e and who may not require identification. Additionally, we started a working relationship with local board and care operator to master lease our own property to increase housing access, specifically for Telecare partners in one of our four community -based programs. Lastly, we began offering a monthly Family Support Group to provide a safe space for family members struggling to care for their loved ones and to create an opportunity to provide psychoeducation to family members of our partners, including topic s such as medication management (attended by our prescriber), co -occurring disorders, self -care, etc. Personal Client Story: Mikal was referred to STRIDES FSP Program from an Alameda County Service Team in Dec 2020. FSP services were requested for Mikal as he had been homeless in the community for the past year (since he moved back to CA from out of state) and had multiple episodes of serious suicide attempts, including most recently in November 2020 during which he poured lighter fluid on his body and se t himself on fire. He struggled with severe depression symptoms and disparaging voices, persistent SI/self -harming behaviors, inconsistent adherence to psych meds regimen, poor engagement in treatment services, and ongoing AOD use. STRIDES team engaged wit h him while he was recovering in medical hospital, then supported him with transferring to crisis residential treatment, and from there, STRIDES supported him with accessing several substance use rehabilitation programs. As of August 2021, Mikal has been s ober for over 8 months, has successfully maintained housing since his initial enrollment, has consistently engaged in treatment - both with case managers as well as medication adherence, and a week ago, he successfully found a part -time employment position . V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: We project that we will be able to serve between 110 - 115 unique individuals this year, as there is a focus on assessing partners who are ready for transitions to step -down case management teams in order to open up more slots for new referrals. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: Ongoing flexibility with service provision during rapidly changing directives during COVID -19 pandemic .

Racism an d homelessness are ongoing public health issues that effect the lives of our clients, staff and programs everyday. COVID -19 created more challenges with seeing clients, keeping clients and staff healthy, and having new housing oppurtunties for clients. In FY 21, we focused on getting folks vaccinated, and offering support as we ended COVID restrictions. There continue to be barriers of other nonprofits not doing face to face meetings with clients, having decreases census in their transitional housing oppu rtuities, and a decrease in PSH matches. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: P was hospitalized 10 times in the month before she came to HEAT. The level one team reported, P was spending all night outside walking and decompensating. She had been hospitalized 10 times in during the month of the referral. She felt alone. She had been in a relationship for 15 years where she felt isolated from healing spaces. She was self- harming, and leaving brutal scars on her arms. She didn't want to die, an d she wanted her life to be different. When she came to HEAT she was given a team of folks and a crisis number to call. We invited her to our community wellness gatherings on Fridays, where she began to find a sense of belonging. We set her up with DBT int erventions by positively reinforcing her coping behaviors. She started using the crisis stabilization unit, and HEAT partnered closely with their team to offer stabilization. She began to come to town house every day, where she ate snacks and sat on the co uch. She talked to everyone about her desire to self- harm, feelings of depression, and lack of natural supports. She felt she lacked community, positive supports, and a sense of belonging.

FY 20/21 Challenges: The continuation of the COVID -19 pandemic has created even more challenges for our resource deprived partners who are more isolated now than they already have been, which exacerbates their mental health symptoms. LIFT met the challenges o f these external stressors by employing a combination of increased physical distancing protocol, continuing to provide PPE, and outdoor engagement. All of the BACS FSPs continued to deliver face -to-face services for its clients. Another challenge contin ues to be finding appropriate shelter housing placements due to increased demand of resources in the community; particularly licensed board and care homes that meet the needs of our partners and those which the partners are able to afford due to their fixe d monthly income. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: LIFT has continued to make a positive impact in the lives of the partners we serve. LIFT has worked tirelessly to decrease reliance on emergency psychiatric services to promote independ ence, community, and self -esteem. One of LIFT's most challenging partners with an extensive history of aggression, incarceration, homelessness, and violence, was able to maintain stable housing for 5 months. This is the longest he has maintained housing outside of an institution. He was initially reluctant to accept engagement and was standoffish with the team. He would often threaten staff and scream expletives refusing support. Although he continues to refuse medication he continues to engage with the t eam in a respectful manner.

We 108 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG make sure that staff are connected to clients, and everyone is excited and joyful when folks come in to the office. We greet our clients with excitement about what they are doing with their lives, what their treatment goals are, and their plans for the week. Client Story: A 82 -year -old partner who struggles with intimate partner violence, with a high level of hospitalizations. We were able to offer her partner support and housing while she participated in intimate partner violence treatment. She was able to return home successful and limit the harm she was causing her partner. This client got diagnosed with COVID -19 and utilized the safer ground spaces in order to self- isolate. She was able to use the resources offered by the county, and made a full recovery. This speaks to the importance on treating the whole system, and highlighting the importance of natural supports. Circa 60 also continued providing services in the community throughout the pandemic educating all partners, providing masks, hand -sanitizer and making sure they have the ability to socially distance. A 71 -year -old client has a daughter in a different FSP. The two FSPs combined to host a family dinn er with both participants and other family members. This provides a safe meeting space with the FSP staff offering containment. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Circa 60 played a lead role in educating partners about the hazards of COVID, provide PPE, connect partners to COVID testing, and vaccines. VI. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: 108 VII. FY 21/22 Program or Service Changes: The 20/21 fiscal year saw an exciting change in leadership. The program manager was promoted to an associate director position while both program supervisors were promoted to management positions. While the change in leadership was positive for the team, it required some adjustments and the core of the team was stable with no turnover. Circa 60 hired a new progr am supervisor who has a strong harm reduction background and years of experience working with high acuity partners. The core of the team had little to no turn over. The BACS FSPs have worked to integrate FSP leadership within BACS and leverage this knowled ge to maintain continuity and support for all the teams.

As clients become more stable they can join a step -down program that supports resiliency and recovery prior to discharge from program. Some clients are trained to become peer coaches to support other clients in need of social inclusion and support. Target Population: Older Adults (60 years or older) living in the Tri -City area (Fremont, Union City, Newark) or Hayward with moderate to severe mental he alth diagnosis. Clients also have complicated health conditions with almost 50% of clients having arthritis, 30% with hypertension, 25% with diabetes and high cholesterol. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a.

Tagalog - 1 client III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Barriers for program Implementation: Challenges experienced in the last year have been related to COVID 19 Pandemic. Pandemic made clients feel wary to having staff visit in person. Also, staff feel wary in visiting senior clients in fear of spreading the virus. Additional challenges as it relates to the pandemic have been client's severe mental health challenges as they often expressed paranoia and fear of using internet technology as a form of communication with their treatment team. Clients have increased depressive and anxiety symptoms as it relates to feeling isolated and unable to participate in the activities they once enjoyed. Medical/Mobility: This is an on -going challenge for our clients who have chronic medical ailments and resulting in limited and poor mobility. Due to their debilitating physical conditions l imit their mobility and diminish their capacity to carry out their daily ADLs independently. Undoubtedly, this situation has contributed so some client's worsening symptoms of depression, anxiety an increased in isolative behavior. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES111 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG In addition, one of the main obstacles the clients struggle with is accessing and using technology as part of their daily functioning. Devices such as smart phone and tablets have come ubiquitous today but some of our clients do have smart phones or tablets for a variety of reas ons. Due to Pandemic, the program shifted its service delivery structure via telehealth and video using their grand pads devices (IPAD for seniors). It was difficult at first to implement service delivery structure using high technology as our seniors lac k the capacity to connect with high technology devices. The program continues to provide services to our clients during the pandemic year. As their symptoms increase or new symptoms occur, the program also increased frequency of telehealth services to cl ients normalizing their emotions and reactions to the pandemic. The program also addressed and provided increased emotional support to those who are grieving over the loss of their loved ones to Corona Virus. So far, our clients have adjusted to the serv ice structure and accepted the fact that this will be the new normal until after COVID 19. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Case Study (Client EP ): Client EP has been a client of the senior mobile mental health program since Feb 2020. Client was working with a case manager from another social service organization and the case manager encouraged the client to receive counseling services in conjunction with case management services. The client appeared apprehensive to clinicians; Client often challenged clinicians in their education and ability to provide therapy to her as she is an education woman. The client lives alone and has one adult daughter who is estranged. Clients focus of therapy was to build a relationship with her daughter or cope with the estranged relationship. Throughout the last year the client has made tremendous progress. The client opened herself to therapy and began to discuss her me ntal health challenges. The client contacted her daughter within the past year, and also has made improvement coping that her daughter is not ready to have a relationship with her. This Client that was often isolated and did not speak to others began to en gage with coworkers at her job and build relationships. The Client offered herself up to senior neighbors who needed assistance and referred them to the city of Fremont aging family services department. The client offered to teach knitting and sewing class es at the city of Fremont senior center and online, and will provide the materials to the members in the class as a way to declutter her home. The client will begin teaching August 10th, 2021. This Client has come a long way within the past year; client re ported to the clinician, \"if it wasn't for you, I don't know where I'd be, I feel as if I have my life back.\" V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: We celebrate the positives our clients made during this difficult time. Most clients had no hesitation to re ceive their corona virus vaccine as soon as it became available for them. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: The program will maintain and provide outpatient mental health services for 55 clients/year as stated in the county contract. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: The intent of the Mobile Integrated Assessment Team for Seniors (Senior Mobile Mental Health Program) is to increase service access for seniors with mental illness including those who are homebound. The program ser ves older adults age 60 years or older who are isolated, unable to access traditional mental health services and community resources, fearful of outside psychiatric interventions and maybe at risk of needing higher level of care such as psychiatric hospita lization. Most services are providing in the home of the seniors. 112 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG The program partners with seniors in promoting their ability to live healthy, productive lives as an active member of their community. The program provides outpatient mental health servi ces to homebound elders in their place of residence. The program serves Fremont, Newark, Union City and Hayward. To address and respond to their on -going mental health needs, the program will provide the following services: These services include: In-home assessment for mental health needs Individual, group and family therapy Medication support and management Linkage to needed community resources Crisis Intervention as indicated One of the major tasks of the program is to promote, coordinate and develop in conjunction with the community partners a menu of other mental health services which will allow a greater number of the senior population to remain in their homes and community if they are able and safe. The program will establish a strong partnership and shared decision making between mental health service providers in the Tri -City areas and Hayward. This partnership and collaboration will ensure access to appropriate levels i f services from crisis intervention to outpatient treatment and case management efforts. The program will strengthen, solidify and maximize internal working relationship within the city structure, establishing formal service integration and collaboration between city programs. The program is currently and has been coordinating services with Targeted Case Management (TCM) Multi Senior Service Program (MSSP) Community Ambassador Program (CPAS) Life Elder Care, Senior Peer Counseling Program, Senior Centers Care Giver Support Program, Youth and Family Services, Family Resource Center, Para Transit program, Afghan Elderly Association, Afghan Coalition and the City Information and Assistance Line. The program works very closely with the City's First Responder s (Police and Fire Department and Code Enforcement). Further, the program will extend collaborative efforts with the Police and Fire Department and Code Enforcement in the cities of Union city, Newark and Hayward. The program will provide and has been pr oviding outreach and education to the above departments in the forms of training on mental health issues, system of care values and wrap around planning efforts. This system of collaboration and care coordination will increase referrals to the program and increase service access and utilization of outpatient mental health services for our older adults' population. The program also advocates for culturally appropriate service delivery models and outreach to underserved ethnic community through community pa rtners and system capacity building. Lastly, the program promotes hope, recovery and resiliency. Our program in partnership with local community provides and client's advocates should overcome boundaries between health care providers.

Intervention to Reduce First Responder's Calls from our prospective clientele: Making appropriate referrals for needed service is the first step in reducing first responders' calls. Referred clients a re assessed for mental health needs and if they meet program criteria for medical necessity and if they accept our services, we will open their case with the program. By accepting our services and resolve issues including calling 911, will reduce first res ponder's call. We also collaborate services with the YANA program (You Are Not Alone) a volunteer program developed by the Police Department where Fremont Police volunteers will provide services to our isolated seniors with peace of mind and a sense of security that they are not alone. Police volunteers will call enrollees daily. If enrollees don't answer their phone after several attempts, then a wellness check will be made to ensure their safety and well -being. We also coordinate our services with t he client's primary care doctors. We are current collaborating services with the new developed South County Crisis Assessment team. We will continue to collaborate survives with different agencies and share resources in addressing mental health issues o f our community's homeless population. 114 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG OUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 5A PROVIDER Health PROGRAM NAME: Crisi s Services: Expansion and Transition to Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) , Mobile Evaluation Teams (MET) , Community Assessment and Transport Team (CATT) , and Outreach & Engagement Teams Program Description: In 2019, Crisis Response Program (CRP) underwent an expansion that transitioned the program into a fully mobile crisis service that respond s to 5150 calls, engage s with consumers who are in crisis, and assess es consumer needs and conduct s follow up post crisis situ ation. The expansion also added on a third mobile crisis team as well as three post crisis follow up teams . CRP effectively changed it's name to Crisis Services. Currently, all clinical staff work primarily out in the field , which increases community -based crisis prevention and early intervention services, thereby ensuring clients are referred to the appropriate type of mental health services. ACBH clinical staff work on the Mobile Crisis Teams (MCT) for North County and South County as well as on the Mobil e Evaluation Team (MET), a partnership with Oakland Police Department. Bonita House clinicians staff the third mobile crisis team, the Community Assessment and Transport Team (CATT) along with Alameda County's Emergency Medical Services and Falck. Three po st crisis follow up teams focus on telephonic follow up, field -based services for ACBH's high utilizers, and field -based services focused on the county's population that are not securely housed. Prior to March 2019, CRP was also an out -patient clinic that provides brief mental health services including case management, targeted crisis therapy, and psychiatry. On average, participants remain ed in the program for 30 -90 days. Once stabilized, participants were transferred to a level of care most appropriate to meet the participant's needs. Consumers who may not need specialty mental health services but need to be connected to a lower level of care such as primary care, substance use treatment, and other community services were also evaluated and referred. However, given the recent expansion of the Mobile Crisis Teams, the out -patient clinic function of Crisis Services no longer exists. Target Population: Crisis Services serves residents of Alameda County along the entire lifespan who are living with a serious and persistent mental illness and are in crisis . The MCT , MET , and CATT Programs provide on -the-spot crisis intervention, psychiatric assessment and evaluation to all ages , and make referrals to other agencies and provides follow -up services. MCT Responds to calls from police, shelters, designated community agencies, and community members throughout Alameda County . The MET teams pair a police officer with an ACBH clinician to respond to calls from police dispatch. The CATT teams pair a Bonita House clinician and EMT to respond to calls from dispatch as well.

Reduce mental health stigma: The mobile crisis teams provide ongoing outreach, engagement, and psychoeducation to individuals living with mental health c hallenges, their loved ones, law enforcement, and the general community. Crisis Services Outreach and Engagement teams are also 80% staffed by peers with lived experience. Many Crisis Services staff have been involved with the Peers Organizing for Community Change , forme rly known as the Pool of Consumer Champions (POCC) in the past and/ or are currently involved with POCC at this time. Crisis Services has worked close ly with ACBH's Office of Peer Support Services, formerly known as the Office of Consumer Empowerment , to incorporate consumer voi ces in the planning, delivery, and continuous quality improvement of our expansion and current services. Crisis Services also incorporates views, feedback, and assistance from the Office of Ethnic Services in the recruitment, staff retention, and diverse needs around training and community resources in order to provide services to all residents of Alameda County. In other efforts to reduce stigma, Crisis Services utilizes a fleet of vehicles that have \"Crisis Services\" written on the side. This communicates the presence of Crisis Services in the communities we serve. b. Create a welcoming environment: In regards to service delivery, Crisis Services now provide s crisis intervention to individuals across the lifespan experiencing a mental health crisis anywhere in Alameda County and we respond within a few minutes to a few hours of the request for service. Starting in February 2022, Crisis Services has made the following changes to it s Mobile team hours: Starting Monday, February 7, 2022 the mobile teams will be available Monday - Friday 8 AM to 6 PM. Our Mobile Evaluation Team ( MET ) with the City of Oakland , Hayward ( H-MET ), the Community Assessment & Transport team ( CATT ) hours will remain unchanged.

Crisis Services staff also utilize consent forms and informing materials packets in English and all threshold languages provided by the ACBH Quality Assurance when appropriate. 116 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG IV. 20/21 Challenges : Crisis Services on-going expansion and services are impacted by the continuing effects of COVID -19 as well as other current events that have affected staff and residents of Alameda County including (but not limited to) political unrest an d the spotlight on racial disparities, California wildfires and subsequent poor air quality, ongoing isolation, etc. The global pandemic, concurrent with these additional environmental factors, have increased crisis calls and requests for wellness checks (frequently requesti ng that Crisis Services provided crisis intervention without the aid of law enforcement), and a decrease in staffing due to staff going on leave to take care of COVID related family needs. Is Anyone Better Off? V. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Here are some examples of the impacts of Crisis Services has on individuals, families, and the community at large (names have been changed and PHI has been removed): Joe was referred to Crisis Connect after a crisis encounter with the Mobile Crisis Team. Staff reached out to Joe to see if he needed to connected to any services. In response to Joe's stated needs, she provided him with resources to ACCESS, the Homeless Action, and peer support groups such as the Hearing Voices Network, PEERS, and Pool of Consumer Champions. Joe was also given parenting resources (a t his request) for Dad Corps, First Five Alameda. Prior to closing Joe's case, staff followed up with Joe and confirmed that he had been connected to Bonita House as his on - going mental health provider. A mother repeatedly called M CT to request evaluations for her 19 year old son, Raymond, who was admitted to John George on multiple occasions. MCT clinicians were able to advocate for a higher level of care for Raymond, who was eventually assigned to a full service partnership and then assisted outpatient treatment as the ACBH system of care supports Raymond in his journey towards recovery. Anita used to receive services from La Familia but discontinued services for several months due to no active Medi -Cal. She stated that she medication support and therapy. After 3 phone calls, staff successfully linked Anita to Tri -City for urgent med and reconnected her to La Familia. VI. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Crisis Services has received a fleet of new vehicles , which has increase d client access to transportation by Crisis Services staff to various mental health or community resources in Alameda County, including programs that divert clie nts from involuntary hospitalizations if clients are willing to access voluntary mental health care. VII. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served : As Crisis Services expands and grows staffing numbers , we expect to increase our ability to respon d to additional crisis calls in Alameda County within the next year. We also project an increase in the number of clients served by Outreach and Engagement staff due to recent efforts with John George and AC3 staff to collect more accurate phone numbers for follow up and provid e all patients discharged from John George with the number to post crisis follow up programs. In 2021, outreach and engagement staff will began a partnership in the field with Healthcare for the Homeless, which has also lead to increased access and more services provided to individuals who are not securely housed.

CAP focuses on the ethical practices of social work. Overall, CAP reduces recidivism back to jail by connecting people with serious mental health issues to outpatient mental health services; and crafting mental health dispositions for re -entry back into the community. III. Language Capacity for this program: The CAP program is able to utilize ACBH Language Phone Line and in person Language Interpretation Services that are available to the co urt. The courts' Language Services are able to accommodate almost any language needed including sign language. CAP is also able to use the language interpretation phone services that are contracted through the county. IV. FY20/21 Challenges : The Court Advocacy Project has had a steady decline in enrollment since the Covid pandemic began . Like 80% of counties in California, Alameda County continues to use the COVID -19 Emergency Bail Schedule, allowing many individuals to leave jail quickly and making it difficult to locate and connect them to services later on. Additionally, o thers may have been cited and releasd, allowing them to access services directly in the community . Individuals who are incarcerated experience ongoing delays in connection to the cou rts and community services due to COVID related precautions such as isolation and quarantine periods, housing and other facility closures , and other resource strains. COVID has also resulting in few er clients being transported to and from the court house , and th e move of many criminal courts to an online platform . V.

FY20/ 21 Additional Information: Due to COVID -19 and the emergency bail schedule, large numbers of clients were released from custody very quickly. During this time CAP staff joined several outpatient mental health treatment programs to go to Santa Rita Jail, assist with obtaining medications, offer transitional support, and link individuals being released to mental health and other services as needed.

There is currently no limit on the number of clients CAP may serve. CAP staff continue to work with clients deemed incompetent to stand tri al, provide support to Behavioral Health Court, and are also assisting with other Covid related program s such as at the Project RoomKey Hotels. VIII. FY21/22 Program or Service Changes: In January 2021 , Senate Bill 317 was implemented and dramatic changes were made to Penal Code 1370.01 which affects individuals who are considered incompetent to stand trial ( Law section (ca.gov) ). Clients who are affected by this revised law, may be eligible for mental health diversion, Assisted Outpatient Treatmen t, or Conservatorship . Covid, legal changes, increased pre -crisis services available throughout Alameda County, and shifting political and societal awareness all have the potential to impact our forensic behavioral health services and the Court Advocacy Pr oject. As always CAP remains flexible to meet clients' needs and offer education and support to help navigate the ongoing changes to the many systems it touches. 120 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG OUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 7 PROVIDER NAME: Alameda County Behavioral Health PROGRAM NAME: Behavioral Health Court (BHC) Program Description: Alameda County Behavioral Health Court is a 12 -24 month program of court oversight and community treatment for persons experiencing severe mental illness whose qualifying crimes result from their illnesses. The goals of BHC are to reduce recidivism and improve the quality of life, a nd assist severely mentally ill offenders by diverting them away from the criminal justice system and into community treatment with judicial oversight. Target Population: Justice involved adults age 18 and older with serious mental illness and co - occurring substanc e use disorder. Individuals must have pending criminal charges that were the result of their symptoms of mental illness . Consumers include Transitional Age Youth, Adults and Older Adults. I. FY 20 /21 Outcomes a. Number of unique consumers/clients served: Approximately 97 clients were served during FY 20/21 clients with approximately 24 individuals graduating during that same period. FY 20 /21 Impact: As a result of Behavioral Health Court , clients were able to have improved access to treatment, increased engagement with wellness and recovery activities, and reduced number of days in institutional settings. The BHC program also improves public safety, health, and property of the surrounding community. II. Please describe ways that the program strives to: a. Reduce mental health stigma: BHC reduces stigma by reminding clients and the community that hope and recovery are possible. By having regular engagement with treatment and ongoing court oversight, clients are able to maintain stability in the community and make progress toward recovery in discovering meaningful activities and holding meaningful roles, often returning to school or work and becoming leaders and role models for their peers newly enrolled in Behavioral Health Court. b. Create a welcoming environment: BHC is a collaborative effort between the Alameda County Superior Court, District Attorney, Public Defender, Alameda County Behavioral Health, and community mental health treatment providers. The BHC Team consists of dedicated staff from each department who have s pecial knowledge and sensitivity to mental health issues, in addition to representatives from forensic focused treatment teams. BHC is non -adversarial. BHC Team members realize the importance of recognizing COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES121 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG and rewarding individuals who do well.

Language Capacity for this program: The BHC program is able to utilize ACBH Language Phone Line and in person Language Interpretation Services that are available to the court. The courts' Language Services are able to accommodate almost any language needed including sign language. BHC is also able to use the language interpretation phone services that are contracted through the county. IV. FY 20 20/21 Additional Information: It is important to note that BHC is partially funded by the Alameda County Behavioral Health through funds made available by the Mental Health Services Act of 2004. ACBH provides the funding for the Clinic ians, Peer Specialist , and Clinical Supervisor. Funds for other co urt staff are provided by their respective agencies. V. FY 2020/2 1 Challenges: The BHC Program had a steady decline in enrollment througho ut 2020. Census challenges included: a pause on all new admissions due to the Covid pandemic , the COVID -19 emergency bail schedule that allows for the discharge of potential clients/inmates from jail before connecting to behavioral health services ; the move to an online platform instead of inperson hearings; treatment team staffing shortages and other complications rela ted to Covid illness and emergency deployements . The early months of 2021 saw the beginnings of an increase in referrals . It was observed that while the Public Defender's Office has a dedicated staff person assigned to BHC , there are mentally ill clients who are given court appointed council, not with the Public Defender's Office, who are often unaware of collaborative courts such as BHC. The Honorable Judge Syren and Judge Smiley completed a \"Collaborative Courts 2.0\" training on May 26, 2021 to increase education and understanding of the qualifications and referral process. For new referrals only, BHC additionally resum ed inperson hearings . Hearings on progress reports for ongoing clients remain on a virtual online platform . While the online platform seems to benefit some individuals , it does not work for all clients and poses technology to be able to engage with the court process. Ongoing complications rel ated to provider staffing shortages, limited services, and facilty closures continue to affect th e engagement of consumers and their ability to participate . Our collaborative partners continue to make adjustments to improve the quality of the court experience for clients and those who support them. VI. FY 20 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served : The BHC program was initially founded in 2009 with a collaborative agreement between ACBH, The Superior Court, Alameda County Public Defender's Office and District Attorney's Office. Many changes have evolved with the program since that time including an e xpansion of the types of 122 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG charges permitted for participation . FY 2020/2021 saw a shift toward ensuring that all individuals admitted to BHC are eligible for and connected to intensive community services or full service partnerships. Individuals needing les s intensive services are referred to Informal Court or other court programs. For FY 2021/2022, d epending on the volume of arrests and charges brought against clients with severe mental illness, BHC will continue to serve as many individuals as possible. To maintain the high quality of engagement with current staffing available for assessments and collection of court reports, BHC clinicians maintain a 1 to 30 staff to client rati o. VII. FY 2021/22 Program or Service Changes: In July 2021 the BHC Program moved from Adult and Older Adult System of Care to the newly established the Forensic, Diversion, and Re -entry Services System of Care (Forensic System of Care). The Forensic System of Care is specifically designed for justice involved individuals who require behavioral health services and coordinates all of ACBH's forensic services across the age spectrum into one line of service . It aligns both in -custody and forensic outpatient services t o enable better care coordination. As part of our \"True North Metric\", intentional attention to Quality, Investment in Excellence, Accountability in Leadership, and Outcome Driven Goals (and metrics), ACBH ensures the Forensic System of Care will: Enha nce in -custody mental health services and develop therapeutic programming for individuals with intensive mental health needs Strengthen and align discharge planning and coordination of re -entry services Improve quality of care across Forensic service s to reduce recidivism for individuals with intensive mental health needs Additionally, t here have been several new laws implemented in the recent years that affect our community and implementation of mental health services with the forensic population . As a result, the Forensic System of Care is actively in the process of working toward a Memorandum Of Understanding with our collaborative court partners, and adjusting the work flow procedures and related policies.

Coordinates refer rals and linkages to mental health services in order to ensure seamless continuity of care when discharged from juvenile hall to community based providers. Target Population: Youth ages 12 -18 years old who are involved in the juvenile justice system and their families. Operational Budget: How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 324 How Well Did We Do? II. Please describe ways that the program strives to: a. Reduce mental health stigma: The Guidance Clinic (GC) actively works to reduce mental health stigma for youth involved in the Juvenile Justice System. This fiscal year, the GC implemented a new process to have a GC clinician meet with every youth upon their detainment into Juvenile Ha ll. During this initial meeting with youth, clinicians describe the available mental health services and how mental health services can be helpful during incarceration . The clinicians also help youth understand their rights in accessing mental health servi ces and conduct a brief initial mental health assessment on each youth . If youth are interested in mental health services, the clinician will create a plan to connect them to regular and ongoing services. If youth are not interested in services, the clinician will explain that mental health services are always available and show the youth how to request/self -refer to services at any time . This new outreach approach helps reduce stigma by further integrating mental health services as part of the standard pro gramming for youth (i.e., it is part of the intake process for every youth), and by helping youth understand that mental health services can be beneficial during stressful and traumatic events. Additionally, GC clinicians continue to maintain a regular presence on the detention units in the Juvenile Hall and Camp Wilmont Sweeney (the other detention facility on the Juvenile Justice Center campus ). The clinicians are part of the milieu, actively checking -in with youth and engaging staff from the Probation Department who work on the unit. Clinicians are seen as part of the daily functioning of the units and youth know that they can always speak to a clinician whenever the clinician is not in a sessi on. Maintaining a presence on the unit s reduces mental health stigma by allowing the clinician to build trusting relationships with youth and staff, while normalizing the services the clinicians provide. 124 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG b. Create a welcoming environment: The GC continues to work with our Probation partners to make several changes in order to create a more welcoming environment for our youth. First, the Probation Department redesigned the detention units by adding new colors/paint to the walls in order to move away f rom sterile colors and brighten -up the space. Additionally, Probation painted chalk - walls inside the cells where youth sleep. This was an idea GC staff advocated for and allows youth more opportunity to safely write on their walls to express themselves or decorate their cells. The clinical offices (where clinicians met with youth prior to COVID -19 restrictions) were also updated with new furniture in order to create a more comfortable space. Changes were not limited to the physical environment , GC staff pus hed for other changes to help Juvenile Hall and Camp Wilmont Sweeney feel more welcoming and supportive of youth. These changes included allowing youth to keep stress -balls in their rooms for youth to use as a coping tool or a distraction. GC staff also co nvinced Probation to provide youth with eye masks (upon request) in order to help them sleep better at night. GC staff also succeeded in influencing larger procedural changes to address feelings of isolation experienced by some youth. For example, youth tr iggered by sleeping in the confined space of their cell, can request to sleep with their door open . While incarceration will never be a truly welcoming experience, the GC has worked closely with Probation partners to improve the physical environment and en sure youth feel supported by staff. III. Language Capacity for this program: During FY 20/21 , the GC staffed 1 clinician who spoke Cantonese, 1 clinician who spoke Spanish, and 1 clinician who spoke Vietnamese. The GC is looking to increase its capacity to serve Spanish -speaking clients. IV. FY20/21 Challenges : The biggest challenge this fiscal year continues to be the COVID -19 pandemic. In late fall of 2019, the GC, in collaboration with Probation, started planning to implement new programs and services to better serve youth and families . Specifically, there was a plan to increase mental health groups throughout the Juvenile Hall and initiate family therapy with interested clients. The GC also hired a re -entry clini cian to better connect youth to mental health services in their home community after being released from Juvenile Hall. However, everyone's focus has continued to shift to COVID -19 begning in March 2020. Shortly thereafter, the Juvenile Hall and Camp Wilmont Sweeney impl emented strict physical distancing restrictions, which prohibited any groups as well as family visitation. One positive outcome from the pandemic is that the numbers of youth in detention decreased significantly, as polcie departments were arresting fewer youth and the Courts were less likeley to keep youth detained. While this has impacted the number of youth served by the GC, it should be seen as one of the very few positive impacts of the pandemic. VII. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served : Given the fact that the COVID -19 pandemic is still not under control, we anticipate fewer youth being detained for FY 21/22. We project 400 youth will be served in the next fiscal year. VIII. FY 21/22 Program or Service Changes: None confirmed.

MST interventions focus on key aspects of these areas in each youth's life. All interventions are designed in full collaboration with family members and key figures in each system - parents or legal guardians, school teachers and principals, etc. MST services are provided in the home, school, neighborhood and community by therapists fully trained in MST. Therapists work in teams and provide coverage for each other's caseloads when th ey are on vacation or on -call. MST therapists are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week through an on- call system (all MST therapists are required to be on -call on a rotating schedule). Treatment averages 3 -5 months. Target Population: Youth (ages 0 -21) referred who are on probation in Alameda County and are at risk of out of home placement due to referral behavior and living at home with a parent or caretaker.

FY 20/21 Client Impact: Case story (All names have been changed to protect the identity of the client) : \"Adam\" had been referred to MST by his probation officer. Reasons for referral were related to runaway behaviors, supervision and monitoring, substance use, and challenges in Adam's academic domain. Initially at intake and in the first few months of treatment Adam struggled with his participation, often missing meetings, and in his ability to follow his mother, Carolyn's, expectations. On the other hand, Carolyn experienced high levels of overwhelm and found it difficult to both hold Adam to expectati ons and follow through with parental responses (i.e. consequences). The initial struggle led to Adam's having been arrested and was at risk of being sent to placement. Through team work, interventions, and advocacy, Adam was given another chance in his hom e environment. Throughout treatment, with Carolyn's support, as well as Adam's father Adrian's support, they were able to increase co -parenting strategies and create a structured environment for Adam. The consistency 126 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG eventually contributed to his managemen t of behaviors, no longer leaving home without permission, or connecting with negative peers outside of the home. Despite this progress, a large part of treatment focused on Adam increasing his attendance and participation at school. Adam began to receive community support from a local case manager/mentor and with the coordination of all supports, Adam began to experience advance in his school attendance, increased pro -social and employment participation, while continuing to manage behaviors. Due to the abo ve successes, Adam was also dismissed from probation. Treatment focus following Adam's dismissal was focused on ensuring that Adam and Carolyn are connected to sustainable school and community supports. Due to these advances and sustainable supports, Adam graduated the MST program. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections Clients to be Served: 10 VII.

FY20/21 Challenges : COVID -19 continues to pose a particular challenge to congregate living facilities around protecting residents from infections without disrupting a treatment model that relies on group care. Staff have put in thorough protocols in place to ensure the milieu as as safe and socia lly-distanced as possible, with symptom screening of staff and clients before entry. Additionally, previous methods of clients entering into the CSU (in particular, provider drop offs) have declined, providing an additional barrier to access.

The CSU also functions as the Alameda County Receiving Center (Welfare and Institutions Code 5151) for youth who are placed on a WIC 5150/5585 civil commitment hold i n Alameda County. All youth arriving at the Willow Rock Crisis Stabilization Unit receive a physical health and a mental health assessment, and are provided ongoing assessment, crisis intervention and crisis stabilization services prior to discharge to the community or transfer to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Target Population: The Willow Rock CSU serves medically stable youth ages 12 to 17 years experiencing a mental health crisis. The program may serve up to a maximum of ten clients at a time.

All client and caregiver documents have been translated into Spanish, Simplified Ch inese, and Vietnamese. Seneca does not track data on the number of clients served in each language. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Through Seneca's experience as the Alameda County CSU provider for 13 years, the agency has identified the following systemic b arriers that impact program implementation and delay or prevent access to crisis stabilization : Identifying transportation alternativ es to mitigate frequent delays experienced by youth waiting to be transported from the CSU to an off -site location other than the PHF. Identify ing alternatives, including allowing CSU staff to provide transportation for a young person to the next setting whe n census allows , would address these delays. Creating additional placement options for youth who no longer meet medical necessity, are prepared to discharge from the CSU, but are not ready to return home. Many youth overstay the mandated 23 -hour, 59 -minute limit for stays while the County secures appropriate next placements. Often youth are sent out of the county under these circumstances. Families require more flexible and responsive service continuums that would allow for additional discharge alternatives for CSU youth , such as an STRTP co -located on the Willow Rock campus, PHPs for Medi -Cal eligible youth, ISFC homes, staffed step -down respite and emergency foster homes, 130 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG and greater integration and coordination with existing Wraparound and mobile response services. Implementing COVID -19 health and safety protocols for staff and clients. Seneca remained committed to operating the CSU throughout the COVID -19 crisis, instituting a range of new protocols developed by its medical services team to ensure safety for clients, staff, and families. Seneca's COVID -19 response procedures have included guidelines for responding when staff or clients are ill, maintaining social distancing indoors, hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, using personal protecti ve equipment, limiting, and screening visitors, and providing care for youth who have tested positive or appear symptomatic. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Seneca's success in supporting the priority population has prevented further traumatization of youth, decreased stress for their families, and assisted ACBH in minimizing the use of more costly and restrictive treatment settings. On average, over 70% of youth served at the CSU do not return within the next year. As a measure of its success helping families, among youth who discharged from the outpatient program in Seneca's most recent annual data, 95% had made measurable progress toward their treatment goals and 95% were diverted from a higher level of care after discharge. Client Story: Seneca's CSU and partnering outpatient program recently collaborated to successfully support a young client and his family. The client, a 15 -year -old mixed race male, was initially referred to the outpatient program for therapy and medication manage ment from the CSU after he experienced a manic episode. His family previously experienced homelessness and recently moved, in order to access housing in Alameda County. The client's father was employed and therefore, the family was not able to qualify for Medi -Cal, however they were not able to afford the employee -sponsored health insurance. In the outpatient program, the client received therapeutic services from a clinician by phone and Zoom and received psychiatric services in person. During treatment, th e client decompensated once and was readmitted to the CSU after experiencing a manic episode. The o utpatient clinician coordinated with the family on how to safely transport the client to the CSU without law enforcement involvement . The outpatient clinicia n greet ed the client and family upon arrival and supported his admission at the CSU. After the youth was stabilized , the outpatient clinician was able to connect with social workers from client's school district, who offered school -based therapy services . The o utpatient clinician continued to hold case management and psychiatry services . The client's family was connected to a Medi -Cal Liaison , as well as other critical case management resources. After the client became eligible for Medi -Cal, the clinician c oordinated with ACCESS for a referral to a local mental health provider who offered psychiatry services. The youth has not been readmitted to the CSU. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: As described in Question 3, youth who are prepared to discharge from the CSU but are not ready to return home , require a more flexible and responsive service continuum to meet their needs. In addition, the following are challenges to engagement in CSU services and Seneca's suggested responses: Access barriers: Too freq uently, youth in crisis are transported to hospital emergency departments, which can be chaotic environments not suited to stabilizing them. Options that would mitigate these barriers include (1) permitting CSU staff to meet youth in emergency departments or the community when the CSU census allows, (2) providing COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES131 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG consultation for law enforcement, hospital staff, teachers, etc., and (3) offering CSU information for caregivers. Transportation barriers: Once youth are placed on a WIC 5585 hold at the hospital and approved for transfer to the CSU, transportation can be delayed due to the prioritization schedule of the ambulance provider. Options to mitigate transportation barriers include identifying an alternative to County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) amb ulance transportation when youth are safe to be transported. VI.

It significantly affected the scope of outreach activities and the number of participants. Depending on clients' technology access, openness, and preferences for Telehealth services, initially there were increases in no shows and appointment cancelations. Due to the pandemic and social unrest, extra efforts were required to effectively address clients' chro nic MH struggles and adjustment issues. AAPI cultural and social barriers continue d to lead to community members' hesitation and delays for seeking \"mental health\" and \"professional\" treatment.

How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 475 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: English and Spanish III. FY 20/21 Challenges: In direct response to the COVID19 public health emergency, Shelter in Place orders, and Executive Orders issued by the California Governor, La Clinica's services have been adapted to maintain the safety and well -being of both patients and staff while ensur ing the continued provision of essential care. La Clinica has converted as many individual appointments as possible to phone or video appointments. We have a skeleton crew of staff in the office for walk -ins and high acuity patients. If a client is high ri sk and needs to be seen in person, the in -office staff will be able to support them. In April 2020, La Clinica transitioned to OCHIN Epic as its electronic health record system. While this new system will allow us to capture the requested patient data nece ssary for county reports, it has been challenging to make the transition to this new system while at the same time adapting services provided as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic and has taken much longer. In addition, successful linkage to lower levels of care is inconsistent as a clearinghouse or updated database of these providers does not exist. Medicare -Medi -Cal recipients also comment on increased challenges with seeking mental health services as they often do not understand that when selecting their health plans, they are also selecting mental health providers. The absence of emergency psychiatric medication centers continues to place an increased burden on CBOs to provide these services. Additionally, there is a lack of policy and protocol clarity around patients discharging from subacute care back into the community centers. With the addition of new ACCESS staff, it becomes more challenging to move through procedures as not everyone provides the same answers to questions. The timeliness e - form does n't mirror the paper form and reduces confidence in reporting. The platform to enter this data still appears not to be functional. Additionally, we have noticed that many of the required forms for 136 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG providing mental health services available on the BHCS webs ite are not updated, nor are they allowed to be used in a fillable pdf format. As we have transitioned to primarily remote work due to COVID the need for these forms in a functional format has increased. Changing documentation standards and service deliver y without a final contract make it difficult to meet deliverables. Additionally, although the system change that made ACCESS the gatekeepers the services may be beneficial in the future, the current rollout has been challenging. This involves retraining st aff to master an already complicated referral process. Finally, a lack of clarity around the NACT rules makes compliance difficult when the standards are not clearly defined. It is a challenge to have the same ANSA rules for ACCESS clients because they are inherently stabilization services, and ANSA is meant to offer an enhanced view of assessment. QA has led us to understand that ANSA is being used as an outcome measure. This invalidates the clinical data collected by the ANSA. ANSAs use was validated for highlighting an additional area of need and focus. We have observed an increase in Mam speakers or use a subtle dialect that is hard to translate, which are not reflected in the language lines. There has been a decrease in BH trainees, which reduces the ab ility of the trained workforce to hire after graduation; many students have deferred training due to the pandemic. La Cl\u00ednica continues to provide uncompensated care in the form of assisting clients who don't meet the threshold criteria for ACCESS services to find the right point of entry for their needs. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: 475 clients were served in FY 20 -21. The impact of La Cl\u00ednica's ACCESS program is that Casa del Sol provides primary linguistic and cultural services for the priority population. La Cl\u00ednica has a reputation for meeting the needs of Latinos in Alameda County and clients are familiar and comfortable coming to Casa del Sol for services. The current political situation impacts the community and may increase men tal health distress, giving La Cl\u00ednica the opportunity to address their mental health needs as they become emergent. La Cl\u00ednica is geographically close to eight elementary schools and impacts school -aged children by providing services that are easily acces sible. Furthermore, La Cl\u00ednica continues to make an impact by increasing coordination with primary care to identify clients who would best be served in the specialty mental health setting. Client Story: La Cl\u00ednica began providing services to a 36 -year- old woman married with 2 children. She is from Guatemala, where she suffered sexual abuse and was separated from her parents since she was a baby. She grew up believing that her maternal grandparents were her biological parents. When she was six years old, bot h grandparents passed away, she learned the truth about her parents, and she was left to fend for herself. She suffers from PTSD, and with the pandemic, her symptoms became more pronounced. She often complained of pain, and after having many medical tests done, there has been no medical explanation for her pain. She was having suicidal thoughts and there were periods of time when her pain was so severe that she was bed bound for several days and subsequently could not take care of her children. She received services under the ACCESS program from 3/8/21 to 8/23/21. In the past six months, she has reported her pain has decreased significantly and she has learned to understand how her body has been impacted by sexual abuse and other past trauma. She tried medic ation before but was very quick to stop, fearing that she was becoming addicted to it. She was able to talk about her concerns with the medication, and now she feels comfortable taking it as prescribed. She reports that now she can see how the medication helps her feel more relaxed. She is back at her normal level of function and able to take care of her family. She has not been bed -bound in the past 6 months, and she reports no longer get consumed by her suicidal thoughts. She has learned to cope with her suicidal thoughts and ignore them by going out for walks, using grounding exercises, and positive self -talk. She is learning to set limits with her family and take care of her emotional needs.

How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: During this year, our Team at BWC served 13 Unduplicated Clients, which was significantly fewer than the contracted 23 Unduplicated clients. The shortfall was almost completely due the Center remaining in Shelter in Place, away from the actual location for the majority of the fiscal year. Recruiting new clients during the pandemic proved to be most difficult. We also fell significantly short of our contracted 428 Outpatient Service hours. Altho ugh we managed to open 7 existing clients to Outpatient services during the Shelter in Place, we billed for just 36 hours. We did, however, exceed our contracted MAA billing hours of 2500. The total MAA billing hours for the year was 3,184 with 2,728 of th ose hours being offered as Peer Support and Wellness service hours provided in the form of group rehabilitation and individual rehabilitation.

Currently, none of our BWC clients are requesting services in any language other than English. Even so, if the need arises at any stage of our processes with clients, we also have access to the County Lan guage Line.

FY 20/21 Challenges: The biggest challenge of the next year will most certainly be our careful return to on -site services and managing the dynamic health and safety issues concerning COVID -19 and its variants. General uncertainty and anxiety continue to be commonplace among th e general population. Re -connecting with our current clients who have either been completely out of touch or who we have had more inconsistent communications with will be a priority. We will also begin our strategies for Outreach and Engagement in the Berk eley Community, focusing on the TAY youth consumers, in order to increase our unduplicated clients and to make our services more accessible to a greater number of Berkeley residents. Due to the increased need for telehealth services during Shelter in Pla ce and the overall increase in technological accessibility, managing technology issues is also a constant challenge. We now offer a hybrid format for all of our groups, and clients can opt to meet with our staff individually on Zoom or the telephone. Our g roup meeting rooms are fully equipped with TVs for Zoom meetings and clients are given the Zoom ID and passwords if they prefer to join the groups electronically. Even so, challenges with our telehealth options remain. For example: Many residents do not ha ve access to a device to access Zoom meetings. Some do not have phones either or are not wanting to engage in telephonic services. Our staff has, at times, worked with clients to help them develop a greater comfort level and ability with platforms like Zoo m. Some clients do not yet fully understand and/or trust some components of telehealth. Connectivity issues due to location and/or quality of services and quality of their devices prevents some from engaging with telehealth services. The COVID -19 Pandemic and racial injustice is overwhelming to many and increased isolation is a byproduct of clients' increased anxiety and/or depression. Getting informed consents signed, assessments and treatment plans processed virtually is no longer valid. We must now get wet signatures on these documents once again, which proves to have its own sets of challenges, especially around deadlines and clients who still do not want to visit the center in person. Increasing comfort levels and productivity of Zoom groups, so that clients receive the highest level of care we offer. Adding new clients into the Wellness Center when they have never visited the facility or met staff in person and may not want to come in person yet.

FY 20/21 Client Impact: The combined results from the client Satisfaction Surveys given to our clients at the end of each quarter are as follows: Throughout the year, a total of 63 clients participated in the 4 Quarterly Satisfaction Surveys. The data was collected by our student trainees over the telephone and then collated. The four statements presented to the clients were: 1. \"I like services that I receive here .\" (53 of the 63 or 82% of the client respondents said they were either very satisfied or satisfied). 2. \"My engagement at the Wellness Center plays a meaningful role in my life .\" (54 of the 63 or 83% said they were either very satisfied or satisfied ). 3. \"I am better able to manage my physical and mental health needs better \" (60 of the 63 or 92% said they were either very satisfied or satisfied). 4. \"I can deal more effectively with my daily problems because of services I receive at BWC .\" (52 of 63 or 80% of respondents said they were very satisfied or satisfied ). Reducing Stigma : 1. In team meetings we process and educate ourselves about mental health stigma and how it might apply to each one of our clients. We look for ways to reduce those stigm as and address them at an individual and family level. Below is a link to the webinar that we asked all our employees to attend each year. The topic of the training focuses on relating more empathetically with our clients, especially vial telehealth durin g the COVID -19 epidemic and how to exercise self -care while we are offering empathy to many clients in distress. https://www.cibhs.org/post/empathic - comm unication- and-engagement -behavioral -telehealth The above training consists of a 1.5 hour webinar plus handouts our staff downloaded to review. 2. We educate ourselves around the stigmas that serious mental health issues create for people. For example, we know from research that people with serious mental health issues are no more violent than the general public. 3. We facilitate daily positive interactions in our groups that promote connection and meaning. The topic of stigma is addressed in the majority of o ur daily groups, and there is signage on the Wellness Center walls that is meant to identify stigma reduction efforts. 4. We utilize Peer support specialists who have lived experience with mental health and substance use issues.

During Shelter- in-place, our staff reaches out to their clients via phone on a regul ar basis and invites them to Zoom groups. We host Zoom groups every day and maintain the same welcoming and caring environment virtually as we do in person. 5. We apply our cultural competency skills when working with the African American, Latino and other minority populations. We create a space for them to share openly about their racial and ethnic challenges and how they impact their overall mental health. We identify the challenges affiliated with systemic racism and identify ways that each member can feel safe, supported, and empowered to reduce systemic racism. V.

FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: Because of all the COVID -19-related challenges, we expect many challenges in meeting several of the 2021/2022 contracted guidelines for: 2,500 hours of MAA billable services (this projection was met by our team last year and we should be able to meet it aga in). 100 Peer Support and Wellness services (we should be able to meet and surpass this contracted expectation.) 428 hours of Outpatient service hours: Although we have recently added Medication Services to all Medi -Cal eligible clients and some of our Out patient service hours should result from assessments done by our Nurse Practitioner, it will continue be a great challenge to meet the contracted 428 hours of Outpatient services simply because of the very limited number of Medi -Cal eligible clients curren tly enrolled at BWC.

During the pandemic, Hedco had an average of 430 individuals here every month for daily support. During the shelter in place Hedco's participants still had access to a charging table for their phones and other electronic equipment, snacks, hygiene kits, counselling, and hot lunches. Hedco was fundamental in providing the community members with the neccesities that they needed during the pandemic.

FY 20/21 Challenges: This past year, experienced a dramatic shift from survival mode to revival mode. During shelter -in-place we were forced to limit in- person contact to outdoor support for our members. With the limited contact we were still able to offer food to individuals and families in need, but as the restrictions lifted and we were able to open up we switched our gears to focus more on reengaging members who had stopped utilizing the center which was a challenge as most of our members dispersed out into the community with no way for us to reach out to them. A particular challenge was keeping members aligned with the everchanging COVID -19 guidelines. Many participants looked to the Fremont Wellness Center for guidance relating to mask mandates, information about vaccines and current news related to Covid -19. Staff provided education and current information relating to Covid -19 and supported individuals in making decisions regarding vaccinations.

These services include: sh owers, hygiene kits, clean clothing, shoes, healthy meals, water, beverages, mail services, to -go prepared meals, pantry staples, fresh groceries, and counseling services. Furthermore, the Fremont Wellness Center serves as a cooling center during extreme heat preventing unhoused individuals to become negatively impacted by extreme weather.

FY 20/21 Challenges: Prior to our reopening our biggest challenge was reengaging former Towne House partners while ensuring we are extending our reach to capture and welcome new partne rs. One other barrier to our reopening was the ongoing changes to Covid -19 protocol and managing the confusion around this not just with staff, but our partners. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: The Wellness Center provides a place where partners and their family members can come and receive housing/therapeutic services, case management services and local resources. Also, per our alameda contract under peer support and wellness services: Towne Hou se Wellness Center tracks the engagement and peer support. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES153 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG We track all interactions/engagements to capture in monthly MAA -billable activities. We also use inhouse census tracking to capture demographic information that will be utilized for reporting purposes on a quarterly and annual basis. Partners who demonstrate and meet level need for mental health support and treatment are assisted with brokerage and linkage to ACCESS. Additionally, partners who demonstrate the need for a dual diagnosis program are supported with linkage to CenterPoint to address their AOD rehabilitation needs. A former partner who utilized Towne House Wellness Center prior to pandemic closures returned during the reopening. Often times when he would come in, he would sit and just rest on the couch, minimally engaging in the milieu. With some encouragement staff was able to engage him in conversation and overtime in activities. He began attending our groups and actively participated. As the weeks went by, the partner slowly ope ned up to staff and would share his observations of what the wellness center used to be like and how he feels it is now. He went on to share that his opinion was that the center has improved greatly and that he appreciates all the mindfulness and wellness activities that were being offered. The partner shared that he has mental health struggles and mostly keeps to himself. During our reopening, staff asked if the partner would like to participate with the celebration by helping us throughout the event. The partner enthusiastically accepted and spent the day supporting the staff with greeting people, pointing folks to activities and explaining what we had to offer for the day. At one point the partner was so engaged that he led our end of day raffle activity. Over the course of his return to Towne House and the reopening day, the partner had immersed himself in all that Towne House had to offer him; food, activities, socialization time, and a sense of community. The partner came regularly and was no longer jus t sitting on the couch. Instead, the partner actively participated in groups, offered to help staff when needed, and began engaging in meaningful interactions with peers. One standout moment staff observed was the day the partner demonstrated acknowledgmen t and insight of his privilege. On this day the partner came with a bag full of men's underwear and socks, letting staff know that he was donating these items to the center for his peers who may need them. The partner went on to share, \"I have more than I need and I have a family who provides. I'm here every day and I see that my peers need things, so if I have it, I'd like them to have it. Also, I heard we were starting a clothes pantry here so we could put this in there\". That one act of generosity demons trated so much more than a donation. What was interesting and amazing from a human behavior perspective was the partner sharing his identification of the intersectionality of his socioeconomic status (privilege) in comparison to his peers and living as som eone struggling with mental health (disability) just as his peers do. This partner is someone who shared that he was isolative and hardly interacted with people, but was now accessing the part of his mental rationale that connected him having a surplus of items he can share (insight) and wanting to share with his community in need (compassion). Presently, our partner has now been elevated to the status of Peer Lead in the center. Staff noticed the need to include more peer based and led activities and when the moment came to identify a good candidate from our pool of partners, we unanimously voted on this partner. In this capacity, the partner supports the wellness center by assisting his peers in the milieu with meals and food support in the wellness cente r kitchen. The partner created his own schedule and dedicates a fulltime week M on. - Fri. to supporting the center and his peers. The partner checks in with wellness staff regularly to gain support when needed and to gain support with employment developmen t. The partner shared that his personal goal is to gain tangible work skills through the wellness center that may equate to possible employability in his future. The partner comes every day preparing snacks and making coffee for his peer and has integrated himself well into his peer community and with staff. Most recently the partner shared with staff that his family is really happy with how involved he is at the Towne House. The partner shared that he feels a sense of ownership and purpose in his role at the Towne House both personally and professionally. 154 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Having a safe place where people in our community can go where they can access resources to services, food, daily shelter, social interaction, and human kindness has proven to be a need. Our increasing weekly census reflects that since our doors have reopened, each week has seen more partners from the community c oming in to utilize our center. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: The reopening of our cent er has been picking up momentum, however, what makes predicting numbers is the pandemic. What we realize is though we have doors open and people are coming, there is an uncertainty on whether that will be a constant as services may once again become impact ed by this virus. What we have been noticing in our weekly census is that on average we are seeing 160 partners per week, but that again can change depending on the course of this pandemic. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: The Towne House team is working to link with organizations/ agencies who provide shower services to support partners with keeping clean and working on ADL's. We are actively looking to link with and create partnerships with these providers and we are close to identifying an agen cy who can come to us and provide this support to our partners on a weekly basis. Towne House is currently working to develop clothes pantry to offer clothing to our partners who demonstrate the need.

Language Capacity for this program: All Valley staff are English speaking, we have staff that speaks Farsi/Dari and we have utilized the language line when there is a language barrier , which occasionally happens. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: The biggest challenge this year was being able to connect with and provide meaningful servic es during a pandemic and maintain all safety protocol. Ensuring that partners were fully informed of all safety precautions and following all protocol was very challenging as there was a lot of misinformation floating around and information constantly chan ging. The staff at Valley tried their best to be up -to-date with all the information and tried to ensure all partners were well informed and well equipped with basic need items and PPE. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: During the pandemic where most social service agencies were closed, Valley, like many other BACS' programs was open to serve clients. Our means of providing support was a little different this year, but staff was there to support and meet the clients where they were at. Partners 156 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG expressed grattude for providing a space that they could turn to when everywhere else was closed. Many of our partners had no natural supports around them and had no other means of social interaction besides Valley. The weekly calls and check -in's allowed staff to assess the needs and safety of our partners; some of these calls led to safety planning and prevention of hospitlizations. M.C is a partner that suffers from severe depression and anxiety and had a history of hospitalzati ons. She was isolated for years until she found Valley Wellness. Valley become part of her daily routine, she would take 2 buses to come to the center, have lunch and engage with staff and peers.

Staff would also drop by her place 1/week to provide her with supplies and in -person connection. M.C has repeatedly said that if it wasn't for Valley should would have been at John George Hospital and that she was very grateful for the support. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Valley Wellness Cent er plays an important role in the Tri -Valley, as the region is fairly isolated from services that are provided in the cities of Alameda County. Many of the clients that VWC serves are those who are from this region and do not want to go to Oakland or Hayw ard, they want to remain here. That being said, housing and other immediate services are very limited. VWC helps clients cope with the absence, or slowness of such services, by meeting their daily needs. Staff hand out hygiene kits, snacks, sometimes cl othing like socks and in the winter jackets and gloves. We empathize with our participants and do what we can to help someone. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: VWC projects that we will have at least the same amount of people through the door, but with Covid -19 and partners being conditioned to stay home it might be a challenge to get some people back at the center. The virus has taken a toll on the mental health and wellness of the citizens of this country, so an increase in mental heal th services will be needed.

Our efforts to partner with another organization for a remote TAY WRAP group were unsuccessful. Despite our efforts to work with more than five poten tial partners, we were not able to set up a remote TAY WRAP group by the end of the fiscal year. We are committed to building at least one solid partnership for TAY WRAP early in FY 2021 -22. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: The WRAP grou p in Spanish that we run in collaboration with La Familia Counseling Service has been a crucial source of connection for participants, who primarily are Latinx elders and have been heavily isolated since March 2020.

She expressed to one WRAP facilitator, with whom she has had a long -standing connection through the group, that the group has been one of the key pillars of her wellness b ecause she knows that whenever she needs it, she will find a safe space, encouragement, and hope through peer support. Being able to access that support during the pandemic has been important for her mental health.

III. FY 20/21 Challenges: We have been still pro viding services to our clients despite being in a national pandemic for over a year and a half. Our struggles have been with retention of providers due to their stress related concerns of working via telemedicine. The ongoing pandemic has increased isolati on for clients and reduced the ability to connect to much needed resources. 160 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: During the year of 2020 2021, we impacted clients through serving them throughout the entire year utilizing telemedicine services. We continue to provide services despite the pandemic and have reduced rates of no shows and timeliness with appointments due to our telemedicine outreach. We have been able to accommodate all referrals with appointments within 7 days or under who are discharged from the hospital. This year our referral to admission time has improved due to hiring an Intake physic ian. Increasing Health Conditions: We have been providing health interventions that reduce the impacts of COVID19 pandemic. We provided a health fair giving vaccinations to the clients and introducing them to their providers. In addition, we had clients increase their access to vaccinations which contributed to less exposure to COVID19. We increased our outreach to outside providers coordinating medical records and health objectives. We were able get 82% of our total clients connected with a Primary Care Physician. This was an improvement f rom the previous fiscal year. We were able to reduce the number of psychiatric hospitalizations of clients enrolled into Pathways by 30%+ this fiscal year compared to last year. This also meant that in order to reduce hospitalizations, Pathways offered mo re time and appointments to clients who were open to us this fiscal year. As a direct result of COVID a number of our clients needed more assistance in finding housing, jobs and other types of treatment. i.e. AOD services, etc. We also noticed a trend thro ughout this fiscal year of new client referrals presenting with a much higher level of acuity than in the past and most importantly needing additional resources outside of Pathways \"medication support\" services this fiscal year. Reduce mental health stigm a: We reduce mental health stigma by hiring staff that are diverse, are culturally competent, and who understand, embody, and implement the standards of the MHSA model of care. This includes a commitment to reduce mental health stigma through utilizing cli ent centered assessment, strengthbased services, trauma informed care, and culturally competent training within the psychiatric and social behavioral frameworks of mental health care. We were able to improve our engagement services and show rates with ou r African American mentally ill clients. Over 70% of our clients are people of color and this year we served over 900 African American mentally ill clients. In addition, we are finding that more clients are requesting to be seen in our clinics due to the d iverse staffing levels that Pathways continues to offer each year. Client Centered Assessment : is an ongoing service activity of gathering and analyzing collaborative information with the client. Together we help the client build community resources and tertiary interventions to reduce harm an increase resiliency. Assessment includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: medical necessity, mental status determination, analysis of the client's clinical history; gathering relevant cultural issues, analysis of behaviors and interpersonal skills, a review of family dynamics and diagnosis. Assessments view the client from a comprehensive social cultural lens keeping in mind the daily stressors a client may go through specifically if they are fr om an underserved population. Utilizing a social justice perspective of how race, class, culture, sexual orientation, and gender identity impact a person's expression of symptom and we ensure that clients are diagnosed correctly. We account for the impact of how these qualifiers can drive diagnosis including African Americans being disproportionally diagnosed with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders when instead they have a trauma disorder. We at Pathways to Wellness differentiate between cultural a nd functional paranoia in symptoms and encourage an accurate portrayal of client symptoms. By focusing on what the client is experiencing in the world as who they are, we can differentiate between what is COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES161 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG the client's symptom and what is the malady of syst emic racism. This way, we can treat the person and not the illness of the institutions in which they continually encounter. Trauma Informed Care: In alignment with the MHSA standards of treatment and care, Pathways to Wellness utilizes trauma informed ca re which includes program participant empowerment and choice, collaboration among service providers and systems, ensuring physical and emotional safety and trustworthiness for program participants. When a client has been exposed to abuse, neglect, discrimination, violence, and adverse experiences, they are at risk for health related issues especially mental health complications. By acknowledging the client's life experiences, our providers improve patient engagement, treatment adherence, medication manageme nt, and potential mental health recovery. Strength Based Model: Our Strengths Based Model uses a set of values and philosophy of practice that encourages clients to become experts in their own mental health recovery. This includes the potential to recove r from adversity through mutually identified strengths, community resources and other opportunities. Program staff and providers assist clients in assessing their strengths, establishing meaningful goals, and developing a recovery plan. Pathways to Wellnes s encourages program clients to recover from mental health and reclaim their lives. We focus on client strengths rather than deficits to increase self worth and enhance the potential for mental health recovery. We encourage the participant to be an expert of their own recovery. We encourage a collective treatment approach as primary and essential while working together as copartners. We provide ongoing culturally responsive trainings for our staff and our communities at large to better engage and serve A frican American consumers which represents the largest client population at Pathways. These trainings are provided to both our staff and to our community. We train providers about the complexity of trauma within the African American population and how to b est serve their psychiatric and biopsychosocial needs. Create a welcoming environment: Our welcoming environment includes providing a client driven comprehensive communitybased specialty mental health services. We support adults ages 18 years and older l iving with a serious mental illness, at risk of or experiencing homelessness, who may also have a cooccurring substance use disorder, and/or who may be engaged in the criminal justice system. Our services implement a phased approach with the provision of intensive services during the early phase of treatment. When applicable, we see clients frequently within their first 90 days in order to ensure they are out of crisis and stabilized on their medications, and have community resources. Our waiting rooms are set up so that clients may experience a welcome home environment with decaf coffee and water provided daily, special food luncheons once a month, clothing and food drives, as well as our yearly mental health picnic for clients, and our consumer council th at encourages participation from consumers. Clients are provided with art supplies while they wait for their appointments and are met with our engagement team to ensure they have their needs met and are welcomed. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: We were able to improve the amount of services provided by creating organization related to telemedicine. As a result, we were able to encourage on time services with a much lower no show rate. We also transitioned fully onto an electronic medical records sys tem which reduces wait times when sharing a client's chart between providers and staff. We also still continue to struggle with discharging high volumes of clients to lower level of care due to the inability for PCPs to take our clients. 162 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG VI.

Services are designed to enhance the lives of individuals living with mental illness and guide them on their healing process. The mission of STEPS is to fa cilitate the transition of high risk, hard -to-place Alameda County Behavioral Health clients into the community while reducing their length of stay in Alameda County psychiatric facilities. Target Population: Adults (ages 18 -59) diagnosed with a severe me ntal illness. STEPS' goal is to serve high utilizers of Alameda County mental health services. Members referred to STEPS will have utilized at least three psychiatric emergency room visits and/or at least one month of inpatient psychiatric care within the past year. Priority will be given to members who have met these criteria for 2 years in a row. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 60 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: STEPS staff utilize a certified language line to provide services in languages other than English. They can, at times, access language capacity of other Telecare program staff in case of emergency. These languages include Spanish, Khmer, Urdu, Taiwanese, Cantonese. III. FY 20/21 Challe nges: The most significant issue during this FY was the COVID virus and response coordination. The STEPS program had partners living in congregate homes both licensed and unlicensed, in homeless shelters, and in independent housing. We supported our hous ing partner's with education for staff and residents in the congregate settings about hand washing and COVID 19 health and safety info. We were able to quickly purchase and distribute items like pre -paid cell phones, hygiene supplies, games/activities, fo od, and emergency items to provide to individuals in an effort to support them sheltering in place. We were also able to support some of the homes in accessing PPE - face -shields, gloves, face masks. We were able to continue to see partners in the commun ity when some level 1 teams were only able to provid e TeleHealth services. The overall response to the COVID crisis from the county, our community partners and Telecare were massive and protected our partners from the spread of the virus . For the STEPS program, another significant challenge in the community is finding and securing affordable, independent housing. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: STEPS partners had a decrease in hospital days and homeless days over the last year. Partners increased participation in primary care treatment and participation with their service 164 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG teams. We supported partners in accessing the level of care they needed t o be safe and successful in the community. Our partners have been able to maintain housing, participate in vaccination events, access on -line support tools including TeleHealth therapy groups, and find employment. Personal story: When \"Ann\" was referred to the STEPS team, she had disengaged from treatment and stopped taking medications. She had recently been sexually assaulted which resulted in a pregnancy. Her medical condition of diabetes was unmanaged, and she ended up in the ER on 2 occasions. Ann was also experiencing near daily suicidal thoughts and had made 1 attempt on her life 2 months earlier. Ann was willing to accept support and was quickly able to develop a supportive therapeutic relationship with her STEPS case manager. STEPS was able to support Ann with coordinating her primary and pre/post -natal care, as well as assist with care coordination for her new baby. STEPS supported Ann in maintaining her housing with emergency funds for back rent owed on her apartment, needed furniture/beddin g for her family, and healthy low -cost food to improve her diabetes management. STEPS supported Ann in re -connecting to level 1 treatment team and restarting her medications to improve her mood and reduce her SI. STEPS supported Ann in connecting with a therapist for help dealing with past trauma and current stressors. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Over the last year, STEPS has increased admission for community referrals and increased assessments/care coordination with Alame da County ACCESS to ensure that partners are receiving the best matched care to support their needs and reduce risk in the comm unity. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: STEPS average census over the last year has been around 25, falling a b it short of our 28 -person census expectation. When STEPS has graduations, we are able to reach out to Alameda County service teams, sub -acute hospitals and crisis residential placements to provide needed support. We will continue to work diligently arou nd maintaining our census at 28. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: There are no expected service or program changes in the next fiscal year.

The IPS component of the program sees work and preparing to work through acquiring job skills as a mental health intervention.

Target Population: Adults in Alameda County (18+) with SMI as well as individuals with co -occurring disorders How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 3 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: English with access to interpretation services for all county threshold languages III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Staff turnover lead to gaps in service provided to clients. Clients need consistency in treatment in order to be successful, new staff having to build rapport with clients translates to frustrated clients and decreased engagement. In add ition to staff turnover providing job development earlier on in the pandemic was challenging especially as unemployment was high there were clients that were not interested in participating due to feeling like being in the community might be unsafe or the perception that employers weren't hiring. With the increase of vaccinations and decrease in cases this impact seems to be waning. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Clients interests in employment has improved. Clients that are motivated and focused on completing their goals remaining engaged and reach their desired outcomes of improving functionality in multiple facets of life. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Due to staff turnover, t he IPS staff lead is serving as support to 3 Bonita House programs untill fully staffed. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: Staff shared between programs in the future; as we hire to fill positions we will consider using IPS services in other programs and sharing the staff to support program needs. During the first quarter of FY21/22 we have served 8 clients and the employment specialist continues to receive referrals and i nquiries of interested clients. 166 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG VII.

By working collaboratively with the ACBH Vocational Program, we offer training and technical support resources, training events, strategize participant engagement approaches, and assure service availability to all programs. There is no service charge to clients who receive these services. Target Population: Adult p articipants in ACBH Wellness Centers' IPS programs How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 76 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: Although all services were provided in English, various languages are supported via translation support. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: The ongoing pandemic has impacted the numbers of IPS program participants actively seeking employment and the varying degrees of social -distancing prot ocols throughout the year have also impacted the numbers of in -person service provision. While I have successfully adopted Tele - Health service provision via video and telephone conferencing, it can occasionally be difficult to coordinate these services wit h certain participants who are unhoused or marginally housed and may or may not have access to video conferencing. There has also been significant turnover of Employment Specialist and Case Management Staff at the various wellness centers, with some positi ons remaining vacant for extended periods of time. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: While significant numbers of participants are engaged in employment, all participants who have received Work Incentives Benefits Counseling have learned important information about how Social Security Disability benefits and Medi -Cal programs function and learned the rules and regulations surrounding earned income, asset limit s, best practices for reporting income and asset management strategies. These learned skills are important for navigating the interface between employment and benefits and help to reduce a reluctance to pursue employment due to fear of losing benefits, and encourage confidence towards building an increased independence and ability to manage personal responsibilities. As an example of a typical outcome of WIBC services: A participant was referred to me by an Employment Specialist from one of the wellness ce nters, needing to learn about how earned income will impact his SSI and Medi -Cal benefits. He has accepted a part time job and has longer term plans to pursue vocational rehab services to eventually obtain a full time occupation that will allow him to transition off of benefits completely. I taught him how to report his income to SSA to avoid any overpayments and getting cut off from his SSI benefits until he is ready to do so. I also successfully 168 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG helped him to start an application for a CalABLE account tha t will allow him to manage the asset/resource limits of SSI and Medi -Cal and save some of his earnings going forward. This will also allow him to learn money -management skills and empower him to feel more confident that he can continue to pursue his goals without any unnecessary complications and setbacks. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: The CIL does not yet capture client demographic information; Vocational Services (OESD 20) demographic percentages utilized as proxy to calculate. VI. FY 21/22 Proje ctions of Clients to be Served: I would expect the numbers of clients to be served in 2021 -2022 to increase slightly, and would project somewhere between 75 -100 unduplicated clients. However, due to the ongoing nature of the global pandemic and its impacts on economics, jobs, social distancing protocols, housing stability and availability, etc., it is difficult to be certain of how things will unfold.

ACVP is one of four units under the umbrella of Vocational Services (Includ ing units for Supported Employment Training and Technical Assistance, CalWORKs Mental Health , Administrative and ACVP Direct Service). ACVP is imbedded in 1 8 county operated and community based specialty mental health programs (including Conditional Release, the TRUST Clinic, Asian Health Services, Casa Del Sol , La Familia, Fred Finch Youth Center, West Oakland Health Clinic, Schrieber Center, Supported Housing ). The model of Supported Employment used by ACVP is evidence -based Individual Placement and Support (IPS). Our service approach is to partner with program participants and engage them around their unique interests and needs in finding a job, meet them in their community to identify employers, obtain and retain jobs, while continuing to collaborate with their clinical team and significant others to aid in their success. After a consumer is working, ACVP continues to work with them until the job is secure and the individual is satisfied with the job match. If they want a different job or lose the one secured, we keep working with them as long as they are interested and motivated to work. There is a \"zero exclusion\" approach to recruiting consumers for services, which means that as long as they have expressed interest and are action oriented toward work, they will be engaged despite any presenting barrier. Target Population: Assists youth (16 -17 years old), Transitional Age Youth (TAY - 18-24 years old), and Adults (18 -59 years old) and Older Adults (60+ years old) in finding and keeping competitive work using the evidence -based practice of Individual Place and Support (IPS) - Supported Employment. IPS services span all of Alameda County . How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 269 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: ACBH Vocational Program has on staff direct service providers who are native speakers of Spanish, Korean and Tagalog. Services are provided to consumers regardless of language capacity (incl. sign language services for people who are deaf or hard of hearing), and make use of th e available \"Language Line\" interpretation or sign language interpretation services as necessary. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: The challenge in this fiscal year has been the continuing impact of COVID -19 on our service delivery model. Staff have largely adjust ed to virtual tele -health platforms in order to collaborate with integrated team members, provide consumers with direct services, and to engage with employers. Since the 're -opening' of California on June 1st, staff have begun to engage employers f ace- to-face for job development activities. Many consumers have indicated they want to put their job 170 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG placements on hold to avoid infection, yet still want to talk with employment staff to stay motivated towa rds work or educational goals. Another ongoing challenge has been to fill vacant staff and supervisory positions. Staff have retired and promoted to better jobs faster than the civil service human resource department can keep up. At the end of FY 20-21, 5 out of 20 direct service positions were vacant (25% unit vacancy rate). Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: ACVP has a 31% job placement rate for the fiscal year. Competitive employment rate percentage is the number of clients in the IPS program who worked a competitive job in the community (n= 83) divided by the total number of people in the IPS program (n=2 69). Benchmarks set by the Westat IPS Collaborative include 30% fair standard, 40% good standard, and 50% exemplary standard. ACVP helped participants start 116 new jobs during the FY 20-21 as well as maintain 26 positions with existing employers, for a total of 142 jobs (Individuals can have multiple job starts within a year; see list of employers and positions in appendix ). The IPS Supported Employment model follows these cor e practice principles: 1. Focus on Competitive Employment: Agencies providing IPS services are committed to competitive employment as an attainable goal for people with behavioral health conditions seeking employment. Mainstream education and specialized t raining may enhance career paths. 2. Eligibility Based on Client Choice: People are not excluded on the basis of readiness, diagnoses, symptoms, substance use history, psychiatric hospitalizations, homelessness, level of disability, or legal system involve ment. 3. Integration of Rehabilitation and Mental Health Services: IPS programs are closely integrated with mental health treatment teams. 4. Attention to Worker Preferences: Services are based on each person's preferences and choices, rather than provider s' judgments. 5. Personalized Benefits Counseling: Employment specialists help people obtain personalized, understandable, and accurate information about their Social Security, Medicaid, and other government entitlements. 6. Rapid Job Search: IPS programs use a rapid job search approach to help job seekers obtain jobs directly, rather than providing lengthy pre -employment assessment, training, and counseling. If further education is part of their plan, IPS specialists assist in these activities as needed. 7. Systematic Job Development: Employment specialists systematically visit employers, who are selected based on job seeker preferences, to learn about their business needs and hiring preferences. 8. Time -Unlimited and Individualized Support: Job supports ar e individualized and continue for as long as each worker wants and needs the support. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: For a ca se-in-point example of participant success and ACVP Supported Employment Services , please watch Josh's Back to Work testimonial and interview on YouTube (Turn on Subtitles/Closed Captioning): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v3JLL5zSnc ; also, despite challenges with the pandemic, the job placement rate went up 14% within the first six COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES171 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG months of Shelter in Place, demo nstrating an effort and success in engaging existing clients who were still motivated to work. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: 262 (172 served between July -Sept 2021 ; Avg. 10 new admits per month, with 9 months in FY remaining. 172+90 = 262) VII.

FY 20/21 Challenges: This fiscal year brought several challenges, which created a barrier to serving more clients and families. We had one staff clinician within the Early Childhood Integrated - Silva Clinic program out on maternity leave and then deciding not to return to the program, and we currently have not been able to fill the position. Due to the Pandemic, our staff were less able to interact with medi cal providers at the clinic and warm handoffs between the medical provider and clinician were not possible, nor was the clinic office available to meet with families. The clinic decreased their hours and put in place pandemic practices, which also decrease d incoming referrals and some client and family referrals that 180 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG came in were difficult to contact. We had the challenge of serving families and young children during the pandemic through telehealth, telephone, and occasional distant in -person meetings. Eng aging young children on telehealth or phone was not easy, although our clinicians found more success with providing services to their caregivers or to older children as the community resources on -line increased. Other pandemic related challenges were less availability to contact clients and families due to illness or moving out of the area or into crowded living situations or other barriers that the families themselves faced. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Contractor's Family Partners shall work within Contractor's programs to assist families in accessing needed services, promoting independence and building advocacy skills. Contractor's Family Partners shall collaborate with the primary mental health clinician to: Directly provide outp atient services; Promote access and linkages to services; Advocate with and on behalf of families; Assist families in increasing their support network; Provide mental health education and consultation to help families understand their role as their child's advocate and role model; Advocate for and champion family -driven practice; Act as a role model and mentor for parents whose children are receiving treatment services. Client Story: As a Family Partner, I received a referral from the clinician that works with this family within the Early Childhood Integrated Silva Clinic program, and collaborated with the clinician to provide services. The clinician identified on the client's treatment plan that the mother wanted support to get her child academically evalu ated, and the clinician recommended that the Family Partner help with the mother's stressors so that she could be more present to support the client to co -regulate. I provided services in the Spanish language and met the mother in February 2021, for weekl y or bi -monthly sessions for over 7 months. The mother presented with extreme anxiety around her child's learning process when attending Kindergarten. I focused my interventions on helping this mother gain an understanding of her child's development. In itially the mother presented panicked that her child was not \"normal\" and needed help from the school district to assess her child. The child in her classes confused the letter \"d\" with \"b\" or \"p\" with \"q\". Mother was very worried that this was abnormal. Family Partner supported the mother to advocate by speaking with the child's teacher and find out what recommendations she may have for her child. I also normalized the learning process for a young child in Kindergarten so that the mother could decrease h er worry. I provided the mother examples from my own life with raising my children and examples of how to promote her child in learning her letters and reading. Family Partner provided referrals to this family to the Hand in Hand parenting website; Hivel y parenting trainings and book club. I encouraged the mother to follow up with the referrals and the services that read books to children on line, in order to stimulate her child's interest in learning to read. Family Partner helped mother to be calm, no rmalized certain behaviors of the child, and referred her to specialized child development organizations. Over the course of this Family Partner's services to this family, the conversations between myself and the mother helped the mother to understand tha t her child was on tract and typical in her development to other children her age. Through these conversations, the Family Partner achieved the goal of helping the mother decrease her stress and worry and to be calmer with her child in order to be more ava ilable for the child's needs, such as co - regulation. The mother gained a better understanding of child development and decided to advocate COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES181 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG for her child by listening to the teachers and determining together when or if the child would need any additional a cademic support. Other measurements of client impact from services: Symptom Improvement o 85% report a reduction in symptoms on the PSC -35 at discharge o 85% demonstrate CANS ratings reduction from 2's and 3's to mostly 0's and 1's at closings. A case study of a 4 -year -old client is being provided by a current clinician who works with the Early Childhood Integrated, Silva Clinic program: I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who has been working in this field for approximately 4 and a half years. I have se rved several culturally diverse families in the community and provided culturally informed services. One of these families is a current ECMH Integrated - Silva Clinic client. I initially met my male client when he was 4 years old, worked with him and his mo ther for approximately 6 -8 months, and transferred him to another clinician in the agency. The case was transferred back to me about a year ago when that clinician went on leave and I was able to reconnect with my client and his family. I have been workin g with this immigrant family of Mexican and Guatemalan descent since then. Parents are monolingual Spanish speakers while client and his siblings speak fluent English and Spanish. I have tailored my services to better serve this family in their own languag e and have used my similar cultural background to connect with this family, while learning about differences between our backgrounds. It was challenging to support this family at the early stages of therapy due to the family's level of stress, intensity of the child's behaviors, and difficulty engaging the mother in therapy. I was able to overcome this by providing empathy with the mother and interacting and building my relationship with the child through play. I have provided evidence -based practices, s uch as Brief Strategic Family Therapy techniques and Solution Focused Therapy techniques to support my client in reaching his goals and improve the parent -child relationship. This child has improved in several ways while he has been in this program, such as being able to follow a routine/structure, express his emotions in a developmentally appropriate manner, have decreased and less intense tantrums, and be more flexible with changes that occur in his everyday life. His family functioning has improved an d has built a stronger, healthier relationship with his mother. His mother has learned how to manage his tantrums, manage her own stress levels, enjoy quality moments with my client, learned to notice the child's cues, and has developed a daily routine to help support the child be successful in the home. This mother and child have been able to navigate their relationship during the pandemic and successfully finished a whole year of virtual learning together. This case will be closing in the next few weeks d ue to the client successfully meeting his goals in treatment. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Long -term plans for the ECMH integrated - Silva Clinic program include building a new medical center where services by the medical providers at TVHC and the mental health providers from La Familia Counseling will be housed under one roof. The plans for this collaboration are already developed and hopefully the ground for the new center will be broken within a couple of years. At that point in time the full c ollaboration between the medical services provided and the mental health availability and services with warm hand offs to families with young children will be accessible to more of the community and a visible and welcoming center will be present for the va st multicultural families within the general Hayward area and surrounding cities. We are looking forward to the future of this development for the amazing collaborative project. 182 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG VI.

The proposed Axis Community Health, Mental Health Urgent Care Center will be available to all members of the community, regardless of income or insurance status. Individuals and families with urgent mental health needs will be able to call for same -day a ppointments. During the COVID pandemic, mental health services will be provided via telehealth; long term plans w ill include a walk -in access point as well. The Axis MH Crisis Center will also serve as a central entry point for assessment, triage, treat ment, and care coordination for individuals seeking mental health treatment, regardless of insurance type or status .

One of the largest program challenges this year was related to COVID. Our care coordinator has been working remotely all year, which makes communication with patients even more difficult than being able to see them face to face in the clinic. Often times p atients would not return our calls, or would follow up much later. b. Technical struggles - patients not being able to bring paperwork, lack of technology or transportation and delays in referral proces s. c. Another struggle was locating the type of services we needed for patients who were facing unique situations due to COVID and the amount of services that were necessary to support this population. It seemed that resources were being tapped and there were waiting lists at some times. 188 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: The care coordinator receives warm -handoffs from the health clinic and also behavioral health clinicians and links those patients with internal or external resources depending u pon the unique patient need. The utilization of the care coordinator has increased capacity to provide behavioral health services in particular and has aided in decreasing our wait time from intake to being matched with a therapist. This is in part due to the care coordinators assistance in scheduling intakes and ensuring therapist schedules are full, and also due to linking/building rapport with patients who have had multiple no shows to medical or behavioral health visits in the past. Care coordinators also act as linkage between systems of care, especially those patients stepping up/down from specialty services. a. Case Example: Single mom who has physical (needs blood transfusions) and mental health struggles (depression), came in initially overwhelmed, unable to pay her electricity bills and didn't have enough money for food. She also lacks family support and has some trust issues from negative past experiences in health care. Has been working with our care coordinator on/off for 4 years. She has built t rust with the care coordinator and \"knows where to go when she needs help\" (per care coordinator). Some of the things that occurred during their work together: referral and follow up with mental health counseling, worked on resume, got a job, working on pr omotion within the job, obtained child care (needed help completing initial and follow up applications for child care due to struggles with technology), applied for and secured low income housing, obtained Cal Fresh benefits, assistance communicating with PCP due to work hours. This patient comes in or calls from time to time and is extremely grateful for the support. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: a. We tend to see some of the same patients multiple times because they often need connection to multiple r esources, may need additional assistance or reminders and we ensure that we continue to follow up with patients until they are linked to services as much as possible. For every unique patient represented in this data, our care coordinators are following up with most of them multiple times, and sometimes on/off throughout the year. b. Our care coordinators are absolutely essential to what we do at Axis. As our services and number of providers has expanded to meet the needs of our population, it has been essent ial to have support ensuring that patients are getting their SDOH needs met also. c. Our care coordinators conduct SDOH screenings for all patients they seen so that we can ensure that we are inquiring about all potential needs and providing truly whole pers on care. d. We created an opportunity for upward mobility amongst our care coordinators now that we have 4 of them total (only 1 represented by this funding). e. Our care coordinator staff are happy and we have had 0 turnover in any of these position. The coord inator filling this position has remained with us since the start of this grant. f. Our therapists and medical providers are also happy knowing that patients will be followed up with in ways they can't always fit into sessions.

In FY2020 -21, T RUST provided Spanish language support to 60 homeless patients. For individuals with other translation needs, T RUST utilizes a language line to ensure language needs are not a barrier to services. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: As was true in all areas of healthcare, the COVID -19 pandemic brought many challenges to TRUST. The foundation of the TRUST model is low -barrier access, with walk -in capacity for behavioral health and primary care, and drop -in services including showers, s nack, and a clothing closet to address basic needs of the homeless population. Prior to the pandemic, the TRUST Clinic had a vibrant waiting room space for patients to come drop in and get a cup of coffee, charge their phone, and see a provider. From th e beginning of the pandemic, TRUST was committed to remaining open and working to support access to services through urgent in -person visits and increased telehealth services. TRUST quickly developed robust protocols and opened a screening tent outside the clinic. As a result of offering LCSW, psychiatry, and psychological services via telehealth, no shows dropped. Additionally, LifeLong welcomed patients into the clinic who needed a private space for telehealth visits. While implementing COVID -19 safety protocols allowed the clinic to remain open, it resulted in long delays for walk -in face - to-face appointments , and the closure the waiting room. As TRUST clinic staff have been balancing the provision of behavioral health and primary care with the ongoing COVID -19 efforts burnout and secondary trauma has occurred, resulting in some turnover in staffing. In response TRUST has made efforts to support staff retention through trainings, support , and increased scheduling flexibility.

FY 20/21 Client Impact: COVID -19 Response : The TRUST Clinic opened the first testing site in Alameda County specifically designed to serve the homeless community, with walk -up testing capacity. When the vaccine became available TRUS T had a robust plan and converted the testing tent into a walk -up vaccine site. TRUST provided 1,248 COVID -19 tests and 508 vaccinations in FY20 -21. TRUST clinical leadership was involved in the development and rollout of Project RoomKey in Alameda County , providing critical clinical support as Alameda County was building the service model for homeless individuals at great est risk for COVID - 19. and for those infected or exposed to infected individual s. TRUST was also a leader in identifying vulnerable indi viduals and successfully referred over 120 individuals into the hotels. Clinic Services : In FY20 -21 TRUST served 1,862 patients, providing 18,939 visits including 13,290 enabling services . This was both an increase over the previous year and a significant accomplishment , as many healthcare organizations saw a reduction in services due to COVID -19. One notable area of success was behavioral health telemedicine, where there was a large reduction in the no -show rate. This success has led to TRUST m aintaining expanded telehealth services for behavioral health , while returning to in - person visits in the clinic. People experiencing homelessness and those who use injection drugs are at increased risk of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Homeless ind ividuals frequently are unaware of their diagnosis and those who are experience challenges engaging in treatment making this an important clinical intervention for this vulnerable population. TRUST was able to maintain a high cure rate for patients diagnos ed with hepatitis C [87%] in FY21 . Patient experience data from TRUST Clinic show that 100% of patients would recommend T RUST Clinic to their friends and family members. In addition, 92% of patients who received a telemedicine visit reported a high de gree of satisfaction with the care and support they received from the provider. V.

The team may not have the exposure to as large a group of experts if they need to travel to the Bay Area. The trainings offered specific resources in terms of their individual topics that could be immediately utilized by the providers attending the traini ng. There were a number of trainings that dealt with the COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES195 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG responses of the African American community to the pandemic with tools and resources that the prescriber can utilize as we move forward beyond this pandemic. This year we also offered two trainings specifically regarding youth as a response to request from the community. The trainings were very well attended with increased interaction utilizing those tools available to us in a virtual format. This year in response to community request and interest the AATA team has been busy offering technical assistance in response to request from various community organization. A team member completed a training for behavioral health professional in the Alameda Health System's Highland campus \"The Souls of Black Folk: Psychiatry, Medicine and Pharmacology\" to increase the awareness of the various issues related to medication and specific interactions that impacts African Americans. The team offered a Technical Assistance training \"The African -American Patient: The Intersection of Psychiatry, Medicine and Pharmacology\" this was offered for Alameda County medical leadership and their staff that work directly for Alameda County. The team also had an opportunity to serve as panel expert for the Black Mental H ealth webinar series, offered by Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson during the May for Mental Health month . This series cover ed a variety of topics important to the African American community. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: The trainings have continued to engage a number of community providers a significant number of providers who have attend at least half of all of the trainings. This year the trainers were able to present specific and timely information related to improving provider s' interaction with the African American and minority communities during this very difficult period of COVID. The participants were offered specific strategies and tools that could be utilized with the African American population in both identifying depressi on and anxiety and offering examples and explanations as to how these issues may present differently in the African American population due to a number of cultural factors. This fiscal year we had an 88% overall participant show rate. This is an improveme nt from last fiscal years' numbers. We have found for a variety of reasons registrants were not able to attend the actual training. We believe that this is significant because it helps the team to understand, the overall need for this type of training in o ur community. Reduce mental health stigma: Several of the trainings focused on a review of the areas of health inequalities that have been highlighted during the C OVID pandemic. With clear information as to how these inequalities continue to support the stigma that continues to be found in the African American community. The presenters offered a specific training to a group of college students who were attempting to understand some of the overall challenges that they face with their behavioral health issues and why the students do not access these services although they are clearly needed. This training was one of the first steps in assisting in decreasing the stigma specifically as it relates to young African American males who have been experiencing an i ncrease rate of suicide. These community educational programs begin to help decrease the stigma using information and clear resources that members of the 196 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG community can utilize. There were also a number of presentations that dealt with the lack of trust tha t a number of African Americans have in the overall health and behavioral health system. While acknowledging that these issues still exist, the presenters offered concrete resources that can be utilized specific with the African American population. The se included but we're not limited to information regarding African American professional organizations that are known to offer supportive services to the community for example specific professional organizations that offer a training and support in the Afr ican American community. Create a welcoming environment: A number of the trainings offered by the Pathways to Wellness AATA team offered a variety of methods that can assist providers in terms of developing a welcoming environment. As a result of COVID a nd the increased need for culturally competent services for African American consumers - AATA increased the number of trainings required and offered for to the community. It has been a huge success and the community enjoys the various training methods that our presenters provide. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Some of our Topics included: Recovery process for African Americans Post COVID -19. The training offered specific strategies that employers can utilize to support wellness among their employees , which helps staff to offer a more welcome environment for the clients. Trauma, Stress, Social Justice and PTSD. These trainings offered participants information regarding the symptoms or clusters associated with race base traumatic stress (RBTS) hopefull y once providers understand this type of stress, they will be more sensitive in terms of both greeting and offering services to their African American and other minority clients. Youth Who Become Violent: Deconstructing the \"Why\". Lessons Learned from a Cu lturally Specific Dually Diagnosed Program for African Americans. Intimate Partner Violence during the COVID -19 Pandemic. This training offered providers strategies that can be used to screen clients for IPV and provide resources about intimate partner vio lence to clients during a Telehealth visit. Providing and Implementing Mental Health Support for at Risk African American Families. Requested Technical Assistance and/or Special Trainings provided to: Alameda Health System - Highland & PHP Providers The Souls of Black Folks: The intersection of Race, Psychiatry, Medicine and Pharmacology UC Berkeley - Black Mental Health Matters educational training for teachers & students Family Education and Resource Center - AAFOP You Are Not Alone Workshop Lifelong Medical Providers Highland Hospital Medical Providers Kaiser Medical Providers Black Mental Health Webinar Series - In Honor of Mental Health Month VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: We projected 150 to 200 unduplicated partici pants in attendance for the year. We expected an average of 45 to 50 attendance at any given training. We hit our goals and will continue with the same goals for FY2021 -22 as well as will continue to offer community education units for a number of our tra inings. We have found that the webinar format makes it easier for more clinicians to attend and get CEU in order to stay current with their educational requirement during the pandemic. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: This year will be the year of change for AATA team we are projecting continue use of the virtual platform for the first trainings in this new year. However, we will COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES197 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG plan for 2 in -person trainings in June 2022. We will also be implementing some changes in t he utilization of this platform that will offer more interaction with participants. There will be a greater focus on use of breakout rooms that offer participants a task to be completed in order for them to have a hands -on opportunity to utilize some of th e tools and resources offered by the presenters. They will also increase use of the polling devices and other interactive methods in order for the presenters to get a clear picture of the needs, see if participants are understanding content and hear reque sts from the participants in real time. This year we will continue with our specific Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Learning Series for CBO Executive Directors and/or leaders from agencies in which they have been sending providers to attend our AATA trainin gs. This training series was developed in direct response to request from CBO provider participants at our trainings where they indicated they often were not empowered to institute necessary tools and/or make the programmatic changes needed to support thei r learnings from our AATA trainings. With this suggestion we decided it was now time in our third year to offer specific trainings for managerial staff of agencies who can direct appropriate changes within their organizations. This two -day training assists executive staff in understanding how diversity, equity and inclusion you can improve overall all services to their minority population. 198 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG OUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD # OESD Description: AfiyaCare provides mental health services, case management/brokerage and crisis intervention.

All forty -four participants spoke English. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: For the 20/21 year we faced very similar challenges that we faced in 19/20 year of AfiyaCare. We continued to face challenges posed by the COVID -19 pandemic, which included: reaching clients, engaging clients, and completing necessary documentation . Due to safety reasons we stopped having in person support groups and in person one on one sessions. We changed our approach to virtual groups and telehealth appointments. This posed chall enges with the population we were serving because there were several barriers that increased during 2020 including: housing, economic insecurities, maintaining a line of connection through cell phone service, in addition to dealing with the day to day challenges living with a severe mental illness. Many clients had a hard time engaging in the virtual support groups that we offered so we didn't have any participants that engaged in our virtual groups. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: This fiscal year we believe that we made a great impact on the clients , families, and communities we served. One our impact measures stated that at least 60% of clients would have a reduction in admissions to John George Psychiatric Pavilion, Psychiatric Eme rgency Services/Crisis Stabilization Unit and inpatient, we saw that 100% of our clients had reduced their admissions to the abovementioned places. We connected 100% of our clients to benefit services needed which helped us exceed the impact measure of con necting at least 80% of clients eligible for General Assistance, CalWORKs, CalFRESH, and/or Medi -Cal who are not connected to these benefits upon their entry into COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES199 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG the program and who obtain these support/s within four months of their case being opened.

The client story shared was given by our behavioral health care navigator, Perrie Andersen , regarding one of the clients from his panel, the name of the client and persons in the story have been changed for HIPAA compliance. Mr. N was referred to Roots and the AfiyaCare program by probation. Mr. N came to AfiyaCare needing linkage to mental health services, a primary care doctor, connection to CalFresh benefits, and permanent h ousing. Mr. N needed help staying abreast of his appointments and guidance on navigating the many barriers he was facing when looking for permanent housing. Perrie was able to stay in weekly communication with Mr. N to help him navigate the many systems he had to get through. From January 2021 to August 2021, Perrie has linked Mr. N to CalFresh benefits, a primary care physician at Roots, mental health services with our behavioral health clinician, Monika, and connection to permanent housing. Perrie helped Mr. N with a hotel vo ucher, connection to the Turning Point community cabins, and eventually a permanent apartment that he shares with his girlfriend.

FY 20/21 Client Impact: AdROC staff met Client D at JGPP just before he was discharged. He was homeless, actively using drugs, and reluctant to accept services. The AdROC peer specialist linked him to an emergency shelter and while he was there, the peer specialist would meet h im in a nearby park and play basketball with him because that was an activity he said he liked to do. There were times when he would disappear for a while , but then he would return to the shelter and the peer specialist would re-establish contact with him and continue to build the relationship. Then she helped him get a job because he had no income. At discharge from AdROC, with his approval, Client D was referred to a Level 1 service team. Client H was a middle -aged woman who had a recent history of cy cling back and forth between hospitals in California and Nevada. Although s he had been a Berkeley Mental Health client years ago , she had no current connections to providers in the ACBH adult system of care . She was homeless, actively using drugs and had no income because she wasn't getting her monthly SSI benefits. The AdROC team investigated and found out the problem was that her brother was her payee and he didn't want to give her her monthly SSI check when she was actively using. Client H's AdROC cas e manager worked with the brother to adopt a harm reduction approach to managing his sister's money, paying for housing at a local SLE, and providing her with a small weekly allowance. The AdROC peer specialist used motivational interviewing interventions with Client H to help her get in touch with her own internal motivation for change. This process of ultimately resulted in Client H being admitted to the Bonita House residential treatment program. Client A was referred to AdROC as he was being discharg ed from JGPP. He had a recent history of frequent cycling in and out of PES and the hospital. His disruptive behavior and paranoid ideation often prevented him from benefiting from opportunities for treatment. His AdROC case manager helped him identify the ways medication helped improve how he felt and how he got along with others. This insight led him to increase his use of medication. The case manager also worked with Client A and his mother to reach agreements around her behavioral expectations of him that allowed him to move back into the family home. V.

IHOT attempts to connect them with psychiatric care and other community supports including medical support, housing, and social services. Each IHOT team consists of: a clinical lead, a licensed eligible clinician, a Peer Advocate and a MH Outreach Worker as well as a Family Advocate. The composition of the team allows us to have multiple and varied perspectives with which to relate to the participants and their families. This unique factor helps with finding new ways to engage folks otherwise considered resistant or reluctant to engaging in mental health services. IHOT visits participants in their ho me, hospitals, jails, and in the community to encourage them to engage in mental health treatment. Their goal is to reduce the impact of untreated mental illness in these adults and provide support for their families. The intention of referral and linkage , is to help prevent an increase in symptoms, added impairments, or need for more hospitalizations or incarcerations. The team schedule s appointments with participants, family members, friends, and other providers, as well as assist s with connections to community resources. Target Population: IHOT serves adults (ages 18 -59) with severe mental illness, who are not currently engaged in mental health treatment or have become disengaged, who are considered resistant or reluc tant to participating voluntarily and present with a variety of barriers that prevent them from connecting to mental health services and other community resources. IHOT serves adults throughout Alameda County . We also provide services to older adults 60 years or older if referred by Access to IHOT. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: We served 132 participants for June 30, 2020 to July 1, 2021. At the present time we are still serving 47 of those participants. How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: Our staff utilizes the Language Line to reach out to participants/family who speak languages other than English. We have used the language line most recently to translate for a family that speaks Mandarin. We have not encountered any language barriers at this time that cannot be support by accessing the language line. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Our team has continued to b e fully operational during COVID -19. The team has found it a challenge to connect participants to resources as some of these resources were closed or limited during COVID -19. We continue to meet people where they are (in their homes, in encampments, and in the community). It has been challenging to embrace Zoom team meetings and infrequent face -to-face meetings with team members. However, during this unusual time, we have managed to continue with our services to participants and to take on new referrals. Our Family 204 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Advocate has provided monthly Zoom Support Group to include former and current par ticipant families which are regularly attended by families. The Elevate HOPE Team is looking to hire a Peer Advocate who would be a good fit for the team and will be able and willing to work with participants in the field. Our team is currently a cohesi ve team that work well with each other and with participants. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: One hundred percent of our participants who were referred or who identified family members as support were referred to support groups like NAMI or FERC. Several family members were referred to NAMI groups who have the capacity to conduct groups in a language other than English. Our Family Support Group has met on a monthly basis (via Zoom during Covid 19) and has included family members from pa rticipants discharged from the Elevate HOPE Program. This allows for increased support for family members in the group. As many as 18 family members have participated in the online support group. Out of 132 participants, at least 50 percent were linked to Mental Health, Social Services, Case Management, drug/substance abuse and Inpatient Psychiatric Programs. Reduce mental health stigma: The staffing design of the IHOT Team (1 Peer Advocates, 1 Family Advocate, 1 MH Outreach Worker, 1 Mental Health Clinician and 1 Licensed Program Manager) enables us to provide services that reduce mental health stigma. The Peer Advocate offers individuals support, psychoeducation, and advocacy from a shared ex perience perspective and uses his/her experience to destigmatize mental health. Their lived experience and education enable them to meet our participants where they are and to model mental wellness through their own stories. The Family Advocate shares her own experience with her family member who suffers from mental health issues. The Mental Health Clinician and Clinical Program Manager bring knowledge of clinical interventions and Risk Assessment working from a Strengths based model. Our team operates from the Strengths Based model utilizing harm reduction in our approach with participants as well as Motivational Interviewing Our team deliberately does not use mental health jargon, labeling, or assumption making about participants choosing to focus o n the participant as an individual. We meet participants in their community setting. During our challenges due to COVID - 19, we still try as much as possible to meet in destigmatizing ways sometimes meeting at a park, someone's backyard, or next to their encampment. Create a Welcoming Environment: The Abode IHOT Team creates a welcoming environment for our participants an d families by consciously avoiding use of stigmatizing or overly clinical language. All our team members seek to engage our participants and families with empathy and regard for each participant's unique experience. Our approach is conversational and see ks to find common and shared experience that reduces anxiety and the stress that some participants and families have experienced when working with providers. We provide food or a meal as well as providing for other basic needs like clothing, a p hone, toil etries. During COVID -19, we continue to strive to make a connection with our participants even if we are not able to share a meal with them. We ask our participants \"Do you need something?\" \"Can I bring you some, water or food?\" This goes a long way to offering a welcoming environment.

The inability to provide services on the part of mental health treat ment providers in the field has create d barriers to providing referral and linkage services to IHOT clientele who already experience barriers to transportation and access to technology. IHOT staff have successfully advocated for some mental health treatmen t providers to provide in -person services, but this is a very rare case. Barriers to Medi -Cal & Private Insurance: One (1) client in particular is currently experiencing barriers to mental health treatment due to their insurance plan. This individual's p arent declines to disenroll the client from their insurance plan and so the client is not eligible for Medi -Cal or any Medi -Cal Services. The client must pay co -pays to their Level 3 clinic which the family cannot afford and of which is not covered by the client's insurance. The client is not able to be assigned to a higher level of care of which they meet the criteria, such as a Full Service Partnership, because the client cannot disenroll from their private insurance without their parent's consent. Is Any one Better Off? IV. Client Impact: Provide In -Person & Face- D uring Shelter -in-Place: Many IHOT clients verbalized access to thier usual professional supports and community connections were drasticaly reduced during Shelter -in-Place. Many IHOT clients expressed continual gratitude for La Familia IHOT being a sole form of in -person and face -to-face support during Shelter -in-Place. Support Families/C aregivers to Navigate Community Resources & Mental Health Care S ystem: La Familia IHOT has provide d education and information to family members and caregivers about the array of mental health resources that e xist in the community, such as the Family Education & Resoure Center (FERC) . IHOT dedicates much time to explaining to families of clients the continuum of care that exists in Alameda County (Level 1, Level 3, Full Service Partnership, Assisted Outpatient Treatment), the eligiblity criteria for each appropriate level of care, and the scope of such services. IHOT also provides education about the pro cess of psychiatric hosptilization (51/50), such as critera for 51/50, how to initiatve 51/50 by calling the police, 51/50 hold, collaboration with staff at John George Psychiatric Hospital, discharge, and referral to community mental health resources. IHOT Referral Linkage: La Familia IHOT has successfully connected many IHOT clients to specialty mental health services within Alameda County based on their level of care, such as Level 1, Level 3, and Full Service Partnerships (FSP). IHOT has also connect ed a significant percentage of IHOT clients to Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT).

La Familia IHOT Peer Support Specialist and IHOT Clinician listened to the struggles of parents manage the client's behavior and provide psychoeducation about mental illness . La Familia IHOT also coached the family on initiating a 5150 in the event of a psychiatric emergency . The family initiated a 5150 one day when the client was engaging in aggressive behaviors towards the family. The client was then psychiatrically hospitalized. After discharge, the client's aggressive behaviors drastically reduced him the home and the client began engaging with the family on a more consistent social basis. The client was very self -sufficient as evidenced by his ability to drive in the local downtown area and drive to social gatherings of extended family. The client then agreed to be referred to La Familia Level 1 Service Team Program. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: IHOT & Operation Safer Ground Collaboration: La Familia IHOT has received many new referrals from the Operation Safer Ground Program (Safer Ground). IHOT has developed a strong relationship with ABODE staff and collaborates with ABODE staff to refer and link Operation Safer Ground clients to mental health treatment, support client's document readiness to secure housing, and provide additional case mana gement to Safer Ground residents, such as connecting a mother's children to receive services through Regional Center of the East Bay.

FY 20/2 1: Number of clients served: 74 How Well Did We Do? II. Please describe ways that the program strives to: a. Reduce mental health stigma: The program works to meet clients where they are with the support of transition facilitators and family advocates who have personal lived experience with mental health, substance use, and / or previous homelessness. The individuals on the team have support and receive extra peer training to meet clients where they are and assist them in envisioning and attaining any identified future goals they may have. The peers and lead clinician hold the view that the struggles that a client may be managing do not defin e the individual but are simply a part of their overall life experience. b. Create a welcoming environment: The team works hard to locate individuals first and then slowly create a relational connection with those individuals. They meet with the individuals they are working with in a caring and non -clinical manner in order to assist in gaining trust and to promote a relational connection. The team utilizes a variety of methods to engage individuals that they are trying to connect with. These methods include games, art, food, and activities such 212 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG as going to libraries or small walks. The team always seeks to connect with the individuals they are working with in a respectful manner and use the goals that the individual is interested in to help them see the benef it of connecting and linking with other treatment providers. The team expresses interest in the topics and goals that the individual has stated are important to them. The team will also work with other people that the individual has identified as important supports, once permission is given to include them and create specific supports for family who may be overwhelmed . III. Language Capacity for this program: Currently IHOT has language capacity for Spanish and Punjabi a. Sixty -seven clients were served prima rily in English. Six clients received services in Spanish. One client received services in Arabic using the county language line as a translation service . IV. FY20/21 Challenges : The biggest challenge impacting the program at this time is the global pandemic we continue to face. It makes connecting with clients in hospitals extremely difficult and it is harder for the team to utilize the resources that they have previously utilized to find and connect with clients. Client anxieties and occasional mental health related paranoia impact the client's desire to connect or increase their individual stress overall which causes more irritability, difficulty managing symptoms and isolation. We have attempted to utilize more collateral supports to connect and link clients. However, not all individuals have a trusted family support system that can be of help. Another challenge has been working with anyone under 18. IHOT has attempted it a few times. However, it has often resulted in parents having extreme anxiety about the under aged youth being contacted by people they don't know. Effectiveness has been limited. Is Anyone Better Off? V. FY 20/21 Client Impact: 4 clients who were not linked anywhere 49 clients linked back to previous provider or IHOT bridged to a new provider 1 decided to stay with private insurance a. The IHOT program offers a once monthly family support group using tele -health modalities. This group is co -facilitated by a clinician and a family advocate. At the initial IHOT assessment of a youth, family resources are also assessed and if appropriate families are invited to participate in a monthly family support group. Through participation in th is group, a community of supportive families has developed. Family members can rely on each other and the shared lived experiences for support as their youth is being offered services. Participating family members also receive psycho -education from facili tators and other participants normalizing and supporting them in their experiences. This not only supports the family but also allows for the youth to be better served by the IHOT team. b. In one family support group session a parent shared their frustration and disappointment at their youth's quitting a job due to boundary violations. The parent described feeling that this incident was evidence of the youth's inability to persevere and succ essfully complete life activities. Another group member, using their lived experience, was able to re -frame the situation as an example of the youth's progress in treatment and their developing ability to advocate for themselves. The facilitators validated the parent's experience and encouraged the COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES213 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG parent to re -connect and support the youth's decision, thereby strengthening the youth's progress in treatment as well as the parent - youth relationship.

TAY ROC members include transition age youth who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, have co-occurring substa nce use and/or physical health disorders, frequently use hospitals and other emergency services, are at risk of institu tionalization, and/or have limited English proficiency. TAY ROC conduct in-reach and engagement at local inpatient facilities, CSUs, and CRPs. The team also provides outreach and engagement to other locations and organizations where TAY experiencing mental health crises are likely to be found. TAY ROC staff provide linkages, supports, and resources to help clients stay in the least -restri ctive , most self- sufficient, and recovery -oriented settings ; reduce the need for inpatient and emergency room care; and improve mental health outcomes. Services are delivered by a team of case managers, peer support specialists, a team lead, and a clinica l director. Services provided by the TAY ROC team include individual and group rehabilitation, crisis intervention, individual and group therapy , plan development and targeted case management. The latter service links the consumer to needed resources and supports in the community such as housing, benefits, medication, therapy, and medical/dental services. 80% of the TAY ROC services are delivered in the community. TAY ROC is locat ed in the Eastmont Town Center in Oakland, CA. Target Population: Describe information about consumers'/ clients' age group (i.e., Children/ youth, Transitional Age Youth, Adults or Older Adults; and Partners' unique needs. TAY ROC serves TAY youths 16 to 24 years of age who are Alameda County residents, who appear to be experi encing a mental health crisis; and/or are affiliated with one of the TAY ROC referral sources; and who are not already connected to the ACBH System of Care.

Language Capacity for this program and number of people served in each language : English and Spanis h III. FY 20/21 Challenges: The TAY ROC team faced a myriad of challenges typically encountered by a startup program: creating operational systems, processes policies and protocols; hiring and training up staff; building relationships with referral agencies; establishing an IT inter face with ACBH for inputting and tracking data a s well as conducting Medi -Cal and MAA claiming . In addition to these common and predictable challenges, the TAY ROC team also had to contend with the threat posed by Covid -19 to staff COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES215 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG and client health and safety, and to modify its operational practices to comply with Covid -19 safety regulations and requirements . For example, the TAY ROC staff's ability to conduct regular in-reach to inpatient facilities, CSUs and CRPs was disrupted wh en facilities were closed due to Covid outbreaks. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: When she was referred to TAY ROC, Client B was selectively mute, neglected her health and personal hygiene, and was inconsistent about taking her medication. The TAY ROC peer specialist was able to engage Client B and successfully built a positive relationship with her. She began accompanying Client B to appointments with her PCP, and linked her to Sausal Creek for injectable medication. After 90 days wi th the TAY ROC program, Client B successfully transitioned to an adult Level 1 service team. Client C was referred to TAY ROC while he was at JGPP. He was having frequent conflicts with his family to the point that they called the police to have him put o ut of the house. The TAY ROC family peer specialist met with Client C, let him talk and actively listened to what he had to say. She didn't judge, she didn't lecture, and she didn't offer advice. Instead she helped him get his driver's license because that was something he said was important to him. This success led to Client C to ask the family peer specialist for help in getting a job because this was also a personal goal. Initially he didn't want TAY ROC staff to speak with his parents, and staff wa ited until he did. One day he gave verbal permission for his case manager to call his parents, which she did. This small opening grew over time until eventually he and his parents reconciled. After 90 days in the TAY ROC program, Client C was linked to STARS and transitioned from the program. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: 30-35 clients monthly VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: ACBH and Telecare are currently engaged in discussions regarding changes to the TAY ROC average monthly caseload and the reallocation of staff between AdROC and TAY ROC programs to better the manage the service capacity of both programs. 216 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG OUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD # OESD 28 PROVIDER NAME: BACS PROGRAM NAME: Success At Generating Empowerment (SAGE) Program Description: The Success At Generating Empowerment (SAGE) Program is designed to serve individuals who are in the process of obtaining Social Security Income (SSI) for their qualifying behavioral health (and other disabilities) and who need ongoing clinical care coordination and support as they navigate the challenging bureaucracy while they are managing symptoms related to a behavioral health disorder. Individuals receive assessment, person -centered treatment planning, and ongoing counseling, clinical care coordination, linkage, and peer support. As individuals are awarded SSI benefits, they become stable and effective at managing their own lives. Individuals are then linked with ongoing natural and community -based supports for ongoing support. The program has a multidisciplinary staffing model that includes 50% clinical care coordinators and 50% peer counselors - people with their own lived experiences that can walk alongside someone to navigate the challenges of the system. Target Population: SAGE serves adults (ages 18 -59) and older adults (60+) who have a qualifying behavioral health diagn osis and are in the process of obtaining SSI benefits through local legal advocacy firms, Homeless Advocacy Center (HAC) and Bay Area Legal Aid (BALA). All participants live in extreme poverty, at or are under 10% Area Median Income (AMI). Many individuals are exiting jails or hospitals. The majority of individuals are homeless. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 370 How Well Did We Do? II. Please describe ways that the program strives to: a. Reduce mental health stigma : We used a trau ma informed lens and harm reduction approach to meet clients where they are at. We address mental health sxs as the client experiences them and try not to use clinical language. We discuss diagnosis in general terms and then ask the client specifically how they experience the sxs and diagnosis. We also talk about diagnosis on a continuum and normalize that most of the general population experiences mental health sxs and diagnosis at some point. b. Create a welcoming environment : By using the same trauma inf ormed lens and harm reduction approach to meet the client where they are at. We utilize the Critical Time Intervention (CTI) model to build strong foundation and rapport so a client feels seen for who they are and who they are not, and welcomed. III. Language Capacity for this program : We have staff who speak English and Spanish. We have access to a language line that we have used to be able to meet all language needs of our clients. IV. FY20/21 Challenges : COVID -19. We were still working toward reaching our full census of 400 clients when COVID -19 became a pandemic and continues to be a big factor in the community and for COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES217 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG our partner's and staff. Most of the agencies we work with to get our referrals and c onnect clients for care closed. Many agencies are still on reduced hours and very limited client contact particularly the legal advocates and capacity issues. The virus has also left clients scared and created a surge in experienced mental health symptoms. Many of our clients are still fearful to meet in person. The impact the virus had on housing was good for some clients but presented as a barrier to others. Many of the shelters our client's access was (and some still are) not taking new clients. Staffing Retention. Due to continued challenges with the workforce due to Covid -19, BACS has experienced challenges with retaining staff. While we still continue to work hard and meet the need for clients who also experience challenges due to Covid -19, we continu e to engage in the community and provide services. We at BACS are a collaboration of healthcare providers, frontline workers and essential workers and we continue to provide services even though we have times of staff shortage. Is Anyone Better Off? V. FY 20/21 Client Impact: We are an agency that does \"Whatever it Takes\" and we as we worked through the Covid -19 pandemic, we continue to provide those services and meet clients where they are at and strive to provide them with a whole person care which mean s that support every individual with their unique needs whether it be connecting to housing, mental health services, medical resources or just outreaching to connect to the community to increase positive social engagement. Clients have expressed feeling th at they have reached many of their goals and have graduated from our program after receiving their SSI. A success story that comes to mind is of a client who was connected with the Sage team in 2017. She was 24 years old and had recently lost her father wh o was her only natural support. This client had medical conditions that impaired her ability to work yet she expressed interest in wanting to go back to school to learn sign language. She has significant history of PTSD, depression and anxiety. Throughout the time working with BACS, she was able to get connected to medical services and was connected to specialist for her medical condition, therapy resources and received permanent housing through Landlord Liaison program. Client has enrolled into school for sign language and now has an emotional support dog that really helps with her PTSD symptoms. Client recently was able to be granted SSI and is feeling confident in her ability to live independently! These are the stories and so many other stories that show how the clients and BACS work together to improve the lives and continue to drive our mission of doing \"Whatever it takes\". VI.

Language Capacity for this program: Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner has Arabic language capacity III. FY 20/21 Challenges: OAST, now in i ts fourth year, experienced significant loss of staffing , including a reduced workforce due to COVID and increased attrition r ate of clinical staff working the SMI population. The program highly values quality of care and is recruiting highly qualified individual s. The program is curre ntly drawing support from other Felto n teams to suppo rt the program while hiring for 2 clinical case managers and a program manager. The program will benefit from re -establishing key community relationships as new providers come on board. The progr am continues to build also the necessary connection to medical sites who are unaware of us as a whole, including skilled nursing facilities and medical providers who are unfamiliar with the need to collaborate on client treatment and discharge planning to succes sful discharge planning . Additional challenges include the loss of traditional community and social supports as a result of COVID closing many social programming, Adult Day Health Centers, and also at times limited access to clients in congregate care. Felton's core foci during the pandemic includes the persisting need to recal ibrate and be creative in meet ing clients' social , community, and day program needs during this time, which have provide structure and stability for many clients. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: The COVID 19 Pan demic caused significant dis ruption and uncertainty in our staff and clients' lives. OAST has continuously provided essential community outreach based services to COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES219 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG our older adult s who are an exceptionally vuln erable population with regards to C OVID to maintain access to vital resources. Key impacts have i ncluded persistent support for clients to access medical care, housing, and connection to family and community. The program is proud to report that at present 100% (N=76) of clients are currentl y housed and 98% (N=76) of clients this past year have been connected to a primary health care provider, meet ing our target quality measure which is currently at 75%. This is in large part d ue to the model of care; staff engage reticent individuals to obta in medical care and retain housing in light of housing instability. Additionally, the clinical team advocated for the differentiation of clients' specific needs within the care system, seeking out correct assessments of both psychiatric illness and underlying/undiagnosed neurocognitive disorders, including dementia which may be misdiagnosed as a mental health condition. Another aspect of client impact included the program 's continued work towards address ing the significantly increased vulnerability for psychiatric crises during the prolonged and challenging time of COVID. As seen in our impact measure target regarding the reduction of client's CSS, PHF, or psychiatric hospitalizations for clients served for at least 12 months (N=63) which is currentl y at 80%, 6 people experienced a decrease in CS, PHF, and/or psych iatric hospitalizations (9.5%) and 40 people experienced no change in CS, PHF, and/or psychiatric holds (63%) reflecting a total of 73% of people who remained stable or improved stability ov er the past 12 months. 14 people did experience an increase in CS, PHF, and/or psychiatric hospitalizatio ns (22.2%). Of the clients who experienced an increase in hospitalizations, there are notabl e crossovers in episode counts which may explain the inflat ion of this number as a client who experiences a single crisis, is initially admitted to a CSU and within the same date admitted to psychiatric in patient, leading to simultaneous episodes within identical time periods . Case Study (Pseudonym used below and identifying information removed) Gladys is a 63 -year- old single African American cis -gender woman who lives with multiple chro nic illnesses and 40+ years experience of Schizophrenia . She is close with family, her 90+ year old moth er is her strongest advoc ate. Gladys communicates min imally verbally and isolates often , preferring to sit by herself. Currently her symptoms are increas ingly resi dual, mostly negative symptoms; Gladys typically does not communicate without prompting and responds minimally to questi ons, nor does she not initiate any activity without prompting , and di minished socialization. At this time she does not report experiencing auditory or visual hallucinations but has historically experienced both. Gladys typically resides in a Licensed Board and Care and is well known by the Housing Support Program team. She requires and has through OAST received support accessing transportation, attending medical appointments and managing her finances. She requires prompting to eat, clothe and bathe. Gladys is very kind and sweet, beloved by her family and providers across her spectrum of care. It is worth noting that providers working with Gladys typically go above and beyond to advocate for her, ensure she feels safe and comfortable and go extra lengt hs to coordinate her care. In the past year , Glady s has moved 4 times and been hospitalized 5 times d/t physical health issues. After each hospitalization, Gladys was discharged to a rehabilitation facility . OAST experienced a challenge in establish ing communication with these providers. Often the rehabilitation facility would discharge her with little to no notice, to an independent living home and would not notify her family nor case managers. Throughout the stay at home order and much of 2020 and into 2021, OAST providers coordinated closely in collaboration w/ her family, PCP, Housing Support Program providers, and the staff at the rehabilitation facilities to persistently ensure that her transition to and from hospitals, facilities and new residenc es went as smoothly as possible, requiring significant support from an array of providers to age in place with dignity One signif icant positive outcome is that Gladys now resides at a Licensed Board and Care in Oakland that is close to her mother's home.

These services assist adults with SMI to decrease or even diminish mental health symptoms in order to integrate into a community, successfully. Another important purpose of the Service Team pro gram is to avoid and eliminate repeated patterns of psychiatric hospitalizations for our client adults. The service design includes anywhere from weekly to monthly contacts of direct service. Alameda County Behavioral Health using Medi -Cal and Medicare fun ds currently funds the program. Hospitalizations and incarcerations are a meaningful problem in our area, which occur annually at an increased rate. Supporting our adult clients to understand their mental health symptoms, identify triggers, and manage thos e symptoms is an essential process of our program. Poor mental health negatively affects an individual's whole-person health, life expectancy, and their ability to envision as well as create their best lives through the Social Determinants of Health.

Adults 18 -59, must have Medi -Cal, Medicare, or be uninsured. Private insurance is not accepted. In FY 20/ 21 the Service Teams were not funded under MHSA. In FY 21/22 planning began to transform these programs from a medication support/case management model to the Full Service Partnership (FSP) model. Implementation for this change process will begin in FY 22/23 and may take several years for full transformation. FY 21/22 data will be provided in the next MHSA Three Year Plan FY 23/24 - 25/26. 222 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG OUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD # OESD 30 PROVIDER NAME: La Familia PROGRAM NAME: Sally's Place Peer Respite Program Description: Sally's Place is a Peer Respite Home and is the first and only of its kind in Alameda County. It is staffed by peers, in alignment with the objectives of our local agencies - Pool of Consumer Champions (POCC) and the Alameda County Accelerated Peer Specialist Program (ACAPS). Guests receive support from compassionate peer staff and can stay for up to 14 days. Sally's Place Peer Respite is a voluntary, short -term program that provides non -clinical crisis support to help people find new understanding and ways to move forward with their recovery. It operates 24 hours per day in a homelike environment. Target Population: Sally's Place serves adults, 18 years of age or older, who are experiencing mental health concerns or distress, have an identified place to stay in Alameda County at the time of intake (which could include a shelter), are able to manage medical needs independently and who voluntarily agree to engage in services. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 Number of clients served: a. Sally's Place has provided Peer support Services to 90 unduplicated new guests and re -admitted 130 guests that had returned who required more support either with referrals or respite services. How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: Among the majority of the staff at Sally's Place, all speak English and here at Sally's we make an effort to have at least 1 Spanish speaker on each shift. When guest arrive to Sally's Place and there is a language barrier we connect the guest to the Language Line, staff can access interpreters speaking many languages via phone - and most languages are available on -deman d at 1 -855- 938-0124. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Even though we have a current process on reaching the interested, pending and return guests that are on the waiting list still face challenges with matching the bed availability to the immediate need for re spite services. Sometimes when the bed becomes available here at Sally's Place we have difficulty making contact with the next guest which sometimes results in a waitlist. Sally's Place has continuously received referrals that exceeds the established bed capacity. That is, we have far more people who are interested - and qualify for - services at Sally's Place than we do available beds. This is good because it means that word is getting out about our services and that guests and providers are sharing their positive experiences, but the challenge for staff is holding the knowledge that many of these individuals will go unserved. It is also challenging when we receive a referral from a case manager, they will give a qualifying address for the guest, but onc e the guest arrives to Sally's Place, the guest will state that they are effectively homeless. Our current resolution is to forward the information to our Peer Advocate who works on COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES223 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG housing during the 14 day stay. We have been successful in finding a housi ng option for these guests upon exit from Sally's Place. In order to resolve this, we do our best to be as clear as possible about the criteria and explain the rationale to referring providers. We have also worked to identify alternatives to Sally's Place for individuals who do not meet our criteria. Another challenge that some of the staff at Sally's Place is with staff sharing their personal story in ways that can be triggering to guests; the staff have been coached on how to do more listening and how to thoughtfully gauge how much self -disclosure is useful and helpful for the guests. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: During FY 2020/21 Sally's Place impacted 47 African Americans, 23 Caucasian, 5 Mexican/Mexican Americans, 81 Non -Hispanic or Non -Latino, 0 Vietnamese, 2 Asian, 1 American Indian or Alaska Native, 16 Another Race not listed, 4 Unknown, 1 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 0 Other Non -Caucasian community members. Having only 40 guest's return for services at Sally's Place may mean that they were feeling better also connected to helpful supportive services. Data shows that Sally's Place have served and supported 26 Females, 63 males and one unknown/unclassified. According to our guest exiting survey most of the gues ts were pleased with the Peer support service given and felt hopeful even connected, after working with the Peer Advocate on the 4 phases during their duration of stay at Sally's Place. During Phase #1 the 1 -2 days the guest and the Peer Advocate work on t he Welcoming and Program overview. During phase #2 -Day 2 -6 is spent working on connections with family and outside social services that the guest would qualify for in Alameda County. Phase #3 -day 6 -8 is when the Peer Advocate works with the guest on Refle ction, checks on how the referrals are going and if any of the referrals were helpful; during this phase the guest would be supported on creating a list of supporters or local sponsors. This is intended to let guest know they're not alone. The Sally's Plac e team collaborates on alternatives needed for challenging situations and on Phase #4 day 10 -14 is the Preparation phase by where the staff and the Peer Advocate will continue to encourage the guest with tools of hope and motivating words. Also reminds the guest that Sally's place staff are here to support her/him/them with information and resources even after exiting Sally's Place. By creating the four Phases chart we will be able to ensure that we give complete care and support to each guest that Sally's Place comes in contact with, and that it's well documented. Reduce mental health stigma: Here at Sally's Place we do not focus on diagnosis; even the staff have lived experiences which they share with the guests to demonstrate how recovery and wellness ar e possible in spite of mental health stigma. The staff provide compassion and support to encourage, educate and teach many tools or ways to advocate for themselves are given while guests are using the respite services here at Sally's Place. Create a welco ming environment: At Sally's Place we keep the house safe and clean at all times. Before guests arrive all the staff are made aware of the arrival date and time. The staff that are on shift on the designated date prepares the room for the guest to arrive. There are times the guest doesn't have transportation so the Peer Advocate will provide the transportation to Sally's Place free of charge. When 224 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG the guest arrives the two staff on shift comes to meet the guest at the door with introductions and one of the staff shows the guest around the house, to their room, and before completing necessary welcoming packet the staff ask the guest if they would like to sit down and caught their breath first and maybe have a bite to eat. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: The Peer Support Specialists have taken to this model of Peer Support and consumers movement of power of choice and the whole team takes pride in supporting, encourging , empowering and advocating for the guests that stay at Sally's Place or even the gues ts that just need over the phone referrals or peer counseling and resouce linking. At Sally's Place Peer Respite we serve guest from age 18 and older. The youngest guest that received services from Sally's Place was 21 yrs. old and the oldest guest was 69 yrs. old. Sally's Place has continued to collaborate and receiving referrals from ; Alameda County CBO'S programs such as; Alameda County Emergency Medical Services (EMS), CATT TEAM, Mobile Evaluation Team - Fremont Police Department, La Familia, Fred Fin ch, Cherry hill Sobering station, Cherry hill Detox station, John George Psychiatric Hospital, Jay Mahler, Berkeley Drop In Center, Alameda County Mental Health Network, Sausal Creek, Homeless Action Center -Oakland, Berkeley Mental Health, BACS, Social workers - Stanford Valley care Hospital, Alameda County Family services, Families and Friends. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served : Our goal for FY 2021/22 Sally's Place Peer Respite would be to serve and admit 144 guests with 109 of those guests unduplicated. Which means that we can only re -admit 3 guests a month for FY 2021/22. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: Sally's Place Peer Respite is still fairly a new program. We are the first Peer run Respite in Alameda County. We make co nstant changes but over all our service delivery model remains the same.

The programs provide outreach and engagement, early intervention, and outpatient mental health services that include the following categories: mental health services, case management/ brokerage, medication support, crisis intervention. In addition, (re)MIND\u00ae and BEAM Alameda also provide Indi vidual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment and education services. The program goals of (re)MIND\u00ae and BEAM Alameda are designed to delay or prevent the onset of chronic and disabling psychosis and mood disorders, reduce individuals' hospitaliz ations and utilization of emergency services for mental health issues, improve the ability of program participants to achieve and maintain an optimal level of functioning and recovery as measured by functional assessment tools, connect participants with ongoing primary healthcare services and coordinate healthcare services with individuals' primary care providers, increase participants' educational and/or employment success, increase meaningful activity as defined by the individual, decrease social isola tion, and assist participants with advocating for adjustment of medications to the minimum amount necessary for effective symptom control. Target Population: Transition Age Youth (TAY) ages 15 -24, who are experiencing the onset of first episode psychosis a ssociated with serious mental illness (SMI) and severe mood disorder. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 Number of clients served: The Felton Early Psychosis Programs (re)MIND\u00ae and BEAM Alameda served a total 76 unduplicated program participants from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. We have served 53 individuals in (re)MIND\u00ae and 23 individuals in BEAM. How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: Currently, our staffing language capacity includes English and Spanish. Overall, we served 70 clients in English and 6 clients in Spanish. In addition, we have prompt access to interpreter services as needed for other threshold language s. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: During the past year of FY20/21, we faced challenges that impacted service delivery: COVID -19 and its impact on service delivery and lengthy staff vacancies (including administrative and peer support staff). To address the challenges due to COVID, we have developed a hybrid m odel of service delivery. We continued to provide face -to-face services to our TAY youth in the community as well as in our offices, using all COVID safety precautions. We provided in -person visits to all individuals who were assessed as high -risk and/or who did not have access to telehealth or phone communication, during shelter -in-place, and this was extended to new referrals. We also created accessibility for staff to be able to provide telehealth through Zoom for Healthcare and for faxes to be sent and received electronically. We strive to provide as many sessions as clinically appropriate via Zoom 226 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG and phone calls; however, many clients and their families prefer and require face -to-face contact. This has helped keep any clients and their families e ngaged with services. In addition, we shifted the delivery of group support from face -to-face to virtual groups; we are currently providing both a Youth group and a Family Support group via Zoom once per week. This required a great deal of adaptability on the part of our staff, our clients and their families. COVID and virtual services have created other challenges. One challenge was the negative impact on total hours of direct services provided to participants due to primarily providing services via ph one or telehealth. Despite best efforts, some of the barriers were participants not answering the phone or responding to text messages, limited privacy in the home, and lack of access to personal phone or computer (for some). In addition, many clients ar e experiencing \"Zoom fatigue\"; they are less engaged via computer than they would be during face -to-face sessions. With lengthy staff vacancies, it has been difficult to meet census and billing requirements. With fewer staff, there are fewer people to see clients and to bill for services; our remaining staff are working extremely hard to continue to provide excellent services. In order to reduce staff vacancies, Felton has developed better recruitment strategies; we have invested in a recruiting services c alled ICMS. This service aggressively seeks new recruits across a variety of job recruitment websites. In addition, we have also reached out to local colleges, reentry programs and BestNOW. Over the past 3 months, the Felton (re)MIND\u00ae program has hired non-master's care manager who is bilingual, a Peer Support Specialist (a BestNOW! Graduate) and an additional SEES/IPS staff. Our only remaining vacancy is for a bilingual master's level care manager/therapist; Felton is currently actively recruiting fo r a qualified person to fill this position. With COVID restrictions lessening, we remain hopeful to be able to continue to provide the full scope of case management, psychiatric and employment/education services, with a return to meeting census and billin g requirements. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: For FY 2020/21, our Impact Objective was to have an 80% decrease in CS, PHF, and psychiatric hospital admissions for clients served for 12 months or more. During this reporting period, the re were 23 clients who had received services for 12 months or more. Of these 23 clients, 19 individuals had at least one admission to CS, PHF, or psychiatric hospital in the previous 12 months before enrollment. 12 out of these 19 participants (63.2%) sh owed reduction in the total number of crisis stabilization or inpatient services episodes. While we were unable to reach the Impact Objective of having 80% of our clients have a reduction in the inpatient admissions, many of our clients experienced increas ed anxiety and paranoia as a result of the impact of COVID and its social isolation. A notable outcome related to reduction in inpatient services is that 8 of the 19 (42.1%) clients who had prior inpatient stays did not have any CS, PHF, or psychiatric hospital stays after entering the program. The Felton (re)MIND\u00ae program was successful in helping 42.1% of these participants re -integrate into the community and return home to their families. Thus, these clients were able to avoid the debilitating effects of any further hospitalizations. Another achievement is that the 4 clients excluded from the 19 above, because they had no history of inpatient care, continued to not have any inpatient stays as well; the Felton COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES227 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG place; we also provided in -person services to any client or family member who requested it. This was extended to new referrals. We also created accessibility for staff to be able to provide telehealth through Zoom for Healthcare and for faxes to be sent and received electronically. We strive to provide as many sessions as clinically appropriate via Zoom and phone calls; however, many clients and their families prefer and require face -to-face contact. This has helped keep many clients and their families engaged with services. (re)MIND\u00ae program was successful in helping clients undergoing early psychosis symptoms from ever entering the inpatient system . Employment Services: In addition, during this period, 37 individuals received supported employment and education services. 19 out of 37 individuals successfully engaged in competitive employment, resulting in a job placement of 51.6%. In addition, 10 of these 37 participants also received educational services; many returned to high school and college. This was one of the treatment components most disrupted by the COVID -19 pandemic and shelter - in-place orders; however, staff was relentless in keeping pro gram participants engaged in their employment and educational goals during a time of business closures, alarming unemployment rates and remote schooling. Personal Client/Success Story: This year, the Felton (re)MIND\u00ae program had a number of success stories. On June 23rd, 2021, we held a virtual graduation ceremony for all the clients who successfully completed the program in FY20 -21. Overall, the Felton (re)MIND\u00ae program had 9 clients successfully graduate from the; 8 attended the ceremony. We als o had 20 current clients and their families attend as well. The Felton (re)MIND\u00ae program provided lunch for all participants via Uber Eats. Many of the graduates spoke eloquently about their experiences and how the Felton program helped them recover. Mo st current clients and their families reported that they were highly inspired to witness the progress that our graduates made during their time at Felton. All who attended were hopeful for their futures and grateful for the services received. One client s poke very eloquently about their recovery journey. When they entered Felton services, they had been recently hospitalized at St. Mary's adolescent ward. Prior to their hospitalization, they had been a straight A student; however, they had a psychotic bre ak in their junior year. With the support of their therapist and our psychiatrist, they were able to learn effective coping skills and develop an effective medication regimen. They were able to return and complete their high school courses; they graduate d in June of this year. With the support of their care manager, they applied for and was accepted at 8 colleges around the country! They will be attending UC Santa Cruz this Fall; their care manager has linked them to counseling services on campus. They attributed their success to being in the Felton program and especially to their care manager. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A VI.

II. Language Capac ity for this program: English mostly. Crisis Line Counselors have access to 24/7 interpreter services in more than 140 languages via Language Lines Solutions. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Covid -19 and the switch to working remotely created challenges in the first half of this fiscal year. Our aging phone system and electronic health records systems were challenging to use in a remote setting and prone to technological failure, negatively impacting service level. We updated our electronic health records system and phone system to state -of-the-art web -based systems in November and December of 2020 - significantly reducing the number of missed calls. The challenge with implementing new technology systems included retraining all crisis line counselors on how to us e the systems, as well as rebuilding protocols and procedures that relied on those technologies. The nature of the crisis line service has changed over the last 5 years with increases in call volume, intensity and handle time for each call. The crisis lin e and National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number are posted on the back of BART cards, school ID, and there has been an increased focus on crisis centers as alternatives to calling law enforcement in the media and public discourse.

In the light of the Black Lives Matter movement and increased media attention and public awareness on the police killing of people of color and people living with mental health challenges, the program refined our emergency protocols and intentionally worked to reduce the number of law enforcement interventions. We focused on connecting people with the appr opriate level of care as well as educating people about the various services across the crisis continuum of care. We strengthened our relationship with Amber House, Sally's Place, Anti -Police Terror Project: Mental Health First, Berkeley Mental Health, Fam ily Education Resource Center, NAMI and ACBH Mobile Crisis Team with regular contact and referrals and staff presentations. We worked to minimize the use of law enforcement interventions by connecting callers to crisis clinics, the mobile crisis team, and providing follow up care. We provided education about services along the crisis continuum in 3,088 calls. 230 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 777 duplicated callers (84.7%) of medium -high risk calls were deescalated over the phone without the use of law enforcement intervention. 140 calls r esulted in law enforcement intervention because a suicide attempt was in progress, assessment over the phone was not possible, or the person was likely to die without further intervention. The number of follow ups calls to medium -high suicide risk callers increased by 166% from 279 calls in FY19 to 742 calls in FY21. The time spent on follow up calls increased 80.3% from 3,881 minutes in FY19 to 6,998 minutes in FY21. This year saw an increase in contacts with people in medium to high risk for suicide, and providing them caring connections, encouragement, and a safety net through their crisis. The number of medium to high risk calls increased by 18% from 778 callers in FY20 to 917 callers in FY21. The time spent with people who have medium to high risk for suicide increased by 32.5% from 19,080 minutes in FY20 to 25,278 minutes in FY21. Between March 19 and April 24th 2021 callers in Alameda County were given the option to answer a satisfaction survey question at the end of their call. Our phone system only allows one question at a time. Callers were automatically routed to question 1 \"On a scale of 1 to 5, how likely are you to call again if you need help? 1 being very unlikely and 5 being very likely\" from March 19th to April 4th 2021. Question 2 \"On a sca le of 1 to 5, how connected did you feel to the counselor? 1 being very disconnected and 5 being very connected\" was surveyed from April 5th -April 24th 2021. 80.72% of callers rated their likelihood of calling to call again if they needed help at 3 or high er. [Quality objective set at 75%] 84.72% of callers reported feeling a sense of connection to the counselor. 61% of callers indicated that they felt \"very connected\" to the counselor.

Calls from other area codes are routed to a voicemail greeting where callers can connect to a crisis line counselor by pressing 1. If the caller does not press 1, they are given the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number. The program will continue to expand follow up services for people with medium to high risk for suicide.

Language Capacity for this program: English is the only language that services were available in with the exception of the Hospital Follow -up staff who have access to 24/7 interpreter services in more than 140 languages via Language Lines Solutions. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: With our local healthcare settings focused on supporting our communities with the impact of Covid19, requests for suicide prevention workshops in healthcare settings declined dramatically in general. Our solution was to begin hosting our own workshops online to better accommodate health care workers and their potentially impacted schedule. Since Jan 2021, we have offered to the community 2 types of workshops: 1) Suicide Prevention in Health Care Settings and 2) Healthcare Wor kers and Stress: Preventing and Managing Burnout. Providing virtual workshops has allowed us to reach healthcare workers that we would otherwise not have been able to see in their respective settings. Regarding the Hospital Follow -up program, CSS had crea ted relationships and plans for being on site at John George Psychiatric hospital on a weekly basis prior to Covid -19. The pandemic was a setback for those plans and CSS had to rely heavily on referrals from providers and also the crisis line to ensure thi s population was served. CSS provided over 120 contacts during the fiscal year and is continuing to educate providers both inside and outside of CSS to ensure appropriate referrals are made to the program. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: CSS has had challenges with starting its SOSA group for the past few years and the group finally launched in 2021. Recruitment for participants was made possible through continued outreach and the removal of attending in person as a barrier. The gr oup took place in person and the participants 232 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG reported positive impact by reflecting on having a space to connect around their past suicide attempts, which is something they stated they can't talk to many people about. \"Healthcare Workers and Stress: Prev enting and Managing Burnout\" was a new offering this year and was created to be responsive to the needs of healthcare workers during Covid -19. The workshop received positive feedback from attendees and a number of participants attended more than once and invited colleagues to attend as well. The ability to address this emerging need is important at a time when the California Healthcare Foundation has published about the suicide risk increasing in healthcare settings. CSS understands that we can't expect our healthcare workers to remain highly attuned to the suicide risk of patients when they themselves are functioning at such a high stress level. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A VI. FY 21/22 Projections to be Served: We expect a 5% increa se in individuals served by this program assuming that Covid -19 will be less of a barrier during the 21 -22 fiscal year. VII. FY 21/22 Program or Service Changes: The program will continue to host workshops geared toward healthcare professionals in addition to offering to go to clinics and agencies. We anticipate that this dual approach could help overcome some of the bandwidth barriers for healthcare providers. Additionally, adding more menu items for healthcare professionals could increase the inte rest during these challenging times. As an example, CSS added a burnout session during 20 -21 and is working on adding a session with focus on safety planning in the healthcare setting in 21 -22. This is a topic that attendees in prior sessions have shown in terest in. Regarding the SOSA group, the program plans on running the group in 8 -week sessions continuously so that it's easier to do recruitment, intake, and placement with interested individuals. This is also in response to feedback from other providers stating that they are more likely to refer to a group that has a set schedule. At this time, due to the risk and limited access to those settings, Santa Rita and Healthcare Setting presentations are anticipated to remain virtual at least throughout the en d of 2021.

We also work with parents and family members of Deaf children or adult Deaf children. For the rest of this report, the word: \"Deaf\" will be used to include all clients with any kind of hearing impairment or loss or preferred communication mode. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 Fremont Office : 7 adults served , 2 child ren served ; Berkel ey Office : 11 adults served , 2 child ren served ; Private insurance (i.e., Kaiser, UHC, Humana): 18 adults/children; Uninsured: 1 adult/children How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: English and American Sign Language (ASL) Clinical Case Managers/Therapists and Case Manager are fluent in ASL. DCCS provide accommodations such as Tactile Sign Language (for the Deaf -Blind) and including ASL interpreters for Deaf clients who meet with psychiatrists at Felton Institute for medication management. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: 1) To increase numbers of staff as DCCS is understaffed due to increasing numbers of referrals, 2) To increase staff's access to clinical trainings, 3) To provide needed education to agencies and providers about intricacies and complications of running a Deaf program, and 4) To increase budget to provide ASL interpreters in compliant to th e Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf standards about the need of having two ASL interpreters: \"Team interpreting is the utilization of two or more interpreters who support each other to meet the needs of a particular communication situation. Depending o n both the needs of the participants and agreement between the interpreters, responsibilities of the individual team members are rotated every 20 -30 minutes and feedback may be exchanged. The decision to use a team rather than an individual interpreter is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to 1) length and/or complexity of the assignment, 2) physical and emotional dynamics of the setting, and 3) avoidance of repetitive stress injuries (RSIs) for interpreters such Client Impact: This past year, DCCS increased outreach efforts with current partnerships in lieu of in-person events and to maintain close ties for when such community events can resume. Before 234 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG COVID outbreak occurred, DCCS staff members were invited as guest lecturer and panelist/presenter at various Deaf Community events : 1) Camp Bloom in partnership with DCARA (Deaf Counseling, Advocacy and Referral Agency , 2) ASL Language Arts and Learning at Camp Arroyo in Livermore and California School for the Deaf Fremont, and 3) California School for the Deaf -Fremont Open House. The new Program Director (Selah Davis on) met with Nancy Moser, Supervisor of Counseling and Vision Services at California School for the Deaf, Fremont and discussed about pilot program called Deaf Virtual Playroom for CSD students who have severe mental illnesses. Program Director was asked b y a senior student/Junior NAD from California School for the Deaf to be the guest speaker to provide virtual presentation to Junior NAD members and the topic of the presentation was called Navigating your Mental Health as a Student . There was estimated to be ten students, two school counselors, and a teacher. Program Director was asked to present for Deaf Plus Adult Community Center (DPAC) staff about working with clients who have both Developmental Disabilities and Schizophrenia and over 10+ participants a ttended this training. Program Director was asked by Gallaudet University to be a panelist for the Black Deaf Healing of Kendall School Division II Memorial (Deaf institution) in honor of Louise B. Miller Foundation . V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: There is an increasing number of referrals; however, DCCS is understaffed, and we are currently recruiting to universities and colleges to work with graduate interns (Western Oregon University and Gallaudet University). Division of Operations and Program Director are currently planning to develop DCCS internship program so students gain clinical experience. In addition to Medi -Cal referrals, DCCS are also getting referrals from private insurances. Kimberly Cohen resigned DCCS in March 2020 and in May 2021, Selah Davison replaced Kimberly as the Program Director. Lynn Vaino continues to provide support to DCCS as the Director of Operations to ensure fiduciary and equity responsibilities of the program to the funders. Case Manager retired on June 30, 2021. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: The DCCS program hopes to serve up 20 adults and 10 for children. The current staff structure includes 2 Clinical Case Managers (licensed and registered LPHAs), Program Director, and Administrative Support staff. Through critical review, observations, and study of this program by staff in this program, the program acknowledges the need for additional Clinical Case Managers/Therapists, Case Manager, on-call ASL interpreters and Peer Support staff to enhance the level of direct services to increase Targeted Case Management, mental health services, and supportive groups to the Deaf/Hard of Hearing community. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: Program Director is in the progress of reconstructing servic e delivery system based on the integrated behavioral health model, which provides a comprehensive or \"whole -care\" services to Deaf clients. Research shows that this innovative model improves the well -being of the clients when their providers work together as a multidisciplinary team that address all the barriers and DCCS team can provide more effective psychosocial treatment to the clients. DCCS will become a model program where staff will collaborate with medical agencies and providers regarding the clien ts' well -being. DCCS/Felton continue to work on following COVID -19 regulations and to ensure that staff follows the protocols and to help support the clients to understand the COVID -19 protocols in the community. Program Director worked with Felton Institute's Communication team to create new DCCS logo and revamp webpage/social media. Two vlogs have been created about National Deaf -Blindness Awareness Month and that DCCS offices were reopening (while still wearing masks and practice social distancing ).

Across all operational segments of the organization, we provided and developed frameworks for identifying areas of improvement and suggested outcomes. We review ed all operating systems including Program, Fiscal, HR, IT, and Training requirements. We also met and coached ACNMHC's Board of Directors. Due to COVID -19 and their fragile infrastructure Felton had to set priority targets to not overwhelm the few and de dicated administrative staff. Additionally, Felton has continued to provide HR oversight and management; training, recruiting, and 236 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG onboarding support; IT training and system buildout; as well as provide chief executive coaching beyond the end of the contra ct on June 30,2021.

Interviews with the current stakeholders involved in providing IT services and manag ing the IT infrastructure. Training, Research & Evaluation : We focused on three general topics, in regard to training needs: 1. Description of the current work in the context of staff development structures and needs. 2. Current agency processes for training. 3. Training needs from the perspective of the current staff. How Well Did We Do? FY 20/21 Challenges: The major challenges found during the assessment process for the various program operations are outlined below. 1) Berkeley Drop -In Clinic: Current staffing is insufficient to support for continued growth of the program. Existing funding impedes successful accomplishment of program objectives such as, rent, office supplies, lack of staffing. Lack of quality control leaves risk of participant s not receiving adequate training. Current contractual demands of contracts do not allow workflow to recruit quality candidates, but only to meet UDC numbers. 2) Reaching Across: Additional funding to support operational cost (rent, office supplies, addit ional staff) The center requires renovations and update on furniture. All computer equipment is outdated (The associate Director works from home to complete daily tracking for the program). 3) BEST NOW!: Existing funding impedes successful accomplishment of program objectives such as, rent, office supplies, lack of staffing. Lack of quality control leaves risk of participants not receiving adequate training. Improve Peer trainings in areas of o History/Value/Approach of Peers o Clinical skills such as, empath y, compassion, active listening, HIPAA and confidentiality o Professional skills development o Overview of ACBH systems of network Current contractual demands of contracts do not allow workflow to recruit quality candidates, but only to meet UDC numbers. 4) Reach Out: Concerns for staff/volunteer safety when they are conducting group in psychiatric hospitals. Attempts to resume groups at board and cares to try and meet contract outcome measurables. 238 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Integrating COVID policy and procedures from federal, state and county levels to meet agency and program needs. 5) Tenant Support Program: Existing funding impedes successful accomplishment of program objectives such as office space (limited space to conduct adequate services) The Housing Market in Alameda County does not meet the demands and needs of the community. Lack of quality control leaves risk of participants not receiving adequate training. Improved communication with Alameda County Staff when application is completed. The major fiscal challenges found during the assessment process for the current state of the fiscal operations are outlined below : Finance Manager handles all of the fiscal operational duties and is overwhelmed. Not to mention they are also ready to retire Supporting acco unting staff is limited Current accounting manual and internal control processes need to be updated Lack of online access to the accounting software for remote access Monthly, quarterly and annual financial management reporting needs improvement Scope of w ork in the contracts don't appear to be properly funded for direct and administrative services The major Human Resources challenges found during the assessment of the current state of Human Resource Dept are outlined below : An integrated and centralized Human Resources function is mandatory. Professional Human Resources expertise is urgent. Integrated Human Resources strategy and planning is critical. Current administrative processes need an update or overhaul. All existing Human Resources documents needs to comply and must be updated to reflect current Federal and State Labor Law. At an agency level, the HR function is distributed across several areas including: Recruitment and Retention On Boarding and New Hire Orientation Compliance Training and Education Employee and Legal Relations Personnel Administration/Processes and Policies There is no mechanism currently existing that integrates these areas. In short, it is a function without a 'center', i.e., an organizationally legitimate focal point for the integration of strategic and operational HR information, and the development of effective and efficient responses.

There is a possible need for more refined tools for data collection and tracking (for both program outcomes and staff development), which may require resources, as well as staff learning. There are currently multiple competing priorities for organizational advancement. Stated Needs - Training, Da ta Collection and Data Reporting Create foundational training content and structure: o All staff go through Best Now peer training mode l Structure for embedding training, coaching and assessment of training impact that is agency - wide, but still meets individ ual program needs . For example, only Drop -In Center requires \"front -desk training.\" Via training for Supervisors and Managers - possibly a full series: building confidence in their own decision making, use of progressive discipline and other management fun ctions, management skills; dealing with performance challenges - specific to managing a peer -based workforce (e.g. trauma -informed, person -centered, boundaries, self -care, distinguishing personal issues vs. workplace issues). [Note: The Network wishes to d o more thinking about these issues, while also creating policies and procedures to help support the workforce and managers). Training on \"Outreach Strategies and Techniques\" - from tracking and measuring success, to the specifics of conducting outreach and engagement for programs (e.g. tabling at events and on street, communicating their messages with flyers, helping individuals make linkages to the agency program that fits their needs, etc.). o How to increase outreach to underserved populations (women, LGBT Q) o Be able to reach more audiences, from those that are niche to a broader audience of clients How to make programs more gender responsive and inclusive (for women); increasing staff awareness of gender responsivity and inclusion 240 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG De-escalation Use of technology, tech literacy, google suite of programs - development needs range from those with basic skills to those with advanced skills.

Efforts are targeted to reach potential responders and youth. Target Population: Adult potential responders and high school age youth living in Alameda County. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: 1,439 How Well Did We Do? II. Lang uage Capacity for this program: English 1 ,439 III. FY 20/21 Challenges: A major challenge was opening the year in distance learning. Towards the end of last Fiscal Year, we started to identify ways to engage youth and the knowledge that distance learning would continue was a driving force for staff to think creativ ely and strategically about how to engage students through new mediums so that we could provide outreach & information that was not only accessible to youth, but something they would actually access/engage in. Together with our Youth Advisory Board we incr eased our presence on Social Media platforms, started providing virtual workshops on relevant teen topics, and began ending our large campaigns with virtual Health Fairs that take place on non -synchronous learning days. Another challenge that we faced at t he beginning of the year was how to obtain evaluation feedback from participants now that services were virtual. We experimented with attaching incentives to the surveys and for classroom presentations, requesting that the teachers incorporate the survey a s a part of their \"exit tickets\" (end of class assignment). Having teachers provide the survey as an \"exit ticket\" was very successful in increasing the number of youth who completed the survey. Additionally, staff have been compiling a list of students w ho sign up for the workshops and then submitting a follow up email with appreciations, resources, and the survey. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Outreach efforts are focused on increasing youth's awareness of the mental health services at the health centers/telehealth. This includes how to identify the need in yourself or a peer, as well as how to refer and/or access the services. Our outreach even ts are focused on relevant teen mental health topics, with an emphasis on how youth can access support resources if they are impacted by any of these issues. Whether referred or seeking support on their own, youth who attend our virtual events or interact with our digital media are supported/provided written information about how to get linked to services whether it is through AFS or to an outside resource. We have continued producing the SBHC Snapshot, an interactive newsletter which included information a nd links to spread awareness of continued MH Services with SBHC and in the community with a highlight on crisis services COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES243 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG available, provide youth with important information on self -awareness of mental health status and strategies on how to prioritize self -care and their own mental health. Our outreach events and program helped improve access to services to a diverse population of youth across multiple schools that would otherwise be unaware and in some cases unable to obtain mental health support. By conduc ting outreach efforts in classrooms and through open virtual links, we provided information and resources directly to youth in a non -judgmental and easily accessible manner. Our outreach efforts also target school district and school site personnel who hav e relationships with all youth and can refer youth who would otherwise not seek services or support on their own. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: We plan to serve approximately the same number of students this upcoming year. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: The most significant change this year will be providing our services on-campus and in -person. Though we have a history of providing services in -person, the return to campus this year is impacted by the Delta variant. Once school resumes, we will be in communication with school administration, students, and our team about how to approach outreach events this academic year. 244 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG OUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD # OESD 34 PROVIDER NAME: East Bay Agency for Children (EBAC) PROGRAM NAME: School -based Behavioral Health : Castlemont Middle School, Castlemont High School and Roosevelt Middle School.

MHSA funding is being braided with Educationally Related Mental Health Services (ERMHS) and Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) funds to provide enhanced (non Medi -Cal billable) mental health services and supports to children in Counseling - Enriched Special Day Classes (CESDC) and two of its School Based Behavioral Health (SBBH) programs in OUSD in order to assist these children and their families in becoming successful in school and at home. Target Population: Youth attending Counseling -Enriched Special Day Classes (CESDC) and/or two of its School Based Behavioral Health (SBBH) programs in OUSD. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 20/21 a. Number of clients served: EBAC provided served a total of 6,165 unduplicated services to 26 clients (students enrolled ) throughout the 20 -21 school year within our Castlemont High and Roosevelt Middle school sites. At Castlemont, EBAC provided services to those who identified themselves as female, male, or transgendered while at Roosevelt services were provided to those who identified themselves as female or male. The total unduplicated services are within the following categories: Family and Caregiver Supports , School Culture and Climate , and Direct client related services and supports . How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: While the data we collected informed us that the primary language needs at Castlemont and Roosevelt are unknown for the 6,165 services, our services were predominately provided in English. Staff spoke with students, caregivers, and site staff in English wh en conducting services . III. FY 20/21 Challenges: 20-21 itself was a challenging year of being in -person, having to switch to online learning and re - entering the school sites during the last six weeks of instruction. During online learning, it was challenging to ensure o ur student's cameras in Zoom class were turned o n. Often times those who did not have their cameras turned on, decreas e in engagement and lack of social aspect with our students was documented. Those students who had difficulty engag ing in online learning also displayed inconsistency in attendance , causing inconsistency in services provided by EBAC. Additionally, p arent/ family contact on a consistent basis was a challenge . Due to the pandemic, several families shared feeling stressed and/or overwhelmed while juggling home life and work.

We ha d two male clients that have in the past really struggled with managing behavior. This included eloping, fighting, and inappropriate language most of the day. EBAC staff was able to give these clients more one to one attention, and mentorship, allowing for increased engage ment , motivation , and eager ness to learn. The last two marking periods they have earned 4.0 grades and made the principles list. Both said t hey are looking forward to in person learning, and continuing their success. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: One of our challenges this year has been related to data systems. Our team is working to ensure data is entered in atimely manner and county i s recieving the information correctly . There are a lot of \"unknowns\" in the data. The staff are only collecting what is in the Alameda County Survey Monkey so we do not have any data on Veteran Status, Sex at Birth, Disability, etc. VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: EBAC is not anticipating any changes to number of clients being served as there are no changes to the classroom size for the 21 -22 school year. This year we will c ontinue to partner with all available caregiver and co llateral supports for each student. VII. FY 2 1/22 Program or Service Changes: EBAC is happy to collaborate with new OUSD staff at Roosevelt Middle School. During this time, we are actively learning about the roles and responsibilities between EBAC and ne w OUSD staff but will continue collaborating on how to best support the clients and their families. EBAC continues to be flexible in providing services and working through COVID guidelines and restrictions with in -person services. Now that we are back in -person, there are more opportunities to work collaboratively with school staff to support client needs and connect with caregivers. 246 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG OUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD # OESD 34 PROVIDER NAME: Fred Finch Youth Center PROGRAM NAME: School -based Behavioral Health : Westlake Middle & High School, Montera Middle School, Oakland High School and Skyline High School Program Description: MHSA Braided funding for Expansion of School -Based Behavioral Health in the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD).

FY 20/21 Challenges: Challenges during this fiscal year have been the impact of COVID -19 and services moving to telehealth/ distant learning at all of the school sites. We found the most impact at our newest school site Life Academy as we started off in distant learning which was a barrier to build ing community with the school . This impacted clinicians' ability to support and provide services related to the climate and c ulture of the school and linkage to resources within the school community. We also found it challenging to support youth with life skills through telehealth services such as opening a ba nk account, applying for identification card, or learning to use public transportation.

This youth was a senior in high school and not on track to graduate. Our staff was able to prov ide this youth with space to engage with an adult to support them in completing classwork, learning how to track their assignments, and teach them study skills to support the youth with passing their classes.

III. FY 20/21 Challenges: MLK: Family engagement has been a consistent challenge during the pandemic. Many of the families are experiencing higher rates of stress due to COVID restrictions, remote learning from home, employment, housing, and mental health/wellness. The team hosted three parent support groups to provide families with resources and develop a sense of community and f amilies did not attend. The planning around the transition back to in person learning was a challenge, specifically balancing staffing concerns around health and safety protocols and student and family needs. McClymonds: Engagement pre -pandemic was a barrier to providing consistent client care for the majority of our student at McClymonds and this continued during the year of distance learning. Throughout the pandemic and with the retur n to in person learning in the s pring , staff struggled to engage students on a consistent basis. In fact, during the return to in person learning option in the spring, zero students enrolled in the CE/SDC class returned. For many families, the pandemic brought forth additional stressors relat ed to unemployment, stable housing, poverty, and maintaining their own physical and mental health on top of the ongoing systemic trauma they endure on a daily basis. Many families packed up and left the Bay Area to live with family as a short term solution ; however, for some the short term became permanent.

For many families, the pandemic brought forth additional stressors related to unemployment, stable housing, poverty, and maintaining their own physical and mental health on top of the ongoing systemic trauma they endure on a daily basis. Many families packed up and left the Bay Area to live with family as a short term solution; however, for some the sho rt term became permanent. Access to our high school students was limited and significantly impacted by access to working Chromebooks and sustainable internet. The relationships developed with our students became that of long distance relationship separated by a screen, and assessing the ongoing mental health of our students was an ongoing challenge. Howard: The planning around the transition back to in person learning, specifically balancing staffing concerns around health and safety protocols and student and family needs was a c onsistent challenge during the s pring. In addition, providing a consistent rotation of staff, both clinical and behavioral staff during the in person learning program was initially a challenge but once the staff were identified a consistent schedule was developed. Communication and coordination around health and safety protocols was inconsistent across school sites and challenging for parents to understand and follow. Is Anyone Better Off? V. FY 20/21 Client Impact: MLK: Despite the initial challenges of providing Chromebooks and supporting families with sustainable internet and crash courses in ZOOM, we engaged every student in the 3 -5 class and half of the students in the k -2 class during the distance learning era. We consistently provided group counseling and individual counseling via Telehealth and we joined Google classrooms or ZOOM classes on a daily basis. We welcomed back 3 of 4 students in the k -2 SDC class and 3 of 5 students in the 3 -5 SDC class for the in person learning program and their attendance was consistent for the last six weeks of school. We appreciated one student in the 3 -5 SDC class who graduated and will transition to middle school. The behavior team plans to continue providing services to students during ESY to generalize skill sets they learned in individual and group therapy to their community. There was consistent communication and collaboration with administration and school team regarding staffing and compliance with health and safety protocols. McClymond s: Despite the challenges, the students demonstrated resilience. Many of our seniors took part in senior events and graduation via ZOOM. Four students participated on a regular basis in group therapy via Telehealth. Despite the challenges, the Lincoln team and teacher continued to collaborate on a regular basis to plan, coordinate services for students who were engaged, and to plan for how to welcome back students in the fall. Skyline: Despite the challenges, the students demonstrated resilience. Many of ou r seniors took part in senior events and graduation via ZOOM. One of our graduating seniors was accepted into a seminary program as she pursues a career as a youth pastor. Howard: Despite the initial challenges of providing Chromebooks and supporting famil ies with sustainable internet and crash courses in ZOOM, we engaged on average six students each day during the distance learning era. We consistently provided group counseling and individual counseling via Telehealth and we joined Google classrooms or ZOO M classes on a daily basis. We welcomed back on average 4 -6 students in the class for the in person learning program for the last six weeks of school. Although attendance was not as consistent, 7 of 8 students returned for in person learning at some 250 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG point during the last 6 weeks of school. Despite a rotation of staffing, the students responded well and were able to remain engaged and safe with no incidents that required hands -on interventions. We appreciated one student in the class who be promoted to the n ew 4/5 I -CE/SDC classroom in the fall.

Language Capacity for this program: UE Coaches at CESDC/ICESDC utilize contracted agencies to provide in person/phone interpretation or translation as needed. Specific languages used and number of people served in each was not able to be tracked for FY 20/21. UE Clinicians at SBBH/ASCEND were bilingual in English and Spanish and able to provide services in both languages as needed. UE Clinicians additionally utilize contracted agencies to provide in person/phone interpretation or translation as needed. Specific languages used and number of people served in each was not able to be tracked for FY 20/21. III. FY 20/21 Challenges: Primary challenges in FY 20/21 centered around navigating and adjusting to remote learning and then back to in -person due to the COVID -19 global pandemic. During the beginning of the year, across all four school sites, there was extensive overwhelmin g experience by both teachers, as they were required to develop new curriculum and teaching plans, as well as students and families who were adjusting to new schedules and technologies. There was a steep learning curve felt by all in launching this school year virtually and this impacted planning, time management, motivation and engagement of the majority of the school community. As the year progressed and students, families and teachers became more familiar with online platforms and routines, additional ch allenges arose around finding time within the 252 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG new structures for Tier 2 and Tier 3 student supports. Even though all groups were adjusting and becoming more skilled at navigating remote learning, experiences of physical and social isolation were adding to the impact of the pandemic and \"Zoom fatigue\" was an increasing barrier to students' engagement in class and motivation for learning. Lastly, while the transition back to in person learning was a huge celebration and a beacon of hope for many, it was also another primary challenge for this year. Following a year of adjustments, school teams and families had little time for planning their transitions to in -person/hybrid learning while at the same time, managing the physical and emotional safety needs of stud ents and staff returning to their campuses following a year of separation. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: ASCEND Deliverable: Contractor shall provide family and caregiver services and support through parent and family engagement activ ities, 1 -2 times per month. UE clinicians worked with school administration through the first half of the year to design and offer parent support groups and workshops at ASCEND. During the 3rd quarter of the year, these were able to be offered for the firs t time, Parent/Caregiver Support Groups in both English and Spanish were offered to support caregivers with behavior management at home, offering tools during distance learning, and emotional support for caregivers themselves. Case Study: A parent who had participated on multiple occasions in the Parent/Caregiver Support Groups asked to stay after the group ended to \"check -in\" with the UE Clinicians (without other parents present). This mother was able to find the courage to share her deep concerns, fears, and anxieties about her child, or more importantly, about her challenges in knowing how to best support and guide her child. This parent spoke of her child as transgendered and was able to seek out assistance directly from the UE Clinicians about ways to deepen her understanding about her child's needs. UE Clinicians were able to brainstorm with this mother, suggest options for her child, share resources for her and offer ideas that were explored at length. UE Clinicians validated this mother's experience and discussed ways to find other parents possibly having similar experiences within the school community. UE Clinicians were able to offer suggestions on ways to manage specific challenges at home and offered continued support for mother in navigating a pa renting challenge that she was feeling unequipped to handle. This parent shared deep appreciation and stated that she felt validated, understood, and supported by UE Clinicians. She also shared relief that the UE Clinicians would be available to continue to support both her and her child. Sequoia Deliverable : Contractor shall support ongoing development and implementation of trauma - informed social- emotional learning curriculum into school -wide and classroom -based routines. UE coaches worked in collaboratio n with families, school administration and teachers to identify school wide social emotional needs. They developed and implemented SEL curriculum at the school level to address this and support schoolwide routines. Case Study : During family wellness check -ins, caregivers expressed a concern about student's connectedness and wellbeing. In response, the Unconditional Education coach collaborated with the school principal and after school staff to create a grade -level social- emot ional/wellbeing time called Squirrels' Treehouse. This is a recurring, once a month, 30 -minute community meeting where students can come, share, and connect with their peers and staff across grade -level. There has been high engagement, positive responses a nd feedback from students, and families have expressed that students COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES253 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG look forward to this time to engage with their peers and that this space is helpful in feeling a sense of connectedness to support their wellbeing. Prescott Deliverable: Contractor shall provide staff wellness activities ongoing through the development of initiatives that build camaraderie, promote self -care, and help staff to feel recognized, valued, and effective. The UE Coach collaborated with school leadership to create times and spac es to offer support for teachers regularly and throughout the year. The UE Coach offered individual and group spaces and activities for teachers' social emotional support, team building and connection and to celebrate successes. Case Study: At the start o f the year, there was a new teacher who was struggling to begin the year. New to the Prescott team and having to build relationships with families and students, all while designing online course curriculum and practices, the teacher sought additional welln ess support. The Seneca UE Coach supported this teacher in establishing a work/life balance skills and routines to build realistic expectations and reduce overwhelm. The UE coach supported the teacher through one -on-one consultation and organized small gro ups of her peers to support planning classroom management strategies, structures for use in the virtual setting and to build community with her fellow Prescott teachers. Over time, this teacher was able to successfully establish her classroom expectations and planning for the year and incorporate consistent time for individualized intervention and attention with students preparing for mainstream transitions. The teacher was also able to support and fully implement mainstream transitions for her ICEC student s into daily specialty classes (dance, music, gardening, and circus arts). Think College Now Deliverable: Contractor shall provide professional development workshops for school staff 3 -6 times annually. During the second half of the year The UE Coach wo rked with school administration to focus training and communication in support of active anti -racist work at TCN. The UE Coach supported development and delivery of PDs that incorporated re -envisioning the school's theory of action to better align with the anti-bias and anti -racism viewpoints amongst the staff. Case Study : As of the 3rd Quarter of the 2020 -21 school year there was only one black teacher at TCN. This teacher has expressed feelings of isolation, stereotyping and racial inequality during her s hort time at TCN. During a whole team conversation about race during a professional development workshop, this teacher expressed that she is finally feeling like she is building connections with her colleagues as well as feeling comfortable to advocate for herself and her students of color against traditional TCN practices that stem from white supremacy/fragility. This UE Coach collaborated with the principal to provide anti - bias/anti -racist trainings and shareable resources while also furnishing safe space for the staff to engage in courageous conversation about racism/white supremacy and how it shows up at TCN. This teacher described her gratitude for this Unconditional Education Coach and the Seneca partnership with TCN for, \"continuing to push the staff past their discomfort to uncharted territory that many schools are afraid to go to in order to do great work.\" V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: During our \"End of Year Partner Survey,\" we asked for feedback about how the impact of Seneca staff and part nerships have had on the school communities. Responses from staff at our partner programs indicate an appreciation for ongoing efforts to address staff and family wellness and to promote connection and community during this challenging year: \"[The partners hip] has a very positive impact on our community. I think our community has become more inclusive and people have become more aware of equity issues.\" \"The UE Coach's work on the cultural leadership team has brought many new ideas to campus.\" 254 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG \"The Seneca t eam was able to provide support in so many ways to individual students and teachers, as well as to the school as a whole, in ways that would not have been possible otherwise. The attention and care they were able to provide to students in need was invaluab le.\" \"The Seneca partnership helped immensely with their presence at our school on a daily basis, getting to know the students and vice versa. Our student population may have deficits or social issues or just needing an adult to give them that reassurance to be able to be the best they can be and show progress and confidence to their teachers and their peers.\" \"The Seneca partnership was very instrumental at creating a school culture that responded to the student/families that we serve. The partnership was critical in that culture/climate was not just the administration duty but a separate and functional branch of our school site. This way teachers and administration could focus on academics and Seneca took care of creating a structure of Social/Emotional l earning for our site.\" \"I've really appreciated the voices, perspectives and presence of the members of the [Seneca] team I'm acquainted with. Including their contributions to pushing the needle at our school on anti -racism and addressing anti -Blackness.\" VI. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: We project the number of students, parents/caregivers and school staff served to be approximately the same or decrease by 200 -300. This decrease could potentially reflect the shift back to majority in -person activities and events which would decrease the o verall attendance of some functions specifically related to client and caregiver counts. Student interactions may also decrease slightly as we find balance again between group online formats and individual supports. VII. FY 21/22 Program or Service Change s: We will no longer be providing MHSA funded support at one of the CESDC/ICESDC schools, Place at Prescott. Instead, the UE coach funded position will be in partnership with Oakland Academy of Knowledge (formerly Howard Elementary). We are currently in as sessment with our school partners to determine which contract deliverable will be the primary focus of this new partnership. While the overall goals will remain to build capacity of the whole school to provide trauma -informed, inclusive, and welcoming supp ort for CESDC/I -CESDC students and the entire student body, the specific activities may change depending on the needs of the school and student population.

Client's served: The staff at East Oakland Pride served roughly 49 unduplicated clients during the 2020 -2021 school year. How well did we do? II. Language capacity for this program and number of people served in each language: Our team at East Oakland Pride consists of 2 full time staff members and one part time staff member. Amongst the team, we have one bilingual (Spanish speaking) clinician. Of the youth served this school year, approximately 26 youth identified as Latinx a nd spoke Spanish or were bilingual (English/Spanish speaking). III. FY 20/21 challenges : Our clinicians had minimal access to the student body during the summer of 2020 and thus there were not many services provided during that time. MHSA services were not provided in August 2020 as clinicians were orienting to new school year and managing distance learning challenges. Early in the school year (August/September/October 2020) , coordinating with teaching staff and conducting family outreach virtually provided a challenge; however, the EOP clinicians and school administrators partnered to develop a system to better coordinate care, particularly when supporting and reaching out to families in crisis. We found that there was a need for more creative and flexible outreach approaches for students and families during shelter in place and distance learning. The EOP clinicians worked to establish more regular outreach to teaching staff and partnered to identify and offer more regularly scheduled groups. There continues to be a need for additional supports for Mam speaking families in the school community and we have not been able to find the resources to appropriately service them. We have been able to better serve undocumented families considering their fear of usi ng or applying for medi -cal by using MHSA funds. We have also faced some challenging with restarting our parent group during this past school year. We have offered virtual parent groups throughout the year but have not had any parents from East Oakland P ride participate. 256 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Is anyone better off? IV. FY 20/21 Client impact: Over the course of the school year, we have been able to provide individual and group support as well as crisis management for youth at East Oakland Pride. We were also able to provide in person support during the spring when youth returned to campus during the hybrid learning period. We provided Tier 1 and Tier 2 support to the school community to improve social emotional outcomes (Direct client services and support), by offering ongoing 1 :1 services to 10 youth, conducting a 3rd grade classroom workshop throughout the school year, and providing social skills and coping skills groups and virtual classroom push ins. We provided support for families in need (outreach to students and families ) by offering parent coaching sessions, family outreach, family meetings and family crisis support throughout the school year. We provided support to teachers/school staff through regular staff consultations and participation in COST meetings. Case studies/success stories : Throughout the school year, we provided an ongoing classroom workshop for one of the 3rd grade classrooms that was identified as having significant challenges. The class was experiencing struggles related to attendance/participati on, motivation, and social isolation. To support with these challenges, b eginning in November of 2020 , and continuing through the end of the school year , we provided an average of 2 workshops per month for the classroom (12 sessions total) . Our clinician provided strength -based play activities (sometimes to smaller groups in the class depending on needs/themes that week, though most often to the whole class) aimed at building community amongst the students, fostering social interaction, strengthening comm unication, and increasing emotional identification and class motivation. The class was able to achieve regular attendance during the school year (19 -25 students present daily), increased class engagement and participation, increased group cohesion, and st rengthened ability to communicate needs and emotional experiences. Another notable example involved one on one support for a 2nd grader. This youth was referred due to angry outbursts, persistent irritability that impacted his relationships with peers an d staff, and frequent \"shutting down\" in class. Our clinician provided 1:1 support during the last few of mo nths of the school year, teaching him skills to build awareness of his anger cues and triggers as well as supporting him with building a coping ski lls toolkit. By the end of the school year, he increased insight into his anger triggers, regularly used breathing exercises to manage anger, and learned healthy and safe ways of expressing anger. He was more present and engaged in class, and though the full impact on his interactions with peers was unclear, it was believed that he was less irritable during social interactions. He reported enjoying the support, and the plan is to invite him to participate in MHSA groups in the Fall to further support th e enhancement of his social skills and relationships. V. FY 20/21 Additional information : While we are able to provide support for our Spanish speaking families with the assistance of our full -time bilingual clinician, we still lack resources to support the fairly large Mam speaking population at the school. Any resources the county is aware of to provide translation support for these families would be most helpful. VI. FY 21/22 Projections of client s to be served : As school has resumed in person instruction, w e anticipate reaching a larger group of youth this school year.

FY 20/21 Challenges: The lack of adequate and accessible mental health supports in certain languages is concerning, with the increased number of clients disclosing mental health issues and an anticipated wave of new clients seeking support. Uncertainty regarding vaccines and mask wearing are making some clients stressed. Financial and COVID -related stressors make it diffic ult for families to focus on anything other than their basic needs. Families have increased concerns for their children's mental health and behavior challenges. Clients experiencing loss are hesitant to discuss their grief. Technology barriers impact clients' access to mental health and other services and limit social connections. With many county offices closed, many families have difficulty accessing services. Our staff also continue to work remotely, but we have made acce ss easier by devoting time to assist clients in how to use technology. We also have a drop box where clients can deliver documents. Anxiety and uncertainty when raising children, who many times have been left alone with no socialization, increased. Is Any one Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: Staff helped clients feeling stressed about socialization after COVID restrictions were lifted by offering coping strategies. Staff also shared up -to-date recommendations and news to ease families' concerns and a ddress misinformation. Clients passed this on to their families and social networks - an invaluable asset, as hearing these messages from someone in their own circle is highly effective. Staff also used motivational interviewing to identify potential areas for further education and intervention. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES259 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG There were 132 Protective Factors Surveys (PFS) completed, with 90 showing an improvement in one domain. We had 140 completed satisfaction surveys and following is a summary of results: 100% reported that the suppo rt they received form EBAC was helpful, 100% reported that the support EBAC provided was the right approach for them, 100% reported that they liked the EBAC staff member(s) that worked with them, 100% reported that the EBAC program/staff was respectful of their family background and language, and 98% reported that it was very easy or easy to get services at this program. There was no feedback on how the program could be improved. The feedback on what the program did well varied from being pleased to receive service in their language, grateful for being enrolled into Medi- Cal, no longer having to worry about how to pay for a health insurance premium, staff are knowledgeable, and staff are helpful. Case study: Staff helped a mother whose abusive husband aband oned the family. The client lost her job due to a misunderstanding and had no other revenue. She was highly stressed and worried about paying rent. Our staff linked the client to legal resources, referred her to counseling and other services, and assisted her in applying for food stamps and health insurance. The client shared that the support she received helped her to become resourceful and strong for her children. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: We learned much about implementing new data and service systems. There were changes made in our database that had unintended consequences. Rolling out new systems takes time and patience as staff adjust to new procedures while simultaneously meeting clients' needs. Also, wellness checks, while important, are t ime consuming and draining for staff. It was their tendency to want to check in with everyone at once, but some structure was important so that they could remain present with families, especially with emotions so high for all involved. We learned to give staff structure about how to spend their time each day so that they could appropriately pace themselves. We also learned the importance of the staff/client contact to reduce client isolation. Clients expressed gratitude that staff took the time to do the we ll checks, especially in their own language. Assisting clients with how to use technology is key to helping families feel connected and informed. VI. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: 1,000 outreach and education contacts . VII.

The program met this deliverable which resulted in the six new projects: 1) POCC Black Men Speak: First time Annual FERC REACH Racial Trauma Community event; 2) Oakland Promise - Ongoing Mental Health for Youth Series with FERC ; 3) Delta Sigma Theta Bay Area Sorority Chapter: new Annual Mental Health Townhall for the Black Community (collaboration with FERC) ; 4) Amazon Employees Worldwide: Annu al November Mental Health Forum ; 5) Union City Family Center (UCFC) - FERC now leads an African American Family Members' Monthly Support Group ; 6) First Annual FERC Community Resource Fair - Held virtually with 10 CBOs and 4 NAMI Alameda County Chapters . The program exceeded this deliverable with 13 virtual outreach and engagement activities, a 50% increase from the prior fiscal year. The program provided 45 virtual peer and social support groups throughout the year . : The program partnered with OFE to recr uit and train 5 Spanish Speaking volunteers to lead Parent Cafes in Spanish for Family Member/Caregivers (Outreach/Engagement); The program recruited 3 volunteers for: 1) CIT training, the Consumer Perspective; 2) for Lunch Hour presentations on Mental Hea lth/Diagnoses and Medications and 3) for Peer/Social Support Group COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES261 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG programming (for Family Members and their Loved Ones): FERC Friday Bingo group . The program held 10 virtual monthly support groups throughout the year (covering all four regions of the coun ty). Client Story #1: Our Family Advocate had a Family Member whose Loved One (daughter) had been homeless for two years, diagnosed with schizoaffective and SUD. The Family Member called the FERC Warmline because her daughter was at John George on a 5150. Our Family Advocate (F A) helped the Family Member fill out an AB1424, and the FA reached out to BACS. The Family Member reported that her daughter was adamant that as soon as she would be discharged from the hospital, she would be back on the streets, and was insistent that she did not want any help. With the support of the FA, the Family Member was able to get additional family members involved; the FA spoke to a cousin who was close with the Family Member 's daughter. The cousin was able to convince their LO to go to Amber House. The Family Member 's daughter has had some ups and downs since, but the family is more prepared now, and the FA speaks with the Family Member frequently to check in, support her self -care and answer questions. The Daughter has recently moved into a boa rd and care, and the Family Member says she is doing well. Client Story #2: Our Family Advocate (FA) had a Family Member who called the Warmline because he was having difficulties with his Loved One (son) who was experiencing first time symptoms of psych osis. His Loved One did not believe he had a mental health condition and the Family Member didn't know what to do. The FA provided the Family Member with resources such as crisis support, IHOT, AB1424. Subsequently the Family Member called crisis support d uring an episode with his Loved One and they were able to diffuse the crisis situation and prevent another 5150. While the Family Member had all the resources he needed, he still needed emotional support. The FA was in contact with him for over 3 months of fering emotional support, encouraging him to join support groups for Family Members (FERC and NAMI), coaching him in his own self -care, educating him about mental illness, how it can impact a Loved One and their Family Member. The FA provided the Family Me mber with a variety of ways he could talk to his son about mental health. The Family Member called to tell his FA that he had had an extensive, frank, and compassionate conversation with his son about mental health and that his son was opening to the idea that he is living with a SMI. The Family Member shared that his Loved One had started working with a psychiatrist and was successfully ta king his prescribed medications. The Family Member reported to the FA that this had brought them closer together; later , the Family Member proudly shared that he and his Loved One had achieved a milestone by going on a first vacation together. Client Story #3: Our Family Advocate (FA) had a Vietnamese speaking -only Family Member who did not know what to do about her Love d One (husband) who was having increasing signs of depression, aggression, and psychosis. The Family Member was also concerned about the safety of her family. FERC was her first introduction to mental health. The FA explained to the Family Member what ment al health was, how it can impact a person and a family. The FA discussed ways in which the Family Member could protect her family and ways in which she could take care of herself as a caregiver. The FA also helped bring in the Family Member's relatives to increase the Family Member's safety. The FA suggested that she work with the Family Member's children so that everyone could be on the same page. With this in place, the Family Member is now in a safe place with a supportive network and her family now kno ws what to do during a crisis. Although their Loved One continues to struggle with anosognosia, the family 262 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG is able to recognize the negative effects of stigma and is developing resilience as they strive to support their Loved one and move him towards ongoi ng treatment. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: The program experienced four trends that may be pandemic related and possibly attributed to the increase in individuals experiencing mental health conditions and social isolation: FERC experienced a 57% in crease in Warm Line calls in FY 2020 -21 (when compared to FY 2019 -20); the program experienced a 60% increase in monthly Support Group offerings; the weekly Peer/Social support group: FERC Bingo Fridays for Family Members and their Loved Ones experienced a 45% increase in participants when compared to FY 2019 -20; out of the 8 categories of needs -based resources requested for by the program's Parent Caf\u00e9 participants across the year, the top two were: #1, Mental Health Resources and #2, Support Groups for M oms and Dads. A final significant trend became apparent in the monthly CIT training program in which there was an increase in the participation of officers from jurisdictions outside Alameda County. Across the year, 48% of the officers in attendance worked in Alameda County jurisdictions and 52% worked in jurisdictions outside the county (33% from other Bay Area jurisdictions and 19% from jurisdictions outside the Bay Area - as far north as Tahoe County and as far south as Kern County). VI. FY 2 1/22 Projections of Clients to be Served : The agency (and FERC program) is committed to an ongoing process of adopting and engaging in actions focused on long term change to address the issue of racism, white privilege and the resulting systemic inequalities f or African Americans and people of color. In FY 2020 -21 the agency contracted a Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) specialist to: assess all agency policies and practices; to conduct a listening campaign utilizing focus groups (Affinity Group Listening S essions) to hear from all staff on how policies and practices are perceived and received. Themes related to racism and race issues, with a focus on the experience of equity, inclusion and diversity were collected. The report will be provided to agency empl oyees in early FY 2021 -22 and will provide information on readiness, data, themes and recommendations for policy, practice, and organizational improvement. The agency also sent over 500 Client Satisfaction Surveys out in FY 2020 - 21. The results indicated t hat 95% of MHAAC clients strongly agreed/agreed that working with the program helped them understand their own mental health needs or their loved one's mental health needs. 100% of MHAAC clients strongly agreed/agreed that they received services or support s in their preferred language. 92% of MHAAC clients strongly agreed/agreed that their Advocate or Family Partner provided them with the resources they needed, and 93% of MHAAC clients strongly agreed/agreed that they would refer their family and friends to the Mental Health Association of Alameda County.

Number of clients served: 139 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: the RTT treatment has staffing that fluent in both English and Spanish, and had no barriers to providing services to partners with the language of choice. In addition, Bacs has invested in a language line service, in the event any partner is referred and needing services translated in a language that our current staffing can not provide. III. FY 20/21 Challenges : As the program continue to provide services through the pandemic their were challenges around engagement, and connecting partners to community resources. Many of our partnerships closed their doors during the pandemic, which limited the programs ability to connect to supports such as: social service s, social security, day programs, feeding programs and AA/NA groups. In addition, housing resources became very scarce during this fiscal year, as many landlords stopped new tenants from leasing or reduce bed availability to try and combat with the spread of covid, as a result, affected program outcomes to permanent housing. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: During this fiscal year, we saw a decrease in hospitalizations and incarcerations. On average, less than 2 hospitalizations or incarc erations occurred per month. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: there was an increase of partners meeting with RTT psychiatry services than the previous fiscal year. Due to Covid related matters, staffing was also challenging to navigate, as we had staffing that needed to stop working to be with family or address their own matters related to C OVID -19. 264 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG VI. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served : We project to serve between 100 -140 partners collectively between both cohorts during this physical year. As the programs ramp up from adjustments during covid, we project to see an increase in census as mandates are lifted. VII. FY 21/22 Program or Service Changes: We will continue to build staffing for the program, and increase community engagements this fiscal year. We are prioritizing strategy to increase psychiatry services within the program in hopes to reduce partners need to access services from multiple providers and make their ability remain connected easier to manage.

The program pairs clinical staff with peer case managers with lived experience in systems impact from the criminal justice system to meet the broad range of client needs. The program uses an eighteen month \"critical time intervention\" -based framework, providing intensive services and wraparound resources during the initial stabilization phase and then transitions the client to community care and supports.

Number of clients served: 49 How Well Did We Do? II. Language Capacity for this program: RTT served 49 clients in English. III. FY 20/21 Challenges : The COVID -19 pandemic safety measures posed challenges to program implementation, particularly in the early part of the fiscal year (prior to vaccination access). The limited capacity to have in -person interactions between staff and clients led to some challenges in rapport building, as well as challenges in completing tasks in a timely manner (i.e. documentation , clinical staff assess ing over the phone was a significant challenge and as a result, they took longer to complete the initial and annual assessments ). Additionally, prior to increased vaccination rates, staff were not able to transport clients to important appointments; this r esulted in a slowing down of progress on some of the clients' case management goals. RTT's support services budget appeared to decrease significantly from the previous fiscal year - this decrease limited our ability to help clients with their housing, bas ic needs, etc. Additionally, with a more limited support services budget, we have not been able to offer as many milestone incentives to keep clients engaged in the treatment program , due to prioritizing the funds for basic needs. Many RTT clients present to treatment as resistant to the recommendation to participate in a psychiatric assessment. Clients report a variety of reasons as to why they do not want to be involved with a psychiatrist - for example: they report a negative history of psychiatric treat ment; they state that they do not want to be dependent on medication , etc. Clients may earn $30 for participation in a psychiatric evaluation. However, many clients still refuse to consider it as an option. Perhaps if the milestone incentive were greater t han $30, we would see more clients be open to meeting with a psychiatrist and get them in the door and get the information directly from the doctor. Over the past year, we had a number of clients who completed the maximum time allotted for treatment with R TT but continued to require ongoing support and treatment. RTT staff have reported a common experience of referring clients for ongoing care via ACCESS 266 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG and having the clients report to them that the treatment they were referred to was not sufficient to mee t their needs. These clients appeared to struggle to engage with their new provider, and RTT staff were not able to refer these clients for a higher level of care, rather, ACCESS stated that any referral must come from the treatment team the client was al ready referred to. The problem then becomes the refusal of former RTT clients to engage further with new treatment team, and therefore not get the referral to the higher level of care that they seem to require. RTT staff have reported a feeling of overall frustration with the system and that these clients - despite the significant progress made while with RTT - may end up decompensating. Unfortunately, RTT clients do occasionally recidivate and end up incarcerated after they have commenced treatment with us (often due to probation violations or other more minor infractions). When this happens, it is common for the clients to be incarcerated for a few days to a few weeks (and RTT will hold their spot for them, so long as it is not a prolonged incarceration - i.e., months or more). During this challenging time, clients appear to really appreciate and rely on the supportive relationships that they have created with RTT staff. Clients will reach out to RTT staff and ask to have phone calls and/or video visits. T hese visits are often not free, and the clients do not have the resources to pay for them. This creates a situation where RTT staff have to decide to engage with a client who is asking for support, or pay for the visit and not get reimbursed (i.e., RTT sta ff cannot bill any services for clients when they are in a locked -out setting, such as Santa Rita Jail). Supervisor/Leadership work hard to navigate these tricky waters and ensure that staff and clients are appropriately cared for, but it is a challenge t hat continues to come up. RTT is contracted for 1 FTE clinician and 2 FTE peer counselors. Unfortunately, RTT has struggled to fill the second peer counselor position since our lead peer counselor took a leave and then resigned late in the fiscal year. De spite being short -staffed, RTT staff continue to support our clients with their case needs. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Impact: RTT is a voluntary program, and while individuals referred to our program are often prompted to do so at the reco mmendation/urging of Probation, getting clients to engage is often the first challenge that staff will encounter. In the past fiscal year, once we were able to schedule/have the client show up for their intake, staff were very successful in engaging client s initially in treatment - in fact, over 90% of new RTT clients had two or more treatment sessions within the first 30 days of admission. Unfortunately, we do see some clients drop off after this first month. Our clinical and case management staff collabo rate well to help clients identify and start making progress towards case management goals as soon as they are open to RTT. A good number of RTT clients were successfully linked with Prop 47 housing funds, and/or they were connected to the Hayward Annex fo r housing assistance, and/or staff were able to successfully apply for COVID -related rent relief on behalf of clients. Clients in need of support regarding employment were referred to - and connected with - the Reentry Employment Program or Prison -to-Emplo yment Program (within La Familia), or to employment services through BOSS, or - in the case of a couple clients late in the fiscal year - clients were connected with the trucking program we recently became aware of called FreeWorld. Throughout the challeng ing year, RTT staff continued to provide basic needs to clients , such as delivering food, other basic necessities, and gift cards to support client access food and transportation. Client Story: a 29-year -old Mexican -American male was referred to RTT by his Probation Officer. The client was initially referred to the Reentry Employment Program, but the client stated that he was not ready to work until/unless his mental health symptoms were better controlled. Th e client reported ongoing and COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES267 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG significant audio and visual hallucinations. The client also disclosed a history of depersonalization episodes and stated that he was experiencing one of these episodes when he picked up his most recent charge (a sexual offens e). The client stated that he is terrified of pain but that he never wants to be alive - he stated that he has made plans in the past to kill himself, but that he was \"not strong enough to do it.\" In addition to the client's psychotic symptoms, he reported ongoing anxiety, panic attacks, severe social anxiety, and symptoms consistent with a mood disorder (manic episodes followed by severe depression). The client also disclosed regular methamphetamine and marijuana use. When the client commenced treatment, h e was on the verge of being kicked out of his parents' home. Due to the severity of the client's initial symptoms, the client's RTT clinician met with him twice a week during the assessment phase. The client's clinician was able to help connect the client with a psychiatrist for a psychiatric evaluation. RTT staff linked the client to The Bread Project (a program focused on cooking skills - food prep and baking). The client successfully completed the program and reported that he is happy when he is cooking and identifies it as a new self -care/coping tool. RTT staff also worked closely with the client's Probation Officer and parents and were able to get the client admitted to a Dual Diagnosis residential treatment program in Alameda County. In the nearly 5 mo nths that the client has been in that treatment setting - while continuing to stay connected to both his RTT clinician and peer counselor - the client has reported a sharp decline in nearly all of his problematic mental health symptoms. The client reported that he has a strong friendship with his roommate in treatment - identified as the first real friend he has ever had. Also of note, the client has been able to sustain this longest period of sobriety from methamphetamines (outside of incarceration). RTT s taff are working to help the client successfully transition out of his Dual Diagnosis treatment program within the coming months - the client and his current roommate are supportive of each other and are interested in finding a place together and the clien t has even expressed an interest in finding employment. The mental health treatment and case management support provided by RTT staff, along with the collaboration with the client's Dual Diagnosis residential treatment provider, have led the client to beco me increasingly independent and his overall functioning has improved significantly. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: Housing continues to be the primary and most urgent case management need for clients. RTT staff work hard to link clients to any -and-all resources available within the county, but if we were able to help financially as well (e.g., with a deposit and first months' rent to get clients going, etc.), that would be significant. The times when we have been able to get clients connected to housing quickly are when we see faster and more sustained success. Our current support services budget allows us to support clients with approximately $100 per month (for all basic needs), and does not afford us the capability to help more directly with housing . RTT clients are high need clients; we have 1 FTE clinician who often ends up being stretched thin to meet the significant demands of clients. If we were able to have 2 FTE clinicians to go with our 2 FTE peer counselors, we would be much better equipped to serve our clients while avoiding staff burn out and turnover. VI. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served : For the upcoming fiscal year, we plan to be fully staffed and to subsequently be able to increase our caseload to maintain an average of 40 clients. VII. FY 21/22 Program or Service Changes: We hope to be able to continue to increase our ability to provide in -person support for clients (RTT staff are all vaccinated and will continue to offer resources to client who have questions about - or want to access - the COVID -19 vaccine). RTT staff have been trained on the Alameda County Care Connect Community Health Record and will be encouraged to utilize the platform . 268 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG How Much Did We Do?

FY 20/21 Challenges: Our full staff worked remotely for the entire FY, with the exception of a small team of in -office staff who showed up daily to sort and hand out mail, and our exceptional outreach Team who helped us connect with SSI/SSDI clients in enc ampments and other places when they couldn't come to us. We moved our drop -in legal services, intakes, and client referrals to phone, mail, and email. The subset of our clients or would -be clients whose disabilities and/or housing status make those meth ods of communication challenging are already the ones who face the largest hurdles in the Social Security disability application process. With the extra barrier of not being able to drop in and complete an intake or reach their attorney without a scheduled appointment, some of them fell off our radar entirely. 47 of our BHCS -funded cases were closed when the clients disappeared. Visits to the jail were discontinued, so our strategy with those referrals changed as well, to the jail's short -session videoconf erence system. We made an effort to reach out to all jail clients referred to us, even if the circumstances normally wouldn't merit an SSI application, because they were so isolated at the jail during COVID It was in many ways easier to reach clients than when we had to physically travel to the jail, but because the paperwork had to travel separate from the interview, it was more difficult to get a claim started. Social Security claims processing slowed considerably. Cases where there was not enough medical evidence for a favorable decision had been on hold for months as the fiscal year started, waiting for a remote hearing or remote exam to be scheduled, a process in which all but the most obviously disabled clients did not get a reasonable timeline or the same chances of convincing a decision maker of their need for benefits. Clients, like everyone, tended to avoid healthcare settings if not having COVID symptoms, so building a record of disability was more difficult. We worked with our evaluating psychologists to try to bridge this gap, but it took them a while to pivot to remote exams. Phone exams would allow only a fraction of the usual battery of exams to be given, and although by July we had two psychologists providing remote video exams via Teams, but it was initially only available to clients with their own phone or computer to participate. At this writing, phone and video exams and phone and video hearings are still the only options for our clients. Is Anyone Better Off? IV. FY 20/21 Client Im pact: Our clients enjoyed over 80 favorable disability determinations in the fiscal year, despite the severe slowdown of decisions that resulted from SSA's operational changes in the pandemic. Another three cases had favorable outcomes without a disability determination: we helped a client obtain proof of birth to qualify for age related benefits, helped another stop an SSA overpayment from lowering his monthly benefits, and one client became employed to the extent she no longe r needed or qualified for disability benefits. Case Study: We appreciate most the stories where a client is initially suspicious or otherwise not comfortable with HAC or the services we provide. Because of the nature of disability claims - long and 270 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG quite personal the relationships we have with clients often change over time. Mrs G. had a severe and longstanding personality disorder, diagnosed as early as grade school according to her records. Her 'maladaptive' patterns of interaction had remained stable over time, and like many with her diagnosis she had held a number of jobs, but none for long. She did not see her own part in the loss of jobs or relationships, but by the time she reached us she had seen so many relationships with employe rs, friends, family, and service providers end badly that she had no reason to think it would work out any differently with HAC. Her attorney's position was, \"Yes, she is difficult to work with. And she's not going to like me, but I'm going to get her on disability anyway, because she deserves my help as much as anyone.\" And she did. Her attorney, R, gathered all her medical records as soon as their initial meeting was over and obtained a detailed letter of diagnosi s from her treating provider. She submitted these and earned the ultimate success for the client, a win at the initial stage of the process. No disappointing denial, no length appeals. Mrs. G. knew that most people were denied at the initial stages of the process, and seemed almost pleased, but continued to have a distrustful and antagonistic relationship with her attorney even as they went to the Social Security office to finish the claim and start her benefits rolling. With her first check, Mrs. G, who ha d been living in her car, rented a hotel room for a week to shower and rest comfortably. However, her small dog that lived in the car with her was not allowed, and threatened to get her kicked out of the hotel. R. offered to look after the dog while Mrs. G stayed in the hotel. It was not part of her job, but she loved dogs and wanted to help Mrs. G. Mrs. G. distrustfully accepted. She came to the office each day to visit her dog, making sure the dog was cared for, and admonishing R for various things. On th e last day of the stay, well -rested with her dog intact and seemingly happy, she presented R with a greeting card, containing a sincere thank you message written inside. It was completely out of character, and as such it was incredibly touching for all of us, especially R. V. FY 20/21 Additional Information: N/A VI. FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: This depends on the rate at which Social Security decides cases and the portion of those decisions that are favorable. It's hard to project this because of continuing pandemic impacts, but based on the past two years we would expect to serve a minimum of 400 clients. That includes approximately 250 cases still pending from the past FY, and new cases up to our maximum capacity under this contract of 560 rolling. VII.

III.FY 20/21 Challenges: The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic presented significant challenges to service delivery in FY 20/21, particularly in ways the pandemic affected communication with clients. For instance, clients often rely on public libraries or other public spaces \u2014which were closed for months \u2014to access their email. USPS delays in processing mail particularly affected homeless clients who use General Delivery and made obtaining necessary signatures more difficult. Clients sometimes do not have a stable address, move in and out of Santa Rita Jail or medical facilities, and experience periods of homelessness. All of these issues slowed services and d elayed communications between staff and clients. The closure of Social Security Administration (SSA) offices due to the pandemic also presented a unique set of challenges. BayLegal staff effectively transitioned to submitting most documents to SSA electro nically. However, the SSA field offices are understaffed, the offices are generally closed to the public except for limited appointments, and hearings were held virtually. Clients have the right to an in - person hearing, so they had to consent to a virtual hearing to progress their case. BayLegal worked with clients to ensure they could attend virtual hearings and brought clients into the Oakland office as needed to attend hearings in special conference rooms retrofitted to comply with all safety protocols. Despite these challenged, staff continued to obtain positive outcomes for clients, including initial approvals, successful virtual hearings, on the record decisions, Appeals Council and federal court remands, and effective policy advocacy with SSA and CDSS.

BayLegal's ACBH contract, Section IV Contract Deliverables and Requirements sets the following goal: achieve an SSI/SSDI allowance rate at least equal to that of the national average approval rate. In the SSI Annual Statistical Report, 2019, the national 2 018 allowance rate was 43.5%.4 BayLegal's FY 20/21 allowance rate for closed cases was 73%. BayLegal successfully accomplished this goal. The client story below illustrates the work funded by this grant. *Client name changed to protect confidentiality: Quondra D.* was living in temporary housing but was not in a supportive environment. After an incident, she was arrested and sent to Santa Rita Jail. BayLegal had previously helped Quondra obtain SSI benefits and her attorney once again stepped in to help he r obtain benefits once she was released. Quondra's attorney worked with her social worker and the Public Defender's Office to determine her release date and set up housing and other social services. Quondra's attorney reviewed medical and eligibility docum ents and filed for SSI benefits. When Quondra was released, BayLegal and her social worker had already set up housing for her and connected her with Bay Area Community Services Homeless Engagement Action Team to provide further support. Quondra's SSI application was approved with nearly $5,000 in back payments covering the time from when she was released to when her application was approved. Quondra is now in a supportive environment, is stably housed, and is able to take care of herself. V. FY 20/21 Add itional Information: Cases with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) are generally moving more slowly due to the ongoing pandemic. SSA and DDS are both understaffed and SSA field offices are generally closed to the public. Cases with DDS are sometimes stalled awaiting a consultative examination that DDS staff has been unable to schedule due to the lack of in -person appointments, or client or clinician objections to an in-person appointment. Despite these challenges, BayLegal continued to advocate for its clients. In part with BayLegal's advocacy, SSA established \"vulnerable population liaisons\" in field offices to help facilitate applications and address barriers to processing claims, appeals , appointment of representative, and other forms as part of SSA's COVID workgroup. In September, SSA plans to roll out a new online tool to make it easier to establish a protective filing date or application lead similar to California's GetCalFresh.org tool. BayLegal hopes that these changes will increase service access for its clients and result in more benefit 4 This is the latest national allowance rate published directly by the Social Security Administration. https:/ /www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_asr/2019/ssi_asr19.pdf.

FY 21/22 Projections of Clients to be Served: BayLegal estimates the number of clients to be served in FY 21 -22 to be approximately 300. Clients will be represented at all stages of SSI/SSDI applications, and staff will advocate for clients with SSA and DDS. VII. FY 21/22 Program or Service Changes: Due to the ongoing pandemic, in -person services have shifted to remote whenever possible. The Oakland office is open on a limited basis for walk -in clients. The SSI/SSDI advocacy project is supported by a remote attorney of the week who calls back clients looking for assistance. The attorney of the week screens for eligibility and merit, provides advice or brief service as needed, and adds clients to the referral list for representation. PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION275 TOP HEADER MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Prevention and Early Intervention |\"IT TAKES A VILLAGE\" \u0003 The Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) services embrace a preventative approach that engage individuals before the development of mental illness, and provid es services to intervene early to reduce negative mental health symptoms so as to reduce prolonged suffering. PEI services emphasize the de velopment, implementation, and promotion of strategies that are non-stigmatizing and non-discrimina tory.1 PEI programs create partnerships with unserved and underserved ethnic and linguistically isolated communities, schools, the justice system, primary care and a wide range of social, wellness, cultural and spiritual support services and community groups. Services are centrally located where people receive and participate in routine health care, wellness, leisure, educational, recreational, faith, and spiritual healing . PEI Plan Requirements : The PEI Community Planning Process requires local stakeholders to recognize the following parameters for this funding stream: All ages must be served and at least 51% of the funds must serve children and youth ages 0 - 25 years; Disparities in access to services for underserved ethnic communities must be addressed; All regions of the county must have access to services; Early intervention should generally be low -intensity and short duration; Early intervention may be somewhat higher in intensity and longer in duration for individuals experiencing first onset of psychosis associated with serious mental illness. Service Requirements : Individuals at risk of or indicating early signs of mental il lness or emotional disturbance and links them to treatment and other resources. 2 PEI strategies & Approaches: Outreach to families, employers, primary care health providers, and others to recognize the early signs of potentially severe and disabling mental illness. The goal is to catch mental health issues in their earliest stages to prevent long -term suffering. Access and linkage to medically necessary care...as early in the onset of these conditions Reduction in stigma and discrimination associated with either being diagnosed with a mental health condition or seeking mental health services (MHSA, Section 4, Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) \u00a7 5840(b). Promote wellness, foster health, and prevent the suffering that can result from untreated mental illness. Referral Process: Non-clinical PEI programs receive clients through provider outreach and engagement. Outreach is based on location , service geography, staffing capacity , cultural needs , and preferences of the target populations. Outcomes: PEI programs focus on reducing seven negative outcomes that may result from untreated mental illness: suicide, incarceration, school failure or dropout, unemployment, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and removal of children from their homes 1 Proposition 63: Mental Health Services Act 2004 2 MHSOAC PEI Fact Sheet, December 2017 Prevention & Early Intervention (PEI) Program Summaries \"It Takes A Village\" 276 PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Organized activities that the County undertakes to prevent suicide as a consequence of mental illness without focus on or intended outcomes for at-risk individuals.

The program was designed as an innovat ive approach to integrate mental health prevention and early intervention strategies into the Public Health Department's maternal child health and early childhood home visiting programs. These strategies allow home visiting/family support programs to have access to perinatal mental health service providers and segway program participants into an Early Childhood Mental Health Sysytem of Care as needed. It is an opportunity to bridge and provide mental health services to public health program participants and allow Behavioral Health Services to serve and support a target population that has few resources for such a critical time in their life span.

The BSMWT also provided a link with Beverly Kyer, Trauma Specialist, who provided meditation workshops and information sessions for MPCAH staff to attend who were working in the face of COVID traumas. The team offered support to the MPCAH Home Visiting SOC for all deployed staff for 6 months. The BSMWT additionally kept active caseloads. The team manager also engaged in the process of hiring three new behavioral health clinicians via the Alameda Healthy Start Initiative grant and there were numerous interviews conducted to hire new staff. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. I learned that working through a pandemic dramatically changed the focus of the team working in a large public health care system based on departmental needs. Team members need and require d more effective/supportive supervision meetings during pandemic times. Hiring and incorporating new team members and blending a team can be challenging. Pandemic can impact service delivery as home visiting models cease and virtual and teletherapy began . Clinicians had to adjust to this new format. Clients still sought early childhood mental health service during crisis times .

These strategies are implemented through a variety of services, including one-on-one outreach events; psycho -educational workshops/classes; mental health consultation sessions with a variety of stakeholders (e.g., families, teachers, faith community, and community leaders); support groups; traditional healing workshops; radio/television/blogging activities; and short -term, low-intensity early intervention counseling sessions for individuals and families who are experiencing early signs and symptoms of a mental health concern. Alameda County is an incredibly diverse population of over 1.5 million people. To address its diversity, Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBH) has contracted thirteen programs to provide culturally responsive Mental Health PEI services to state -identified underserved populations . This evaluation report was provided in coordination and partnership with Alameda County Behavioral Health and the Unserved/Underserved Ethnic Language Population (UELP) programs and their community partners: Afghan Coalition Korean Community Center of the East Bay Asian Health Services La Clinica de la Raza Bay Area Community Health Native American Health Center Center for Empowering Immigrants & Refugees Partnerships for Trauma Recovery Diversity in Health Training Institute Portia Bell Hume Center Filipino Advocates for Justice Richmond Area Multi -Service, Inc. International Rescue Committee In 2014, Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) worked with seven Unserved/Underserved Ethnic Language Population (UELP) programs to develop and administer an outcome -based survey. The survey was administered again in 2015. The outcome -based survey was revised in 2016 and separated into two different data tools - the UELP Community Health Assessment and the UELP Community Wellness C lient Satisfaction Survey. Each of the UELP providers vetted and implemented the new tools in 2017.

This report is about the 20 20/202 1 evaluation . The health assessment and satisfaction surveys were disseminated to the UELP community in 23 different languages including English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Khmer, Nepali, Korean, Thai, and Burmese and covered the following outcomes: Forming and strengthening identity; Changing knowledge and perception of mental health; Building community and wellness; Connecting individual and family with their culture; Improving access to services and resources; Transforming mental health services . All UELP providers offer services in two main categories: 1) Prevention services, for clients who are at higher than average risk of developing a significant mental illness and 2) Preventive Counseling (PC) services, designed for clients who are showing early signs and symptoms of a mental health concern. Responses to the client satisfaction survey were analyzed separately for Prevention and PC services to measure any differences between the two types of services. The health assessment is only g iven to PC clients. The evaluation used mixed methods. To better understand the meaning of survey responses, ACBH also conducted focus group s with the UELP program participants . KEY FINDINGS The client satisfaction survey and focus groups were used to assess the program outcomes. The critical findings of the analysis are summarized below. During fiscal year 2020 -2021, a total of 668 respondents from all 13 of the UELP programs completed the survey. In FY 20/21 , the data shows that UELP providers in total produced: 9,135 Prevention events, which is a 22% increase from last year and a 15% increase over pre -pandemic FY 18/19; 70,239 people were served at these Prevention events (duplicated count); and 1,174 unique clients were served through PC services, which is an 8% increase in the number of clients served in FY 19/20. PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES289 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG In FY 20/21, both assessment tools assessed the impact of the three core strategies (Outreac h and Engagement; Mental Health Consultation ; and Early Intervention services) across the following outcomes : Forming and Strengthening Identity Prevention services enhance self -efficacy . Ninety -two percent of Prevention and eighty -four percent of PC respondents reported feeling better about themselves. Changing Individual Knowledge and Perception of Mental Health Services Providers are working towards changing the perception and narrative around mental health. Ninety - three percent of Prevention respondents and eighty -nine percent of PC respondents reported having a stronger belief that most people with mental health experiences can grow, change, and recover. Having these discussions more frequently and openly work s towards normalizing mental hea lth and reducing the stigma associated with it. Building Community and Its Wellness UELP providers are working towards a healthier community for their clients. Respondents reported establishing relationships because of their participation in services. UELP programs help clients build and reduce the risk of social isolation. Ninety -four percent of Prevention respondents and eighty -six percent of PC respondents reported that they have people with whom they can do enjoyable things. Connecting Individual and Family with Their Culture UELP programs provide clients with opportuni ties to connect with their culture . Focus group/interview respondents reported that they had improved their parenting skills and learned how to parent in America. Ninety -four percent of Prevention respondents and eighty- five percent of PC respondents reported feeling more connected to their culture and community. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic activities have moved to online spaces, Focus Group participants said that this makes it easier for them to participate in the programs . However, there was a decrease in the mention of participants connecting to their culture during the Focus Groups this year. Improving Access to Services and Resources UELP programs strive to improve access to services and resources for their client populations. Respondents reported several examples in which their program has connected them to resources such as employment, housing, food, and financial services. Ninety perce nt of Prevention respondents and eighty -two percent of PC respondents report ed becoming more effective in getting the resources that they or their family need. Transforming Mental Health Services UELP programs are transforming the way mental health services are delivered in Alameda County. One example is by providing linguistically and culturally competent programs. Ninety -seven percent of Prevention respondents and 95% of PC respondents said that staff were sensitive to their cultural backgrounds and understood what they are going through. Ninety -nine percent of Prevention and PC respondents reported that program staff treated them with dignity and respect. Additionally, staff were said to be among the most beneficial parts of the program in the open -ended responses. 290 PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG This is reflected in the high percentage of Prevention (97%) and PC (96%) respondents agreeing that they would recommend this program to a friend or family member. Despite largely pr oviding online services since March of 2020, the UELP agencies are still able to provide a welcoming and inviting atmosphere that is safe for clients. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS Overall, respondents reported improved quality of life because of their participatio n in their programs, but still reported a need for continued support. PC respondents are also benefitting from more intensive services from their UELP providers. More than half (7 2%) of PC respondents reported fewer crises, which is a large increase compared to last year (57%). Focus group respondents suggested that participation might be more sustainable if the groups continued online . They find it more convenient because they do not have to find transportation or take more time out of their day . Wh en asked what they would like to see more of on the client satisfaction survey respondents wanted more help with mental health and f ocus group respondents mentioned that they wanted youth programming to help them with their mental health . EVALUATION LIMIT ATIONS Although this annual evaluation data continues to show positive results, it has several limitations in our assessment methods, including the small sample size, the lack of comparison group, and the subjective nature of qualitative asses sment and analysis.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. One family the UIY team worked with came from Honduras to the United States in 2019. The family of 4 included a pregnant mother. It had experienced some hardships caused by COVID 19, inclu ding homelessness. The family wanted to remain in the Bay Area, so the children's education would not be interrupted. They were also expecting to reunify with their son who was shortly to be released from custody of the Office of Refugee and Resettlement . Being an undocumented family made it difficult to obtain secure housing as well as reach financial stability. After tireless advocacy, UIY staff secured a placement at LaFamilia's shelter, where the entire family (including the newborn) successfully se ttled in. Luis was able to be reunited with his family. Luis has been receiving UIY preventive counseling services since then, showing great promise toward reaching treatment goals. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Challenges include: decreases in participant engagement, participant difficulty in accessing basic needs over a sustained period of time (including Medical enrollment support); difficulty develo ping data tracking systems to document supports offered to unique individuals/families. Challenges also occurred when assessing each individual situation to identify the appropriate tier of needed support. Most cases the team has worked with this year see m to benefit from more acute interventions, as well as wrap around services rather than preventive services. UIY team mitigated these challenges by adapting service delivery models to provide more in -person services (through more home visiting and communi ty events) as well as strengthening partnerships with community agencies and school districts (even as school re -openings continue to be uncertain). Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Due to COVID 19 and continued school closures, we have learned that in order to maximize participant's engagement, UIY staff needs to perform, at a minimum, the initial visit in person. This fosters a greater sense of trust, and it provides more efficient ways to explain how UIY programming can benefit participants.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. This year CyB has continued to have a far -reaching impact with 1:1 prevention and early intervention participants. We also have continued educating behavioral health professionals in our communities to better prepare them in their work with the Latinx community. In o ur PEI work, we have supported couples navigating pandemic -related stressors, supported adolescents in decreasing feelings of isolation, sadness and worry. We have offered parents tools for parenting in this challenging time of home schooling and pandemic -related trauma, including navigating the cultural and linguistic challenges of on- line education, and supported older adults in feeling connected in the loneliest moments of lockdown. Online services allowed an increase of participation of Latin men. Ou r programs successfully implemented a robust telehealth services component and a curriculum development committee was launched in January. We also delivered close to 60 virtual events and surpassed our goals by far. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Community outreach and traditional healing events were challenging since they used to be in person and are often massive events. We transformed some of these events into drive -through encounters and virtual gatherings. Successful linkages numbers were di fficult to meet. We still found that overwhelmed agencies had difficult times responding to our client's calls. As many agencies had to adapt to on -line and telehealth services this past year, Cultura y Bienestar has had the additional challenge of navig ating cultural and linguistic disparities in these mediums. This has required walking our community through technological barriers, advocating for access to laptops and Wi -fi and supporting them to adapt to different ways of relating through the screen. In the face of these challenges, CyB successfully launched women's, men's, and adolescent and parenting circles using a virtual model. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We have reaffirmed that preventive mental health programs play a vital role during the pandemic to provide much -needed emotional support and help mitigate the devastating effects of isolation, despair, and uncertainty among vulnerable populations. We also reaffirmed the importan ce of providing care for the caregiver during these difficult times, including regular check -ins, compassionate and trauma -informed communication and vicarious trauma awareness as well as building strong working relationships among team members to support each other. With the increased influx of referrals to our PEI services this past year, we have learned the importance of having a streamlined referral process. We have been able to put this in place while keeping our open -door policy to ensure access for our diverse community. We have also come up with more successful behavioral health triage processes, ensuring community members receive the necessary level of care for their mental health needs.

Note: The box has a 1,000 -character limit. At the onset of the pandemic, we partnered with local housing units to provide programs to low -income families and seniors, including: 1) Utilizing virtual platforms for emotional education/support, 2) Phone consultation by the AHS Nurse Practitioner Intern, 3) Outreach spec ialists provided emotional support for those who needed further care, 4) Linkage and referral for services offered to other residents, 5) Provided hundreds of care packets with essential safety and wellness items. The program also partnered closely with m edical providers to engage AAPI immigrant parents into our series of parenting classes. Our program hosted two series of workshops for parents, mostly AAPI mothers to learn parenting skills, to connect with others, and to voice their struggles facing laye rs of distress during the pandemic. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. With the onset of the pandemic and shelter in place orders, our preventive counseling services moved to telehealth platforms with limited face -to-face programming. We were able to successfully transition most of our programming, but limited in our support groups due to safety guidelines and community member reluctance to use telehealth. We offered more individuals and phone check -ins and delivered wellness resources routinely. We are currently assessing client interest and safety of in -person groups and hope to restart support groups this fiscal year. We also further established a stronger social media platform in multi languages. Our program leveraged internal and external resources to network with community partners to further engage community clients to the virtual workshops and seminars. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: The box has a 1,000 -character limit. During this year there were some key lessons learned: 1) Continue development of telehealth platform. Digital outreach will be needed to further diversify services to meet c lient needs. 2) In -person services are highly valuable as not all community members want to continue with telehealth methods. 3) County systems (INSYST, CG, UELP) reporting methods are challenging to manage when telecommuting due to systems limitations. 4 ) Onboarding new staff takes longer and greater resources during the pandemic due to virtual processes.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We developed a social media strategy with over 900 subscribers. We successfully engaged the 1.5 generation providing groups, individual outreach, and COVID emergency funds. We launched online town halls addressing anti -Asian violence and anti -Black racis m with 60 participants each time. We increased our ability to connect members to public benefits; provided 40,000+ meals, held two vaccine clinics, multiple testing days, and scheduled 100s of individuals for vaccines/testing off site. CERI leveraged our UELP funds to increase sustainability of services through private foundations, FEMA, CalHOPE, and COVID funds. Saveth lost her parents during the genocide and as emotionally/physically abused. She said, \"Prior to CERI, I wanted to take my life. Now I want to live.\" This year, we supported Saveth with preventive counseling and accessing public benefits and medical appointment. Saveth found support in groups a nd purpose through contributing her skills by sewing masks funded by CERI. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. This past year has been incredibly challenging with the global pandemic and rise in anti -Asian hate violence, which has led to an increase in isolation for our community members and an increase in PTSD and other mental health symptoms. We have had to increase visits to homes and provide town halls/support groups on safety in the community. With many people out of work and children doing online learning, families were financially stressed and connection to public benefits was crucial. Access to technology and internet access has continued to be an issue. Addressing access includes ensuring clients and staff have reliable internet connection, purchasing or asking for donations of phones, laptops and tablets, and providing tutorials on how to use Zoom. With less in -person contact, communication within the t eam is critical and we have added an online director's meeting, regular facilitator's meetings, and staff training. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. A lesson we relearned this year was the importance of groups for our community members, who often feel unheard and unseen. Being diligent about going to homes, using Zoom and relying on outdoor activities, such as field trips with COVID -19 safety protocol s, to connect community members has been essential for our community. We thought it would be difficult for our elders to get on Zoom and we were wrong. With support, our elders made the transition with ease. Putting in the work early, going to homes, wo rking with families, and calling have been integral. We also relearned the importance of partnerships. Working with Samuel Merritt's Occupational Therapy Program and ARTogether, we expanded our online programs for children and youth. We worked with Worl d Central Kitchen, Phnom Penh, Cross Bay Mutual Aid, Nyum Bai, Cambodian Street Food, and Monster Pho, among others to distribute over 40,000 meals. We also expanded collaborations with other UELP providers to increase services.

Our Arise staff were able to help an 18-year old student referred by her school, who had suicidal ideation and self -harm. Through our counseling sessions and home visits, our MHS provided our client and family with skills on how to manage family conflict, learn skills for stress management, time management, family communication, and peer communication. Using a strength -based approach, we build on our client's passion of baking to share with the peer support group members to improve her self -esteem and communication with peers.

We delivered 144 prevention visits and 90% of the visits were conducted via phone calls, ema ils and Zoom. We completed 6 MH referrals and successful linkages (1 was referred to the ACCESS program via AHS and 5 were referred to services outside of ACBH). We did 36 screening and assessments and had 31 unduplicated clients in preventive counseling . Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Conducting in -person and outreach and engagement activities to build rapport and trust, navigating clients through PIWI non-clinical to clinical services was limited due to the pandemic. Meeting the preventive counseling count continues to be challenging as well as we still need to increase awareness of the PIWI program and having a presence at community events. Creating s ocial media content to spread awareness was time -consuming and required more specialized skills, software, and apps. Building relationships with providers and school systems require time, layers of communication, and filtering through systems barriers. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The pandemic revealed critical challenges and changes that were not anticipated. Our office was closed and 90% of our activities sifted to online platforms (Zoom, Teams, WebEx, Google Meets, FaceTime, texts, and telephone calls) requiring new learning to better understand the functionality of such platforms. We needed a lot of time to examine existing processes and to adapt to disseminate and complete online forms (surveys/consent forms). We examined our workplan to identify solutions or tactics to address the way we operate as a direct service provider. Our focus shifted to support the community in meeting basic needs and to provide information on COVID. Offerin g group therapy looks to be ideal for this population and even younger people find this setting to be less intimidating that a 1:1. Participants identified and recruited other family members, peers, church members, friends, and colleagues, and their own ch ildren to participate in PIWI program activities.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. 1) ACWP engaged many Korean elders in using virtual platforms to: promote wellness, reduce social isolation during shelter in place, and build leadership to be community ambassadors to raise mental health awareness and reduce stigma around mental health in the API community. 2) KCCEB engaged socially isolated API elders with wellness checks to access health, mental health, safety needs, and provided social and emotional support. We have reached out to over 300 elders in the c ommunity - they were most vulnerable with low socioeconomic status and severe isolation. Many elders expressed gratitude for the support they received, stating that they live alone without any family members near. We were able to connect many elders to m eal delivery, social services, health, and mental health support as needed. 3) Build new partnerships and strengthen old partnerships with other CBO's and agencies to better serve our API community, especially to address anti -Asian violence happening in th e API community. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. 1). Continuing to meet the overwhelming increased needs and demands of the API community. Throughout the COVID -19 pandemic and shelter -in-place, Korean and other API community members were facing an ongoing array of crisis (i.e. unemployment, food insecur ity, social isolation, vaccination access barriers, anti -Asian violence, and trauma triggers, etc.). Because of the ongoing crisis and needs of the Korean community, KCCEB continued to address the urgent need of the most vulnerable populations by providing free meals, EDD (unemployment insurance) navigation support, safety kits, and by addressing the health and mental health needs of the community. 2). Engaging and following up with referred preventive counseling clients to complete enrollment and initiate services. Despite high referrals, registration was low due to client's challenges in adapting to remote and telehealth counseling. We continue to be persistent in outreach and registering with multiple follow ups. Box F: Program lessons learned of th e past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. 1) Be prepared and build capacity to promptly adapt to changing circumstances. Our capability to be flexible and adjust to the changing environment is fundamental in ensuring that our clients and community memb ers continue to access and utilize the services they need , especially during critical times such as the pandemic. 2) The importance of strong community collaboration and partnership with local community -based organizations to support vulnerable API popula tions and leveraging our collective voice and power to address the ongoing COVID crisis. For example, our K -Coalition and other API partners advocating for multiple vaccination sites for API monolingual speaking community members, especially API elders.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. An Afghan young man has recently arrived in the U.S. with his family. This client was feeling sad and anxious about the new life changing events he was experiencing. Client shared that he was having feelings of sadness, frustration, and anxiety for not being able to speak the English language and not having meaningful activities. After establishing rapport with client, he was able to express his frustrations and concerns which he reported was \"very helpful and effective\". Client was connected to youth workers who were able to assist him in improving his English abilities, which client stated was helpful for him. During his weekly counseling sessions, client appeared much more positive, and after several sessions, client shared more positivism and was feeling more confident about his abilities he stated that he would prepare himself to take the DMV permit test in the summer time. Another accomplishment was our food bank that distributed food boxes to 50 families per week. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. All services were provided remotely relying heavily on technology to bring programming and assistance to clients. One challenge was connecting cli ents to technology and providing the most in - need clients with devices so that they could participate in our workshops/events/prevention counseling, communicate with family members and learn about resources, including COVID -19 relief. We hired an Elderly O utreach Worker who taught clients how to download and use apps such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and social media sites. Another challenge was supporting youth who, due to in - person school cancellations, had become disengaged, depressed, and broke off communication with parents. We mitigated this by ramping up tutoring efforts as a means to support students. A new tutoring program was established using peer volunteer tutors to match struggling students with high school/college aged tutors who assisted with academi cs and provided guidance and support. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Afghan TV and social media are very effective means of outreach to our community. We saw increased participation with virtual events due to more flexibility. This is consistent with several prevention clients who preferred telehealth for counseling services for the convenience of it. Outreach to clients one -by-one was also very effective. For those clients without transportati on, we discovered that phone, SMS, and emails were an efficient way to share information. For youth, we saw an influx in tutoring requests due to online learning that caused Afghan youth to suffer academically. We learned that through tutoring youth's ac ademics improved but also their mental health as it provided mentorship and much -needed social interactions. We continue to adjust between in -person services and remote depending on the needs of our clients. Lastly, the pandemic reiterated the importance of hosting Consortium meetings to educate health care professionals about Afghan culture.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Increased outreach efforts to older adults resulted in participation of low -wage workers affected by the pandemic in addition to elder caregivers. Youth and TAY participants were able to incorporate mental health and create healing spaces in social causes such as racial justice, anti - AAPI violence and COVID awareness. Participating in these social movements provided healing experiences for those wh o were most affected. Weekly support groups and peer led workshops continued to provide youth/TAY/adults with culturally competent and meaningful connections during quarantine. We are particularly proud of a new youth leader that was able to mobilize new members and recruit new leaders. Shortly after joining, they wrote and performed poetry for AAPI cultural events. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The mental health specialist left the organization in November, causing a gap for counseling services until a replacement was hired in February. The pandemic was a substantial challenge for most of the older adult participants due to lack of access to technology all owing them to participate virtually. The creation of Zoom tutorials in -language helped mitigate this. Challenges in transitioning in new peer leaders was mitigated by strengthening connections among peer leader cohorts. Weekly support groups were offere d via Zoom and utilized platforms like Discord and Instagram to communicate with youth/TAY and recreate community spaces. Box F : Program lessons learned of the past year. Note: 1,000 -character limit. Patience and willingness to adapt to 'new norms' are essential for us to continue to serve, especially older adults and working TAY who were more difficult to reach in the beginning. Having a centrally -located school site simplifies leveraging relationships with adults to support youth. Through expanded outreach, having youth come from different areas across Alameda County and school sites brings varying perspectives to diversify and enhance discussions.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. COVID -19 has had significant implications on individuals' sense of community, has increased stressors, and has exacerbated underlying mental health conditions among the Afghan community. APTW's support groups have provided social support, education on stre ss coping techniques, and opportunities for sharing of COVID -19 related resources. Clients shared feedback that the virtual support groups helped them feel connected, cope with stressors, and promote their families' resilience. One client in particular w as experiencing seizures, side effects to medications, depression and anxiety. The PEI caseworker supported her with learning techniques to reduce stress and anxiety, such as controlling intrusive thoughts to breathing exercises while providing emotional support. Eventually, this client was able to identify her own self -worth and her condition quickly improved. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. Access to adequate technology and digital literacy skills are a barrier to clients engaging with our virtual services, now conducted over Zoom. We were pleased to be able to provide laptops and tablets to APTW clients and teach digital literacy skills. With the support of th e APTW team, clients were able to attend virtual English classes, connect their children to their virtual classes, and attend Zoom sessions for counseling or psychosocial support groups. California's Shelter in Place order posed challenges to ensuring conf identiality for all UELP programming, since participants share homes with children and spouses. Programming often involves building trust with clients and having sensitive conversations about mental health. To mitigate these concerns, the UELP team has com pleted extra trainings on domestic violence, mandated reporting, and has developed strategies for creating 'safe spaces' and cultivating boundaries for clients who are 'sheltering in place.' Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. In Year II of the grant, IRC significantly benefited from prioritizing internal collaboration across IRC's programs, as well as partnership with community providers. To promote access and i ncrease internal referrals, the APTW team conducted a presentation with all IRC staff on the different components of the program to encourage cross -referrals . The UELP team has collaborated with Partnership for Trauma Recovery, Diversity in Health Training Institute and Afghan Coalition on referrals and community resources.

Note: 1,00 0-character limit. We saw many successes and accomplishments this past year as we continued to use telehealth platforms which helped de -stigmatize seeking out of services by allowing anonymity, took away barriers such as needs for transportation and childcare and helped increase access to care. We were able to offer 10 support groups this year, 2 in Farsi, 4 in Nepali, 3 in English, and 1 in Hindi. Each were well attended. Through telehealth, we were able to reach South Asian community members in hard to reach areas county wide and collaborate with faith healers and community leaders to help normalize emotional wellness conversations. We established stronger relationships with many South Asian mental health stakeholders, providing MH consultations and helping to bridge service gaps. As a result of this outreach we saw an increase in referrals to our program, especially for family work focused on the impacts of the pandemic. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. The biggest challenges continued to be our inability to work in the community , especially not being able to host or attend community events. Once the vaccine roll -out began, our outreach workers did start meeting with the community outdoors, passing out print materials to connect them to resources and helping them decrease isolation to minimize the impacts of the pande mic. The other challenge we experienced was in keeping youth engaged. In the past, we would meet with them in person and utilize art, sports, board games and other interactive activities to help build rapport and encourage continued engagement. However, on telehealth it was more difficult to connect with youth. Many did not have safe/confidential spaces at home and they were experiencing Zoom fatigue. We had to begin to think outside of the box, find online activities or utilize things that most youth w ould have access to at home to do art projects. We also offered for some youth to come into the clinic if they felt safe. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Some lessons learned were: a) Importance of community building - need to continue to train community leaders and faith leaders on how to respond to emotional wellness needs in the community, b) Importance of telehealth services even after the pandemic is over. It really helps to increase access to care, c) Support groups are so important, even when there are only a few community members present. They help in normalizing emotional wellness conversations, d) Prevention work so needed in the South Asian community. We need to advocate for more fundin g to help increase these services, e) The pandemic continued to remind us that we must wear different hats when serving immigrant communities. 364 PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Box G: For programs that refer individuals with severe mental illness , please provide information for the categories below: G.1: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care within ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 10 G.2: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care outside ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 20 G.3: Types of treatment individuals were referred to (list types) (500 -character limit): Alameda County & Contra Costa County Outpatient at the Hume Center, Tri -City Health, EAP programs, private health insurance, college/university health programs, Kaiser G.4: Unduplicated number of individuals who participated in referred program at least one time : n/a G.5: Average duration of untreated mental illness in weeks : n/a G.6: Average number of days between referral and first participation in referred treatment program: n/a Box H: For programs that work to improve timely access to mental health services for underserved populations , please provide information on the categories below: H.1: Who is/are the underserved target population(s) your program is serving (e.g. TAY, Southeast Asian) (500 Characters): This program serves individuals from the unserved and underserved South Asian community, more specifically those from India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Burma.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Food Security Project: We were extremely proud of or Food Security Project. We were able to hold this part of the program in person. This gave us real time insight to some of the real needs of our youth, families and elders. In the past, parent participation has been difficult. Due to the home visits our connection. Annual Youth/family GONA: our GONA was so well attended we decided to hold two this year. We have learned so much from this pandemic and having to work virtually. There is value in being able to reach the participants that cannon come in physically. Virtual programming will continue to be a part of our programming moving forward. We were able to re - implement our Elders Program in the beginning of 2021 with bringing back our staff that had to be reassigned due to COVID -19. Since her return, the Elders Program is going strong. They continue to receive support from our Traditional Healer during regular check -ups. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The impact of COVID -19 has been immense as we all know. One of the biggest impacts has been the loneliness and isolation our youth, families and elders have been experiencing. The cancellation of major events for another year (Powwows, ceremonies, and family gatherings) and access to resources drying up due to being over inundated. We were able to mitigate these challenges by going virtual, making regular calls to our participants to check in and visit a little when we deliver their weekly food boxes. The in -person visits were healing for both participants and for staff. The visits made the youth, families, and elders feel heard, and the staff could see the positive impact of the visits and check -ins. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,00 0-character limit. We continue to see there is a value in seeing each other (staff and community members). We saw the negative effects of isolation and loneliness on everyone. We realize now how important our gatherings are to foster wellness in our community. We also learned that we can use virtual learning beyond our current situation. We will be utilizing virtual platforms moving forward. Even though access can be an issue for some, the positive impact outweighs the barriers. Most of all, that we are being tested and we as a community perceiver and find the light in the da rk. We roll up our sleeves, put on the hip boots and work together to make beautiful things happen.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. PTR's African communities program provided counseling to 24 unique clients, facilitated 15 psychoeducational workshops, 3 educational workshops, 3 support groups; hosted and co -hosted 8 community events, provided MH consultation for 46 community members, prevention visits for 64 potential clients, and distributed communication materials on 5 loc al listservs that reach CBOs throughout the Bay Area. One of the successes was facilitating psychoeducational workshops by identifying the mental health- related needs and tailoring workshops to specific community groups through a community -based healing a pproach, to normalize and destigmatize mental health issues. PTR engaged African newcomer youth remotely through the psychosocial support group, mentorships, and coaching. PTR has also maximized reach to African communities in the Bay Area through divers ifying outreach approaches and partnering with universities, associations, CBOs, and non -profit organizations. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. PTR's main challenge continued to be entering client information in the InSyst system. The majority of our clients are asylum seekers, many of whose immigration status is currently uncertain. Given their past histories of trauma and insecure legal status, consenting to share personal information reported in InSyst causes stress and anxiety for some clients. Additional barriers to entering InSyst data include 2020 changes in immigration policies, stigma, fear of being racially profiled, and systemic discrimination in s ervices. To respond to this, PRT created a unique consent form, tip -sheet, and user -friendly referral form for UELP clients that indicate the information shared in InSyst, and the level of protection guaranteed by Alameda County. The fact that PTR was ab le to provide prevention visits for 64 potential clients and conduct mental health consultations for 46 community members is an auspicious sign of PTR's ability to increase the number of PEI counseling clients. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Engaging community, faith, and CBO leaders and getting buy -in and trust from them created an enabling environment to reach out more broadly, and to collaborate with more stakeholders to contextualize, tailoring our workshops and events to meet the needs of the communities. This assistance in contextualizing, tailoring mental health issues for specific communities, increasing language access, and diversifying outreach strategies allowed PTR t o better meet community needs. The diverse perspectives, ethics and experiences of PTR staff, all of whom are immigrants were relatable to the community we serve, also informed programming. Weaving mental health issues into different needs and stressors of the communities has increased acceptance among community members and enabled staff to easily transfer key messages around mental health issues. The engagement of African youth student associations based in universities helped us to have additional huma n resources.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We were successful in engaging our targeted communities despite the pandemic challenges. This was via the psycho -educational workshops we offered to groups of mothers and youth (males), embedding art and expressive art to the sessions. We held community events where we had conversations on spirituality, fun activities for families, and cultural music. We are proud of our success in building relati onships and collaborations with schools and CBOs. Among our success stories this year, one MENA mother who fled from a domestic violence environment and didn't have any support. The Sidra team (MHS and Outreach workers) has provided her with emotional support, linkages to different resources which helped her in restoring her life, housing with rental assistance for 1 year, food assistance, educational/career guidance, and legal services. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: The box has a 1,000 -character limit. The continuous prevalence and presence of COVID -19 have affected our work with MENA communities. When we were just starting to build strong relationships and trust with community members and partners, the remote and virtual methods of service made it hard for us to connect especially with the youth population. We lost the interaction with the young MENA students especially since maintaining privacy has become a big issue for them. They live in low -income housing and quite a good number within the househo ld. Although we have success in building trust with parents, gaining more visibility as a resource among the community, we have had challenges finding Arabic -speaking clinical staff to hire to respond to the client's needs. However, we are adding more en deavors in addressing the challenges by seeking more partnerships as a support. Box F: Programs lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. This year validated what we learned in the first year of our program launch, that women are key to successfully reaching the community as they are key gatekeepers. We learned that when mothers are satisfied, they become our advocates and champions for Sidra not only within their families but also in the outside world (i.e. schools). We also le arned that in order to reach males (fathers/husbands), we need to use a different narrative to destigmatize mental health services, and we have seen that home visits can help change the dynamics of the discussion. This was clear er for us this year with th e overwhelming impact of the pandemic on the population that the presence and availability of mental health providers from the community is a great necessity. 384 PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Box G: For programs that refer individuals with severe mental illness , please provide information for the categories below: G.1: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care within ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 1 G.2: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care outside ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 0 G.3: Types of treatment individuals were referred to (list types) (500 - character limit): Client was referred to a LMFT who speaks the language and understands the culture of the client to be treated for complicated grief which hinders the client from having a functional, health and productive life.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Implementation of COST referral system across 276 schools in 14 school districts in Alameda County has successfully and crucially served over 6,000 students and families who needed behavioral health support and services. The COVID -19 pandemic underscored the value and impact of COST to identify and provide holistic supports to students and families, such as basic needs, hotspots, and behavioral heal th services. One school district used COST to identify foster care students and families who need more support. An elementary school foster student, who had never been to school, received academic interventions and behavioral health support that greatly impacted her academics and behavioral health. COST connected the foster family to community resources. To support a family with three students in different schools, COST teams across sites collaborated to connect all students with mental health support a nd conduct a home visit to connect the family with counseling and other resources. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The COVID -19 pandemic and distance learning continued to be a challenge in implementing COST and engaging students and families. In almost all cases COST teams, therapy and mental health services went viral. However, throughout the year some districts were able to offer in -person learning hubs for students who were struggling with distance learning and integrate in -person counseling and supports. Often the severity of health and economic issues families faces were dire and families were often harder to reach. Many COST team members have conducted more home visits to support students and families, as well as participating in school site -based distribution of needed resources to families. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. School districts leveraged the existing infrastructure of COST and its strong multidisciplinary team to increase access and provide linkages to services virtually. Teams continued to meet, identify students and families in need and provide support and access to mental health and ot her basic resources such as food, housing support, health support and access to needed technology. All districts continued to utilize COST as a way to identify needed resources, from an individual to community level, and to support families and build on e xisting relationships. For some teams, the pivot to virtual meeting enables more team members to participate regularly, and some meetings may remain virtual even as schools reopen. Other virtual services, such as developing support groups across school s ites, also proved really effective in linking students with one another. Utilizing technology to improve access to services will continue, along with maintaining in -person supports and services.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. One program accomplishment this year is Lockwood CDC hosting a virtual community event that focused on how music supports social and emotional development. The event reached other early childhood programs in the community as well as families. The children performed by dancing and reciting poem s.

Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. COVID -19 has had a huge impact on the work that consultants do. Due to shelter in place, safety regulations it was difficult to observe children and teachers in the classroom. Ways that consultations collaborated with sites to troubleshoot this is to use technology to facilitate observation. Consultants participated in Zoom Circle Times and met with teachers via Zoom (or other platforms). Being about to meet virtually allowed for less missed meetings and more flexibility with scheduling. Parents seemed to understand and were supportive of the process. Some challenges were faced regarding Wi-Fi connections and level of understanding about how to use various technology devices and programs. However, everyone worked together to support one another. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. This year taught us to be patient, flexible, and more empathetic.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. As distance learning extended into this school year, we continued to build an active internet presence. By the end of quarter 4, our SBHC Instagram account surpassed 400 followers of which most are current or former AUSD students. Our teamwork, creativity, and resourcefulness have allowed us to continue our outreach and health education services in new ways including a monthly health education newsletter, workshop series, and virtual health fairs. Our Youth Advisory Board (YAB) members assist in sharing content that is relevant and youth -friendly. A recent success story involves a student who ac cessed our services and joined YAB after our presentation in the Encinal Mental Health Matters Class. A few weeks into joining YAB, she asked the Health Centers Supervisor for MH support. The HCS assisted the student in accessing our MH services and alert ed the clinician team to the student's referral. The student received ongoing services from one of our school -based clinicians. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. A major challenge was opening up the year in distance learning. Towards the end of last FY, we started to identify ways to engage youth and the knowledge that distance learning would continue was a driving force for staff to think creatively and strategical ly about how to engage students through new mediums so that we could provide outreach and information that was not only accessible to youth, but something they would actually access/engage in. Together with our Youth Advisory Board, we increased our prese nce on social media platforms, started providing virtual workshops on relevant teen topics, and began ending our large campaigns with virtual health fairs that take place on non -synchronous learning days. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. This year provided AFS with a number of new techniques, approaches, and allowance for creativity to connect with youth. We learned how to navigate social media, putting systems in place to not only share, but interact with youth digitally. We learned the impact of utilizing multiple modalities to share information. Physical flyers, social media, email blasts, Google Classrooms, texting applications, and word of mouth through both your and key faculty such as school psychologists.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. GART collaborated with Safer Ground to provide support to older adults housed in hotels during the pandemic. GART provided consultation, supporting counseling, linkage, and brief treatment to individuals needing services and mental health support. Case ex: 6 6 y/o male referred from Safer Ground dur to symptoms causing him to be at risk of being removed from the hotel. Ct also had low -income, long history of being unhoused, and struggled with physical issues. The client's symptoms included, suicidal ideation , depression, auditory hallucinations, anxiety, relational discord and agitation toward others. Within 6 months of treatment, the client began to address long- standing trauma and their impact on his current behaviors and choices. He learned tools to bett er manage anger and developed insight into how his anger impacted others. At discharge, GART referred him to long -term psychotherapy services and due to improvements was also placed in permanent supportive housing for seniors. Box E: Program of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. As a field -based program, the pandemic caused many challenges in navigating how to safely continue to provide services to our clients and new referrals. GART also saw a decline of referrals this past year, but did provide consultation and navigation to many individuals and providers. GART was able to pivot to successfully incorporate telehealth and phone -based services in order to continue to provide treatment for clients and assessments for new referrals. Hiring has been a challenge this year and GART is still without an RN, which is critical for many reasons, including older adults frequently have co -occurring medical conditions and establishing rapport and engagement. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. GART has learned that telehealth and phone -based platforms are a good supplement to ongoing fiend -based face -to-face services for some older adults and hope to b e able to continue as needed post -pandemic. We continue to notice potential service gaps for older adults that have symptoms may be better explained by dementia as well as individuals experiencing homelessness.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Outreach efforts and the renaming of the African American Everyone Counts Campaign - now called Black Wellness and Resilience - drew participants to the anti -stigma support groups. This was particularly notable during a year of fully remote services, when reaching new participants who had not previously been engaged in PEERS programs has been challenging. Some members of the African American Action Team were trained to facilitate the anti -stigma support groups, providing an additional leadership opportuni ty for African American mental health consumers. The first -ever Virtual Summit, Lift Every Voice and Speak: The Power of Voice, drew 36 participants for the four -hour event. LEVS speakers were actively involved in planning and implementing the event, which focused on telling your story for change and wellness. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The primary challenge this year was that in -person programming was not safe, dur to COVID -19. Finding partners to host speaking engagements for our Lift Every Voice and Speak (LEVS) speaker's bureau was challenging early in the year. We mitigated this challenge by reaching out to organizations that were holding virtual even ts and by hosting our first LEVS summit. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Special Messages groups continued to provide connections and peer support during a year of intense isolation. In addition to peer support around message receiving and voice hearing, PEERS staff made multiple referrals to health, employment, hunger, housin g and transportation services. Healing Arts Workshops at Laney College, Conscious Voices, BESTNow! All focused on meditation, mindfulness, and healing and were received with enthusiasm by attendees. The lesson we learned through this was that Healing Ar ts workshops proved to be a useful way to reach potential new participants, as attendees expressed interest in Hope & Faith, Black Wellness & Resilience, and Lift Every Voice and Speak programs.

The texter shared their identity as an African American woman with mental illness and trauma and \"this world is not for me and has never been.\" Because of her lived experience, the texter often times declined referrals to higher levels of care. The text line program is available to provide services to people who may not interface with greater behavioral health care sy stems, but can still benefit for its support. Over time, the program hopes to build trust with community members and to connect them to appropriate levels of care for ongoing services. Box E : Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The program continues its efforts to recruit and train text line specific counselors. Our team of 30 text line counselors was smaller than last year's team of 40. To mitigate this, we scheduled paid shift supervisors on every shift. We hope to expand text line coverage to be 24hours/7 days per week by July 2022. The challenge will be to train enough volunteers to cover all the shifts. Working remotely can increase a counselor's sense of isola tion and burnout. To mitigate this, the program utilizes text and video chat so that team members can stay connected, provide and receive support, and shift supervisors can provide coaching and feedback. The program also would like to serve community memb ers who do not speak English. This year, we hired and trained a bilingual Spanish text line shift supervisor who will be able to respond to community members in Spanish during certain hours of the week. The part -time position is funded by a grant from Ka iser. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Young people and their family/support systems continue to impress us with their remarkable resilience and adaptability to an uncertain world during a global pandemic. Although our Text Line serves clients with a variety of struggles, several common themes that our texters have recently approached us about include psychological trauma, interpersonal challenges, and anxiety/stress regarding school. This year was particul arly a challenging year for several clients, too as many of them expressed feelings of isolation and anxiety due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Some youth texters also mentioned experiencing more family conflict das a result of the lockdown restrictions earlie r in the year, along with difficulties focusing on online school.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our online youth curriculum in a 20 -min format met the needs that our schools were asking for: vital information provided to youth in a short amount of time allowed by the distance learning format. We received very positive feedback from our teachers on both the length and on the level of engagement that our TFL health educators were able to elicit from students. Another success is that we were able to connect with about the same number of youth as before the pandemic, along with creating relationships w ith new schools. Another new addition to our youth menu was developed by our Senior TFL Health Educator, Zoey Eberle. Zoey developed a Youth Peer Counseling workshop that was well received at the virtual Teens Tackle Tobacco Youth Conference. Another su ccess was the creation of a new workshop added to our healthcare settings menu. Our Community Education Trainer, Jennifer Johal developed a workshop for health care workers to address burnout. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We were not able to gather enough significant quantitative data nor demographic data from our workshops this past year. We were not able to gather pre/post data as we were unable to access our audiences before training. Gathering data from youth was particularly challenging as each school/teacher had their own understandably strict permissions on their online platforms that did not always allow chat access to guests. Another issue was that onli ne classrooms could be quite fluid where students would log off and on as a norm and we weren't confident that we would capture all the students that watched the presentation in full. Time was also a factor. Online classrooms varied from 30 -45 minutes an d we prioritized getting through content and Q&A before classes ended. The biggest challenge for our adult workshops is receiving responses. Though our adult survey and demographic link is being distributed, the response rate has been very low. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Moving forward, we will elicit help from our teachers and organizations with regard to distribution of our survey links when providing our workshops virtually.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Two clinical interns initiated the creation of the Asian American/Pacific Islander Support Group in response to the rise in stress following COVID -19 and increase in hate crimes against community members. This group was offered to current clients in addition to the larger community and is run as a drop -in group. Facilitators r eported that attendees have appreciated a space that addresses the unique stressors related to the API community and that the group has been run in collaboration with attendees. Facilitators have described the experience as personally meaningful in that i t allowed them to connect with the community and directly address many aspects of their cultural identity. Providing spaces like this is an important component of suicide prevention as communities who feel isolated can be at a higher risk for dying by sui cide. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Due to the limitations presented by COVID -19, and the reduced amount of availability of our interns, we provided services to fewer total clients than in previous years. This was particularly noticeable in our school -based program where overall referrals were low and families proved difficult to engage. We were able to increase our engagements through groups, and provided an increasing number of groups as the year progressed. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The program continued to develop its focus on increasing cultural humility practices, and made changes to the format of group supervision to encourage reflective practices. The program also supported the agency in its commitment to justice, equity, divers ity, and inclusion (JEDI) by assisting with the creation and facilitation of affinity groups along with other work. Although this year has been uniquely challenging, we found some success in continuing to be creative with our clinical offerings. Clinic al interns reported experiencing a sense of support and inclusion, and were able to provide high quality services. This year has been a significant learning experience and has helped provide a focus and direction for our next training year.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. The WRAP group in Spanish through La Familia, in particular, has been a crucial source of connection for participants, who primarily are elders and have been heavily isolated since March 2020. This group was able to support ACBH with the MHSA Plan Update by hosting a focus group in Spanish. Spanish -speaking consumers were under -represented in the community program planning process that informed development of the Three -Year MHSA Plan, so this was particularly important. The following responses to the question, \"What did you learn today?\" gi ves a picture of how TAY Leadership Club participants themselves characterize what they are learning. -Affirmation that I do not need to be/feel validated, and not to compare myself with others or have the need to be perfect!! Box E: Program challenges o f the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,00 0-character limit. The primary challenge this year was that in -person programming was not safe, due to COVID -19. Our efforts to partners with another organization for a remote TAY WRAP group were successful. Despite our efforts to work with more than five potential partners, we were not able to set up a remote TAY WRAP group by the end of the fiscal year. We are committed to building at least one solid partnership for TAY WRAP ear ly in FY 2021 -22. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. To engage participants in WRAP and maintain participation in our groups, we had to experiment with new methods of outreach in the remote environment. Persistence and experimentation yielded the results we sought, and we were able to build and sustain part icipation even given the issues around the digital divide that all programs face. To provide additional peer support during this time of increased isolation, we provided 150 one - to-one peer support calls to 28 unduplicated participants, averaging 15 min utes per call. These calls focused on wellness tools, personal connections, and referrals to related services. Participants talked about a wide range of concerns, with isolation and difficulties associated with poverty (e.g. income, housing) being the mo st prominent.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Youth UpRising was very happy about transitioning our telehealth mental wellness therapy sessions to in -person around April 2021. This in -person therapy was at the request of youth, primarily, and also given we had the appropriate COVID -19 measures in place. We also l aunched a group that focused on healthy boundaries, stress management, self -care and empowerment. Youth UpRising was very happy to continue serving youth with wellness services via telehealth at the height of the pandemic, around March/April 2020 and in t he months to follow. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our most significant challenge was engaging our young people while in quarantine. Our outreach included using social media to inform young people of the services we had available in hopes they would engage. From March 2020, until around summer, things were very slow and we believe it was due to youth processing what was happening in the world. When we did attemp t to do telehealth with young people, some did not have adequate internet connectivity and others were not able to be at home in private spaces to have the conversations they needed to have with our therapists. Box F: Program learned of the past year? No te: 1,000 -character limit. It will be important that we extend further opportunity for youth to let us know what programming they need. While we were able to determine the challenges that came up for them through our groups, counseling and therapy sessions, there is a great opportunity to further expand the programming based on their guidance. We are also increasing our peer -to-peer facilitation in our programming which we have seen is very helpful for youth development and building trust. Youth s pend a lot of time with each other, much more than we are able to spend with them, and having that connection helps in the area of wellness and empowerment.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. FY 20/21 continued to present challenges due to COVID -19. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we were able to have in -person stable groups at REACH. In consultation with public health, we developed a health screening process including temperature checks and complying with masking and social distancing protocols. We offered 5 different activity stable groups with 3 adult facilitators per group. Groups has 6 -9 youth with space dictating the number that we could have in each group. Each stable group had scheduled breaks and mealtime to reduce the potential for group intermingling and exposure if there was a positive COVID case. Since June 2020, we have had 12 sessions of in -person learning and group activity. We are currently in our 2nd summer session. Furthermore, we have continued with our bi -monthly food distribution and recently hosted a vaccine pop -up event at the youth center. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The pandemic continues to challenge our service delivery model. We work closely with the public health department, school districts, and program partners to make sure that we are aligned with public health guidelines and recommendations. We hold daily debriefs at the end of the day to ensure that staff and partners are consistent with protocols and to address any breakdown in communication. We h ad 2 positive COVID cases last month and we were able to isolate the exposure and minimize the impact on programming. Although the positive cases were exposed outside of REACH, we took precautionary steps and asked the group that was exposed to quarantine for 10 days depending on their vaccination status. Regarding the health and wellness screener, it is currently being translated into Spanish to be more culturally responsive to our youth and families. Furthermore, we are currently working on our data tr acking system to reflect accurate and comprehensive data . Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We need to continue to be judicious with health screening protocols and complying with public health guidance and best practices. We encourage youth and their families to get vaccinated if they are eligible and confront myths about the vaccine as well as educate staff on vaccine information. The pandemic placed additional technical challenges. It required most of u s to learn different ways to navigate various virtual platforms, training of staff and upgrading computers and wi-fi capacity. Regarding data challenges, we realized that we will need to get staff trained on the data system and provide refreshers througho ut the year so that all staff will be able to enter youth's information in a consistent and accurate manner. 458 PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Box G: For programs that refer individuals with severe mental illness , please provide information for the categories below: G.1: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care within ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 0 G.2: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care outside ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 46 G.3: Types of treatment individuals were referred to (list types) (500 - character limit): In addition to being referred to resources to meet non - behavioral health needs, youth were referred to CCM's at REACH, YFSB, Fuente Health Center, Opportunity Academy, and Dreamcatchers. 1 youth already in therapy at Seneca Center G.4: Unduplicated number of individuals who participated in referred program at least one time : 41 G.5: Average duration of untreated mental illness in weeks : 0.5 G.6: Average number of days between referral and first participation in referred treatment program: 3.6 Box H: For programs that work to improve timely access to mental health services for underserved populations , please provide information on the categories below: H.1: Who is/are the underserved target population(s) your program is serving (e.g .

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Staff helped clients feeling stressed about socialization after COVID restrictions were lifted by offering coping strategies. Staff also shared up -to-date recommendations and news to ease family's concerns and address misinformation. Clients passed this on to their families and social netwo rks - an invaluable asset, as hearing these messages from someone in their own circle is highly effective. Staff also used motivational interviewing to identify potential areas for further education and intervention. Case study: Staff helped a mother who se abusive husband abandoned the family. The client lost her job due to a misunderstanding and had no other revenue. She was highly stressed and worried about paying rent. Our staff linked the client to legal resources, referred her to counseling and other services, and assisted her in applying for food stamps and health insurance. The client shared that the support she received helped her to become resourceful and strong for her children. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. 1)The lack of adequate and accessible mental health supports in certain languages is concerning, with the increased number of clients disclosing mental health issues and an an ticipated wave of new clients seeking support. 2) Uncertainty regarding vaccines and mask wearing are making some clients stressed, 3) Financial and COVID -related stressors make it difficult for families to focus on anything other than their basic needs. 4) Families have i ncreased concerns for their children's mental health and behavior challenges. 5) Clients experiencing loss are hesitant to discuss their grief. 6) Technology barriers impact client's access to mental health and other services and limit social connections . 7) With many county offices closed, many families have difficulty accessing services. Our staff also continue to work remotely, but we have made access easier by devoting time to assist clients in how to use technology. We also have a drop box where cl ients can delivery documents. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year. Note: 1000 -character limit. We learned much this year about implementing new data and service systems. There were changes made in our database that had unintended consequences in other areas and similarly with program services. Rolling out new systems takes time and patience as staff adjust to new procedures while simultaneously meeting clients' needs. Also, wellness checks, while important, are time consuming and d raining for staff. It was their tendency to want to check in with everyone at once, but some structure was important for them to remain present with families , especially with emotions so high for all involved. We learned to give staff some structure about how to spend their time each day so that they could pace themselves. We also learned the importance of staff/client contact to reduce client isolation. Clients expressed gratitude that staff took time just to do the well checks, in their own language. Assisting clients with how to use technology is key to helping families feel connected and informed.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We are proudest of our ability to support our staff and adapt curriculum to Zoom throughout the pandemic. We created ways to record music through Zoom and added programming like our beat group that was a better fit for virtual tech -based programming. We were ab le to maintain the same level of rapport building and connection in our groups. We had a critical intervention when a student dropped out of our Zoom. Team members followed up to find that he got into a fight with his alcoholic mother. He talked of kill ing himself so we did a suicide assessment and reached out to his support services team through Seneca Services. The family was separated and he was able to gain other housing. With his stability solidified, he was able to perform months later in our showcase. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges?

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We continued to meet most of our deliverables during the COVID 19 pandemic. We adapted to Zoom Video meetings for outreach and contacts. We adhered to all the guid elines for keeping everyone safe. We practice social distancing, wearing masks, and washing or cleansing hands often. We ordered masks and gloves to distribute to our members. One of our most noted successful outreach event s was participa tion in the Rally Against Police Violence and Killing African American Men and Women at the state capitol in Sacramento, CA. We were able to pass out information about Black Men Speak and its goal to empower members. Other events included BMS' speaking ev ent in Justice for Sean Monterrosa at San Francisco city hall, the CAMPRO Conference, the POCC Annual Conference 2021, and the REACH African American Trauma event via Zoom. \u0005\u0091\u009a\u0003\b Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challe nges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. BMS (Black Men Speaks) would have completed all of our deliverables sooner , but with the COVID 19 crises and the shelter -in-place order, our plans were disrupted. We had four speaking engagements scheduled at various classrooms at UC Berkeley, another at a church in Oakland, and one with the POCC Steering Committee and Executi ve Committee. We also had planned engagement s at Santa Rita and the Juvenile Justice Center but both were postponed. We will continue with those plans as things open again. Another challenge has been doing surveys. We were not able to get information o n Zoom. Some of these challenges were met by conducting virtual meetings where speakers share their life experiences and stories of resilience, as well as short videos shared on social media. \u0003 Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We adapted to a new way of doing our deliverables by using Zoom, and so our program can continue even in uncertain health and social situations by providing information and being available to our members and our community as a positive force. By continuing our relationships with organizations such as All of Us or None, BOP, REACH, and Boss, we have continued to increase visibility of BMS and empowerment in target populations in different ways. Through BMS presentations, we have seen muc h support of men released from incarceration including employment, housing, and self -sufficiency.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. During FY 2020/21 MHAAC focused on developing culturally syntonic workshops for African American families to build community through cultural connection. Presenters were either African American or cross -cultural experts in services to the community. ACBH ally Dr. Aaron Chapman was a champion and of the remaining presenters, 83% were African American and 100% were POC. 98% of participants reported the presenters covered their topics well; 99% reported that their questions were answered well; 97% shared that the presentation was useful. Workshops were redesigned to draw from the African American experience by including cultural infusion through the use of music, spoken poetry, imagery and the stories of lived experience. Workshops promoted culturally syntonic self -care and self -care practices such as the FERC African American Support Group and the presentation of Dr. Theopia Jackson, President of the Association of Black Psychologists, who educated on the African American tradition of healing circles. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our most significant challenge this year was evolving the program's outreach/engagement with no in -person contact. The program used an African American PR firm to promote through social media and to community leaders. African American radio station promotion and articles published in a local African American paper were implemented. With the addition of a part time outreach worker and coming under FERC administrat ion, the program focused on increasing personal ties to organizations, however we found this difficult. The Steering Committee expanded their outreach to leverage relationships across the country resulting in 4 out -of-state participants. We had 435 Zoom registrants with 47% attending; average workshop attendance was 41. 80% of participants attended on computers and 20% attended via phone. 71% were from Alameda County (54% from Oakland); 23% from other Bay Area counties and 6% from outside the Bay Area. Despite engagement barriers, 90% of participants rated the workshops 8+ out of 10. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The lesson learned this year was the importance of formative community feedback and transmission. We found that we needed more than an evaluation to garner floor needs and we learned that transmitting needs up is an important aspect of the work. We used an evaluation feedback loop in which participants response on workshop evaluations was used to shape program offerings. For example, we found that 52% of participant's loved ones live with MHI and SUD. We responded by providing presentations on SUD with M H. However, we found that an average of 54% of participants completed our evaluations. To address this, a standing discussion component was added to the workshops to garner live feedback on community needs and to inform the community of the program's tra nsmission of their feedback to the ACBH system. For example, at the February workshop the community requested an African American Warmline, and this was brought to ACBH and is in discussion.

Note: 1,00 0-character limit. The program was successful meeting or exceeding all of its contract goals and objectives during FY 2021. Ten weekly healing circles were facilitated. At least 3 large group events were hosted and more than 8 trainings were delivered. A significant accomplishment was organizing and facilitating a Black Mental Health Conference that was attended by over 300 participants with 9 breakout sessions. Ten months ago, a former youth RJOY employee and circle participant was shot and killed. He was an engaged and expectant father of twins. He regularly attended Black Male Circle. He also supported the Youth Circle by accompanying young people from group homes and the community to the circle. We held several circles with his fianc\u00e9e. The circl es centered on healing and support. We held a virtual baby shower exploring needs. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? 1,000 - character limit. The primary challenge over the past year remained working in a virtual environment. We had relatively successful one -off events, such as talent shows, dance parties and the Reimagining Black Mental Health Conference, with significant numbers in attendance. But while initial participation in events and h ealing circles was strong, we experienced a mid -year drop in numbers for some circles that would seem to be attributable to \"Zoom fatigue\". Many participants in recent months have expressed eagerness to return to in -person meetings, something that we are beginning as vaccination rates rise and also as we have developed new protocols for in -person circles through community events we have held in the wake of incidents of violence in our community. We continued to follow up with participants, offering unders tanding while also trying to ensure that attendance remained high enough to engender trust and engagement among all participants in circles where attendance began to decrease. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. A key lesson learned this year is that there is a deep connection between isolation, stress, and violence: the slow emergence from out pandemic lockdown has been accompanied by a disturbing rise in violence in Oakland and around the country. The other side of this lesson is two -fold: first that the crisis we have endured is as much a mental health crisis as a public health crisis, and there is a need to provide strong interventions at the community and individual levels to help peop le address the impact of the past year in their lives. The second part is that connectedness and accountability to one another remain key means of interrupting patterns of violence in the community. RJOY was called upon to provide restorative justice cir cles for victims and witnesses of tragic incidents of violence this year, holding open meetings for example for members of a youth football team who witnessed the murder of a player's father in a dispute with another spectator. 492 PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Box G: For programs that refer individuals with severe mental illness , please provide information for the categories below: G.1: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care within ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 5 G.2: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care outside ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 3 G.3: Types of treatment individuals were referred to (list types) (500 - character limit): Individual counseling, psychiatric medicine evaluation, individual psychotherapy, family therapy, group counseling, housing support, case management, housing, food and health care referrals G.4: Unduplicated number of individuals who participated in referred program at least one time : 15 G.5: Average duration of untreated mental illness in weeks : 12 G.6: Average number of days between referral and first participation in referred treatment program: 10 Box H: For programs that work to improve timely access to mental health services for underserved populations , please provide information on the categories below: H.1: Who is/are the underserved target population(s) your program is serving (e.g .

Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how d id the agency mitigate challenges? Note: The box has a 1,000 -character limit. The primary challenge we experienced during the year involved adapting working with our mini - grant recipients to modify their original project plans to develop a hybrid virtual platform and process for accomplishing initial goals to impact their targeted community. Working with our grantees we developed a parallel in -person platform that will launch per county guidelines. We also experienced some challenges balancing th e congregational trainings and community responses to the COVID -19 vaccine hesitancy within the African American community. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Flexibility is essential to respond to the very fluid landscape caused by COVID -19 restrictions and guidelines. We have and are working very closely with each MHFC to implement strategies that are unique to their faith community and accessible to the larger MHFC. Each faith community's capacity to imp lement virtual platforms for their congregants and community varies. The smaller congregations are more limited than the larger congregations. We are working with each faith center to assure that each is able to maximize resources and access information to bridge the challenges of social distancing and shelter in place guidelines. Additionally, there was a growing need to address the mental health implications raised by social justice issues, policing in the Black community amidst the political landscape of a post -Trump America. Mental health ministries within our congregations are carrying a heavy load.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We are particularly proud of the extent to which each church has embraced offering peer -based mental health support to their faith community, making the mini -campaign their own. One example is that a faith leader at one church wove together her experience as a nurse with stories of people in the Bible with mental health challenges. Additionally, every church representative said they initially joined the Hope & Faith Campaign to support others in their community, but unexpectedly reaped deep benefits from the program themselves. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. The biggest challenge during this time of operating remotely due to COVID -19 has been that participants are less likely to fill out our demographic and evaluation questionnaires online than they typically do when we meet in person. Some of this is due to technical challenges facing the church -based facilitators and participants. Nevertheless, through persistent outreach and technical assistance, we collected all of the data we needed. Box F : Program lessons learned of the past year. Note: 1,000 - character limit. The clearest lesson that has emerged from the Hope & Faith Campaign is that African American faith communities - both clergy and members - are hungry for tools, language, and opportunities to address the links between mental health and spirituality. The process of reflecting on and adapting the anti -stigma support group curriculum to the needs of their church community deepened the sense of ownership over the Hope & Faith mini -campaign by each church. The most common comment on evaluati on questionnaires was a version of \"more\" -- with participants asking for more information and peer support around mental health. This is a sharp contrast to the often -repeated stereotype that Black faith communities are not open to grappling with mental health.

The online group availability is helpful because due to health challenges I have been unable to regularly attend group [in -person].\" We have clear plans in development to reach more older adults through implementing virtual screenings to bring in more group members.

Box E: In the boxes below please provide a brief response to the following question. What were the challenges of the past year and how did your agency mitigate challenges? Note: The box has a 1,000 - character limit. Early on in SIP, we received feedback th at the virtual space would be challenging to older adults. To mitigate this, we set up a system with our social work students, making weekly check -in calls and setting up 1:1 contacts to problem -solve. After SIP, we became concerned about food insecurity s o we reached out and, using our food budget, sent out 53 cards (to 35 unduplicated community members). A note we received: \"Thank you for the card. There is no way that I can properly thank you enough. I want to volunteer to help you as a gift for all that you have done for LGBT senior citizens like me.\" We've received complaints from BIPOC group members, that they've found it difficult to bring their full services to the group space, citing microaggressions. To mitigate this lack of safety, we held listen ing meetings and have plans for structural changes and training improvements. Box F: In the boxes below please provide a brief response to the following question. What were the lessons learned of the past year? Note: The box has a 1,000 -character limit. The first lesson is how important it is to be ready to adapt to change in order to meet the needs of our clients. The second lesson is how vital it is to be ready to listen and respond to community members in order to better serve our BIPOC members.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Throughout FY 20/21, food insecurity has been an ongoing concern for several of our older adult group and community members. To assist our g roup members, we used our food budget (split from two programs: Peer Groups and Older & Out) to provide 30 $100 Safeway gift cards (to 13 unduplicated people), a total of $2,000 in December 2020 and in May 2021. Despite our success in our O & O groups tr ansitioning to Zoom, and the majority of our members continuing to connect through those spaces, some group members opted out, and/or became frustrated with the virtual platform. To mitigate this, we offered wellness check -in calls and emails, in which our BASW social worker intern provided to group members, dually serving as a \"break\" from Zoom, yet still providing connection, support, and linkages/referrals. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We've learned that the LGBTQIA+ older adults are resilient, reaching out and seeking connection, even through the virtual platforms. Consequently, having grown closer through O & O, some members started their own peer support group. We are learning how t o reach out to better serve BIPOC older adults. Additionally, we also learned that group members want more ways to connect and learn, thus we are planning diversity, equity, inclusion workshops in FY 21/22.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. FY 20/21 has further highlighted the deep commitment and passion for our facilitators as some groups have increased their meeting frequency from 1x/month to 2x, and from 2x/month to weekly gatherings. We are proud that the group MAPS (Metoidioplasty & Phalloplasty Support) started online. Their first meeting garnered 12 attendees, and since then have averaged 11! Additionally, four new groups are in development, showcasing the need and desire for support groups. They will begin in FY 21/22. From July 2020 to December 2021, we increased the frequency of consultation meetings from 1x/month to 2x. We offered quarterly DEI trainings on the topics of micro -aggressions , disability, justice and accessibility, and intersectionality, in which facilitators provided positive feedback on what they learned. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We've received concerns over group members not following group guidelines causing feelings of lack of safety. To mitigate these challenges, our directors of community programs and diversity, equity and inclusion held listening sessions and had 1:1 meeting s with involved parties. A complaint and feedback process with a restorative justice framework has been in development, and will be implemented in FY 21/22. Since we adopted our forms to be received digitally, individuals have had challenges completing a nd submitting our demographic forms. We are examining how we can ensure that our data is received in the upcoming FY. Throughout this pandemic, food insecurity has been an ongoing concern for some of our facilitators and group members. To assist our com munity members, we applied our food budget (Peer Groups and Older & Out) to provide 20 $100 Safeway gift cards (to 13 unduplicated people), worth $2,000. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. How do we continue to serve our community and the most marginalized? This is the question we consistently asked ourselves this past year. The COVID -19 pandemic brought a myriad of change and challenges, and our agency, including our dedicated facilitators, respond ed with fervor and steadfast commitment to ensure that the needs of the community were met. We learned: 1) Flexibility and creativity is crucial to approaching and meeting community needs; 2) The resilience, devotion, and compassion of our facilitators a llowed the program to flourish; and 3) That we may not reach some of our most vulnerable community members on virtual platforms, and for some group members there is no substitution for in -person services.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Community -based gun violence and Covid -19 have been dual pandemics suffered by East Oakland residents over the past year. In addition to providing Covid testing and vaccination services, Roots has also played an active role in determining the root causes of the community -based violence in an effort to form strategies to address vicarious trauma. In June, this was personified when Madison Park Primary Sch ool staff reached out to Roots seeking counseling services for one of their Transition Kindergarten students who witnessed her father take his own life with a firearm. From the Roots Sobrante Park Coordinator to CEO/Founder Dr. Noha Aboleta, Roots respond ed immediately to provide a health navigator to the family to help connect the student to a pediatric mental health clinician and to help the family with any other services should they request them. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The Covid pandemic was the overarching challenge to providing services over the past year. It made it necessary to cut back on most in -person outreach efforts, which limited Root's ability to increase its visibility in the community and made consistent client enga gement difficult. However, by moving community outreach and engagement efforts to virtual platforms, Roots was able to successfully remain immersed in the community, staying connected to the broader community and especially Root's clients by utilizing Zoo m, Google Meets, phone calls, and texting. Roots also successfully transitioned touchless produce distributions to home delivery services for families that relied on this resource. Box F: Program lessons learned in the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Although Covid has been described as a once -in-a-lifetime pandemic, it has allowed the Roots organization the ability to create alternative methods of client and community engagement. By utilizing virtual platforms, Roots was able to s tay connected to clients, community partners, and to engage in community outreach. However, recognizing that many community members lacked access to internet services and/or computers in the home, Roots developed \"touchless\" events that allowed for contac t with small groups following CDC guidelines. The adverse challenges brought on by the pandemic made it necessary to create more frequent check -in meetings between Roots community partners as well as within the organization between departments. This ensu red that the communicating of relevant information and data needed for reports, share outs, and event planning happened on a regular basis .

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Despite setbacks that COVID -19 caused, the HTA program was determined to promote its work and to host free virtual art workshops to get community members through these tough times. We learned the TAY community was especially struggling with Zoom burnout since all of their classes were on Zoom. Our goal was to create fun and interactive workshops for them to participate in, especially since they knew how to use the technology. After successfully conducting outreach to over 180 students from James Logan HS, Fremont HS, and Castlemont HS , we were able to recruit students for 3 separate art therapy groups. In partnership with the licensed art therapist, we were able to create a safe place for the TAY to express their emotions and to assist with their mental health. One of the TAY was str uggling with the death of her dog and the news that her grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. The therapy group was very helpful in getting her through this tough time. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate c hallenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. During the 21/21 FY, HHREC was forced to reassess and redevelop many of its operational systems. For the first time ever, we were unable to conduct in -person programming and were required to shut down our office. Majority of the year the staff had to take time to research ways to provide programming virtually and how to cater that to our specific audiences. Another big component that affected our daily work was outreach. As all in -person outreach was halted, th e program manager conducted outreach through phone calls, social media posts, email blasts, and countless follow ups. We are proud to say that through our innovative outreach efforts, we reached 180+ students/faculty during our online presentation to 5 hi gh schools in alameda county. For the seniors, unfamiliarity with using technology was a challenge. Nevertheless, the program manager assisted participants over the phone and was able to successfully register them for workshops. In total, we successfully offered 9 art workshops. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The ability to adapt to any condition is crucial and essential as a non -profit. In the past months, our community members not only had to battle the effects of a pandemic, but also make a life - changing decision on whether to get the COVID -19 vaccination or not. The decision was especially challenging for our community to make because of distrust with the U.S. government. Such events increased men tal health illnesses dramatically. This is a testament to the growing need for wellness programs and therapy that HTA offers to the community. With an increase in volume, our financial resources need to increase. We need to purchase software like video conferencing tools and other technology that allows us to conduct our programs and reach our audiences virtually. We also need training for the staff to learn about the technology and pass on the knowledge to our participants. The harder the times get, th e more vital programs like HTA are to rebuilding hope, resilience, and connection in our community. 548 PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Box G: For programs that refer individuals with severe mental illness , please provide information for the categories below: G.1: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care within ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): n/a G.2: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care outside ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): n/a G.3: Types of treatment individuals were referred to (list types) (500 - character limit): n/a G.4: Unduplicated number of individuals who participated in referred program at least one time : n/a G.5: Average duration of untreated mental illness in weeks : n/a G.6: Average number of days between referral and first participation in referred treatment program: n/a Box H: For programs that work to improve timely access to mental health services for underserved populations , please provide information on the categories below: H.1: Who is/are the underserved target population(s) your program is serving (e.g .

Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Recruiting both staff and new participants took a lot of strategizing and trying out new approaches. Many schools were busy with transitioning back into the classroom setting, which hindered outr each opportunities to a degree. Covid remained a barrier for reaching high school populations, as well as it prevented many people fr om wanting to travel for services. Many youth were interested in attending programming but were conflicted due to potentially finding jobs. We remedied these issues by travelling to various cities and delivering necessities to youth, either by tabling or by Covid -protocol approved presentations. We began creating new and diverse events to attract new participants with varied scheduled events to accommodate the time conflicts that occurred. A lot of new programs and initiatives were created, with some in cluding incentives, in attempts to bring in new youth. We were continuously providing virtual services and training throughout the entire time period. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Throughout the course of this time period, we have learned that innovation and creativity are our best approaches when it comes to attracting new participants. We have noticed that our most out - of-the-box ideas seem to have really stood out with our students. Events such as Fr ee Friday Movies, a segment in which we display new movies that are specifically chosen for our demographic, have been really popular with the new recruits as well as with follow resource providers who have become accustomed to sharing our events with thei r participants. Our participants seem to really enjoy the variety of programming and opportunities that our program provides. We have learned that we have a very diverse group of individuals who all have multiple layers of needs that can be tended to sim ultaneously. Our efforts to have a broad range of resources and outreach tactics have resulted in participants receiving aid in multiple areas of life and participating in more than one initiative.

The highlight of our successes this year include: encouraging intergenerational participation by providing 4 sch olarships for young African American girls to attend a Spring Break Empowerment Camp; putting more effort into reaching the family members of our participants. Many of our new participants have reported that they've been invited by current Be Still commun ity members. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. As programming for BWMWP has shifted online, challenges remain in the area of keeping participants interested in online e vents; PEI data collection, and having an adequate budget to providing incentives for greater participation. In order to keep participants interested, we had to create dynamic programming and think outside the box. Participants were heavily encouraged to share their ideas about program topics and guests. We were able to present different topics that were not overlapping and they received positive feedback. With social distancing and shelter -in- place regulations, there was little to no interaction with pa rticipants. Now, that regulations are lifting, there have been opportunities to provide community members with materials to promote mental health. Survey Monkey is now being used as a tool to collect data from participants and we expect greater participa tion. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The biggest lesson learned this year is the necessity to modify internal practices to expand outreach. With many agencies and community centers unable to operate fully, the focus was shifted to social media and word of mouth to drum up participation. Alo ng with expanding outreach, adjusting technology to meet the needs of running virtual events was a must.

Innovations Programs are not designed to support existing or ongoing programs or services, but rather to provide the mental health system with innovative demonstration projects that will support system change in order to increase access to services and improve client/consumer outcomes. An Innovation Project may introduce a novel, and/o r ingenious approach to a variety of mental health practices. Innovation Projects can contribute to learning at any point across the spectrum of an individual or family's needs relating to mental health, from prevention and early intervention to recovery s upports which includes supportive housing. An Innovative Project must meet the following criteria: 1. It is new, meaning it has not previously been done in the mental health field; Innovation Projects must promote new approaches to mental health in one or mor e of the following ways: Introducing a new mental health practice or approach, or Adapting an existing mental health practice or approach, so that it can serve a new target population or setting, or Modifying an existing practice or approach from another field, to be used for the first time in mental health. 2. It has a learning component, which will contribute to the body of knowledge about mental health. The learning component is represented in the application's Learning Question. Before INN funds can be spent on an INN project, the project idea must be vetted through a 30 -day public review process, approved by the County Board of Supervisors and then approved by the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC).

INN Project GoalsINNOVATION567 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG INN PROGRAM SUMMARIES PROJECT NAME : COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT TREATMENT TEAM (CATT) Project Des cription: Alameda County's existing system for responding to behavioral health crises in the community is inefficient in terms of expense, time and connecting clients to appropriate services. A vast majority of transports for individuals on a psychiatric hold are conducted by ambulance, which is expensive and requires law enforcement to wait for an ambulance to arrive. These calls are lower priority since they are generally not life -threatening, therefore increasing the wait time. In addition, the existing system transports an individual who qualifies for a 5150 involuntary hold, but those who do not qualify a re left on site without a connection to services. The goal of CATT is to im prove access to services in Alameda County by Combining efforts to significantly transform the response to behavioral crises in the community: The CATT program is using a mobile crisis transport staffing model that accesses technological support to enable the CATT program to connect clients to a wider and more appropriate array of services. The CATT team consists of: A licensed mental health clinicia n who is teamed up with an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in an unmarked vehicle specially designed for the CATT team. Together, this team can provide mental and physical assessment to individuals in crisis and transport them to appropriate services required in the moment; and Technology supports, ReddiNet, are used to identify current availability of beds and Community Health Records to provide the most accurate information about the client's physical and mental health history. By bringing together t he right staffing and the right technology, this innovative crisis response team s' goals are to reduce unnecessary 5150 holds, transportation to medical facilities for medical clearance, and the many hours of waiting for clients and first responders. In ad dition, the goal to increase access to appropriate services by connecting and transporting clients whether or not they are on a 5150 hold. In the first year of the CATT program, July 20, 2020 and July 20, 202 1, there were 1,185 requests for a CATT team response. A CATT team provided services to 758 clients (64% of all calls). Of the 758, 465 (62%) resulted in a client transport. Approximately 40 CATT responses per month avoid what would likely have been an unnecessary hospital t ransportation 5150 involuntary hold . The first -year evaluation final report has been completed by the CATT project evaluator, Public Consulting Group (PCG). A report brief was created by PCG and can be found in the appendix. The brief contains highlights and summary of the CATT program background and overview; process evaluation findings; outcome evaluation findings; response, transport, and involuntary hold dispositions; and program recidivism. CATT Summary of Challenges and Resolution s In the MHSA Update FY21/22, a number of challenges were identified and that ad ditional funding was going to be required to uplift the project for continued success.

PROJECT NAME : MENTAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY (MH TECH 2.0 ) Project Description: Technology is on the forefront of innovation for health monitoring, be it physical or mental health. Alameda County is fortunate to be located on these front lines of technology. The County's unique location in the Bay Area provides residents close proximity to not only Silicon Valley, but numerous other technology companies, big, small, and emerging. This parity provides the County wi th a community that tends to embrace new technology with enthusiasm. Mobile apps that focus on mental health can be used for a variety of purposes. They show great promise in promoting healthy behavior changes, increasing adherence to treatment programs, p roviding immediate psychological support, facilitating self -monitoring and reducing the demand for clinician time .1 As mobile applications grow in popularity among the general public, so does the potential to increase the quality of care and access to evid ence -based treatments through this technology. This two and half years (2.5) project is to provide a platform for individuals who reside in isolation, anonymity, or feel they have no place to go because of their situation. This project is offering new opportunities for outreach, and engagement, and support to the communities listed below by testing a technology -based delivery system for mental health solutions. There are five (5) grantees who have creat ed mental health mobile apps for four (4) identified populations. Of the five (5) grantees, two (2) of them are doing a single identified population while the remaining three (3) are doing multiple population s. The identified populations and the awarded grantees, Diversity in Health Training Institut e (DHTI); Korean Community Center of the East Bay (KCCEB); Mental Health Association for Chinese Communities (MHACC); NAMI; and Niroga Institute, are listed below with their respective targeted population 1 https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy -lifestyle/stress -management/in -depth/support -groups/art | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Targeted Populations Name of Grantee Name of Grantee 1) Caregivers of family members who suffer from a Serious Mental Illness (SMI) or a Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) KCCEB MHACC 2) Youth/Transition Age Youth (TAY) who are victims of trauma induced by violence, particularly gun violence DHTI Niroga Institute 3) Attempted Suicide Survivors MHACC NAMI 4) Immigrants, Asylees, and Refugees DHTI KCCEB Most of the grantees have websites and presentation videos posted on YouTube.

Almost a hundred people were in attendance fo r the day long remote event. MH Tech 2.0 Summary of Challenges and Resolutions MHSA division is looking to ACBH's executive team to review all the apps created in hopes that some , if not all of them can be folded into appropriate systems of care. If additional funding is approved from another funding stream, then the county will support the apps during the Fis cal Year 2022 -2023. Currently, ACBH has put in notification to MHSOAC that the county will be extending the project (no cost extension) for another seven (7) months until June 30, 2022. PROJECT NAME : Supportive Housing Community Land Alliance (CLA) Across the Bay Area, an inadequate supply of housing stock, particularly affordable housing, has contributed to rising home prices, rental rates, evictions, displacement and homelessness. Over the past five years, there have been significant declines in the number of licensed board and care facilities, residential hotels, and room and board facilities frequently utilized by individuals living on fixed incomes. Individuals with severe mental illness living on fixed Social Security disability incomes experience some of the greatest challenges in finding and maintaining housing in this region. Project Description: The Community Land Alliance (CLA), is based on a community land trust model, is a nonprofit, community -based organization designed to ensure community stewardship of land. Community land trusts are often associated with conservation efforts. However, the significant effort to ensure affordable long -term housing through this form of own ership is the CLA's mission. The alliance will acquire land and maintain ownership of it permanently. The CLA will enter into long -term, renewable leases with residents. If the resident leaves, the resident earns a portion of the increased property value. The remainder is kept by the trust, preserving the affordability and purpose of the property for future households. The proposed Innovation Project is promoting interagency collaboration in order for the Alameda County Supportive Housing Community Land Al liance to develop and maintain supportive housing units. ACBH will be partnering with Alameda County Housing and Community Development Department, housing and real estate legal and financial experts, consumer/client representatives, family member represent atives, and existing nonprofit affordable housing developers to develop a land trust focused on supportive housing that incorporates unique aspects in order to address local conditions. The CLA is looking to begin its partnership with the housing division in spring of 2022. This timing will parallel the exit of the project's grantee, Northern California Land Trust (NCLT). The subject matter expert, Burlington Associates, will continue its work with the project until December 2022. CLA Summary of Challenges and Resolution The Supportive Housing Land Alliance team has been working since Oc tober, 2020 . Currently the CLA has been incorporated and is finalizing its Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 1023 is used for the Internal Revenue Service to issue a determination letter or r uling letter that recognizes an organization's exemption from federal income tax. This is a final step for the CLA to become a full -fledged non -profit entity. Due to the pandemic, a fellowship was appropriated to support the deployed project managers and staff who were unable to reasonably fulfill duties while performing COVID response team duties. The county 's collaborat ion with the national nonprofit FUSE Corps creat ed an executive fellowship . The FUSE fellowship enabled ACBH to have extra support in regard to project management. The FUSE INNOVATION571 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG fellowship ended in October, 2021. However, the fellow has transitioned to working for the project as a consultant. Currently, the former fellow is assisting i n transferring project management to the identified executive director. As a consultant, t he former FUSE fellow continues to work closely with NCLT's project manager ; ACBH Subject Matter Consultant, Burlington Associates (BA) ; and ACBH staff to keep the C LA project on track . The former FUSE fellow's broad d eliverables that were completed included: Deliverable Results 1) Review current affordable housing efforts and engage with stakeholders Introduced County Supervisors, City Councilmembers, State Housing & Community Dev elopment staff to CLA Connected with supportive services and affordable housing organizations to learn ab out best practices and assess org anizations for future contracts Enlisted CLA in joining 2 Adult Residential Facilities advocacy and learning groups Established connections within Alameda Co unty Community Care Licensing to facilitate acquisition of ARFs that are closing/for sale. 2) Develop a comprehensive strategic plan to establish and sustain CLA Assisted in establish ing a mission and visio n statement Stewarded development of Equity Principles and statement for CLA Facilitated the launch of an Advisory Committee Drafted a short -term strategic plan for CLA Assisted with content and design of CLA website with support of NCLT, and BA 3) Ensure incorporation of CLA Facilitated election of founding board of directors Assisted in d rafting and approving organization 's bylaws Provided orientation and training for founding board members 4) Support long -term implementation Created draft program m anuals for Acquisitions, Property Management, and Supportive services Developed initial messaging and presentations Created a funding/financing sources database The project's next steps include a proforma; budgets for adult residential care facilities (ARF) and single - family home purchases; complete program manuals for property management and supportive services; and building sustainable financial model(s). Additional ly, plans on strategic partnership to acquire properties with nonprofits that are buying property, serving clients with SMI and delivering supportive services. There is continued pursuit to make request for information from organization to facilitate vario us models of partnership with existing organization for the SHCLA's prototype. Currently, MHSA is working on procurement of a project evaluator. The evaluator 's contract will run concurrently with the remaining two and half years (2.5) of the project beginning in July, 2022 . 572 INNOVATION MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FUTURE INN P ROSPECTS MHSA core values of community collaboration, cultural responsiveness, being consumer and family driven, system integration and resiliency and recovery focused all steer the direction that INN projects are to follow. MHSA staff has been vetting the many suggestions received to identify potential successful INN projects that will meet these core values, address the community priorities, and meet INN requirements. These potential projects will be presented to ACBH Systems of Care for further screening to ensure the potential projects additionally address external factors such as rates of crisis, substance use trends, community violence, trauma, staffing capacity and alignment with ACBH core values of Access, Consumer & Family Empowerment, B est Practices and Health & Wellness. There are three innovation ideas currently being developed to bring to the MHSOAC for approval within the next twelve (12) months .

Consumer Empowerment Using DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) Summary The DBT pr oposal came out of the County's Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) meetings during February - May 2020. During a larger webinar focus group , DBT online training was presented as an idea for uplifting peers. The webinar included stakeholders, and the County's P eers Organizing Community Change (POCC and formerly known as Pool of Consumer Champions) agreed that this would be a good pilot project to support .

This program is to provide new skills as peers e nhance their hire ability and increase their skills as peers when practicing within peer to peer groups . ACBH wishes to provide a learning environment that is removed from restrictive time and spac e. An online training program is able to provide an avenue that is self-paced, recovery -oriented mode of learning for peers to cultivate relationships with others committed to learning, practicing, educating others about, and building mastery of the 4 DBT skill sets: core mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion r egulation, and interpersonal effectiveness . There are several DBT techniques that coincide with the recovery philosophy that make it an excellent fit with peers: Validation is the non -judgment belief that consumers 'experiences are understandable and important. The peer practices validation by respecting the program participants self -knowledge; Radical genuineness is a validation strategy that believes in the client's strengths and capacity for change; and Collaboration which in DBT is viewed as a strateg y that strengthens the working relationship2 and coincides with peer process \"to arrive at a mutually acceptable plan for moving forward in the treatment process.\"3 It is these parallels in philosophy that makes DBT training to peers very appealing to refresh and broaden the skills of peer support specialists. A proposal summary is listed in the Appendix. Forensic Services Summary Alameda County faces the issue of people with serious mental illness (SMI) experiencing incarceration as one of the most prominent challenges faci ng the behavioral health and cranial justice communities. It is more likely that an individual will be booked into jail than be engaged in treatment thus creating jails as large mental health institutions. The two forensic proposals were born out of Alame da County Behavioral Health Services and Forensic System Redesign Plan Update , May, 20214. The two innovation plans , Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services and Alternative to Confinement Continuum of Services , arose out of the county's efforts to divert individuals with mental health challenges from the justice system into mental health services . Both of these innovation plans were developed for and by community stakeholders, including the County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force. 2. Peer -led Con tinuum of Forensic Services The Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services is a collection of four (4) components : Reentry Coaches, WRAP for Reentry, Forensic Peer Respite, and Family Navigation and Support . Three are peer -led and one is family focused. The p roject specifically seeks to : Support mental health consumers who are justice involved by helping them transition back into the community following an arrest or incarceration ; Identify and address the issues that led up to their arrest and/or incarceratio n, and connect with mental health and other services to support them in their recovery and reentry journey ; and 2 Ibid. 3 Deegan, P.

As a result of the continuum of services, we expect that individuals will experience fewer episodes of arrest and/or incarceration and will have increased participation in ongoing mental health and other services. 3. Alternatives to Confinement Con tinuum of Forensic Services The Alternatives to Incarceration Continuum of Forensic Services is a collection of three (3) services that work together and are intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from criminal justice system into mental health services. These services are Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment, Arrest Diversion/Triage Center, and Reducing Probation/Parole Violations. This continuum of care specifically seeks to divert individual from incarceration when: A mental health consumer who is forensically involved begins to exhibit early warning signs of a crisis with behaviors that may lead to police contact ; At the moment of police contact that may result in arrest, and The person has fallen out of compliance with their probation or parole and is subject to re -arrest. Using models from mental health and other disciplines, these three interventions collectively provide an opportunity to divert forensic mental health consu mers from police contact that may result in being detained, from being arrested or booked into the jail if detained, and from being re -arrested if unable to comply with the terms and conditions of their release. These priorities for diversion arose out of the sequential intercept mapping process with Alameda County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force and focus on preventing entry into the criminal justice system as well as promoting exit from the criminal justice system .

Client Vignette 1 (Success Stor y) Lieng Dao: Ohlone College Mental Health Advocacy Program I attended Ohlone Community College as a Biology major. However, I often have doubted this hardcore science major was a good fit for me. When the pandemic hit, I had Covid anxiety. For a while, I suffered from loneliness as I was isolating myself and had no human interaction other than my family. My mental health declined, and I realized there were many people who were also silently suffering alone. Hence, I wanted to learn more about mental health and lend a helping hand to those in need. Therefore, I dec ided to join the Mental Health Advocacy Program at Ohlone College and became heavily involved with other programs such as Mental Health Equity Scholar and CA Community College Smoke Free Campus Research study. I found these programs do meaningful work, are the most rewarding, and are great ways to give back to the community as we helped students who mentally struggled during a pandemic. I finally learned that my passion is in the public health field and decided to change my major. I have since transferred t o San Jose State University, looking back, I would not be where I'm at without Ohlone StepUp, a program that promotes student mental health, reduces stigma, and makes students feel supported, valued, and socially connected. One of the modules that stoo d out to me the most from the Mental Health Advocacy Program is self - care. We often overload ourselves and try to be productive all the time, but it is easy to overlook that selfcare is a form of productivity and it is incredibly important to take care of ourselves during this great pandemic. For my service -learning project, a component of the program, I held a workshop via Zoom for Ohlone Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) students who were burned out by online learning. Lockdown had taken a toll on students, so my workshop was a small gathering for everybody to share their thoughts, concerns, and express their hopes for the future. Through this valuable experience with Ohlone, I discovered that I enjoy serving others, giving back to the comm unity, and ultimately solidified my major choice. Despite the challenges of the COVID -19 pandemic, I was able to overcome and thrive when devoting my effort to serving others. Workforce Education and Training \"Equity In Action\"WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING577 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Making the switch from biology to public health wasnot all smooth sailing s ince there was a lot of pressure from my family who believed that Iwasted time taking a lot of biology major classes that are not needed for public health. But I was determined, and I felt happier learning about public health as it satisfied my intellectu al curiosity, and the desire to serve the community motivated me to work hard. An American entrepreneur Biggs Burke once said, \"Don't be afraid to start all over again. This time, you're not starting from scratch, you're starting from experience.\" I wa nt to send a message to my fellow college students to tell them that there are always more options for you to choose if you're willing to work hard for it.

Marisol lives in unincorporated Ashland with her mother and younger brother, who is 10 years old. She says, \"My mom has really bad anxiety and depression and it was worse when she didn't take her medication. It was hard going home from school and not knowing what was going to happen. School was like, my place to take a break from that.\" When the COVID -19 pandemic shut down schools in March, 2020, Marisol and her brother began participating in distance learning from home, and things became even more difficult. She helped her brother navigate his online classes while trying to manage her own high school workload. She tried her best to maintain stability in her household and support her mother. Marisol says it was these lived experience s that inspired her to pursue a career in mental health. \"Ever since I was little, I wanted to help people, like, as a nurse or something. But helping my mom with her mental illness made me realize that mental health is really important, and maybe I can ma ke a difference as a psychiatric nurse practitioner one day.\" Marisol credits FACES for the Future and the Bright Young Minds Conference for showing her that a career in mental health is possible. She says, \"My FACES Program Coordinator believes in me and is always there to support me. I could talk to him when I was stressed or if I had a question. And at the Bright Young Minds Conference, I got to see a lot of different kinds of professionals, even some who had been through some of the same things I've been through. We also learned about grief and how to manage stress. It made me feel like I can do it, so that's a good feeling.\" *Please note that at the student's request, some personal details have been altered to protect their privacy. 578 WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Client Vignette 3 (Success Story) Ahlam Mohammed : FACES for the Future Alumni FACES Program: St. Rose Hospital graduated from San Lorenzo HS, 2016 Education: currently enrolled in the Master's Program of Social Work, CSUEB Current Profession : Behavioral Health Tech, providing services to children with Autism Goal: Earn an LCSW, support and provide resources to troubled youth Ahlam Mohammed is a first -generation student who participated in the FACES for the Future St. Rose Hospital program.

FY 21/2 2 Progress Report : Alameda County Work force Education and Training (WET) local Loan Repayment Program (ACLRP) is in the process of transitioning into the State -funded Regional Workforce Education and Training (WET) Partnership Program (RP). WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING581 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY 21/2 2 Progress Report (cont'd): On March 24, 2020, Alameda County and California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA) executed a participation agreement (PA) to implement the Alameda County Loan Repayment Program with ACBH WET. This agreement allocated a maximum of $500,000.00 of funding, and spanned a program term of April 1, 2020 through May 31, 2022. On October 8, 2020, the Parties amended the ACLRP agreement by which CalMHSA agreed to continue to act as administrative and fiscal intermediary in the implementation of a second cycle of the AC LRP. This agreement allocated a maximum of and additional $500,000.00, for a total of $1,000,000, and extended the program term to February 28, 2023. Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) WET, in collaboration with CalMHSA, launched its first cycle of the local ACLRP in July 2020, and began a second cycle in July 2021. Of note, Alameda County is one of the only Greater Bay Area Region (GBA) countie s that has completed a round of loan repayment and is moving into round two, using State funds. effective from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2025. Currently, CalMHSA in contract with HCAI, is serving as the administrative and fiscal agent for the WET RP and coordinating with the GBA Counties to establish partnership agreements. Alameda County is working with CalMHSA on transitioning the ACLRP cycle 2 applicants into the WET RP in order to take advantage of the existing State WET RP funding. CalMHSA is am ending the current ACBH Participation Agreement (PA) and morphing it into a PA that works for the WET regional partnership (RP) activities. Every five years, OSHPD develops a WET plan to address specific workforce needs. The State allocates funding to the five Regional Partnerships across California, including the Greater Bay Area Region based on the MHSA funding formula. The 2020 -2025 State Workforce Education and Training (WET) program aims to address the shortage of mental health practitioners in the public mental health systems (PMHS) through a framework that engages Regional Partnerships and supports individuals through five categories including: Pipeline Development, Loan Repayment Program, Undergraduate College and University Scholarships, Clinical Master and Doctoral Graduate education stipends, and Retention Activities. Based on local Alameda County WET programming and previous Mental Health Service Act Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) information, Alameda County WET opted to implement the Loan Repayment, the Community College Behavioral Health Career Pipeline and the Scholarship and Mentoring Programs for undergraduate students following OSHPD's framework. The total OSHPD grant allocation for Alameda County is $2,102,701.02 from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2025. There is a matching amount required for all GBA participating counties and Alameda's total County Match Fund requirement under the 2020 -2025 WET RP is $521,722.91 . Upon signed agreement, CalMHSA will collect all lo cal matching funds. Alameda County intends to reallocate funds previously allocated to the ACLRP toward the OSHPD WET RP for the purpose of fulfilling its County Match Fund requirement. Alameda County will use the existing ACLRP contract funds (2nd cycle , FY21 -22) with CalMHSA towards Alameda's match amount of $521,722.91. 582 WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 2. Training/Technical Assistance Program Description: Provides a coordinated, consistent approach to training and staff development. Develops, researches and provides a broad array of training related to mental health practice; wellness, recovery and resiliency; peer employment and supports and management development. ACBH Training Unit FY20/21 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges: From the period of July 1, 2020 - June 30 2021, the Training Unit provided or collaborated on a total of 73 training activities, thereby training 1,926 ACBH and contracted provider (CBO) staff. hours to LCSWs, LMFTs, LPCCs, LEPs, Addiction Profession als, and RNs and 186 CE hours to psychologists. Training topics covered a variety of issues including, but not limited to, Mental Health First Aide; Adult and Youth Suicide Assessment & Intervention; Preventing, De -Escalating, and Managing Aggressive Behavior in Behavioral Health Settings; Tobacco Cessation Interventions; Legal and Ethical issues; and trainings related to Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS). Provided Trauma Informed Systems ( TIS) o verview presentation for NAMI East Bay Speakers' meeting and for the African American Family Outreach Project members. Beginning in February 2021, the training officer has worked with East Bay Agency for Children, Trauma Transformed (T2), on a TIS curriculum revision project that will be completed by the end of December 2021. The intent of the revision is to create curriculum that is more relevant and responsive to current issues . Persons involved in the curriculum revision project include the T2 TIS Implementation & Evaluation Coordinator, the ACBH training officer, ACBH TIS coordinator, ACBH TIS trainers, and peers and family members of ACBH services. The peers and family members are paid a stipend for their work on the project. TIS 101 training p rovides foundational knowledge of TIS principles and helps participants understand how trauma and stress impact developing bodies and brains, communities, organizations, and systems. Provided trainings related to trauma informed care including \"Surv iving Compassion Fatigue a.k.a Secondary and Vicarious Trauma\"; \"Understanding Nervous System Regulation and Culturally Sensitive Restorative Practices for Providers and Clients in Times of Crisis.\" The training \" Trauma Informed Standards, Practices, and S trategies for Healthcare Organizations: Safety Talk in the Context of CLAS and Cultural Competency \" was provided by the Office of Ethnic Services and supported by the training institute. Fourteen (14) of the trainings were hosted by the Office of Ethnic Services of which twelve related to one or more of the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS). Some examples include \" Recovery Process of African Americans: Seeking Wellness during COVID -19 Re -opening Phases\"; \"Working with Interpreters/Language Lines for Behavioral Professionals\"; \"People Power Equals Change: Lessons from a Hyperlocal Community Assessment of Opioid Use and Community Well -Being\"; \"What is Wellness: An Indigeno us Perspective on Healing and Connection\"; \"The Crooked Room: Racism, Adversity, and African American Health\"; \" Trauma Informed Standards, Practices, and Strategies for Healthcare Organizations: Safety Talk in the Context of CLAS and Cultural Competency. \" WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING583 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Provided five (5) trainings in Adult Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and two (2) Youth MHFA trainings thereby certifying 75 ACBH and provider staff. An additional six (6) MHFA trainings were provided to the community including two (2) that were provi ded to 23 staff of the Fremont, Union City, and Albany City Library branches. Provide continuing education credits for the California State University East Bay two -year post graduate Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health certificate program in wh ich 15 students are enrolled. Hosted the April 2021, Greater Bay Area Mental Health and Education Workforce Collaborative funded Virtual Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) instructor's training and sponsored eight (8) attendees. The eight attendees incl uded two (2) ACBH staff, four (4) staff from MHSA funded contracted agencies with programs for the Underserved Ethnic Language Population (UELP), and two (2) persons from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Tri- Valley. All eight instructors are now certified to teach Adult MHFA virtually. Training outcomes are measured using self -administered evaluations. Each training proposes measurable learning objectives to be achieved by the end of the training. Following the training, attendees evalua te whether the objectives are met using a Likert scale from 1 -5 (strongly disagree to strongly agree). They also evaluate the training content, instructor, technology, accessibility, and program administration. At the end of every training, participants ar e encouraged to complete an evaluation and if they want continuing education credit, it is required. For all trainings, evaluation data results indicate all outcome measures are being met on an average of at least a 4 or 5 of the Likert scale, with 5 being \"strongly agree.\" Challenges: Due to the majority of staff working remotely, both county and contracted provider, all trainings have been provided virtually which presents technical challenges for both the presenter and participants. Although the evaluation results regarding technical aspects are positive overall we know that some participants were not able to either log in or stay for an entire training due to connectivity problems. For the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) trainings, the transition from in person trainings to the onlin e platform presents a challenge and limitation because participants need to complete 2 -hours of pre -work prior to the instructor -led online training. For all scheduled trainings an average of 2 -4 out of 20 registrants did not complete the prework. There ar e always a number of no shows for in person trainings as people's schedules and circumstances change, but the requirement of prework plus the ability to use an online platform presents additional hurdles for persons who want to get certified in MHFA. With trainings moving to online platforms we were faced with the challenge of needing to have shorter trainings, which means there are less continuing education hours available. For trainings that required 6 - hours of instruction, we addressed this by offerin g the trainings in two days, but that is also challenging for some staff schedule -wise. There continues to be challenges related to the Learning Management System (LMS), SumTotal, that was purchased in 2019. Although there was a plan to \"go -live\" with the new system in May 2020, because of system glitches and challenges with getting user accounts for the 4,000+ contracted provider staff, as of November 2021, the system is still not fully functional for Behavioral Health. We have used the system in a limite d capacity for all ACBH staff to complete HIPAA compliance trainings which is a success, but hope to be able to use the system fully by January 2022. 584 WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY21/22 Progress Report : For FY 2021 /22, beginning July 1, 2021: As of February 9, 2022, the Tr aining Unit provided or collaborated on a total of 32 training activities, thereby training 959 ACBH and contracted provider staff. Provided/offered 130 continuing education (CE) hours to LCSWs, LMFTs, LPCCs, LEPs, Addiction Professionals, and RNs and 97 C E hours to psychologists. Training topics were provided on a variety of issues including adult and youth suicide assessment & intervention, mental health first aid, de -escalating and managing aggressive behavior, tobacco cessation interventions, and trainings related to trauma, responding to crisis, and using a telehealth platform. By the end of the 21/22 fiscal year, eight (8) Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) trainings will have been provided virtually for 140 - 160 county and contracted provider staff. Five (5) of the trainings are Adult MHFA and three (3) are Youth MHFA. Continue the collaboration with California State University East Bay, providing continuing education credit for their two -year (January 2021 -December 2022) post graduate Infan t and Early Childhood Mental Health certificate program. An overview of Trauma Informed Systems (TIS) will be included in the new ACBH employee onboarding training. All newly hired ACBH staff will attend the onboarding and in addition to receiving the TI S overview they will be encouraged to attend other trainings, such as Mental Health First Aid, the 3.5-hour TIS training, and CLAS trainings. Continue to maintain provider accreditation and offer required continuing education (CE) credit for Licensed Clinical Social Workers, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors, Licensed Educational Psychologists, Licensed Clinical Psychologists, Registered Nurses, and certified Addiction Professionals. The cur rent Training Officer has been in the position since July 2017 and will be retiring from the County in January 2022. Following her departure, the WET manager will begin the hiring process and it is expected that the position will be filled by March of 2022 . As part of organizational structural changes within ACBH, in October the Workforce Education and Training (WET) team transitioned to be under the leadership of the Office of the Behavioral Health Director. The director's vision is to have a more coordi nated effort for trainings across the department and to develop a departmental training plan. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING585 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY22/23 Anticipated Changes: Under the direction of the ACBH director, the training unit will be actively involved in onboarding over 100 new staff that will be hired to fill positions in the Forensic, Diversion and Re -Entry System of Care. In the transition from AC Care Connect to CalAIM additional training needs are anticipated for county and contracted provider staff. This would include training on Enhanced Care Management and how to effectively serve the populations of people experiencing homelessness, justice involved individual s, and those who use multiple systems of care. With Workforce Education and Training (WET) being under the leadership of the Office of the Behavioral Health Director, it's anticipated that there will be more coordination of trainings being offered by the various ACBH units and programs. There will also be department -wide trainings, such as monthly Specialty Toolkit trainings which will be brown bag lunch trainings on specific topics and procedures. Once the new Learning Management System (LMS) is functi oning we are excited about the features available to ACBH and contracted provider staff. SumTotal will provide a data management system for self- registration and tracking of instructor -led training, online, informal, and social learning which supports career growth and development. This new LMS includes significant additional features, improved options for managers, and has a more advanced user experience. It will also provide an opportunity to compile and analyze evaluation data and measure outcomes mor e efficiently. In response to the shelter -in-place order all trainings moved to an online platform. Although the transition took time to develop and time for staff to adjust, it will be beneficial to continue to offer online trainings in addition to in p erson trainings. It has been a goal of ACBH to offer online trainings to reduce staff travel time needed and allow for more accessibility. Additionally, the new LMS system provides a platform allowing the ability to launch and learn on mobile devices. We a re excited about the opportunity to utilize this function to be able to provide online learning content including, but not limited to, courses, videos, Training materials, etc. The curriculum revision of the 3.5 -hour Trauma Informed Systems training will be complete by 2022. With the support of the ACBH Director and the Health Equity Officer, we anticipate that all ACBH staff will be highly encourage d to complete the training.

With the Consultant Psychiatrists having access to and understanding of the County's specialty behavioral healthcare system, they continue to be a bridge for care coordination for Alameda County's primary care Safety Net System. The program continues to help improve service capacity in the primary care clinics by helping their medical and behavioral health providers improve skills and comfort level when diagnosing and treating primary care patients with complex behavioral health condition s. During the last six months of PY S, the Primary Care Psychiatric Consultation Program (PCPCP) staff were able to provide 2,683 consultations services and 37 training presentations to primary care providers and behavioral health clinicians in nine Alameda County Community Health Centers; After the completion of the Sixth Cohort of primary care providers attending the UC Davis, School of Psychiatry, Primary Care Psychiatry Fellowship Program in December, 2020, the eight Alameda County FQHCs and the Alameda Health Consortium decided that a better utilization of the County's Primary care Integration funds would be to have the ACBH Office of the Medical Director's Primary Care Psychiatric Consultants to provide their primary care providers and behavioral health clinicians on -site trainings and individual consultation services as needed. During 20/21, the Primary Care Psychiatric Consultation staff were able to provide 2,683 consultations services and 37 training presentations to primary care providers and behavioral health clinicians in eight Alameda County Community Health Centers and one HIV Specialty Care Health Center. With the Primary Care Psychiatric Consultants being ACBH staff, they have also helped to improve care coordination by assisting Safety Net primary care providers and behavio ral health clinicians learn how to properly complete the required screening documents for the ACBH, ACCESS Office that will facilitate a high need patient's approved admission into the County's Specialty Mental Health or SUD Systems of Care.

FY21/22 Progress Report : Ohlone College completed its fourth cohort of the Mental Health Advocacy Program which trains students on a wide range of mental health topics and support their planning and delivery of service learning projects to promote mental health to their affinity groups. This semester, student part icipants came from three affinity groups that are underserved or experience disproportionate rates of mental health challenges: EOPS (Extended Opportunity Programs and Services), Umoja Scholars Program (a learning community for students of African descent ), and Puente (a Latinx student learning community) . This fourth cohort of the Mental Health Advocacy Program was a success by far the most stellar and engaging group Ohlone have had. Being in person, which has not been the norm in the past twenty months , made a significant difference in the delivery of content, group discussion, and students' reception to the material, each other, and the program's objectives. Students provided constructive feedback on how to improve future training modules and program c omponents, particularly service learning projects. To address sustainability of this program - a noncredit program proposal has been completed and uploaded into the college's Curricunet system; we are waiting for the proposal to be added to an upcoming Cu rriculum Committee agenda for review and subsequent vote. The Alameda County College Mental Health Student Navigator Program has completed its first full semester of the second pilot year -long workforce development training pilot program where students l earn about the community mental health system to provide \"case management\" support for their peers to transition from campus -based care to community -based care. The cohort is diverse, and students are committed to the work and feel they are helping their p eers get connected to services. Funded by Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) Workforce Education and Training (WET), the Navigators program was able to recruit a strong and diverse cohort of ten students representing three schools: Berkeley City Col lege, Chabot College, and Ohlone College. In an effort to integrate student engagement programs at Ohlone, mental health navigators were invited to produce a special 'Navigator Take Over' podcast series as part of Ohlone's 'Note to Self' podcast program. The student leaders worked together well i n planning their selected topics and organized each episode in an outline to increase the quality of each recording session. Students enjoyed their experience and appreciated the opportunity to elevate the navigator program on the podcast airwaves.

Each Fellow will receive six shadowing or guest lecture opportunities overall over the course of their year in th e program. Two of the six or 33% of the guest lecture presentations have been completed. Four Fellows are transitioning into direct practice in January for the first time as planned. One other will begin in February. Two Fellows will not complete coursewor k until later in the spring but still should by the time they graduate from the Academy. Case Management: All six Fellows from the first cohort first went through a MAPS assessment, BRL's own internal assessment tool. This assessment covers mental health, academic, physical, and other areas where urgent needs can be highlighted for case managers. Fellows completed 34 sessions of ca se management and or therapy support overall. Fellows received an average of six sessions each of case management and/or individual therapy support. Categories of support have included grant applications, stability supports, mental/emotional care, college applications, job readiness and goal setting. Challenges: The first challenge would be the Covid -19 epidemic. This has had far reaching impacts to all in terms of how staff and youth interact as well as how services can be delivered. BRL's initial semester was through telehealth primarily and is transitioning to a hybrid model. TAY are eager to engage in person but not all TAY desire to or have received vaccination. Telehealth has performed extremely well, but nothing beats the in -person engagement. As the program move s into the spring , BRL is looking for the program pieces best suited for in -person engagement while still vigilant in terms of staff and participant safety. The program started looking at the case management and music production program components as spaces that could be more in person and the classes to continue via telehealth, all while new variants and safety protocols evolve. This program was funded as of July 1, 202 1, therefore BRL needed to launch the program while still working on startup objectives such as recruitment of staff and curriculum development. As a result, the program had to push back intended August start to Sep tember. The current staff have worked above and beyond to fill all the vacant roles and responsibilities. BRL anticipate s the program in the spring to run more at capacity due to fuller staffing and having more of the programming already in place. Recruitment, or to be more specific, finding precise recruitment partners for long term collaboration toward building sustainable pipelines for TAY, is an ongoing process. Some of the most interesting things that came up were participants' need for stability and mental/emotional supports while very much needing to activate as gainfully employed adults. Whereas the program is built for youth who actively seek to be in human services, for some of the particip ants, this is the first time they are being introduced to human services as a field. They are often getting started on their learning journey of professional fields or professionalism. The program is also seeing that more high schools offer experientia l/internship models earlier. BRL program is designed developmentally for young adults but the captive audience seems to present earlier in these alternative model High Schools. BRL is continuing to look at ways to build into WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING591 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG these schools through corr esponding Hip Hop Therapy prevention programs and build the pipelines from three to five high schools and colleges. Client Impact: Client E joined our 1st cohort in September through referral from a non -profit that supports youth and TAY from the foster care system. He completed their cycle of services with the agency before joining ours. They were consistent with the classes and ske ptical and slightly defensive in regards to the case management and individualized therapy support. As the program approached the end of the 12 weeks of classes, E shared with the lead clinician that they didn't think they could continue with the program . They were dealing with circumstances that were contributing to extreme feelings of overwhelm and depression. Struggling with the violent loss of a close friend, abrupt termination from their other job, toxic family members with substance struggles, abusive romantic interactions, plus trying to stay on top of her own struggles with alcohol use came to a head when she shared with our clinician thoughts of suicidal ideation. With all this going on, they were going to exit the BRL program because they didn 't feel like they were able to show up in a way that would have us disappointed with them. This would not be the first time a youth would choose to disengage because of misplaced feelings of shame, not realizing that the BRL program is built to support du ring turbulent times. Program case management team including clinical supervisors collaborated on a treatment plan to address their ideation, dangerous triggers, and logistical support with the approaching holiday season and holiday break from services. BRL case manager and clinician met with E and together crafted a plan outlining triggers, supports, and check ins during the break with the Lead Clinician and Academy Dean during the two -week holiday from before Christmas Eve and after New Year's. He struggled somewhat with the intensity of the support but verbally expressed their love of the program and the supports that they received. He shared that they wanted to commend us on not giving up on them and encouraged us especially when working with foster youth to continue to be persistent because you never know when that support will land with the youth at the exact time it's needed. FY21/22 Progress Report : BRL anticipate s engagement of twelve participants in the spring and continuing outreach and recruitment of the remaining eight fellows before the end of the fiscal year. BRL anticipate s filling any vacant staff positions and solidifying curriculum by the end of the fiscal year as well. FY2022/23 Program or Service Changes : No major changes are anticipated in regards to recruitment, just more articulation and confirmation of directed site collaborators for High Schools, Colleges, and Community Based Organizations. So far, confirmed collaborations with assigned site partners will be Met West High School, Oakland School of the Arts, Oakland High School, First Place for Youth, and Expressions Technical School. BRL will continue to work with the Peralta Community College school system. The Pathway Program is one third of the wo rk that BRL provides. The other two programs are care provider trainings for others organizations as well as direct work with community youth. BRL hope s to solidify the bridge between the direct practice and the Pathway to Work programming. BRL also have decided to raise the case management minimum interactions to two times a month as well as scheduling spaces within their committed work times on Tuesdays and Thursdays to engage in case management and/or individualized therapy. BRL is launching the case management before the start of classes so that participants can become accustomed to their full schedule as soon as possible 592 WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Early Childhood Mental Health Postgraduate Certificate Program FY 20/21 Outcomes , Impacts , and Challenges: MHSA WET provided funding in FY18/19 to launch a two -year pilot Early Childhood Mental Health Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program at Cal State University, East Bay. The overarching goal is to build capacity in a culturally diverse earl y childhood mental health workforce to meet the social, emotional and developmental needs of young children, ages birth to five, and families in Alameda County. In FY 2018/19 Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) and California State University East Bay (CSUEB) launched the pilot Early Childhood Mental Health Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program which focused on the developmental foundations of infant and early childhood mental health. The program's content examined the developmenta l foundations of relationship -based clinical work between infants, young children, families, and caregivers, and combined theory and practice. The curriculum places a strong emphasis on working with families from diverse cultural, racial, and ethnic backgr ounds, which is especially important given Alameda County's socioeconomic, racial, cultural, ethnic, and immigrant diversity. The program began with a cohort of fifteen (15) students, fourteen (14) of whom were subsidized by Mental Health Services Act Workforce, Education & Training (MHSA WET) funds and one (1) paid out of pocket. Of the fifteen (15) students, eleven (11) were clinicians of color, ten (10) spoke one of the identified threshold languages, and all fifteen (15) worked in Alameda County early childhood community -based organizations (CBOs). In year two (FY 19/20), Cohort 1 saw the fifteen (15) members of the original cohort return intending to complete the second year of the program. However, one (1) student dropped in Fall 2019 and fourteen (14) of the fifteen (15) students completed the pr ogram in December 2020. Year two (2020) presented new challenges resulting from COVID -19. COVID -19 required the development of new teaching methods to address safety concerns. In response, class instruction was moved online (i.e., TEAMS) which ensured on going instruction. For administrative coordination, ACBH staff helped to strengthen the reporting systems used by creating a TEAMS administrative page to track requisite student information (i.e., attendance, class participation, grades). This tracking fo rm was also used for grading. In year two, ACBH had a leadership transition from retiring Margie Padilla, Director of Early Childhood Program, who helped develop the program, to Dr. Clyde Lewis, EPSTD Coordinator. Dr. Lewis was selected to provide on -goin g program management. ACBH worked with CSUEB to develop a plan for student recruitment. These efforts were successful in providing information about the program and the application pool increased considerably from the first cohort recruiting efforts. Th e second cohort had a competitive application process and will also have fifteen (15) students. The range of interest from CBO employees increased and as such, there is a wider range of organizations represented. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING593 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG In year three (FY 20/21), a new second cohort of 16 students was recruited (22 applicants and 16 accepted into the program). The recruitment process started in Spring of 2020. In the spirit of collaboration, meetings were conducted with CYASOC Leadership Team and the CSUEB Cohort Instructor t o review the recruitment and selection criteria, the steps and resources needed and the timeline. A rubric was developed to assess students that meet criteria. The planning team also discussed lessons learned from the last cohort cycle to apply best and improving practices for the new cohort. Cohort announcements focused on individuals who focus on early childhood skill development as well as exhibit cultural competencies that can meet the unique needs of the diverse Alameda County. child and family pop ulations. Announcements were distributed to the Alameda County network of service provider agencies, to networks of CSUEB staff, and to employees and interns at current clinic and outpatient service sites. Program Evaluation : The program was evaluated by a tool developed by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland in the first year of the pilot. In the second year of the cohort, the corresponding evaluation survey was administered by the CSUEB Faculty Member and Instructor. T he evaluation focused on methodological approaches used for student training. To this end, the evaluation provides ongoing feedback for managers to ensure continuous quality improvement. To see the full report and evaluation see: Appendix D -3 MHSA WET: CSU East Bay Early Childhood Program Annual Report FY 22/23 Anticipated Changes: This program has been approved through the end of the second cohort in which participants will graduate in December 2022. The future direction of the program will be discussed in the coming months towards the goal of sustaining the program beyond this pil ot.

FY22 -23 Anticipated Changes: In FY 202 2-23, ACBH will not be able to host a fellow as UCSF was unable to recruit a participant for the Program. ACBH Office of the Medical Director (OMD) and WET have been exploring with Stanford School of Psychiatry to develop a Public Psychiatry Rotation Program beginning FY22 -23. ACBH Graduate Internship Program Manage and facilitate the onboarding process for C hildren Young Adult System of Care (CYASOC) , Adult and Older Adult System of Care (AOASOC) , Adult Forensic Behavioral Health and Vocational Rehabilitation, Nursing, and other programs/units within the ACBH department. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic there was a need to pivot all internship program operations to electronic and virtual platforms. The shift to a mostly virtual internship program was swift and necessary. Provide updates and revise documents to the \"Onboarding Resource Manual\" which was created to provide guidance, structure, and compliance for the internship program. Develop necessary forms and/or documents as needed to address new program policies, procedures and applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards of practice.

FY21 -22 Progress Report : Developing improved system to collect and manage training and program evaluation results to inform program planning, intern recruitment, placement and follow up. Continuing to collect and manage training and program evaluation results to inform program planning, intern recruitment, placement and follow up. Facilitation of the post -internship program evaluation forms for data preservation. This effort seeks to gather information from the intern perspective for continuous enhancement of internship program. Improvement of onboarding efforts, in conjunction with s ystem leaders, to create standard guidelines, practice, and protocol for onboarding interns for all systems of care. Challenges : Having the ability to pivot during high stress times of the pandemic was imperative Working with county counsel to find creative ways to communicate new COVID -19 guidelines for amendments to practicum agreements with schools Creating bandwidth across the systems of care impacted teams pose challenges as individual staff will take on new functions to manage tasks, responsibilities, and people within their programs to keep the new process functioning with integrity. While diversity is promoted as an essential priority, there continues to be a challenging lack of Latino and especiall y African American male intern applicants. Increased cultural competence training for interns and intern supervisors is a need that has been a challenge to fulfil with existing internal training capacity. Additional funding (coordination and collaboration with WET Institute and Ethnic Services Department) by ACBH would allow content expertise (outside of Alameda County staff) to train on cultural competence and other subject matter. Recruitment challenges include identifying potential interns who speak ACB H's threshold languages and who reflect Alameda County's cultural diversity and committing adequate staff to cover two -day orientation events. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING597 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY22 -23 Anticipated Changes: Social media presence is imperative for the internship program to better communicate and promote program.

Update and enhance internship website to reflect most current intern assignments available to support students in their program search. Korean Community Center of the East Bay - Graduate Internship Program FY20/21 outcomes , impacts , and challenges : Korean Community Center of the East Bay (KCCEB) , Graduate Internship Program is funded by MHSA WET. The internship program trained 6 MSW students for MHAP's first cohort (3 first -year and 3 second -year). Interns came from UC Berkeley, CSU East Bay and University of Southern California. For two -thirds of the students, KCCEB was their first experience in a primarily Asian -serving organization. In addition to English, interns offered serv ices in Cantonese, Mandarin, Khmer, Korean and Tagalog. Interns were involved in various KCCEB programs including Senior Case Management, Social Services, and Prevention/Early Intervention (UELP) Programs. Students were placed on -site at KCCEB as well as two school -based sites (Alameda Science and Technology a nd San Leandro High School). They learned about the broader system of care and mental health coordination through referrals with local partners (e .g., IWAY, Peralta Community Colleges, Family Bridges, Kent Gardens Senior Community, and Alzheimer's Associat ion). Interns provided mental health outreach and engagement, senior wellness checks (100 Korean seniors and 50 Chinese seniors), helped to develop mental health innovation (mobile app project for Chinese caregivers and Community Thrive Korean small busi ness relief) and had one -on-one case management and PEI clients (total of 70 clients). First -year students held a case load of 8 -12 clients and second -year students held caseloads of 10 -15 clients. Finally, our interns had a unique opportunity to be active ly involved in advocacy efforts including the Behavioral Health Equity Coalition, Senior Prevention Injury Partnership, East Bay Immigrant and Refugee Forum, API Coalition, State Oral Health Alliance, Health Justice Network, and California Pan -Ethnic Healt h Network. Interns' support was especially critical during the pandemic and anti - Asian violence to ensure that our seniors' needs were being met and that they did not fall through service cracks. Interns were also actively involved in ensuring more visibil ity and representation for behavioral health services were allocated to Asian and Pacific Islanders. KCCEB developed a curriculum including video trainings, individual and group learning components and handouts with 6 components: 1) Core Competency for M ental Health Practitioner (Social Work 9 Competencies); 2) Foundations for the Organization and Program 1 (Social Services, Case Management, AB74, UELP/PEI, MAA + Progress Notes, Clinician's Gateway); 3) Supervision and Training (Individual, Group, Training topics: Anxiety, Depression, Trauma -informed Care, Self -Harm, Suicide Assessment, Culturally responsive counseling and interpretation) + Outside trainings; 4) Advocacy; 5) Direct Service (Roles, Settings, Client Assessments, UELP Reporting Requir ements); 6) Evaluation. 598 WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Challenges: COVID: Most interns saw their clients virtually or through the phone. Only in exceptional cases were clients allowed to meet in person at the KCCEB office. On the positive side, KCCEB was able to have interns from Southern California because in- person con tact was not offered due to the pandemic. KCCEB also had our online call platform with Salesforce that made reaching out to clients more seamless. The challenge of COVID was especially felt among working with youth for whom virtual sessions were less than ideal. Students were not always available during intern availability, had limited privacy in their homes for therapeutic sessions and faced school stress with virtual classes. As such, interns spent a lot of time following -up and chasing down clients which took away from available time in direct clinical settings. KCCEB anticipated 10 -12 h ours of supervision and training time for the MHAP program based on prior experience in training programs. In reality, the MHAP training program took 20 -25 h ours per week . Students seemed to need more time learning foundational skills, wanted more shadowing time for assessments, care plan development, counseling and/or collaborative/advocacy or community -based multidisciplinary team meetings. Finally, there was a lot of c linical documentation and paperwork needed for different programs and three different school sites. FY21/22 Progress Report : KCCEB is hosting 5 students this year from CSU East Bay, Dominican University, and Palo Alto University. Three interns are focusing on school -based services at Alameda Science and Technology and San Leandro High School, API community children, families, and adults and two interns are supporting Korean seniors. KCCEB is operating a hybrid -model so that some interns are seeing clien ts in -person. One of the challenges we are seeing this year is an increase in mental health service needs both from youth and from the Korean community. The pandemic has impacted peoples' mental health and we are seeing more complex cases. Compared to last year, we are seeing an increase in referrals. In just the first half of our contract year, case numbers surpassed last FY (35 so far, last year was 22). In the school site settings, we are seeing students experiencing anxiety, depression, and other trauma s in returning to school or being in public settings, grief and loss of people who have passed away or transitions with people leaving home, family arguments and stress, etc. One thing we notice about our Asian students is that they are more likely to be r eluctant to share with their parents that they need mental health support. As we have a UELP contract, we are able to take students who are not asked to obtain parental consent. This is the first year we have received self -referrals from KCCEB for mental health counseling among LEP Korean clients including three seniors and one youth. In the past, community referrals have been through proxy or indirect methods (i.e. friends or fam ily calling on behalf of other individuals) due to stigma. Community members self- referring is an indicator that there is a dire need in the community, to the level that individuals cannot wait on seeking help. Our long- term goal is to develop a pipeline where we increase the number of API mental health professionals serving the LEP and immigrant community. We are delighted that our former and current interns are pursuing their careers in community mental health, joining non -profit organizations that focu s on serving marginalized communities to continue their career path. Among our second -year graduates, two have gone into community -based organizations (Family Justice Center in Contra Costa Co and a senior center in LA). We also have a Korean -speaking int ern who initially started volunteering with KCCEB to help with WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING599 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG senior wellness assessments during COVID -19, then joined as a graduate student intern to build her clinical skills, and will continue her mental health practice as a staff member of KCCEB upon graduation. FY22/23 Anticipated changes : Currently, the MHAP Program falls under the direct responsibility of the Program Director. We learned that in order to run a robust program, individual and group supervision takes twice as long as anticipated as interns require more clinical support and oversight in areas of their direct work, learning and developing their clinical intervention skills, and pra cticing their clinical documentation skills. In response, this year we will have two supervisors (including a part -time consultant). One supervisor is providing individual supervision, including coordination of services, providing clinical training and ove rall oversight of the interns, while the second supervisor is providing group supervision. This gives students different clinical perspectives and also reduces the burden for supervision especially during this time when there are increasing crises and com plex cases. We have also diversified our supervisors so that one is an LCSW and the other LMFT in Art Therapy. This allows KCCEB to be more versatile in training and supporting mental health trainees across different backgrounds (social work, psychology) and also gain specialized skills (e.g., art therapy). KCCEP is also working to build up our reputation not only as a Korean -serving organization but as an API -wide serving organization. Because of the perception that the program only serves Koreans, we g enerally have a lower pool of MSW intern applicants. As School Internship Site Coordinators see our work with the broader Asian American community and in the schools, we hope to increase our applicant pool. Consumer and Family Member Training, Education and Employment FY20/21 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges: BestNow is funded by MHSA WET to provide training, education and employment services to Peers. BestNow focused on recruitment and preparation for the Peer Support Specialist class and successfully recruited 20 Peer Support Specialist Training participants even with the ongoing public health crisis. Provided a total of 15 Pre -Employment Workshops that were open to consumers, with each workshop serving at least five consumers who are co ntemplating employment for the first time or who are re-entering the job market. Workshops focused on interviewing skills, cover letter/resume building, financial literacy, overcoming stress, benefits of returning to work, and emotional skillfulness. Focused heavily on outreach to consumers and collaborated with ACBH and other agencies within the mental health and substance use disorder systems of care, to support student access to Peer Support specialist training. Conduct ed two orientation sessions for three months for a total of 30 individuals showing to get their questions answered by BestNow. 600 WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Adapted trainee selection process to be held remotely online, using BestNow graduates as panel interviewers and holding the interviews on Zoom. Restructured training program, including editing down curriculum materials while taking the opportunity to update materials. Added curriculum sections on Trauma and Cultural Humility in an effort to keep training up to date and address the SAMHSA Core Competencies for Peer Workers. Held support groups to assist training graduates on Zoom on a biweekly basis. These groups were well attended with an average of 15 -20 individuals attending. The participants expressed how supportive those groups were during such a challenging time. 11 agencies represented at the internship fair, showing the dedication of our par tner programs to the internship program and the value that our interns have brought to these agencies over the years. The agencies represented included Alameda County Network of Mental Health Clients, Berkeley Mental Health, Bonita House, Telecare (several program sites), BACS, PEERS, POCC, ACBH Consumer Empowerment Department, and Options Recovery. Challenges: Several orientation sessions had a much lower number of participants show up than the number of people who registered using the Zoom link provided on our outreach materials. This could be due to technology -related challenges from participants or individual s registering too far in advance. A major challenge we experienced during this fiscal year was also restructuring the Peer Support Specialist Training to adapt to the restrictions resulting from the COVID -19 crisis while meeting our contract deliverables. BestNow made the decision to shorten the length of each training session because of trainee and facilitator limits o n how long they could stay engaged in each Zoom session. We also decided to meet 3 times per week instead of 4. To make up for this, we added a Friday Practice Sessions which were optional and required less planning and coordination. We also added biw eekly one -on-one check -ins with our participants to make up for the classroom time lost. Another challenge was technology -related skill gaps for many of our trainees. While most trainees had devices, they could use to attend class sessions, we did have to arrange to lend a BestNow laptop to one person who otherwise would not have been able to participate. In general, some participants struggled with skills such as sending email attachments, navigating the Zoom platform, and even saving and downloading documents. BestNow attempted to address these challenges in various ways. We held a \"How to Use Zoom workshop,\" before the training started to support the participation of people who were new to using Zoom. We have also done a lot of one -on-one support t alking with participants through commonly used skills such as saving documents to their devices and attaching documents (such as assignments) to emails. Additionally, because of the continued challenges posed by the COVID -19 pandemic and Alameda County shelter -in-place order, many agencies which previously hosted BestNow interns declined to do so. This made WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING601 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG it very challenging to find appropriate internship opportunities for all of our trainees. With the reduced number of internship options available, ma ny trainees have also declined to intern at agencies that would require them to have direct contact with participants due to the COVID -19 safety concerns. Trainees may have started the program with the assumption that the situation would be safer once the internship portion of the training began; however, the numbers in Alameda County continued to rise. Furthermore, a continued challenge for our trainees is related to criminal justice records. We continue to have highly qualified trainees rejected from int ernships/employment opportunities because they have convictions on their record, without regard to the time that has passed since their convictions or the nature of their convictions. We maintain that Peer Support Specialists who have personal lived expe rience with incarceration and the criminal legal system have valuable insights to share from their experiences and should be given equal opportunities for internships/employment opportunities as those trainees without these experiences. FY21/22 Progres s Report: In the Fiscal year of 2021 -2022, there were some big changes to our contract and the structure of the Peer Support specialist training. Originally our training was 7 -weeks of classroom time with a required 6 -month part-time internship at an Ala meda County mental health and/or substance use recovery program. The dual in -class and workplace experience was a system designed to ready folks with little work experience, or folks returning to work after a long absence, to feel confident to find susta inable employment after the training. BestNow condensed the training down to 4 weeks of classroom time, with limited internship opportunities (with priority to participants with the least employment experience). Restructures the curriculum and t ook out some components in order to shorten the training. 20 individuals graduate d from their Peer Support Specialist training program and connect 4 individuals to internships and 2 individuals to full -time job opportunities for the 2021 year. Additionally, BestNow ran cycles with a very diverse demographic group. In FY2021 -2022 , we had 30.6% of our participants identified as African American, 16.3% as European American, 8.2% as Latino, 6.1% as Asian American, 4.1% as middle eastern, 4.1% as Native American, and 2% identif ied as Pacific Islander. Hired a new program manager, program curriculum coordinator, and program trainer. With the new team, BestNow is in the process of revamping their social media accounts in order to stay more connected with agencies and prospective participants. We also succe ssfully hosted our first alumni event after COVID -19 began, which had over 35 alumni attend. BestNow is expecting to go into 2022 with having our first internship fair after the pandemic and also offering our 101 -documentation training in -house with the help of the new program manager. We also plan on having refresher course training for any previous graduate who may feel they need it in preparation for when the state certification exam gets released. 602 WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY22/23 Anticipated changes: BestNow is anticipat ing many changes for the 2022 -2023 fiscal year such as restructuring the trainings. BestNow is considering having 3 different training courses. Two of those will be 80 -hour training specifically for individuals already working in behavioral health care services. This type of training could also be used as refresher training for BestNow alumni who might have graduated many years ago. The third type of training we would offer would be between 120 -180 hours (TBD) and it would be for Peers who want to work in behavioral health care services. This training would be more in -depth and would consist of presenters coming to teach certain portions of the curriculum as well as teaching the participants about community building and networking. Establishing a mandatory internship period . Remove the two \"Refresher\" 10 -hour courses, that were meant to prepare BestNow! alumni for Peer Specialist Certification. It has been challenging to understand what to include in the refresher courses, as SB803 is still in the process of being implemented an d we are not sure what format the test will look like. To meet this challenge, we developed a curriculum for a \"Refresher\" that targets each core competency, but even covers just those concepts would still be fit in a sort 10 -hour course. We believe that encouraging individuals who have previously taken the 120 -hour training, who would like to \"Refresh\" PSST information before certification, to take the 80 -hour training instead. We believe that 80 hours is still very quick, and is best suited for Peers al ready working in behavioral health care services who would like to become certified. 5.

CAPITAL FACILITIES & TECHNOLOGICAL NEEDS606 TOP HEADER MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Capital Facilities & Technolog ical Needs | \"BRINGING PEOPLE AND RESOURCES TOGETHER\" The Capital Facilities & Technological Needs (CFTN ) component of the MHSA \" works towards the creation of a facility that is used for the delivery of MHSA services to mental health clients and their families or for administrative offices. Funds may also be used to support an increase in peer -support and consumer -run facilities, development of commu nity-based settings, and the development of a technological infrastructure for the mental health system to facilitate the highest quality and cost - effective services and supports for clients and their families \". It should be noted that CFTN funding was ori ginally a 10-year block grant, which ended on June 30, 2017. However, ACBH continues to transfer CSS funds to the CFTN component for various programs and projects . Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5892(b), Counties may use a portion of t heir CSS funds for WET, CFTN, and the Local Prudent Reserve. The total amount of CSS funding used for this purpose shall not exceed 20% of the total average amount of funds allocated to that County for the previous five years. ACBH's MHSA funded Capital Facilities projects are in alignment with Alameda County's Vision 2026. More on this vision can be seen at https://vision2026.acgov.org/index.page New Projects Approved for funding, implementation FY 21/22 -22/23 Medical Respite Expansion projects ACBH allocated $3M in MHSA CFTN funding for Medical Respite bed expansion projects in Alameda County. The Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) unit under the Alameda County Health Care Serv ices Agency (HCSA) is developing a new medical respite project called Oak Days utilizing these funds. Oak Days is currently running as a non -congregate emergency shelter with 40 beds set aside for very medically fragile clients who have complex physical a nd mental health care needs. To be eligible for one of the 40 beds at Oak Days clients must meet ALL THREE of the following criteria: 1. Functionally compromised (which includes both physical and mental health issues) 2. Complex chronic condition (includ ing mental health) 3. 8 or more ED visits, or 2 or more inpatient in last year (psych ED visits and inpatient psych admissions are included in the count) These beds were created to meet a need that doesn't exist. The majority of start -up costs have been provided through Alameda County's Whole Person Care Program, but there is currently a need for the provider to purchase a Home Health Agency License. This is a one -time expense that will allow the agency to pay for caregivers with Medicaid funding and will open up other medical respite opportunities for Alameda County.

The following sections provided an overarching summary of signific ant quality assurance and improvement activities directed towards improving the administration of MHSA compo nents . Alameda Coun ty Health Care Services Agency: Results -Base d Accountability (RBA) Initiative Project IMPACT began in July 2014 as an effort that supports programs throughout the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) to measure and report their outcomes1. The Project IMPACT team consists of a total of 17 program staff and managers from every Department in HSCA, including members who have worked closely with the RBA implementation efforts in their own Departments. The Agency Leadership Team (ALT), which incl udes the Agency Director of HCSA and the Directors, Deputy Directors and Finance Directors of each of the Agency's departments, is monitoring and guiding the development of Project IMPACT. RBA is a program evaluation framework that is data -driven and uses a simple iterative process to help organizations assess current performance, identify strategies to improve, and facilitate rapid implementation of action plans. Since 2014, ACBH has been utilizing RBA in various capacit ies to monitor program performance and assess impacts on the clients who come into contact with department and/or contracted services. ACBH has integrated RBA into MHSA contracting efforts with Full-Service Partnerships ( FSPs ), adopted the framework as part of its P revention & Early Intervention (PEI) services evaluation, and made strides to include it as part of the Juvenile Justice Center and Crisis Services program work. A summary of RBA examples for MHSA are included in Appendix C -1. Alameda County Behavioral Health Department Ini tiatives Reorganization Efforts .

Financ ial Services Division The MHSA Trust Fund Account (MHSA Trust) was established to maintain the MHSA monthly allocation and interest earnings. All expenditures are charged to the County General Fund (CGF) with the related MHSA program code. Finance prepares a quarterly projection report to identify the net MHSA revenue, and then develop a journal to move funds from the MHSA Trust to the CGF to offset the expenditures. Finance has assigned a MHSA Plan number for each plan component and its projects; and have set up 29 program codes in the County financial system to associate with the MHSA projects. For community - based organizations/providers (CBO), the Division assigns a reporting unit number (RU#) for their projects. The program codes and RU#s can be used t o keep track the payment status. In each fiscal year, the Finance Division create s what is called The Green Sheet to identify all MHSA projects for that year including the Plan number , total budget, MHSA budget portion, estimated Medi - Cal revenue, program code and reporting unit (RU) #. The provided data helps support the preparation of the MHSA Plan and the Annual Revenue and Expenditure Report to the Department of Health Care Services. Communication. Finance establishes monthly meetings with the ACBH Leadership Team to provide information, discuss issues and concerns , and communicate with the MHSA Director for relevant updates. Fiscal Accountability . The Finance Division follows a set of policies and procedures to avoid supplantation of MHSA funding. All expenditures, encumbrances and revenue are reconciled every quarter, as part of the quarterly projections process. The Division requires two signatur es when signing housing assistance checks over $5,000. Each Invoice and deposit require one signature. Procurement & Contract Co mpliance Activities The ACBH Contracts Unit operates under the auspice of the Finance Division . The Contracts Unit is undergoing an organizational restructure in which all contracts will reside within th is Unit. These changes are part of an overall response to federal and state health care policy changes which affect county behavioral health in Cal ifornia. In order to meet the demands of these changes, ACBH is proactively preparing to adapt to and thrive in the new behavioral health environment by more fully aligning ACBH's compliance with the following federal and state requirements: The state -county Mental Health Plan Contract, Performance Contract, and Drug Medi -Cal Contract; 616 PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG | 4 Expanded Federal Medicaid Managed Care regulations; and Expanded covered services and contract requirements in Drug Medi -Cal. The Contracts Office has seven Program Cont ract Managers also known as Program Specialists and eight Fiscal Contract Managers. Each Contract Manager manages between three and fifteen MHSA funded programs. The Contracts Office has one Program Contract Manager who serves as the liaison between the Co ntracts Unit and the ACBH MHSA Division. In this role the Contract Manager reviews the MHSA plan and updates, coordinates with the MHSA staff on reporting requirements and timelines, coordination of audit requirements on behalf of the Contracts Unit and co mmunicates emerging changes that would impact the Contracts Unit. Roles & Responsibilities . Contract Managers are responsible for monitoring programs from various aspects; Fiscal: reviewing units of services from the electronic claiming system in compariso n to the allocation. Program: technical assistance (phone calls, meetings, or emails), reviewing reports (quarterly or annually) against the contracted deliverables. Performance Measures . Contract Managers work in collaboration with the MHSA staff, and t he provider to develop process, quality, and impact objectives for each type of program. For example, Full -Service Partnership s (FSP s) are measuring the percent of providers who can achieve a 50% reduction in the following: 1. Psychiatric hospitalization a dmissions 2. Psychiatric hospital days and 3. Psychiatric emergency visits 12 months prior to FSP admission and 12 months post admission. Additional metrics have been implemented more recently tied to a pay for performance fiscal model. Contract Compliance. ACBH formalized a policy in June 2018, \" Contract Compliance Plan and Sanctions for ACBH Contracted Providers \". This policy supports ACBH in holding providers accountable for implementing County, State, and Federal requirements. Examples may include by not limited to: lack of achievement in meeting performance standards, substantive underperformance on m eeting contracted deliverables, failure to meet contractual requirements such as staffing, timelines, required certifications and/or licensure. Additionally, ACBH responded to an audit finding in 2017 which resulted in the development of the MHSA Monitorin g Guidelines in 2018 to strengthen the process in which ACBH are monitoring MHSA funded programs. MHSA Data Management Systems ACBH uses a web- based data and outcome reporting system called YellowFin. MHSA staff partnered with System of Care staff and t he ACBH Data Services team to update the FSP outcome s dashboard to include the Service Teams. The Service Team impact metrics are used for the FY 20/21 Report and to make decisions on transforming the teams. The reporting dashboard cover s hospitalizations, incarcerations, primary care linkage, and system costs. The Service Teams were added because of the success of the FSP dashboard . The Underserved Ethnic Language Programs (UELPs), Evaluation Workgroup has finished it's first round of changes to the yearly UELP evaluation. The workgroup redesigned the logic model and worked with a graphic designer to create a graphic al version of it and re -worded and updated both the Pre/Post Health Assessment and Participa nt Satisfaction Surveys. Both of these have been implemented during FY 21/22 using Survey Monkey and the results will be used during the evaluation.

The IHOT Program Specialists is now using the dashboard to track the clie nts in the program and their outcomes. Prevention & Early Intervention (PEI) Unit Performance Efforts The MHSA PEI Unit is committed to working in collaboration with contracted providers to identify program outcomes and evaluation processes that are aligned with MHSA and the PEI system's values and regulatory requirements ( see Appendix F -4). In an effort to foster the system's \"voice and choice,\" we're working together with providers in a trauma -informed way to: Create a safe space where individuals and providers can share their experiences, challenges and frustrations, and knowledge regarding data collection, reporting, and evaluation; Form work groups that include direct service/outreach staff to assess the utility, feasibility, propriety, and accu racy (CDC evaluation standards) of the evaluation processes and survey instruments; Invite accountability to ensure that evaluation activities are culturally and linguistically relevant and promote equity and accessibility; Explore non -Westernized, communi ty-oriented ideas of how to invite feedback and uplift participants unique perspectives and experiences; Build strong relationships and transparency with providers during virtual site visits by offering support and assistance, and Keep providers up to dat e about MHSA/PEI data requirements and updated regulations.

You're a newborn coming back to society, some people don't have a choice to not return to the same atmosphere. I've learned how to breathe, you've got to get help and connect with like -minded people. I'm starting to heal. I had to become vulnerable to get what I need. I had to come out of my comfort zone - had to d o things differently. Prison became a comfort, so I had to break the cycle of seeking comfort in the streets and in prison, I had to change my thinking, start doing things that were productive and now I can be proud of myself.

Then the police will tell you, \"I cannot\" and he walks away. \"There are too many cases.\" They will walk away. Even you trick the patient to the hospital, the hospital is full right now.

I don't think that's the problem of language. Of course, if there's an interpreter, that will make life easier for pe ople who don't speak well in English. Yeah, hospitalization is the very big problem now If I look up information online, I'm not sure I can find any information that is helpful related to mental health. It is very difficult for elderly to search things o n the internet. The warm line has overloaded. Cases have tripled. Is this situation resulting from home staying during the Covid? Does it increase the psychotic episode or elevated the symptoms?

Some patients need to stay in the hospital but cannot because of the parents' language barrier. When the police came in 5150 calling, the child, I mean the pati ent, speaks fluent English and said, \"I'm fine, I don't have a problem.\" But the parents know that their child break the window, hitting things here and there due to insomnia every night. However, the parents cannot speak fluent English and are unable to send their child to the hospital. The most important thing to know now is that cases are escalating. Many families with mental patients are hard hit in the pandemic. There is a language barrier in 5150 call cases. Patients speak fluent English but not the parents. They are not speaking fluently enough to send their kids to get help. That is actually one of the problems caused by Covid. I agree with that kids speak English better than their parents. That is a very difficult situation to deal with. Especially in terms of appearance, Kids speak fluent English and they act normally when calling the police. Even though the police know that they might suspect the kids do have some problem, they cannot do anything because of the normal appearance and conve rsation. This is one reason they delay sending their ailing kids to hospital. This is a tough situation whenever we call 911, the kids act normally, even after the police come, the child will answer questions and speak fluently. Parents are limited in Eng lish. So, this is probably the cost of the delay in service. I think besides calling 911, English is also vital when we need to go to the hospital or report to our jobs. Otherwise there will be a big breakdown. Things happened to us yesterday, we called t he police, we tell them about our situation. They asked my daughter but she refused to answer. If the police team asked her that way, of course she would not answer anything. There is inadequacy in services. 22..

We have been living like hell for the past two years. My elder daughter had no schooling except online due to the pandemic. She developed an eating disorder and has been in and out of the hospital for almost twenty times. But we received very inadequate help. There was no proper response to our request, every time we made one. I hope Alameda County can treat eating disorders as a life - threatening illness and provide adequate services. You can't sustain two days without eating. Can you imagine my elder daughter having not eaten for five to six days consecutive! She was on the verge of dying! Yet the County provided no meaningful help. Does the County take life seriously? The service is so bad and inadequate. I hope through thi s platform to call attention to the seriousness of eating disorder, to address it as is a life -threatening illness. Normal human heart rate is 60 per minute, my daughter's was 39, she could die at any moment. We rushed her to the UCSF hospital in SF. But o nce until her vitals were stable, they discharged her, without any follow -up services by a specialist. My daughter felt helpless. We were totally lost as to where to look for help.

How can you save lives if you are not given necessary resources? Peers nee d help finding jobs The pandemic had a great impact on senior people. They could not go out to use fa cilities, especially for those who have mental illness. As far as I know there were three who committed suicide. That is a big ratio in the Chinese community. 33.. What do you see as bbaarrrriieerrss for people to get help? I think language barrier and the need for t ranslation is still the issue. Besides the 911 service, there are many other services that we need, such as help with finding a job. To be able to communicate in English is necessary. Once communication failed due to lack of English proficiency, it affe cts everything down the road. It is a big problem. This is not a problem of language barrier. Now, it's about the hospital refusing to accept patients unless they are dying. My daughter's heart rate and blood pressure had reached a very low level. But they would not take her in because she was not in immediate danger of dying. This is a big problem. They told us that my daughter's situation needed a long -term care. Anorexia needs more than just one day of treatment to recover. The County only provided 7 weeks of treatment. According to an anorexia specialist we had talked to, my daughter needed consecutive treatment up to 5 to 6 months. She cannot to be discharged in 7 weeks. That is not enough. The County promised and signed a treatment for 5 months. But later in the second meeting, they revoked that and changed it to 6 to 8 weeks. The hope I had after the first meeting was suddenly dashed! How disappointing! At the end of last year, my daughter and I tried to look for an alternative doctor, psychiatrist, for her mental illness. We had a great deal of difficulty as far as availability goes. I had a list of, I think 85 or 86 doctors, I must have gone through at least 40 to 50 doctors and none of them were available. That really created a lot of anxiety for my daughter alone. The unavailability for any alternative doctor when she was having problems with her current one. Another one is the Institute course she has been going to, which is in Union City. She has been going there for her drug management. Since the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018, they have constantly, maybe every other month, changed their personnel. So, there was no so - called routine to follow up. The st aff were poorly trained. Difficult for peers to find jobs Asian hate around the county. They do not feel safe living, it's a very big issues in our community. The Chinese community suffers most because of language barrier.

Without follow -up services, one single treatment is totally useless. stigma and the discrimination I think the stigma is more pronounced in the traditional Chinese culture, in the tr aditional Chinese community.

But follow - up services, long -term caring services, are equally important. ? If the State give equal attention to both clinical treatment and long -term care services, a lot of problems can be avoided. I think prevention has a lot of room for improvement. All of the people that are sitting here are not doctors, not trained therapists, but many of us are trained support group facilitators. We have gone through different training.

In many jurisdictions, individuals with mental illness are more likely to be booked into jail than engaged in treatment, and jails have become the largest mental health institutions. This issue is exacerbated because the legal threshold to arrest and incarcerate someone is lower thanis the legal threshold to engage that same individual in treatment if they are unwilling or unable to participate on a voluntary basis. Because t he legal standard for incarceration is much lower than the threshold for involuntary treatment and jail beds are more readily availab le than treatment beds, either voluntary or involuntary , it has become increasingly common to incarcerate individuals in need of mental health services.1 Despite intentional efforts to make the mental health system as accessible and recovery -oriented as po ssible, there remains a group of individuals who will not engage in voluntary services and are more likely to be incarcerated than treated by the community behavioral health system. Once a person with SMI and/or SUD becomes justice -involved, they are more likely to remain involved and penetrate the justice system further2, 3. These individuals typically have minimal financial resources and are more likely to be held in jail awaiting trial or placement for treatment, including competency restoration. They ma y experience difficulty complying with the terms and conditions of probation or release, and they may be charged with a new criminal offense while confined in jail. Within California and across the Nation, there is a concerted effort to identify diversion opportunities and to ensure a continuum of services for individuals with mental health issues who are involved with the criminal justice system. Alameda County, along with its partners and community of stakeholders, has invested substantial time and resour ces on a number of efforts that aim to strengthen forensic and reentry mental health services for people with mental health needs and/or substance use disorders by: 1 National Sheriff's Association and Treatment Advocacy Center.

Alameda County was interested in how Innovation funds could assist in addressing the forensic and reentry mental health needs in the County. This Innovation plan arose out of these concerted efforts to divert individuals with mental health challenges from the justice system into mental health services and was developed for and by community stakeholders, including the County's Justice I nvolved Mental Health Task Force. Proposed Project Project Description The Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services is a collection of four (4) continuum of services , of which three are peer led and one is family focused. The continuum of services specifically seeks to : 1. Support mental health consumers who are justice involved by helping them transition back into the community following an arrest or incarceration, 2. Identify and address the issues that led up to their arrest and/or incarcerat ion 3. Connect with mental health and other services to support them in their recovery and reentry journey , and 4. Build the capacity of family members to advocate on behalf of their loved one with a serious mental illness who has become justice involved. As a result of the continuum of service s, we expect that individuals will experience fewer episodes of arrest and/or incarceration and will have increased participation in ongoing mental health and other services. The included services are described below. 4 http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%2 0SERVICES/Regular%20Calendar/Item__1_ACBH_Services_Forensic_sys_5_10_21.pdf Safely diverting people from the justice system into treatment, Stabilizing and connecting individuals in custody to community behavioral health services, and Promoting service participation that reduces recidivism.700 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 4 Reentry Coaches. In Alameda and across the state, there have been strong outcomes associated with using people with lived experience to support individuals following a crisis or hospitalization to connect to follow -up mental health services . These individuals are sometimes referred to as peer mentors and have shown strong outcomes in increasing service linkage and reducing crisis and hospitalization in Alameda, Orange, and other counties. This project aims to employ forensic peer specialists who can serve as reentry coaches for individuals with serious mental illness to help them tran sition back into the community. Their role is to help the person with whatever they need, including tangible resources such as linkages for food and shelter or transportation to appointments , as well as encouragement and consciousness raising to actively participate in their own recovery and reentry journey. Referrals into the program may come from service providers supporting reentry planning at the Santa Rita jail, and ideally the reentry coach would be able to make contact with the individual before the y are released from jail. However, their first contact may be upon release at the Safe Landing program , which is a drop in center on site at the jail that provides information and referrals to individuals leaving the jail, or at another community location . The reentry coach will work with the individual to develop a personalized reentry plan that addressed the needs and issues that the person feels are most pressing, and the coach can stay involved for up to 90 days providing direct peer support as well a s support to engage with other services. WRAP for Reentry . The Centers for Human Development have a number of curricula based on Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) for specialty populations, including individuals with mental health challenges who are involved with the criminal justice system. Existing WRAP facilitators as well as identified Forensic Peer Specialists will receive training in WRAP for Reentry. The WRAP for Reentry groups will be available at existing peer led programs as well as of fered at the peer respite, Forensic CRT (included as a part of the Alternatives to Confinement continuum of services ), and potentially at Santa Rita, if permitted. Forensic Peer Respite. The Forensic Peer Respite will be available to adult mental health c onsumers who are justice involved who would benefit from a brief moment of pause to reflect on their recovery and reentry journey, address whatever issues are coming up for them, and receive peer support to connect them with whatever services may be most h elpful to support their continued recovery and reentry. This program will provide 24/7 peer support services that address mental health, substance use, and criminogenic needs in an unlocked, peer -led environment. The average length of stay based on other peer respite s will span 5 -14 days with the opportunity to extend up to 30 days with ACBH approval, and the total capacity will be 6. The Forensic Peer Respite would be available to consumers who are beginning to experience early warning signs of a crisis or other behaviors that place them at high likelihood of police contact. 701 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE INN PROPOSALS 5 The program will accept consumers ages 18 -59 with mental health and criminal justice involvement who can be safely served in this environment. This program is intended to be a ste p up from the community as well as step down from the jail, and referrals may come from community mental health providers who are serving justice -involved mental health consumers as well as providers from jail mental health, psychiatric hospitals, psychiat ric emergency services, local emergency departments, crisis stabilization units, sobering centers and detoxification units, and the reentry coaching program described above . It is also possible that the program will also accept consumers from the Forensic CRT if there is an individual that would be better served in a peer-led environment. Family Navigation and Support. Family members of adult children with mental health issues are a critical component of supporting an individual to participate in mental health treatment and exit the justice system. However, family members have to quickly become experts in the justice system and relevant mental health law in order to understand and work within the justice system and process in support of their loved one. The family navigation and support service would develop and disseminate informational materials about the forensic mental health process. This program would collaborate and train existing warmlines , staffed by family partners, to educate and coach families on how to best advocate for their loved ones and would collaborate with ACBH to ensure information materials are translated and accessible for all Alameda C ounty residents. The program would also provide individual and group consultation to families in order to increase knowledge of the justice mental health system and the legal process; the types of specific hearings, legal mechanisms, and appeals for indivi duals with mental health issues; how competency is determined, what incompetent to stand trial means , and what services may be available ; how to provide medical and mental health information to the jail and other legal entities ; and how to advocate on beha lf of a loved one who has become involved with the criminal justice system. Project General Requirements The Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services both adapts an existing mental health practice for the forensic mental health population as w ell as adapts practices from other disciplines. The Forensic Peer Respite, Reentry Coaches, and WRAP for Reentry take existing mental health practices and seeks to apply them to adult mental health consumers who are involved with the criminal justice sys tem. Specifically, this continuum of services is inspired by the Peer Respite model which exists in other jurisdictions and in Alameda County, the WRAP curriculum which has a strong evidence base and has been implemented for decades in Alameda County, and peer mentoring programs who support individuals post crisis or hospitalization that are available across the state. In each of 702 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 6 these instances, they have been modified for a justice involved mental health population and seek to promote similar outcomes i ncluding reduced arrest and incarceration rather than crisis and hospitalization as well as increased service connectedness. The Family Navigation and Support component is modeled after other disciplines, specifically the resources and consultation avail able through advokids5 for the foster care system or Regional Centers for families with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. These programs offer a combination of written resources, consultation, education, and support to educate families about the intricacies of the system and equip them to advocate on behalf of their family member. Individuals to be Served Overall, the Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services project will serve 2,279 individuals per year. We anticipate that the R eentry Coaches will serve approximately 480 individuals per year, which is 15 consumers per coach with an average engagement of 90 days and 8.0 FTE . The WRAP for Reentry program will serve approximately 960 individuals, or 20 unduplicated individuals per month per facilitator, of which there will be 4 facilitators. We expect to serve approximately 122 individuals in the Forensic Peer Respite per year . This assumes that the 6 bed Forensic Peer Respite will operate at 85% capacity with an average length of stay of two weeks . We also expect to reach about 800 families with the written resources through the Family Navigation and Support program, with about 25%, or 200 families, reaching out for consultation or other support. However, we anticipate that there is significant overlap between the programs. This continuum of services will serve transition age youth ages 18 -25 and adults ages 26 and up who have significant mental health issues and are involved with the criminal jus tice system; they may also have co -occurring substance use issues. They may be of any gender or gender identity as well as sexual orientation. We anticipate that consumers will be predominantly Black or African American with smaller percentages of people who are white, Latinx, or Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian. This is based on demographic data of consumers receiving services at Adult Forensic Behavioral Health, which is the outpatient clinic located inside the County jail, as demonstrated in Table 1. We also anticipate that a proportion of individuals will speak Spanish and other languages and will ensure language access is available. Additionally, the Family Navigation SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE INN PROPOSALS 7 Support project will work with culturally specific organizations to ensure that they have the capacity to support individuals to advocate on behalf of their family members. Research on INN Project The issue of individuals with serious mental illness who are involved with the justice system has become one of the largest problems facing communities across the nation, and the rate of individuals with serious mental illness is two to six times higher am ong incarcerated populations than it is in the general population.6 Research clearly demonstrates that outcomes for people with mental illness who become justice involved have better outcomes when diverted into services than when in custody.

Using models from mental health and other disciplines, these four programs collectively provide an opportunity to support individuals to reenter the community and engage in services that reduce the likelihood of future arrests and/or incarceration. These priorities for diversion arose out of the sequential intercept mapping process with Alameda County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force and focus on supporting reentry as well as promoting exit from the criminal justice system. They are based on t he principles of peer support provided at opportunities identified through Alameda County's Sequential Intercept Mapping process. At this time, no other jurisdiction has developed a singularly focused Forensic Peer Respite or applied a peer mentor approach to people with serious mental illness reentering from jail . While WRAP for Reentry is implemented in other jurisdictions, it does not yet have an evidence base supporting its use. People with forensic mental health needs may be served in Peer Respite, pe er mentor, or WRAP programs , but none specialize in the intersection between behavioral health and justice system involvement and specifically target behavioral health and criminal justice involvement . While there are myriad versions of parental support , none are solely focused on supporting family members whose loved ones with serious mental illness have become justice involved. To this end, this project aims to explore the extent to which these programs are able to reduce criminal justice system involve ment for people with serious mental illness (e.g., reduced jail booking s and jail days , increased service participation, increased exit from the criminal justice system ). Learning Goals/Project Aims In Alameda County, 25% of ACBH consumers receive mental health services in the jail, and 10% of consumers only receive mental health services in the jail.7 This highlights the need to address the over -incarceration of people with mental health issues and support them outside of a jail environment as a key Cou nty priority. This project, along with the other Innovation Plan entitled Alternatives to Confinement , is one element of a larger Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and represents the service offerings that are relevant to and meet criteria for Innov ation projects. \u0003 http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%2 0SERVICES/Regular%20Calendar/Item__1_ACBH_Services_Fo - SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE INN PROPOSALS 9 With this project, Alameda County Behavioral Health seeks to pilot these four services within a continuum of care to understand the extent to which these programs, separately and together, increase access to and participation in mental he alth services for adults with mental health and criminal justice involvement and improve outcomes, including reduced jail bookings, jail days, and exit from the criminal justice system. Evaluation or Learning Plan This Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Ment al Health Services project evaluation will explore process and outcome measures related to the four included services. The overarching evaluation questions include: 1. What resources are being invested, by whom, and how much? 2. Who is being served, at what dosage, and in what ways, including participation in more than one INN -funded service? 3. To what extent do people who participate in INN -funded services experience reduced jail bookings, jail days, and are able to exit the criminal justice system ? 4. To what ex tent do people who participate in INN -funded services experience increased service engagement and participation? 5. How does family education and consultation support individuals to move through the justice system ? The evaluation will explore the following t ypes of quantitative data: Socio -demographics of individuals served, including race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, zip code, income type and amount, housing status, level of education, and veteran status. Clinical and justice involved profile of individuals served, including mental health diagnoses and previous service participation; previous arrest, charge, and booking information; substance use and misuse; known trauma history; other clinically relevant i nformation. Current program and service participation, including program, service type, procedure code, provider type, dates of service, length of encounter, length of episode, disposition. This includes for INN -funded programs as well as all other Ment al Health Plan ( MHP )-funded services, such as crisis and hospitalization as well as other residential and outpatient services. Current justice system interactions, including jail bookings and discharge dates, charges filed, court dispositions. If feasible , police contact and arrest data that did not result in a jail booking may also be included. 706 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 10 Referrals, including referrals sources into the INN -funded programs as well as referrals and linkages provided from the INN -funded programs into other mental health services.

Section 3: Additional Information for Regulatory Requirements Contracting The County expects to contract out all of the services included in this proposal . Additionally, the County intends to contract for an ext ernal evaluator for this project to work with our internal data support team in exploring the learning goals and evaluation questions listed above as well as complete required reporting for the project. The County will appoint a contract monitor for each of these contracts to ensure contract compliance as well as a portion of the County project/program manager to supervise the quality of work performed. Community Project Planning These projects arose out of a longer -term planning and system improvement pro cess dedicated to improving services for justice involved mental health consumers. The Justice Involved Mental Health (JIMH) Task Force included representatives from the Health Care Services Agency, Alameda County Behavioral Health, Public Defender, District Attorney, provider and advocacy organizations, consumer and family 707 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE INN PROPOSALS 11 representatives, faith based and other community leaders. After a more than year long process, the JIMH Task Force published a report in September 2020 with multiple stakeholder recomm endations, including a focus on supporting reentry . Concurrently, ACBH published a Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan in October 2020 that was informed by JIMH and included additional actions informed by evidence -based practice and ACBH's strategic d irection. During 2021, ACBH systematically went through the Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and identified aspects of the plan that either warranted further development and/or consideration or may meet criteria for INN funds. As a part of this p rocess, ACBH contracted with the Indigo Project to engage in INN Project planning. The Indigo Project met with a number of internal and external stakeholders to gather information and workshop the ideas and concepts as they evolved, including: Consumer r epresentatives and members of the Pool of Consumer Champions Family representatives and individuals from NAMI Providers who represent communities who are underrepresented because of cultural affiliation and language access Members of the African American s ubcommittee Members of the MHSA Stakeholder group Healthcare for the homeless providers System of Care Directors for Adult, Crisis, and Forensic Mental Health Services Consumer and Family Empowerment Managers With each discussion, the concepts evolved and were further developed and clarified. These projects will be included in the MHSA Annual Update Community Program Planning (CPP) process in 2022 with the hopes of beginning implementation in FY2022. MHSA Ge neral Standards This project arose out of a community effort to address the needs of mental health consumers who are forensically involved. It was developed by consumers, family, and communities to support wellness and recovery and avoid incarceration. Community collaboration is exemplified in not only how this project was developed but also in how the project itself works to support individuals to return to and remain in their communities rather than in a jail environment. Cultural Competency is include d as a foundational component in that this project seeks to address the overincarceration of people with mental illness, the majority of whom are BIPOC individuals, by supporting individuals to reenter their communities and successfully exit the justice sy stem. Additionally, the services themselves will be informed by and primarily staffed by individuals who represent 708 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 12 our County's diverse populations. Services will be client and family driven in that services aim to preserve a person's freedom, independen ce, and ability to consent to their own services by using person centered planning with family member input that respects an individual's needs and preferences and works in partnership with each individual and their family to discover how they understand t he issues that they're facing and helps them develop a plan that they are willing to do to address what is most important to them. The services are wellness, recovery, and resiliency focused in that they are built upon the belief that participation in mental health services and supports are more productive and meaningful than incarceration and that services that respect an individual's ability to invest in their own recovery journey are more likely to result in sustained freedom than \"rehabilitation\" provided by the jails. Finally, services are intended to be integrated in that these programs seek to strengthen each person's ability to renter the community and successfully navigate the servic e system with peer support . Cultural Competence and Stakeholder Participation in Evaluation On a quarterly basis, ACBH will convene a stakeholder meeting with individuals who are invested in both forensic mental health INN projects, which include this pr oject and the Alternatives to Confinement continuum of services . This meeting will serve dual purposes to gather information from stakeholders and partners about their perspectives on the project and its implementation as well as to provide data from the e valuation to support a CQI process. As a part of this project, we will explore the extent to which the project is reaching its intended target population and that people receiving services are reflective of the jail population (i.e., the population receiv ing services is comparable to the Santa Rita population in terms of race/ethnicity and age). This will be one component of what is discussed in the quarterly meetings as well as overall feedback and evaluation data described in the preceding section. Innovation Project Sustainability and Continuity of Care This project with its continuum of services will primarily serve individuals with serious mental illness. If this project accomplishes its intended objectives of 1) reducing jail bookings and jail da ys and 2) increasing participation in ongoing mental health services, the County will continue to fund the project using a combination of MHSA Community Services and Supports funding and Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Most of the services describe d in this plan should be eligible for Medi -Cal reimbursement following completion of the INN project , assuming peer certification and billing for peer support continue implementation during this INN project . 709 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE PROPOSALS 13 Communication and Dissemination Plan If this continuum of services is successful at 1) reducing jail bookings and jail days and 2) increasing participation in ongoing mental health services, ACBH will apply to present learnings at California -specific conferences, including the forensic mental health association, California Institute of Behavioral Health Services, and California Association of Counties (CSAC) conferences. Additionally, ACBH will request that the contracted evaluator prepare a white paper that can be distributed through the California B ehavioral Health Directors Association, California Probation Officers Association, and the MHSOAC listserv. Keywords include: 1. Mental health reentry 2. Forensic Peer Respite 3. WRAP for Reentry 4. Reentry Peer Support 5. Reentry Family Support Timeline ACBH propos es a 5 year Innovation project in which the first two years of the project allow for program start- up. While services may be able to be implemented more quickly, we believe that it is important to have all elements available at the same time, particularly with a service model that requires significant coordination with partner agencies . To that end, ACBH will begin the site identification and procurement process upon MHSOAC approval. This may take up to nine months to facilitate a competitive bid process and then enter into contracts. The second year will focus on preparing the program s for opening, developing written materials, and outreaching and coordinating with our justice partners . Concurrently, the evaluators will be working with the department and stakeholders to develop the evaluation approach. Years 3 -5 will focus on service provision as well as data collection and analysis to support learning. In the final year, ACBH will a lso develop an ongoing funding strategy using MHSA, realignment, and FFP dollars. In year 5, the evaluators will also draft the summative evaluation report and a white paper detailing project implementation, outcomes, and lessons learned. 710 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 14 Year 1 Project Start -up - County Procurement Procure mental health provider and evaluator services Execute INN service provider and evaluator contracts Year 2 Project Start -up - Program Development Preparation Site Identification Written Materials Development Staff Hiring and Training Outreach to partner agencies Project Start -up - Project Evaluation Evaluation planning, including stakeholder input Milestone: Services Commence Milestone: Evaluation Plan Complete Year 3 Ongoing: Service provision Ongoing: Data collection Quarterly: Stakeholder convening to support CQI Annual: INN reporting Year 4 Ongoing: Service provision Ongoing: Data collection Quarterly: Stakeholder convening to support CQI Annual: INN reporting Year 5 Ongoing: Service provision Ongoing: D ata collection Quarterly: Stakeholder convening to support CQI End of Project: Sustainability Plan End of Project: Summative INN report Section 4: INN Project Budget and Source of Expenditures INN Project Budget and Source of Expenditures The next three sections identify how the MHSA funds are being utilized: 711 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE INN PROPOSALS 15 A) BUDGET NARRATIVE (Specifics about how money is being spent for the development of this project) B) BUDGET BY FISCAL YEAR AND SPECIFIC BUDGET CATEGORY (Identification of expenses of the project by funding category and fiscal year) C) BUDGET CONTEXT (if MHSA funds are being leveraged with other funding sources) Budget Narrative Provide a brief budget narrative to explain how the total budget is appropriate for the described INN project.

In many jurisdictions, individuals with mental illness are more likely to be booked into jail than engaged in treatment, and jails have become the largest mental health institutions. This issue is exacerbated because the legal threshold to arrest and incarcerate someone is lower than is the legal threshold to engage that same individual in treatment if they are unwilling or unable to participate on a voluntary basis. Because t he legal standard for incarceration is much lower than the threshold for involuntary treatment and jail beds are more readily available than treatment beds, either volunta ry or involuntary , it has become increasingly common to incarcerate individuals in need of mental health services.1 Despite intentional efforts to make the mental health system as accessible and recovery -oriented as possible, there remains a group of indiv iduals who will not engage in voluntary services and are more likely to be incarcerated than treated by the community behavioral health system. Once a person with SMI and/or SUD becomes justice -involved, they are more likely to remain involved and penetrat e the justice system further2, 3. These individuals typically have minimal financial resources and are more likely to be held in jail awaiting trial or placement for treatment, including competency restoration. They may experience difficulty complying with the terms and conditions of probation or release, and they may be charged with a new criminal offense while confined in jail. Within California and across the Nation, there is a concerted effort to identify diversion opportunities and to ensure a continuu m of services for individuals with mental health issues who are involved with the criminal justice system. Alameda County, along with its partners and community of stakeholders, has invested substantial time and resources on a number of efforts that aim to strengthen forensic and reentry mental health services for people with mental health needs and/or substance use disorders by: 1 National Sheriff's Association and Treatment Advocacy Center.

Alameda County was interested in how Innovation funds could assist in addressing the forensic and reentry mental health needs in the County. This Innovation plan arose out of the se concerted efforts to divert individuals with mental health challenges from the justice system into mental health services and was developed for and by community stakeholders , including the County's Justice Involved Ment al Health Task Force . Proposed Project Project Description The Alternatives to Incarceration continuum of services is a collection of three co -located services that are working together intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from the criminal justice system into the mental health services. This continuum of services specifically seeks to divert individuals from incarceration in three primary ways : 1. When a mental health c onsumer who is forensically involved begins to exhibit early warning signs of a crisis with behaviors that may lead to police contact, 2. At the moment of police contact that may result in arrest, and 3. When the person has fallen out of compliance with their probation or parole and is subject to re -arrest. This continuum of services seeks to provide services that prevent individuals with mental health and criminal justice involvement from being booked into the jail . Services include the following three progr ams. Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment (CRT). The Forensic CRT will provide a voluntary, unlocked alternative to hospitalization and/or incarceration for individuals with 4 http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%2 0SERVICES/Regular%20Calendar/Item__1_ACBH_Services_Forensic_sys_5_10_21.pdf Safely diverting people from the justice system into treatment, Stabilizing and connecting individuals in custody to community behavioral health services, and Promoting service participation that reduces recidivism.717 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE INN PROPOSALS 4 mental health and criminal justice involvement who require services to re -stabilize and address the issues that place them at higher risk for police contact and/or an involuntary hold or arrest. While this may seem similar to the Muriel Wright Center in neighboring Santa Clara County, Muriel Wright is intended to provide crisis resi dential services for individuals who receive services through their criminal justice mental health program while Alameda County's proposed CRT is intended to divert individuals with mental health issues from the criminal justice system, regardless of wheth er or not they are already enrolled in forensic mental health services. While they are both forensic CRTs, Alameda County's proposed program serves to test a different function within the system for individuals who may or may not already be enrolled in pu blic mental health services. This program will provide 24/7 mental health services and supports that address mental health, substance use, and criminogenic needs in an unlocked environment. The average length of stay will span 5 -14 days with the opportuni ty to extend up to 30 days with Mental Health Plan approval, and the total capacity will be 16. The Forensic CRT will be licensed by Community Care Licensing as a Short Term Social Rehabilitation Facility and certified by Medi -Cal. The Forensic CRT woul d be available to consumers who are beginning to experience early warning signs of a crisis or other behaviors that place them at high likelihood of police contact. At the Forensic CRT, individuals would be able to stabilize from the crisis and address th e issues that were increasing the likelihood of police contact. The facility will accept consumers ages 18 -59 with mental health and criminal justice involvement who meet medical necessity criteria for crisis residential services and do not require servi ces in a locked setting. This program is intended to be a step up from the community as well as step down from a locked environment, and referrals may come from community mental health providers who are serving justice -involved mental health consumers as well as providers from jail mental health, psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric emergency services, local emergency departments, crisis stabilization units, sobering centers and detoxification units, and the arrest diversion program described below. It is also possible that the Forensic CRT will also accept transfers from the existing CRTs if there is an individual with criminogenic needs that would be better served in a forensic environment. Arrest Diversion/Triage Center. The arrest diversion/triage center is a centrally located program where law enforcement officers can bring someone with a serious mental illness who would otherwise be arrested in order to avoid the jail booking and engage the person in other services. This program is unlocked and is not intended to accept individuals who require services in a locked environment. The arrest diversion center is open 24/7 and staffed with a clinical program supervisor , case managers, and certified forensic peer specialists. When a person is brought to the arrest diversion center, they are welcomed 718 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 5 and offered a snack or other supports to help them feel comfortable and address any imminent basic needs. Once they have settled, the case manager meets with the individual to unde rstand the person's situation and what short term interventions may be most successful in helping the person address whatever issues contributed to law enforcement contact. They may also identify longer term supports that may be useful. Based on this ass essment and the person's preferences and willingness to participate, the case manager will make arrangements with and for the person to obtain the agreed upon short term services. They may also complete referrals for the longer term supports, if it makes sense to do so. While there are other programs that provide diversion from the criminal justice system into treatment, the programs are 1) either led by the justice system or 2) if they are led my mental health staff, they are placed in a crisis or emerge ncy setting. Alameda County's proposed arrest diversion/triage center differs from other models in that it is not a crisis or hospital setting, and mental health staff will provide assessment, brief intervention, and service coordination to engage the per son in services that help them address the issues that led to the police contact and promote their mental health. The County, through its stakeholder -led Justice Involved Mental Health Taskforce and Sequential Intercept Mapping Process, has prioritized t he need to divert arrest for individuals with mental health challenges in Alameda County. One of the identified barriers to pre -arrest diversion is a location where law enforcement officers can take someone to obtain services that will reduce the likeliho od of subsequent police contact. This service provides that alternative drop off location and realigns the need for assessment and case planning back to mental health staff who can determine what a person's needs and preferences are and link them to the a ppropriate programs and interventions. Reducing Probation/Parole Violations (RP/PV) . People with significant mental health challenges often struggle to comply with the terms and conditions of release and may be more likely to be re -incarcerated as a resu lt of a parole or probation violation. Additionally, providers appear hesitant to interact with the justice system on behalf of their consumers for fear of triggering additional legal challenges for the people they serve. This program provides educational materials and training for mental health providers who work with mental health consumers who are involved with the justice system in order to build their capacity to support the people they work with. Specifically, providers will learn how to support cons umers they're working with to comply with the terms and conditions of their release and build the skills and knowledge to help consumers negotiate with their parole or probation officers on how to come into compliance with the terms and conditions of their release without being reincarcerated . APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 6 In the training, mental health providers will learn how work with consumer s to understand their forensic history, what terms and conditions they have failed to comply with, how they understand why they have failed t o comply, what services they have been participating in to address their mental health and criminogenic risk and needs, and what services they are willing to participate in. Staff will also learn how to develop a plan for reaching out to the parole or pro bation officer with the goal or coming into compliance with the terms and conditions of release without \"being violated\" or having to be booked into the jail . Staff will also learn how to negotiat e directly with the probation or parole officer on behalf of or in partnership with the consu mer. Additionally, this program will also support providers to increase knowledge of and comfort in working with legal entities to resolve parole and probation violations. Project General Requirements The Alt ernatives to Confinement continuum of services both adapts an existing mental health practice for the forensic mental health population as well as adapts practices from other disciplines. The Forensic CRT borrows the CRT model, which provide s an alternat ive treatment setting for people who do not require services in a locked environment to stabilize from a crisis and return to their community. While there is a strong evidence base for reducing avoidable hospitalization for people experiencing mental healt h crisis, the CRT model has not been piloted for people experiencing crisis who are at risk of arrest or incarceration as a result of their mental health and criminogenic needs . This continuum of services seeks to test whether or not a forensic -focused CRT would reduce incarceration for people experiencing mental health issues that place them at high likelihood of police contact . The continuum of services would also measure the extent to the extent to which the program can connect people to ongoing mental h ealth services, thereby decreasing the likelihood of future justice involvement. Currently, Alameda County has three CRTs for individuals with mental health issues that are experiencing crisis but do not require services in a locked environment. These pro grams have been successful in preventing avoidable hospitalization and connecting individuals to longer term mental health services and supports. The proposed Forensic CRT would provide the same level of mental health supervision but integrate services th at address substance use and other criminogenic risk and need to support mental health consumers who are justice involved. The Arrest Diversion Center is inspired by triage models from other disciplines. For example, the triage model is used across emergency and jail environments to quickly determine level of need and obtain that level of care. San Francisco used this type o f model specifically in their juvenile justice system to avoid booking youth into their juvenile hall. The Centralized Assessment and Referral Center (CARC) operated by Huckleberry APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 7 Youth Programs accepted juveniles from police officers and would meet with them and their families to assess their need s and connect them to ongoing services and supports. Contra Costa County used a similar model for individuals experiencing homelessness out of their multi -service drop -in centers (MSCs) where police could transp ort an individual to a service center rather than book them into the jail. Once at the MSCs, homeless individuals could access a variety of tangible supports (e.g., laundry, shower, food) as well as obtain an assessment and service linkages and referrals. However, these types of programs are rarely led by the mental health system, and when they are mental health led, they are typically set up as an urgent care center or crisis stabilization unit , are subject to rules and regulations for those environments , and do not have or are unable to maintain a specific forensic focus. This program intends to maintain a low barrier for police drop off and service provision with the singular focus to quickly connect mental health consumers with services that will redu ce the likelihood of police contact or re -arrest , which may include partnering or negotiating with their family and other natural supports to develop a plan. The RP/PV program also takes an existing type of program used across the justice system and appl ies it specifically to mental health consumers. Santa Cruz has a large and highly successful Reducing Revocations program for individuals on community supervision, and San Joaquin County has significantly reduced their incidence of probation violations resulting in re -arrest as a result of this type of intervention. This program will specifically apply that successful intervention to mental health consumers to determine if the RP/PV training can reduce re -arrest for individuals on community supervision as well as increase the rates of successful probation/parole completion for mental health consumers. Individuals to be Served Overall, the Alternatives to Confinement continuum of services will serve 2,279 individuals per year. The arrest diversion center will serve approximately 1,825 individuals per year. This assumes that there will be about 5 individuals per day who are diverted from arrest and jail booking to the center. We expect to serve approximately 700 individuals in the Forensic CRT per year. This assumes that the 16 bed Forensic CRT will operate at 85% capacity with an average length of stay of one week. We also expect to serve about 40 providers in the RP/PV program . However, we anticipate that there is significant overlap between the progr ams. This continuum of services will serve transition age youth ages 18 -25 and adults ages 26 and up who have significant mental health issues and are involved with the criminal justice system; they may also have co -occurring substance use issues. They ma y be of any gender or gender identity as well as sexual orientation. We anticipate that consumers will APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS721 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 8 be predominantly Black or African American with smaller percentages of people who are white, Latinx, or Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian. This is based on demographic data of consumers receiving services at Adult Forensic Behavioral Health, which is the outpatient clinic located inside the County jail, as demonstrated in Table 1. We also anticipate that a proportion of individuals will spea k Spanish and other languages and will ensure language access is available. Research on INN Project The issue of individuals with serious mental illness who are involved with the justice system has become one of the largest problems facing communities across the nation, and the rate of individuals with serious mental illness is two to six times higher among incarcerated populations than it is in the general population.5 Research clearly demonstrates that outcomes for people with mental illness who become justice involved are better when diverted into treatment than when in custody. The Sequential Interc ept Model (SIM)6 is a conceptual framework that defines a series of opportunities to divert individuals who have contact with or are involved with the criminal justice system into \u0003Cloud, David, and Chelsea Davis. Treatment Alternativ es to Incarceration for People with Mental Health Needs in the Criminal Justice System: The Cost -Savings Implications. - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 9 treatment. The SIM framework provides a system -wide way in which to organize interventions and resources in order to maximize diversion into treatment at each intercept. Risk Needs Responsivity (RNR)7 represents an approach to effective interventions within the justice system that allows for a wide variety of programs, services, and interventions to be used. The risk principle states that services should be targeted to the assessed risk of reoffending. The needs principle states that treatment should target assessed criminogenic needs. The responsivity principle states that treatm ent should be tailored to meet the specific learning style, motivation, abilities, and strengths of the individual. Essentially, RNR states that treatment and supervision decisions should be based on assessed risk and need. The Alternatives to Incarcerat ion continuum of services co-locates three services that are intended to divert individuals from being arrested and/or booked into the jail in order to divert them into treatment. Using models from mental health and other disciplines, these three interven tions collectively provide an opportunity to divert forensic mental health consumers from police contact that may result in being detained, from being arrested or booked into the jail if detained, and from being re -arrested if unable to comply with the terms and conditions of their release. These priorities for diversion arose out of the sequential intercept mapping process with Alameda County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force and focus on preventing entry into the criminal justice system as well as promoting exit from the criminal justice system. They are based on the RNR principles in that they do not prescribe a single approach but instead provide opportunities to assess both behavioral health and RNR principles and develop service plans that connect individuals with services that are likely to address behavioral health and criminogenic risk and need as well as reduce the likelihood of sustained or future criminal justice involvement. At this time, no other jurisdiction has developed a singul arly focused Forensic CRT or applied a reducing revocations approach to people with serious mental illness. People with forensic mental health needs may be served in CRT models or general reducing revocation programs, but none specialize in the intersecti on between behavioral health and justice system involvement and specifically target behavioral health and criminogenic risk and need. While there are myriad versions of a triage center across the nation, none are led by the mental health system, and none are exclusively focused on arrest diversion for people with serious mental illness. To this end, this continuum of services aims to explore the extent to which these programs are able to reduce criminal justice system 7 Andrews , D., Bonta , J., & Hoge , R. (1990).

Learning Goals/Project Aims In Alameda County, 25% of ACBH consumers receive mental health services in the jail, and 10% of consumers only receive mental health services in the jail.8 This highlights the need to address the over -incarceration of people with mental health issues and support them outside of a jail environment as a key County priority. This continuum of services , along with th e other Innovation Plan entitled Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services, is one element of a larger Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and represents the service offerings that are relevant to and meet criteria for Innovation projects. With this continuum of services , Alameda County Behavioral Health seeks to pilot these three co -located services to understand the extent to which these programs, separately and together, increase access to and participation in mental health services for adults with mental health and criminal justice involvement; improve outcomes, including reduced jail bookings, jail days, and probation/parole violations; and increase knowledge and collaboration between mental health and criminal justice providers and ag encies. For the Forensic CRT, we hope to learn the extent to which the Forensic CRT is able to prevent avoidable jail bookings and jail bed days at the moment of intervention as well as following CRT participation. We also hope to learn the extent to wh ich individuals engage in ongoing mental health services following CRT discharge. These are similar to the expected outcomes of a non -forensic CRT except they substitute jail bookings and bed days for crisis and hospitalization. Similarly, we hope to le arn the extent to which law enforcement officers are willing to divert individuals to the arrest diversion center in lieu of booking them into the jail therefore resulting in reduced jail bookings. We also hope to explore if and how individuals participat e in ongoing mental health services following participation at the arrest diversion center and whether or not they remain in the community or are re - arrested. We also hope to learn more about their assessed level of need and referred level of care to bett er share system capacity needs for ongoing program planning. Finally, we hope to learn whether or not a concerted effort to reduce parole and probation violations for people with serious mental illness reduces booking individuals into the jail as a resul t of parole or probation violation. We also hope to learn the extent to which the program results in increased knowledge, understanding, and collaboration amongst probation and parole - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 11 Evaluation or Learning Plan This Alternatives to Confinement continuu m of services evaluation will explore process and outcome measures related to the three co -located services. The overarching evaluation questions include: 1. What resources are being invested, by whom, and how much? 2. Who is being served, at what dosage, and in what ways , including participation in more than one INN -funded service? 3. To what extent do people who participate in INN -funded services experience reduced jail bookings, jail days, and parole/probation revocations? 4. To what extent to people who participate in INN -funded services experience increased service engagement and participation? 5. How does knowledge, understanding, and collaboration between mental health and criminal justice agencies change over the course of the project? What activities and experiences promote or detract from the working relationship? The evaluation will explore the following types of quantitative data: Socio -demographics of individuals served, including race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, zip code, income type and amount, housing status, level of education, and veteran status. Clinical and justice involved profile of individuals served, including mental health diagnoses and previous service participation; previous arrest, charge, and booking information; substance use and misuse; known trauma history; other clinically relevant information. Current program and service participation, including program, service type, procedure code, provider type, dates of service , length of encounter, length of episode , disposition . This includes for INN -funded programs as well as all other MHP -funded services, such as crisis and hospitalization as well as other residential and outpatient services. Current justice system interaction s, including jail bookings and discharge dates, charges filed, court dispositions. If feasible, police contact and arrest data that did not result in a jail booking may also be included. Referrals, including referrals sources into the INN -funded program s as well as referrals and linkages provided from the INN -funded programs into other mental health services. Experience of services from consumers, family, behavioral health providers, and justice professionals.

Quantitative data will be collected directly from the County's Electronic Health Record, the Sherriff's Office via existing Memorandum of Understanding, the Community Health Record funded through the Whole Person Care Initiative, and via data request to the courts. Experience of services and perception of knowledge, understanding, and collaboration will be collected via interviews and focus groups; there may also be a brief survey developed for service recipients and their families or involved professionals. Data will be collected on an ongoing basis and reported annually to providers and partners in order to support communications and continuous quality improvement as well as to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) in order to meet INN reporting requirements. Section 3: Additional Information for Regulatory Requirements Contracting The County expects to contract the Forensic CRT to a community -based provider and may also choose to contract for the other services. Additionally, the County intends to contract for an external evaluator for this project to work with our internal data support team in exploring the learning goals and evalu ation questions listed above as well as complete required reporting for the project. The County will appoint a contract monitor for each of these contracts to ensure contract compliance as well as a portion of the County project/program manager to supervi se the quality of work performed. Community Project Planning These projects arose out of a longer term planning and system improvement process dedicated to improving services for justice involved mental health consumers. The Justice Involved Mental Health (JIMH) Task Force included representatives from the Health Care Services Agency, Alameda County Behavioral Health, Public Defender, District Attorney, provider and advocacy organizations, consumer and family representatives, faith based and other communit y leaders. After a more than year long process, the JIMH Task Force published a report in September 2020 with multiple stakeholder recommendations, including a focus on preventing law enforcement contact and arrest diversion , among other suggestions. Con currently, ACBH published a Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan in October 2020 that was informed by JIMH APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 13 and included additional actions informed by evidence based practice and ACBH's strategic direction. During 2021, ACBH systematically went throug h the Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and identified aspects of the plan that either warranted further development and/or consideration or may meet criteria for INN funds. As a part of this process, ACBH contracted with the Indigo Project to engag e in INN Project planning. The Indigo Project met with a number of internal and external stakeholders to gather information and workshop the ideas and concepts as they evolved , including: Consumer representatives and members of the Pool of Consumer Champions Family representatives and individuals from NAMI Providers who represent communities who are underrepresented because of cultural affiliation and language access Members of the African American subcommittee Members of the MHSA Stakeholder group Healthcare for the homeless providers System of Care Directors for Adult, Crisis, and Forensic Mental Health Services Consumer and Family Empowerment Managers With each discussion, the concepts evolved and were further developed and clarified. These proje cts will be included in the MHSA Annual Update Community Program Planning (CPP) process in 2022 with the hopes of beginning implementation in FY2022. MHSA General Standards This project arose out of a community effort to address the needs of mental healt h consumers who are forensically involved. It was developed by consumers, family, and communities to support wellness and recovery and avoid incarceration. This project arose out of a community effort to address the needs of mental health consumers who ar e forensically involved. It was developed by consumers, family, and communities to support wellness and recovery and avoid incarceration. Community collaboration is exemplified in not only how this project was developed but also in how the project itself works to keep individuals within their communities rather than removing them and placing them in a jail environment. Cultural Competency is included as a foundational component in that this project seeks to address the o verincarceration of people with mental illness, the majority of whom are BIPOC individuals , by preventing police contact and jail booking as well as supporting individuals to successfully exit the justice system. Additionally, the services themselves will be informed by and primarily staffed by individuals who represent our County's diverse populations. Services will be APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS727 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS 14 client and family driven in that services aim to preserve a person's freedom, independence, and ability to consent to their own services by using person centered planning with family member input that respects an individual's needs and preferences and works in partnership with each individual and their family to discover how they understand the issues that they're facing and helps them deve lop a plan that they are willing to do to address what is most important to them. The services are wellness, recovery, and resiliency focused in that they are built upon the belief that participation in mental health services is more productive and meanin gful than incarceration and that services that respect an individual's ability to invest in their own recovery journey are more likely to result in sustained freedom than \"rehabilitation \" provided by the jails. Finally, services are intended to be integra ted in that these programs seek to strengthen collaboration between mental health and justice organizations so that individuals and families can streamline efforts and communication between mental health services and criminal justice requirements in order to promote community -based recovery and minimize or avoid criminal justice involvement. Cultural Competence and Stakeholder Participation in Evaluation On a quarterly basis, ACBH will convene a stakeholder meeting with individuals who are invested in bot h forensic mental health INN projects, which include this project and the Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services. This meeting will serve dual purposes to gather information from stakeholders and partners about their perspectives on the proj ect and its implementation as well as to provide data from the evaluation to support a CQI process. As a part of this project, we will explore the extent to which the project is reaching its intended target population and that people receiving services ar e reflective of the jail population (i.e., the population receiving services is comparable to the Santa Rita population in terms of race/ethnicity and age). This will be one component of what is discussed in the quarterly meetings as well as overall feedb ack and evaluation data described in the preceding section. Innovation Project Sustainability and Continuity of Care This project will primarily serve individuals with serious mental illness. If this project accomplishes its intended objectives of 1) reducing jail bookings and jail days and 2) increasing participation in ongoing mental health services , the County will continue to fund the project using a combination of MHSA Community Services a nd Supports funding and Federal Financial Participation (FFP). All of the services described in this plan should be eligible for Medi -Cal reimbursement following completion of the INN project. Communication and Dissemination Plan If this project is succ essful at 1) reducing jail bookings and jail days and 2) increasing APPENDIX B-5 FY20/23 MHSA INN PROPOSALS728 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 15 participation in ongoing mental health services, ACBH will apply to present learnings at California -specific conferences, including the forensic mental health association, California Institute of Behavioral Health Services, and California Association of Counties (CSAC) conferences. Additionally, ACBH will request that the contracted evaluator prepare a white paper that can be distributed through the California Behavioral Health Directors A ssociation, California Probation Officers Association, and the MHSOAC listserv. Keywords include: 1. Jail diversion 2. Pre-arrest diversion 3. Reducing revocations 4. Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment 5. Forensic mental health diversion Timeline ACBH proposes a 5 year Innovation project in which the first two years of the project allow for facility start -up. While the non -residential services may be able to be implemented more quickly, we believe that it is important to have all elements available at the same time, particularly with a co -located service model. To that end, ACBH will begin the site identification and procurement process upon MHSOAC approval. This may take up to nine months to facilitate a competitive bid process and then enter into contracts. The second year will focus on preparing the site and program for opening, including preparing the application for Community Care Licensing as well as the materials, including policies and procedures, for Medi -Cal certification. Concurrently, the evaluato rs will be working with the department and stakeholders to develop the evaluation approach. Years 3 -5 will focus on service provision as well as data collection and analysis to support learning. In the final year, ACBH will also develop an ongoing fundin g strategy using MHSA, realignment, and FFP dollars. In year 5, the evaluators will also draft the summative evaluation report and a white paper detailing project implementation, outcomes, and lessons learned.

Peer involvement from consumer s and family members of Alameda County is essential not only to Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Innovation planning and program development, the Peers Organizing Community Change1 (POCC ) is utilized for , but not limited to, outreach, focus groups, and surveys to assist in developing programs by all systems of care. The POCC's role is to provide a strong consumer voice in Alameda's mental health system and in the community. Alameda County began a comprehensive peer organization in 2006 holding their first major peer event in 2007 with an undertaking to educate, advocate, and lead. The POCC's mission is to improve the quality of life for the county's residents who have mental health, mental health and substance use is sues in whatever setting they find themselves and to provide consumer perspective in transforming the County's behavioral systems of care to a recovery vision that consumer -driven, culturally, responsive, and holistic in its services and supports .2 The Co unty is dedicated to robust approaches to ensure opportunities and uplift peers within the county regarding their skill level . Peer delivered health and wellness services are important complements for an integrated care team model working to help a system merge the concepts of recovery with physical well - being and overall recovery.3 With the passage of California's Peer Support S pecialist Certification Program Act of 2020, ACBH is looking to further build trainings and increase employment opportunities of its diverse peer workforce in crisis care. As the peer support specialist workforce has grown over the years , their roles have evolve d, which in turn , has led to gaps in knowledge about their activities within systems of care . ACBH is seeking to develop an online Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Peer to Peer training program to train peers with the skills of DBT. This program i s to provide new skills as peers enhance their hire ability. ACBH wishes to provide a learning environment that is removed from restrictive time and space. The overall goal is to deliver a self -paced, recovery -oriented mode of learning for peers to cultivate relationships with others committed to learning, practicing, educating others about, and building mastery of the 4 DBT skill sets: core mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.

Building peer skills with DBT training, is an excellent addition to the POCC's mission of providing an empowered and informed voice: of, by, and for consumers in the behavioral health care system, related systems, and in the community.4 California's Peer Support Specialist Certification Program Act of 2020 has led ACBH to opt -in to: 1) Peers being a provider type under Medi -Cal that could bill for peer services as well as other services; and 2) Providing a process for certification of peer support specialists. DBT is primarily a cognitive -behavioral treatment, with roots in Eastern and Zen mindfulness practices. DBT generally treats severe emotional dysregulation, suicidality, and non -suicidal self -injury in clients.5 However, its principles are being expanded to many other populations. DBT's core ph ilosophy includes its basis in mindfulness, clear prioritizing of treatment targets, and a dialectical balance between acceptance and change strategies. It is well documented that peer supported services provide a unique and beneficial aspect to mental he alth treatments. With the pandemic unintentionally showing that online meetings, trainings, and learning are feasible, ACBH is progressing forward into the future using technology to develop a DBT online training for peers to improve/add to their skills av oiding high costs and low accessibility associated with standard DBT training; developing peer to peer skills practice groups offered in person or virtually to support the strengthening of mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interper sonal effectiveness skills; supporting the emerging certification process for peer support specialists empowering peers in their supportive roles; and decrease mental health stigma. What Has Been Done During the course of POCC's history, major efforts to get MHSA dollars to fund consumer run programs was first sought so consumers could be hired through MHSA's Workforce, Education and Training funding. The POCC developed a Peer Employment Tool Kit during the planning period , and contributed greatly by parti cipating on the county's initial MHSA planning group that was deciding where resources would go. An initial hire by the county's behavioral health care was done to implement the hiring of consumers ' initiative. Eventually the POCC's efforts received approv al for a consumer organization to provide the hiring of consumers. As the POCC grew with more members, more committees were needed to reflect the consumer perspective on system of care changes. These changes were to reflect ethnic diversity, age and gend er identity. Additional committees were formed to address important issues in the community. These issues included Healing Trauma, Substance Use Recovery, Public Policy & Education, and Veterans.6 Today, the 4 See https://www.pocc.org/about -us/history -mission -values 5 Koerner K.

Why the Need Peer support has been around for decades . There are thousands of peer support programs in the United States. However, many who need peer support in order to maintain their life, be it treating their diabetes , veterans with PTSD , or maintaining one's recovery, do not always receive the support they need. Peer support programs all too often have small budgets while trying to help many people. The lack of resources tends to delay development of new approaches especially for peer su pport programs as these tend to have inadequate funding. The passing of the Affordable Care Act (2010) has provided a heavy focus on prevention, and created many opportunities for developing and funding peer -delivered whole health and wellness services. T his landmark legislation coupled with the unique qualifications peers have brought to behavioral health systems has brought much needed resources to those with mental health challenges. Howe ver, as with any profession, as it grows and becomes more established, there is a need to create new opportunities to take advantage of existing expertise, while keeping individuals in the profession interested and feeling like they are advancing their careers.7 Peer support is based on the belief that \"people wh o have face, endured and overcome adversity can offer useful support, encouragement, hope, and perhaps mentorship to others facing similar situations...\"8 Peer delivered health and wellness services are important complements for an integrated care team model working to help a system merge the concepts of recovery with physical well -being and overall recovery.9 Since the beginning, the POCC has operated under this recovery vision along with its commitment to ensure that the consumer viewpoint was a significant part of ACBH. ACBH and POCC are determined to advance and promote peer support programs. When providing peer support that involves positive self -disclosure, role modeling, and unconditional regard, peer staff have also been found to increase participants' sense of hope, control, and ability to effect changes in their lives; increase their self -care, sense of community belonging, and satisfaction with various life domains; an d decrease participants' level of depression and psychosis.10 Doing so will require testing innovative treatment modalities. Although DBT was developed to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD), evidence has shown that DBT is not only an effective tre atment for BPD, it has successfully been adapted or modified to populations 7 Daniels, A.

Adding DBT to the skills of peers is a natural extension. There are several DBT techniques that coincide with the recovery philosophy making it a good fit : Validation is the non- judgment belief that consumers 'experiences are understandable and important . The peer practices validation by respecting the program participants self- knowledge ; Radical genuineness is a validation strategy that believes in the client's strengths and capacity for change; and Collaboration which in DBT is viewed as a strategy that strengthens the working relationship12 and coincides with peer process \"to arrive at a mutually acceptable plan for moving forward in the treatment process.\"13 It is these parallels in philosophy that makes DBT training to peer s very appealing to refresh and broaden the skills of peer support specialists . No one knows when the pandemic will end or if it will become endemic. What we do know is t here are already studies showing the negative impact on mental health the pandemic is afflicting upon our communit ies. With DBT online training, peers will safely be able to uplift their skills with a practice that is proven to work and assist in alleviating the growing number of community members who need support with their mental health. Budg et Alameda Count y is requesting Commissi on approval to earmark $2,163,844 of MHSA Innovation funds over a four- year timeline for the creation and development of an online DBT training program for peers , peer to peer skills practice groups and research . Outcomes Creating and developing DBT online training modules geared for peer support specialists and in person or virtual peer to peer skills practice groups will support the County's commitment to build on its Peer Support Specialist Certification trainings and in crease employment opportunities of the diverse peer workforce in its systems of care. The Peer to Peer DBT program is to provide new skills as peers enhance their hire ability ; and test if these new skills are effective in practice groups. Developing an online DBT training will also be complimentary to ACBH's Crisis Care Management Services (CCMU) grant which was awarded to ACBH in December, 2021 . The CCMU grant was awarded from the Department of Health Care Services.

Innovations are defined as novel, creative, and/or ingenious mental health practices/approaches that are expected to contribute to learning, which are developed within communities through a process that is inclusive and representative. The County requests YOUR feedback to help identify which of the THREE innovative concepts to impl ement. Please submit your suggestions by April 30, 202 2. 1. Consumer Empowerment Using DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy ) The DBT project will develop an online Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) Peer to Peer training program to train peers with the ski lls of DBT. An online training program is able to provide an avenue that is self - paced, recovery -oriented mode of learning for peers to cultivate relationships with others committed to learning, practicing, educating others about, and building mastery of t he 4 DBT skill sets: core mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. 2. Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services The Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services is a collection of four (4) components, three of which are peer-led and one that is family focused: Reentry Coaches, WRAP for Reentry, Forensic Peer Respite, and Family Navigation and Support . The project seeks to support mental health consumers who are justice involved transitioning back into the community . This project also seeks to build capacity of family members to advocate for loved ones with a serious mental illness who has become justice involved. 3. Alternatives to Confinement Continuum of Forensic Services The Alternatives to Incarceration Continuum of Fore nsic Services is a collection of three (3) services that work together and are intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from criminal justice system into mental health services. Diversion is sought when early signs of crisis occur, police c ontact which may lead to arrest, and probation or parole non -compliance. The services include : Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment, Arrest Diversion/Triage Center, and Reducing Probation/Parole Violations . 1.

The funds are divided among five components, two of which serve clients through multiple programs . During Fiscal Year 20-21, the Community Services and Supports and Prevention and Early Intervention components funded over 100 program s. Community Services and Supports (CSS) use funds for direct services to adults with severe mental illness (SMI) and children with severe emotional disturbance (SED) . CSS fund s two areas : Full Service Partnerships (FSP) , which provide voluntary wrap around services to consumers or partners diagnosed with a n SED or SMI and Outreach and Engagement/System Development Programs (OESD) , which cover multiple treatment modalities and services to those with SED or SMI. Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) services embrace an approach that engag es individuals before the development of mental illness and intervene early to reduce symptoms. All PEI programs use outreach to connect with communities, provide access and linkage to necessary care, reduce stigma and discrimination associated with mental health, and promote wellness. A subset of PEI programs are the Unserved/Underserved Ethnic and Language Populati ons (UELP) programs, which focus on the Afghan/South Asian, African, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, and Latino communities .

While they are all strengths -based and recovery oriented, the staffing and program activities vary . However, all teams provide intensive case management services that work with clients: \"... to get them connected to resources in the community and to help them bu ild their own internal reservoir so that they're able to live more independently and utilize crisis services less and live a more fulfilled and stable life.\" - Bonita House Service Team Program, Population Served, and Agency Type Program Population Served Agency Type Asian Health Services Adults in North County who speak Asian languages Community - Based Organization (CBO) BACS Adults Bonita House Adults Felton Institute Older Adults La Familia Adults in North County who speak Spanish La Clinica, Casa del Sol Adults in South County who speak Spanish Telecare Visions Adults West Oakland Health Council Adults Eden Community Supports Center Adults Alameda County Oakland Community Supports Center Adults Tri City Community Supports Center Adults Valley Community Supports Center Adults Report Rationale and Methods Prior to Fiscal Year 2021 -2022, m ost of t he Service Teams were funded through Medi- Cal/Medicare billing and State of California realignment funds , which w ere impacted by the COVID -19 Pandemic. In order to continue to provide these important services the Services Teams will now be funded under the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), which will replace the realignment part of their funding. MHSA funds mental health services in California through a one percent tax on personal annual incomes that exceed one million dollars. It is designed to expand and transform California's mental health systems to Appendix C-2 MHSA Profile Sheet: MHSA CSS Service Team Report MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG better serve individuals with and at risk of serious mental health issues and their families. Locally, ACBH 's MHSA Division is the agency that administers the MHSA funding. One of the statutes of MHSA requires non -supplantation meaning that Service Teams will need to be transformed to be funded by MHSA. To explore possi ble transformation options the MHSA Division's Management Analyst performed hour -long interviews in June of 2021 with the Service Team's Program Managers . Program Description Program Activities Programs provide a variety of activities to clients. Below are the services that the Service Teams provide to their clients , this is not an exhaustive list and additional activities are described in more detail below. Program Name Outpatient Services In-Language Services (non -English) Integrated Primary Care (PATH) Substance Use Disorder Treatment (Options) Supported Employment (IPS) Substitute Payee Program Community Based Programs Asian Health Services BACS (ICM) Bonita House Felton Institute La Clinica, Casa del Sol La Familia Telecare Visions West Oakland Health Council County Run Programs Eden Community Support Center Oakland Community Support Center Tri-City Community Support Center Valley Community Support Center APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 Outpatient Services The main category of services that the Service Teams provide fall under outpatient services, which include mental health services, case management/brokerage, crisis intervention, and medication support. Aside from the above services , Asian Health Services, La Familia, La Clinica, Oakland, Telecare, West Oakland Health Council, and BACS progr ams described the support groups that they provide. The support groups range from clinical and SUD to health focused and one program even created an anger management class. \"We do have a W RAP group that is offered twice a week for family and clients and family members of clients. It's a supportive group run by La Familia. \" - La Familia Physical resources a re provided by many programs, which come from their board of directors , incentive programs, or in some cases donated from the community around them. 1. Funding for incentives - La Familia, Tri-City, Valley , La Clinica, and Eden \"There's a program that if we h ave savings on paying for people's medications it gets passed on to the clinics so we might get a couple thousand dollars a year. It's not a lot of money and we can buy gift cards with that a certain number of gift cards and then we have them for the year. So that if somebody one of the clients doesn't or didn't get a check or doesn't have food we can give them a Safeway gift card. \" - Tri-City and Valley 2. Hygiene kits - Asian Health Services and Oakland \"We are big on reaching out to get people to donate ite ms to our clinic. We have hygiene kits that we give to our homeless population.\" - Oakland 3. Transportation around community - All but one agency, BACS, mentioned that they have vehicles for case managers to use or their agency provides some transportation. BACS case managers still transport client, but use their own cars and also provide bus and BART tickets to clients. \"We do maintain two vehicles that we use for transportation as needed. It's not always that we can help every patient with transportation b ecause we only have two vehicles. But when we can it is useful to have those. \" - La Clinica 4. Social Activities , which included clients coming into the office to hang out (pre -pandemic) or organized events, were mentioned by La Clinica, Oakland, Tri -City, Va lley, Eden, Bonita House, and La Clinica. \"Yeah, our peers maintain a community garden I think that's a source of peer socialization and agency building it's really lovely that they have it. \" - La Clinica Although only mentioned by a subset of programs the system -wide resources that case managers would help clients connect with include: 1. Housing help - Asian Health Services and BACS \"We also have that HFSN , which is the Housing Fast Network , that's the Henry Robinson and the Holland hotels. Those are just basically what it sounds like they take people from just APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG straight up the street with the purpose of having them be able to come in or sleep inside save some money and then we'll work with th em to get more stable housing. \" - BACS 2. Wellness Centers - Bonita House, Eden, BACS \"We also just reopened the Wellness Center , which is fantastic . It was closed for over a year and before we closed we would literally have I don't know 30 people a day in there. We would serve food and people could come in first thing in the morning that have been outside all night and then you have breakfast and coffee there's someplace where you can be. It's one of the only places in Oakland, Townhouse our wellness center , where you can walk in without a referral and you're welcome there. Clients can get their mail sent there, we have a computer lab, we have groups . We just reopened and they have a full groups schedule put together .\" - BACS In-language Services There are three Service Teams that provide services in languages other than English . During Fiscal Year 20 -21, La Clinica and La Familia served Spanish speaking clients and Asian Health Services served people in Cantonese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Korean, T agalog, Mien, Lao, Japanese, and a Chinese Dialect . \"I think some of the strengths is that we cover quite a few languages with the staffing arrangement. By having a psychiatrist that speaks the language, by having clinical staff counselors that speak the language, and also trainees and interns that we recruit. And of course, our clinical managers as well. That helps quite a bit with serving the diverse cultures and communities of the AAPI community. \" - Asian Health Services Asian Health Services, La Clinic a, and La Familia serve d the most non - English speakers during Fiscal Year 20 -21 Note: Telecare served only English speakers during FY 20 -21. Extracted from ACBH's Yellowfin Platform. Primary Care and Health Focused Resources Three county -run programs, Eden, Oakland, and Tri-City, contract with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to provide primary care integrated into the mental health services through the Pro moting Access to Health (PATH) program . These services are needed because people with serious mental illness die on average 24 years earlier than the general population, SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 due to chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease1. While Asian Health Services, West Oakland Health Council, and La Clinica C asa del Sol do not have integrate primary care they are co - located with FQHCs . Asian Health Services also has dental providers that they can refer their clients to. \"Departmentally we have access to traditional healing and culturally acceptable component and care program that a lot of other service teams may not have. So, I think that's useful to us and our patients.\" - La Clinica, del Sol \"When her patients require an injection, they are sent on the unit to get one done by a nurse for another medical provi der.\" - West Oakland Health Council Substance Use Disorder Treatment In addition to the PATH program the same three county -run clinics , Eden, Oakland, and Tri- City, also have substance use disorder (SUD) services integrated into the Service Teams. The SUD program called Options provides : \"...a group once a week and then they do a lot of community outreach for people who have substance abuse issues to try to engage them to try to address their substance use and especially as it interferes with their mental health treatment. \" - Tri-City Other programs also have access to or provide in -house SUD treatment . Asian Health Services and La Clinica have internal rehab support an d the program manager from Bonita House spoke about the dual diagnosis residential treatment programs that are meant to provide services to those that have a mental illness and a substance use problem. While these programs are available across the county t hey are limited so most of the SMI clients receive services from programs that are not meant to address both their SMI and their SUD. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) or Supported Employment The approach of IPS workers is to partner with c lients and engage them around their unique interests and needs in : finding a job identify ing employers apply ing for jobs and assist ing with retention . The IPS worker is embedded into the team and continu es to collaborate with the client's clinical team and sign ificant others to aid in their success. After a c lient is working, providers continue to support the individual until the job is secure and they are satisfied with the job match. If they want a different job or lose the one secured, IPS and clients keep lo oking for jobs to help find a better fit. There is a \"zero exclusion\" approach to recruiting c lients for services, which means that if they are motivated to work and have expressed interest, they will be engaged despite any presenting barrier. \"What happens is the vocational programs that come on- site and join our service team in meetings and get to know some of the client's background and also meet with the clients to look for jobs that interest them or a suitable for them. We've been really successf ul with a vocational rehab specialist and team at the county to get jobs four our clients. \" - Asian Health Services 1 Manderscheid, R. (2006).

APPENDIX C-2 PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Substit ute Payee The ACBH Substitute Payee is a program that the Service Teams provide to accomplish the following goals: i. Promote fiscal/b enefits stability among clients. ii. Support clients in maintaining basic needs including but not limited to housing, food, utilities, and clothing . iii. Coach clients to achieve financial independence. Oftentimes the case managers are the ones in the role of man aging a client's money. \"Yet we have to do the SSI paperwork and tracking for so many different things. Any budget changes, any special money, any moves, any hospitals, any jails. They all require these forms that we have to do and can't bill for it's not a mental health service. \" - Telecare Staffing Patterns and Strengths The staff makeup and configuration vary by team , but Program Managers mostly agree on the strengths of their staffing pattern. Program Manager Role Most of the teams have one Program Manager that does the following: A. Supervise clinical staff (ensuring clinical services, practices) both licensed and unlicensed and administrative work. B. Step in when understaffed and need a team lead or teams need help. Two of the teams , La Fami lia and Felton, have two program managers . When interviewed, Felton had two interim licensed managers that were splitting the role, but the mode is similar to the description above. One of La Familia's program manager s supervises the clinical aspects of th e program and the other oversees the administrative and operations of the program and is unlicensed. Team Staffing and Roles The staffing patterns that focus on the case management activities vary by programs, however, all but one program falls into the two general categories below : 1. Primarily staffed by Master's level clinicians that do intakes, case management, and all assessments. Tri-City, Valley, Telecare, West Oakland Health Council, and Eden practice this pattern. 2. Licensed and unlicensed staff are clinical case managers that work together to provide case management services and day -to-day needs, with staff therapists or licensed clinicians that mostly focus on assessments and more intensive therapy . La Clinica, Felton, La Familia, BACS, Bonita House, and Asian Health Services practice this pattern. \"The program has two clinical case managers, those individuals focus on annual assessments with clients, they do some limited one -on-one therapy, they also hold a caseload of clients that are a little bit m ore acute. They're currently 2 case managers on the team if we're fully staffed there would be four and a case manager carries a caseload of about 30 individuals and they are providing mental health rehabilitation skills and case management to and with cli ents.\" - Bonita House APPENDIX SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 Finally, the Oakland Community Supports Center has a unique staffing pattern with two teams that have a flexible engagement team embedded in each. \"Our engagement team is just that they have a smaller caseload and they get all of ou r new referrals. The thought and hope is that when we get new referrals they're able to meet with them more frequently and go out in the community and try to find them especially if they're currently not housed. We work with them on trying to get everythin g set up their initial assessment and treatment plan and their necessary referrals. After that is done then they are transferred to somebody on the regular team... if you [a team member] get an alert that they are at John George they'll [the engagement team] go immediately to John George to try to meet with them. They have a smaller caseload but they still do have their own caseload as well. Some consumers they'll work with them for 6 months, for some it'll be 3, for some it will be a year.\" - Oakland CSC Other Staffing Resources Aside from licensed and unlicensed staff that focus on case management, there are other staffing resources that the programs have access to. Administrative/Clerical Position were provided at Tri -City, Valley, Eden, and Felton. For Tri-City, Valley, and Felton they provide clerical support to help process paperwork for billing or answer phones. For Tri - City, Valley, and Eden Alameda County provides a staff person to help improve the quality of clinical documentation. \"I was going t o say one of the things that the county does provide we just recently got a QA [quality assurance] person who is just working with the county teams ... She comes to team meetings and I'll ask her sometimes to review charts ... Staff's been very responsive to tha t that's felt very positive to them because they are doing so much paperwork that they would rather do it right and be done with it you know. And a lot of this stuff is sometimes hard to interpret so I think they feel better about their paperwork. \" - Tri-City and Valley Internship Programs are important to both cultivate and expand the workforce . During the listening sessions conducted by the MHSA Division internship programs were mentioned by participants as an important way to build the workforce. Below are the agencies that mentioned having interns during the school year. Agency Description Asian Health Services Psychology, social work, marriage and family therapists, and licensed professional clinical counselors BACS Master's degree p racticum students perform the initial intake assessments and treatment planning La Clinica Casa del Sol Master's degree practicum students Oakland Community Supports Center UCSF Nursing and masters of social work interns Tri-City and Valley Social work and nurse practitioner students \"One thing that I will say is a change that has just been made that is really helpful that our Clinical Director started is a practicum program where we can have a new client come in and they will do the assessment and then treatment planning, which takes some of the weight off the clinicians.\" - BACS APPENDIX C-2 TEAM MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Staffing Strengths Program Managers were asked about the strengths of the way that they staff their teams and overwhelmingly t eam collaboration was seen as a strength, regardl ess of the staffing patterns. Telecare, La Familia, Tri-City, Valley, La Clinica, Oakland, West Oakland, Eden, Felton, and Bonita House all mentioned team collaboration as a strength. The definition of collaboration varie d from using a multi - disciplinary p erspective or the case managers working together when short staffed. \"When a client starts with us they get three people , they get a med provider that's clinically appropriate, they get a peer specialist if that's appropriate, and they definitely get a clinician . I think one of the strengths of that kind of a staffing model is that a client , apart from just getting a lot of support , there's also a lot of different ways to approach the care ...So, being able to share in that work can sometimes be helpful. And kind of tagging off of each other. I think also our clients benefit from having multiple people to support different goals for them. I think that's one of the strengths is just the collaborati ve approach to it. Like, \"Hey, person X is kind of pissed off at me this week because I couldn't do Y so can you tag in this week to support.\" Really that kind of collective approach to the care is really one of the strengths\" - Felton Another theme was co mmunity knowledge, defined as knowing what services and supports are being offered in the community and/ or having linguistic capability. Notably, Asian Health Services, West Oakland Health Council , La Familia, La Clinica , which are the teams that serve 85% or more people of color and the three service teams that serve a lot of non-English speakers (range 39% -61%) mentioned this theme. \"I guess I'll start off with the paraprofessionals, although they do not have their credentials or the academic backgrounds they do provide a rich amount of experience and diversity to serve our population. Because they come from the communities that we serve they have a better understanding at times and the connection with the community members and such to be able to provide care, in language, to our population. I think in that respect the paraprofessionals are very valuable to us.\" - Asian Health Services The licensed clinical case managers were also seen as a strength because they are able to do clinical documentation and to provide some therapy to clients that need it. Asian Health Services, Telecare, Tri- City, Valley, La Clinica, West Oakland, and Bonita House, mentioned this as a strength. La Familia said that having a licensed Program Manager would take some of the burden off of the staff therapists, which focus on assessments and therapy, but do not have a caseload. \"I think the strengths are that there is always a clinical eye to whatever need is being addressed by our particular clients and patients. The same is not aff orded when a case manager is sort of directing the services or the service provision at that given time. I think it's useful that a clinical person is both directing and connecting needs, they're also observing how they are participating in the world and h as a better sense of how they can help them meet their treatment objectives and also observing and identifying different barriers.\" - La Clinica Client Success and Measuring if A nyone is \" Better Off\" Success Definition While ACBH collects and provides a lo t of data for the Services Team, when the Program Managers were asked what success looked like for their clients and there was n ot one simple easy thing for providers . They did not have a unifying single definition for what success looks like. Most provide rs said that success is dependent on where the client starts and is dependent upon their goals. APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 \"I think that depends on it's, sort of subjective in my opinion, I think it depends on the client and how they might define success and see what success is...A life worth living is one way to think of it.\" - Felton While there was not a unified definition for success there are some commonalities among what the Program Managers said a successful client looked like. They spoke about clients having relationships with others, feeling like they can accomplish tasks, and making decisions about the direction of their life. \"I agree it's nice when they start to desire things like I want my DMV license, or I want to move out and not live with my parents. It feels like so metimes some of them are stuck in a younger developmental stage and they need a lot of support. Some of them they had that support they have that awareness and that desire to have that little bit of adult independence which is good we want them to be able to get there but it take s a lot of work to get them there.\" - La Familia \"But for some consumers who maybe have more severe issues or who have been institutionalized where they maybe spent many years at Napa or Gladman for them maybe success would be okay you're able to take your medications half the time or you're able to go independently to a doctor's appointment or even your able to ride the bus. I know there is I can't think of any case manager that we have that hasn't had at least one client that we actually had to teach how to ride the bus.\"- Oakland Because there is not a definition of success for clients of the Service Teams, there seems to be difficulty in graduating clients from the program to some sort of lower level of care. \"I think one of the things that I still haven't necessarily gotten my head wrapped around is when somebody has achieved a level of success what does graduation look like and at what point do we talk about graduation? There are and not insignificant number of individuals on the caseload that have been clients of Bonita house for 20 years.\" - Bonita House Other Data the Agencies Collect In order to explore other ways that the Services Teams might measure success the Program Managers shared what other data their agencies collect. Some of the agencies review their d emographics , the diagnoses of clients, and client satisfaction surveys in order to do program planning. \"We also look at basic demographic information, where our clients are coming from, where they're located, what zip c odes, what ethnicities, what languages they speak. So, a lot of those demographic information we check routinely to see where things are going in our clinic. Then of course the clinics, the type of diagnoses we're seeing on the mental health side, what typ e of services they are coming in for. Is it more medication services? Is it more rehab services? Along those lines and the folk's gender and stuff like that.\" - Asian Health Services \"I think also we're looking at demographic data because we're curious abo ut who were serving and who's successfully retaining in the program and not .\" - Felton Although, a few Program Mangers said that their agency either does not collect more data (West Oakland Health Council) or are not focused on data because they are focusi ng more on the day -to-day management (Eden and BACS ). \"I don't use it extensively because my focus is more on the work that we're providing to the clients so I get my mandates in terms of things that we need to be doing differently and tailor it APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG in that regards. Data doesn't mean a whole lot to me sadly because I'm really focused on the day to day with staffing. \" - Eden Changes to the Program due to the COVID -19 Pandemic Alameda County's first confirmed case of COVID -19 was reported on February 28, 2020, and the Bay Area's first shelter in place order went into effect on March 17, 2020. As of January 21, 2022 , Alameda County has a cumulative 203,927 confirmed cases and 1,575 deaths . There are 81% full vaccinated residents in the county. In-person Groups and Transportation Many activities were affected by the Pandemic, including in -person groups, which stopped. Programs had varying success with moving them to online and/or teleconference. Asian Health services had low attendance in their virtual group, La Familia had good attendance at a teleconference, Oakland had phone groups but they were not as successful as in -person group. La Clinica, Telecare, West Oakland, and BACS did not replace their in -person group and Eden tried but was unable to implement it successfully. Clients also stopped hanging out at the office at Tri -City, Valley, and Eden. Additionally, transportation changed because case managers could no longer provide it to clients, Telecare, Tri -City, Valley, and Eden mentioned this change. \"Absolutely things changed we used to have a program where people came into the office once or twice a week to attend groups and have lunch and that's something that went by the wayside in terms of people coming that clinic and sitting and waiting. They now hav e to utilize the back door because we didn't really want to have individuals you know in close proximity in the waiting room. Just not feeling like they had a home in some respects. \" - Eden System -level Changes due to the Pandemic The two biggest changes t hat occurred to the system was that clinicians could not work from home and community -based programs were hard to access. \"Everything was over Zoom even like the morning team meetings. Getting people to primary care was you know 20 times harder. If they were doing primary care over the phones. It's like, \"Who's phone?\" Are they calling the clients phone or they calling my phone? \" - Telecare Telehealth Implementation Due to the initial shelter in place Service Teams and other specialty mental health provi ders in Alameda County implemented telehealth procedures for psychiatry and case management . Most provided telehealth during the initial shelter in place and then Oakland and BACS, quickly transitioned back to primarily field -based case management work . Although, all programs are now seeing clients in person either out in the field or in their office. \"I think during the first couple weeks we were so confused we started with making phone calls, but we quickly realized that does not work for our clients that just doesn't work we have to go out and see them. We have to make sure that they can pick up their medication all of those things. So, we were 100% field -based the whole time even last summer through the fires at the same time, the civil unrest. I am real ly proud of what we did last year.\" - BACS Asian Health Services had started tele -psychiatry appointments prior to the pandemic and Tri-City, Valley, and Eden ha ve emergency medication clinics so they also ha d the equipment for telepsychiatry prior to the start of the pandemic. APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 \"We actually started our psychiatry clinic on a pilot, and we worked with Henning and the adult service team to start that. That actually started in November of 2019 so the fall/winter 2019 so we were starting to pilot it. And then of course the pandemic hit you know sometime in March, and we were just able to convert not just psychiatry team pretty much our entire staff to telehealth. And that really helped us to continue providing care to our clients and also maintain or increase o ur visit rates through telehealth.\" - Asian Health Telehealth Definition Programs implement ed telehealth differently and tele -psychiatry was different than tele -case management. Below are the different ways that telehealth was implemented. Program Name Tele -psychiatry Tele -case management Asian Health Services Come into office for services via Zoom . Depending on severity. Zoom or telephone. Tri-City Phone calls or virtual meetings, which could happen in office. Phone calls or virtual meetings but would meet clients outside or in office when they preferred . Valley Phone calls or virtual meetings, which could happen in office. Phone calls or virtual meetings but would meet clients outside or in office when they preferred . La Clinica Combination of phone and video services. Criteria of who needs in -person appointments is usually those on long - acting injectables. Combination of phone and video services. Oakland Facilitated via Case Managers in field with laptops or they can come into the office . None, still field based . West Oakland Telephone Telephone with some preferr ing to come into office. Bonita None. Stayed in field and did injections. Telephone Eden Virtual and arrangements with some case managers , but no uniform process . Telephone BACS Used client phones or case managers facilitate through laptops on car dashboards. Telephone for a few weeks but then they went back out in the field. Felton Some telehealth happening, but based off clinical triage of whether a service is necessary and safe to be in person. Some telehealth happening, but based off clinical triage of whether a service is necessary and safe to be in person. La Familia Phone calls either with client phones or facilitated with case manage r. Phone calls, but also quickly back in the field. Telecare Mostly on intake and combination of phone and video. Then see them in person. Phone versus in person was b ased on Alameda County's COVID -19 numbers. Client Responses to Telehealth Overall clients struggled with the tele -case management but did better with tele -psychiatry because that was often facilitated by the case managers either in cars using laptops/smartphones or by clients coming into the office. Often the struggle was that c lients did not have the resources to use virtual platforms. APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG \"I would say it wasn't happening a ton and I think that is sort of clientele, do they have a phone? Do they have a smartphone? Most of them probably don't. Some of them have computers, but I woul d say for the most part most of them do not. Are they somewhere with their phone with Wi- Fi access? Is the other piece. So, I would say that the telehealth was a big barrier with our clients at least. I think we can catch them on the phone, but maybe not necessarily telehealth.\" - Telecare Phone calls are hard for clients, too, because they can be hard to get ahold of due to not having phones, their phones get shut off, or if they are paranoid about people listening to their conversations. \"Some of our clients are actively symptomatic so if you have a delusion that people are listening in on your conversation then you probably don't want to be on the telephone. Some of them just aren't talkative and things of that nature so it just very hard to be on the ph one having a conversation with great fluidity.\" - Eden Two of the programs, La Clinica and BACS, mentioned usi ng staff time to do technical skill building with clients . \"We enlisted our peers and our MHRS to help us help contact our participants and we enl isted their help and helping build technological skills to walk someone through how to download an app or walk them through how to log on to Wi -Fi or whatever those resources were. We really had to divert a lot of staffing to help people build the capacity to engage in services.\" - La Clinica Telepsychiatry went better because it was often facilitated by staff in the field or when a client came into the office to use the rooms that were set up for tele -psychiatry. \"We have either iPhones or our laptops and so we can do that in the field ...[or] they prefer to come in . So, when they come in we have laptops set up in the doc offices so they can do their Telehealth and we have everything set for the m the case manager can still supervise but be at least 12 feet aw ay just to make sure that the case manager can supervise but is still socially distant.\" - Oakland Staff Responses to Telehealth The Program Managers think the p sychiatrists like the telehealth model overall and it does make it easier to keep clients on medicine, but most of the Program Managers think at least occasional in - person visits would be useful: \"I don't know how I feel about that because I do feel like it's important for the psychiatrist to at least lay eyes on them every now and again. What you see face -to-face it's different than what you hear over the phone. So, I have to think more about that and probably talk to them about where they are with that, but I do want to move back to at least once every 6 months you have a face- to-face visit with somebody depending on how frequently you're meeting with them. That you see them at least once a year or once every 6 months.\" - West Oakland \"I think there should be that as a choice for clients because they were never given a choice with the psychiatrist . They had to be seen face -to-face or they wouldn't get a refill so that was very difficult so that's been easier and the clients like that. \" - Tri-City and Valley APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 Areas for Change or Improvement Program Activities to Streamline or Change Due to move to M HSA-funding program activities were asked about streamlining or changing, staffing adjustments they would make, what pandemic -related changes they would like to keep, and what success looks like for these clients. Clinical Documentation All of the Program Managers mentioned the burden of documentation and had varying ideas for how to decrease the burden. Including decreasing how often assessments need to be done: \"But I think just how frequently we have to do our annuals. We do them annually. I know other counties are moving towards a two -year review instead of a one -year review. I think that is something that could be helpful.\" - Asian Health Services Having the paperwork requirements be less stringent and more like high -level requirements: \"I would attempt to reduce the quality assurance regulations and have them be more on parity with other federal or state requirements so they're not too exhaustive.\" - La Clinica A couple of the program managers suggests that technology should be leveraged to help decreas e the burden and duplication of information : \"In general, I think if there was some way, we could figure out how to streamline the paperwork I think having a medical record that pulled information from different areas so that you're not reinventing the whe el every time you open a new document.\" - Tri-City and Valley \"I don't know if this is across the board what Almeda County does, but it sounds like there's three separate things you have to do and you have to fill out the clinical assessment form, you have to log into a separate thing and fill out the ANSA, and then you have to do another form which is a screening questionnaire through Alameda County Behavioral Healthcare where it's like \"Do they meet the medical necessity?\" So, if I'm understanding it corr ectly there's actually three forms you have to do which within the San Francisco programs we have it all embedded in one form.\" - Felton Telehealth Due to the pandemic programs were able to try telepsychiatry and tele -case management, most of the Program Manager s express ed that they would like to keep s ome version of telehealth . However, for some agencies, like BACS they were explicit that they only wanted to keep it for psychiatry, while others like Felton are using remote telehealth technology to help wi th the workload of the ir licensed clinical case managers. \"One thing we're doing right now we just brought over a couple of tablets to support because we are understaffed, we're using the tablets with the peer counselors to connect back to the clinical st aff that are at the office writing the assessments and treatment plans to kind of be more efficient with the time and to be able to connect with the clients directly.\" - Felton \"I think like depending on what's going on with an intake client I think maybe the psychiatrist doing them virtually might be easier. And they can get it done quicker. So then again because historically the intakes would just come into our office, which they are more than welcome to do at this point. And I'm always the person who fee ls like in person is better. But I also recognize that if they were at Jay Mahler or something that going to get them to bring them all APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG the way to the office is very disruptive to their day as well. So, in certain situations, I feel like that could be some thing that could continue for the better. \" - Telecare However, case managers going back into the field and the psychiatrist at least occasionally seeing the clients in person was important. \"But I do think at a certain point it's going to be like, \"Everyt hing's open so take your mask if you don't feel comfortable. You can ask your client to take a mask.\" ...We've been doing vaccinations here and I know they're quite a few of our clients have gotten vaccinated here so that helps. \" - West Oakland Remote Work Keeping r emote work for case managers to be able to do administrative or paperwork was something that a few agencies want to keep and found useful during the pandemic ( Tri-City, Valley , and Bonita House ). \"I think as a team we'll keep the sort of I think w e'll move into more of a hybrid model where as much of the work with clients as possible that can be done see face -to-face will be done face to face. But I think that there will be a lot less utilization of the office. Particularly for administrative tasks , things like documentation and that sort of thing will be something that folks will have the ability to do at home if they would like.\" - Bonita House While programs are fine with some remote administrative work not every program wants to keep 100% remote work (West Oakland and Eden) because some clients want to come into the office. \"So, now that things have calmed down I said, \"Everybody needs to be in at least 3 days a week\" and people can do whatever configuration they want but you should be here more in the office. Because what happens is some of our clients do come and they might not come on the day that their provider is here because they just pop up. and it's been fine because the other providers that are here will work with them and help them get w hatever it is they need but I think it's better when they're able to meet with their actual provider.\" - West Oakland Additionally, r emote admin istration meetings between ACBH and the teams was seen as useful and time saving . \"I do think that for some of the meetings with like not with just our team but with Administration as a whole I used to go down to the Cove but now they've all been move to go to meetings or Microsoft Teams and it's actually freed up or time that I can spe nd doing stuff here but I don't have to have all the commute time. \" - Oakland Separate Substitute Payee from Clinical Relationship How the Sub stitute P ayee program affects clinical relationships was also a concern for three of the program, Oakland, Telecar e, and West Oakland Health Council. \"I would totally disconnect the sub -payee from their Mental Health Services because it creates a lot of work that we don't get reimbursed for and then dealing with you know we have clients some of whom are quite paranoid and our providers have to deal with, \"You're taking my money. I know you are\" or you know if you have somebody who's homeless and trying to get them to keep their receipts for the check they just last requested. It takes up a lot more time than I think th e county understands.\" - West Oakland APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 Increasing use of Peer/Group Supports One of the impacts of COVID and even before COVID the use of peer or group support work was not as robust as program managers would like it to be. Specifically, being able to be co mpensated for group care was mentioned (La Clinica). \"I don't know if we could or couldn't change this but one of the things that we've done in San Francisco that I really appreciated is you know we've held groups and we developed a program specifically wh ich was just an older adult day Support Center. So, a little bit of a shifting of the model to group level work because I do often see the work that we do as individually based here in Alameda County so I do see one person doing one thing with one person. I think the benefit to doing it is that we get our clients as they feel comfortable around each other and to develop their own peer base as well.\" - Felton \"If I could fix anything I would make it that we could have in -person indoor groups again. \" - Oakla nd Staff ing Changes and Improvements Increase Staffing and Adjustments Increase staffing in various areas was mentioned the most often with increasing the number of master's - level staff being mentioned more often. Seven program managers representing 8 agen cies mentioned this. \"I would probably just bring on more case management staff. I would like to have the capacity for individuals to really live their passion and do the specialty work because many of them are skilled and or certified in different modalit ies but because we are primarily case managers the therapeutic modality that takes a back seat to everything else.\" - Eden The second most often mentioned expansion of staff was for peer staff, which was mentioned by 4 agencies. \"I would like to broaden the availability of sort of peer focused and peer -led services I think that the peer initiative has kind of been on pause for a few years. It would be nice to see those activated again and as well as the family partner role being expanded a little bit more .\" - La Clinica Having nursing staff as part of the team was mentioned by three agencies. \"That's really a pie in the sky Idea. ICM has never had a nurse. One of the things that I would say that is pretty true for all the clients we have is that they have major medical issues and many, many of them do not like the doctor's and it's been really tough this last year. ... A nurse can do a number of things they can give injectable anti -psychotics in the field for people that are not quite able to get to a clin ic, they can troubleshoot in the field, when a client has some sort of problem that they don't want to go to the ER or they don't want to go to their primary care doctor. ...Field -based nurses would be amazing.\" - BACS Finally, having a housing coordinator with money to help was the last type of staff member that wanted to be increased with two program mangers representing three agencies mentioned this. \"A lot of people want to live independently in an apartment with Section 8. But it takes a tremendous amo unt of paperwork and a tremendous amount of coordination to get somebody into subsidized housing. It would be nice if the county would commit to improving some of the APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Board and Care Homes. They have the HSP, the housing support program, but what ends up happening is that the people who are really problematic and really severe can't get into those programs because they're too sick and they can pick and choose because they're always full. So, they end up going into the crappier homes because they'll say yes. So, it's that whole dynamic I think that's a huge weakness because the housing situation really help stabilize people.\" - Tri-City and Valley Data Collection Areas of Improvements and Needs Even though there is a lot of data that ACBH collects and shares Pr ogram Managers still mentioned areas where they would like to see improvement . Improve Information on New Referrals Many (Eden, Bonita, Tri-City, Valley, and La Familia) program managers expressed concern over the depth and breadth of the information prov ided when they receive a new referral to their team. All referrals are process through ACBH's ACCESS line and one program manager stated that: \"We have situations where individuals have forensic background and pretty violent histories and if we're not taki ng the time to really dig deep into some of the files we're putting some of our case managers at risk... In the olden days probably from 2010 to 2015/2016 they were much better at giving us additional information but again their system was set up a little differently...I think that the ability for them to ACCESS and to give us the background information because I think sometimes they give to us and they don't appear to meet medical necessity but somebody has made an administrative decision, which we understand so then we have to spin our wheels trying to figure out why I received this referral and/or trying to assess to find out what criteria has actually been met for them to receive services.\" - Eden Comparison Dashboards While there was not consensus over what should be shared between the Service Teams, some of the Program Managers are curious about how the other Service Teams are doing . \"I think something new that the service teams have started to share amongst each other is utilization data. I think that's b een really useful to understand you know what is the overall need / burden on the system and how are each of the service team sort of holding that burden. I think that's been useful for helping us understand each other's work and barriers. I think that if there was a little bit more open us our visibility into the inpatient utilization I know acute care coordination helps to serve that but I think it's a little less quantitative then I would like.\" - La Clinica System Challenges In addition to the Service T eam specific program, staffing, and data needs that the Program Managers mentioned they also spoke about staffing and program challenges that are seen system -wide. Hiring and Staff Retention The system -wide problem of h iring and staff retention difficultie s has also affected the Service Teams. The Program Managers of Asian Health Services, Telecare, Tri-City and Valley, La Clinica, Bonita House, BACS, and Felton mentioned hiring and retention difficulties of staff and psychiatrists . Additionally , Telecare, La Clinica, Bonita House, and Felton mentioned staff turnover as a challenge to the ir program during the pandemic. \"We've had a really hard time recruiting in general. I think part of it is that the salaries are on the lower end for the CBO s and are significantly below Kaiser. So , just recruiting anybody that has a APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 Master's and is willing to take the pay that is offered has been a challenge. It has not been easy to find MHRS that are non -master's or even adjunct we've had open positions. We've h ad at least one open position my entire tenure and there are not lots of applicants and most of the individuals we've interviewed we've hired. Whether they've chosen to come to us or not is a different story. We've had a really sort of tough go a number of folks on our staff have left the state in the middle of COVID and just decided that they're moving and that they're done with California. Sort of making big life decisions. So, recruiting has been really hard in general.\" - Bonita House \"I think a team -level weakness is that there's a lot of turnover in staffing of availability to address the needs of persistently mentally ill adults that are both linguistically and culturally responsive. I think there is a lack of consistent pipeline programs that help us do that staffing at least at the graduate training level and there is a real lack of extending the loan repayment to graduate -level mental health providers that exist to let primary care providers who are meeting shortage area gaps. Those are real weaknes ses that contribute our staffing shortages.\" - La Clinica Need for More Clients La Familia and West Oakland Health Council reported not having enough clients for their team. This is a system challenge because referrals come through ACCESS for specialty men tal health clients. \"I would say one of the weaknesses is, not so much the arrangement, but it's hard to give the clinicians a full caseload at times because there's not enough clients. That's all I can really think of.\" - La Familia \"Truthfully right now we don't have enough clients right now to expand. We're contracted for six positions for the Adult Services but because we are not billing enough and we didn't have enough clients we put one of those roles on hold.\" - West Oakland Health Council Resources Agencies Want and Need Housing In addition to staff to navigate housing for clients as part of the teams, many Service Teams mentioned the general need for more housing and the ability to access emergency housing. \"The unfortunate part is because we're in the Bay Area and there's the housing crisis it takes a long time and they are understandably ranked [to access housing]. But people staying in these with , lack of a better word , kind of gross unlicensed board and cares for $850 a month. Where they get h ot dogs or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches during the day. It's like nobody wants to do that, understandably and they're choosing most the time between that and homelessness. \" - Telecare Transportation Transportation for medical appointments that are an alternative to paratransit and case managers picking clients up was also mentioned. Telecare, La Familia, Tri-City, Valley, La Clinica, and Felton , which said they need a new agency vehicle, all spoke about transportation needs. \"Sometimes you need a clinical person in there to get the person to even go you know , cuz you're like supporting them or helping them in their anxiety or making sure that information is conveyed to the provider once they get to an appointment . But sometimes you just nee d a little bit of that and it's mostly driving so it'd be nice if we had some more options for a supportive transportation situation. The county has tried different things over the years but you know it is a little expensive to be paying a master's -level p erson to be driving. \" Valley APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Day Programs or Groups Many programs wanted access to structured day programs or other groups, La Familia, Tri-City, Valley, La Clinica, Oakland, West Oakland , spoke about wanting this resource. While there are the Wellness Centers, a lot of the programs said that their staff or their clients did not think they provided sufficient services. \"I would like to see , like I said earlier , day programs is something that we're starving for in the model of the Villa Fair mont Day program that they have it is just such a good model. I'd love to see that for our Medi -Cal clients or something similar ...So, they have groups specifically for clients with psychotic symptoms and that's really nice. They have really nice group activities like art and music. Things better pretty enriching for someone's life and makes them feel like they're doing something a lot of our clients I wish I could offer them that but if they don't have Medicare they can't use that program. \" - La Familia \"Yes, because a lot of times our clients don't do well in general population groups. And part of the way that the county is trying to deal with that was with the wellness centers. But for whatever reason our clients haven't they haven't been as popular as we had hope. Let's put it that way and then the pandemic just wiped them out. \" - Tri-City and Valley More in -language services Along the lines of needing day programs other services teams that provide in -language services often have a need to be able to r efer patients to other levels of care and can feel constrained doing so because of the limited in -language services. \"I know sometimes there are wellness centers in areas where folks can go in the county for support. If there are areas that can provide t hat that are in language for our clients, we would prefer them to go there to get support and to engage with others during the daytime. I think that is something that could be helpful. Definitely more funding and resources for language services. We do use the county -provided interpretation line, which is helpful but of course there are other times when an in - person interpreter is also useful and helpful. S o, just having something available for that for our population. I mentioned earlier too just more in la nguage support in the higher level of care. It can be more supportive environment for the clients. That would be useful, too. \" - Asian Health Funding for Incentives Some ( La Familia, West Oakland, BACS ) of the Services teams would like money for gift car ds, bus tickets or other flex funds to help their clients. \"For some of our clients transportation is an issue so if we could give them bus tickets that would be great. Some of our clients are homeless and may not be on SSI so don't really have any money so like a gift card to a grocery store so that they get some basic needs met that would be great. I think those two tied together would help. \"- West Oakland Health Council Dementia Care The only Service Team that serves only older adults, Felton , mentioned a unique need for that ag e groups, which was dementia care. \"Right like you can't therapy somebody out of dementia. You're not going to antipsychotic medications I'm out of dementia. We really need significant, significant services across the board, across the country we don't have adequate services for those needs. And they really require a different kind of wrap -around team like a different kind of frequency of visiting. Once APPENDIX C-2 MHSA PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX PROFILE SHEET: MHSA CSS SERVICE TEAM REPORT FY20/21 a week doesn't cut it for someone who's really symptomatic and not in supportive enough housing that really becomes their needs really become 24/7. \" - Felton Program Recommendations While there are many system -wide challenges that emerged from the Program Managers, these recommendations focus on the Service Teams. 1. Define Client Success: Since there is not a single definition of success , then the Service Teams and ACBH are often focused on symptom reduction and not whether \"anyone is better off\". This leads to clients that may not need the Service Teams to continue to rece ive intense services without being graduated to a lower -level of care. One possible foundational theory for success is the Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT): \"The theory also proposes that all humans have three basic psychological needs, or experient ial requirements, whose procurement supports intrinsic motivation, growth and health just as the procurement of basic physical requirements supports the growth and health of plants. The three needs are: autonomy (needing to be self -regulating; to own one's actions and to identify one's self with one's behavior); competence (needing to be effective; to be moving towards greater mastery and skill); and relatedness (needing to feel psychological connection with important others; to support, and be supported by, those others) .\"2 [emphasis added] This theory is one of six mini -theories within the framework of Self -Determination Theory. The concepts of autonomy, competence, and relatedness map to wha t the Service Team Program Managers described when asked \"what su ccess looks like for their clients.\" Additionally, \"contexts that support versus thwart these needs should invariantly impact wellness. The theory argues that all three needs are essential and that if any is thwarted there will be distinct functional costs. \"3 2. Measure Client Success: Once success is defined then exploring measure that are already collected or need to be collected. This could include the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Project (MHSIP), which Service Teams are already asked to colle ct from their clients. 3. Explore alternative staffing models and the use of Telehealth: In order to transform the Service Teams as required by their move to MHSA funding, then implementing the innovative staffing pattern . For instance, Oakland Community Support, utilizes an Engagement Team to provide intensive outreach to engage new clients , this critical service is not always billable under Medi -Cal. Additionally, t his 2 From: Sheldon, Kennon M. TEAM REPORT MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG model allows the rest of the team members to then focus on the day -to-day needs and treatment of securely engaged clients . Another model to consider is the team approach employed by the assertive community treatment (ACT) teams. With this model, the client works with the whole team. This empirically proven model assures the whole team is awar e of each client 's treatment needs and that clients have real time access to care even if their lead clinician is out of the office or busy providing services to another beneficiary. Implementing an ACT model would institutionalize the collaborative approach that many Program Managers already see as a strength of their Service Teams. The use of Telehealth could also be useful and more convenient for more stable clients . It could reduce transportation barriers to treatment and help leverage clinician capacity by decreas ing client transportation time. Clinicians can see beneficiaries in their home via Telehealth or visit them in the home and support a Telehealth psychiatric visit. This could increase the client's overall suppor t and contact rate with their clinical team. 4. Expand Internships Programs to all Service Teams: The need for more clinical staff is needed across the whole ACBH system. One of the ways to reduce some of the current burden and to develop future clinicians t o expand the workforce is through internship programs. The interns could do similar work to what the BACS interns are doing, which is the initial intake and treatment planning.

It is designed to expand and transform California's mental health systems to better serve individuals with , and at risk of , serious mental health issues and their families. MHSA funds are divided among five components, one of which , Community Services and Supports (CSS) , uses funds for direct services to adults with severe mental illness (SMI) and children with severe emotional disturbance (SED) . CSS is divided between : 1. Full Service Partnerships (FSP) , which provide voluntary wrap around services to partners diagnosed with a n SED or SMI . 2. Outreach and Engagement/System Development Programs (OESD) , which cover multiple treatment modalities and services to those with SED or SMI. The Promoting Access to Health (PATH) programs, which provides and coordinates integrated health care to adults with SMI , and has a wellness program to provide group health education and encourage socialization , are funded through OESD. They were created to increase the life expectancy of those diagnosed with SMI who were on average dying 24 years earlier tha n the general po pulation , primarily due to chronic diseases. The f irst PATH clinic opened at the Oakland Eastmont Adult Community Support Center in east Oakland through a partnership with a local Federally Qualified Health Center. The program has since expanded to include Tri-City Adult Community Support Center in Fremont in 2012 and Eden Adult Community Support Center , the newest clinic , that opened in 2020 in San Leandro. The following data sources, all from Fiscal Year 2020 -2021, were used in this r eport: 1. Annual report including client demographic information that PATH teams submitted . 2. Results of consultant conducted interviews with staff at the PATHs for a needs assessment . 3. Quotes from i nterviews conducted with one client from each of the PATH clinics. 4. Results of a survey the PATH Teams administered that asked about the client's experience and self-reported health , person -centeredness of the services received , and how the practitioner did at population health management . Oakland Eastmont surveyed 25 clients for an 8% response rate, Tri -City surveyed 16 clients for a 3% response rate, and Eden surveyed 29 clients for a 17% response rate. Combining these data sources increase s the robustness of this report and informed th e recommendations provided . 766 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG How Much Did We Do ? 348 partners served at Oakland Eastmont Adult Community Support Center 511 partners served at Tri - City Adult Community Support Center 29 partners served at Eden Adult Community Support Center Clients received s ervices in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Farsi, Khmer, and Korean . Most of the PATH clients speak English. Clients were provided with regular and timely health assessment screenings includi ng BMI, Blood Pressure, Hb/A1c, and Lipid Profile. When speaking with clients from each of the clinics they reported receiving help with not only their physical care, but also information on wellness like cooking classes and socialization activities. \"Oh yeah, I came in with a broken heel and that they helped me take care of. Then I had a broken toe, they helped me take care of that. I'm obese so they sent me to an endocrinologist. I have a hernia so they sent me to a hernia doctor. Let me think, what els e? They've done everything. \" - Tri-City Client \"They may have a class on why you shouldn't smoke or a class on how to cook a certain dish. I don't mind sitting in on those things.

Staff Program Description from Needs Assessment Oakland Eastmont Tri-City Eden PATH improves access to care for SMI clients by offering co -located services and a warm hand off to Primary Care physicians - this makes it easier for clients to overcome barriers to walking into a strange doctor's office. PATH handles extremely complex cases which can be difficult to diagnose, and require extra time and attention and interpretation. For example, physical symptoms may be masked by medication, delusion, paranoia, and /or an inability to articulate what is wro ng.

Transition to Telehealth Summary o f Telehealth and the Effects of COVID -19 on Client Care from Staff Needs Assessment Technology/Telehealth Comments Oakland Eastmont Tri-City Eden Due to COVID -19 pandemic protocols, most primary care, case management , and psychiatry visits took place via teleconference or telephone. While many primary care visits do require in person visits and exams, some providers said that the use of telehealth had many benefits, and they would like to see this expanded, and integra ted into PATH services. a Providers said that not all clients had the proper equipment (smart phone or laptop) to participate in teleconferencing. Providers expressed a need for additional training in technology for those who did have access to a smart phone or laptop. Clients may be referred to mental health therapists for additional help and it was noted that telehealth may be easier for them than an in-office visit. Staff expanded upon the benefits of phone visits for cli ents saying that transportation was a barrier to coming into the office: \"He noted that patients are comfortable with the phone and communication by phone and this can also save them money; otherwise they have to travel an hour or more by bus just for a \u00bd hour appt. Phone can save lots of time, so they are used to it and like that means of communication as well.\" - PATH Needs Assessment \"Transportation is a challenge all around, and funding was cut for Alameda County and Para Transit was cut; not everyone is ca pable of taking bus or BART so transportation alternatives are needed.\" - PATH Needs Assessment The clients that were interviewed also spoke about the phone visits . One express ed concern over being able to get in touch with their providers, especially during the first lockdown and before vaccines were widely available: \"There was a while where they weren't keeping in touch, understandably. Because they did close down, they did call me and inform me about them not seeing clients in the office anymore and if there was any issues that were an emergency then I could come in or go to the emergency at the hospital. It was what was to be expected , I mean everyone was crazy. When they got themselves pulled together then they started you know calling and making s ure that we were ok. That I was ok.

You've been in the house for what 16, 19 months? You kind of get, I don't know some people, some people may not want to go back outside so I think those s ervices would still be valuable for folks like that.\" - Eastmont Cl ient Socialization Activities There were o ther services that the pandemic affected , including no longer provid ing socialization activities . Both staff and a client spoke about this: \"The COVID -19 pandemic caused not only a loss of co -location, which led to difficulties in communication and coordination between providers, it led to clients living in isolation and having a lack of things to do/activities. They reported seeing an increase in client symptoms, and a need to re -instate services that had been provided by PATH (including providing clients with physical and educational activities, and socialization). There was a perceived increase in depression and anxiety.\" - PATH Needs Assessment \"I like to hang around the people they nice, cool people. They just good people to be around and we all have a common interest and a common goal. Like we all need help. We all sick. But we trying to get better. So that, I like that setting. It's not all about me. \" - Eden Client speaking about how the PATH used to have activities for clients \"I think through the PATH system that they should have some sort of program that is able to get people out of their homes and interacting with each other in a group setting with something that is interesting or that they would go to. Because I know people here that may not get out of their house for two or three weeks because they have nowhere to go. No friends, can't vocalize what they need, really don't know what they need but there needs to be some type of more in-depth program to get people to A) get something that they're interested in. .. Actually, the PATH when it first opened they had like you know we could walk around the lake with them and it was a smal l group also. But that's kind of shut itself down because there is no one to do it. But I think programs like that would help because my heart bleeds for some of the people that don't have friends or family coming .\" - Tri-City Client Clinic Hours, Services , and Transportation Prior to the Pandemic, the clients interviewed felt that the PATH services provided we re useful : \"So, the health part I thought was a really brilliant idea because at one point I was running around pretty much trying to find doctors and they were referring me to the places I need to go and it was really difficult getting around.\" - Tri-City Client APPENDIX D-1 MHSA CSS: PRIMARY CARE INTEGRATION EVALUATION MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Howeve r, even prior to the pandemic, the limited hours that the clinics functions can make it harder to get in touch with the PATH staff: \"The return calls are hard to get from the clinic because it's only open Tuesday and Thursday, and that is a little more di fficult to deal with because it takes two weeks for them to get back to you. So, you call them and ask them a question, the second call is usually just setting up the third call, then the third call, especially now since the Coronavirus, is over the phone and before it was just coming into the office.\" - Tri-City Client During the needs assessment, staff also mentioned the need for transportation help , expanding the hours of the clinic, and the types of services provided: \"Some specific requests for improving services included: a request to bring the podiatrist on site more frequently, to add dental care, for the staff to help clients get vaccinated against COVID -19 (to break through the resistance to the vaccine because of conspiracy theories that it was dangerous); to purchase a van for transportation; and to schedule the medical team to spend more time with their patients.\" - PATH Needs Assessment \"But care would be better if it was daily instead of 1 \u00bd days per week, Mon and Wed his clients don't have the luxury of seeing primary care providers those days. Clients are on a tight budget so they pay $4 round trip on public transportation, and transport ation is very slow. A clinic van would be very beneficial.\" - PATH Needs Assessment When asked if there were ways that they want the program to expand beyond what is already offered , the clients were concerned about the space in the clinic or did not thin k that services needed to be expanded: \"I guess they could, but I don't think the space would permit it. Like I said it's made for maybe two or three people to be in there at once. Anything else, I couldn't imagine them not having to send people out.\" - Tri-City Client \"They don't need any improvement at all. I don't see anywhere where they need improvement.\" - Oakland Eastmont Client Clients Prefer PATH Services Importantly , clients preferred the care they received at the PATH clinics to care they received at other clinics: \"It wasn't a rush job. A lot of times you would wait in another doctor's office and you wouldn't get in for an hour and they'd spend five minutes with you and then you'd be out. They were more into this prescribing than actually listening to what you had.

Improve Data Quality - Currently, ACBH does not collect results on the results of the BMI, Blood Pressure, Hb/A1c, and Lipid Profile screenings, which makes it unclear whether the PATH clinics are improving client's health . The ACBH program st aff that work with the PATH clinics should explore whether these results can be shared. Even if it is at the population -level report, which would indicate if the PATH clinics are improving the health of their clients. 2. Explore Program Expansion - Further a ssess whether expanding clinic hours, adding sites, and/or adding more transportation options would improve access for ACBH clients who are not currently being served, or who are under -served. While, t he clients interviewed for this evaluation did not ment ion transportation as a barrier that can be a barrier for other clients in the system. a. One way to improve access m ight be through phone calls if clients are comfortable and this may decrease the transportation barrier. However, this would not replace an in person visit. 3.

Tribble, PsyD, LCSW Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services A Department of Alameda County Health Care Services Agency Fiscal Year 20-21 Annual Report: Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program: An Alameda County Behavioral Health & Cal State University East Bay Collaboration Submitted By: Laphansa Gibbs, Division Director ACBH Child & Young Adult System of Care 12.29.2021 Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program Program Description: Mental Health Services Act - Workforce Education and Training ( MHSA WET) provides funding that allows for the completion of a two -year Infant & Early Childhood Mental Health Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program at Cal State University, East Bay (CSUEB). The overarching goal of this program is to build capacity in the early childhood workforce by increasing the number of qualified practitioners who understand and can address the culturally diverse and specialty early childhood mental health needs of young children and their families in Alameda County . The reporting for the pilot follows. Program Background and Updates In FY18/191, California State University East Bay (CSUEB) and Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) launched the pilot Early Childhood Mental Health Post Graduate Continuing Educat ion Certificate Program ( program ), which focused on the developmental foundations of infant and early childhood mental health. The program's content examined the developmental foundations of relationship -based clinical work between infants, young children, families, and caregivers, and combined theory and practice. The curriculum places a strong emphasis on working with families from diverse cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, which is especially important given Alameda County's socioeconomic, racial, cultural, ethnic, and immigrant diversity. The program began with a cohort of fifteen (15) students, fourteen (14) of whom were subsidized by Mental Health Services Act Workforce, Education & Training (MHSA WET) funds and one (1) paid out of pocket. Of the fifteen (15) students, eleven (11) were clinicians of color, ten (10) spoke one of the identified threshold languages, and all fifteen (15) worked in Alameda County early childhood 1 This report covers fiscal year (FY) 20/21 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021). From July 2020 -December 2020, the first cohort completed (December 2020) and the second cohort recruitment took place. This second cohort started in Spring semester (January 2021). This report also covers FY 21/22 updates covering July 1, 2021 through December 15, 2021. 788 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 2 community -based organizations (CBOs). In year two (FY 19/20), Cohort 1 saw the fifteen (15) members of the original cohort return intending to complete the second year of the program. However, one (1) student dropped in Fall 2019 and fourteen (14) of the fifteen (15) students completed the program in December 2020. FY 20/21 Outcomes, Impacts and Challenges Overview A collaborative effort allowed for the development of this partnership that aims to address an important need, an informed workforce who are culturally and linguistically informed about the challenges of the communities they will serve. For this pilot, ACB H, CSUEB, and evaluators worked to ensure programmatic coordination, recruitment, methodological design, data collection, and reporting. To address challenges identified in year one, ACBH allocated additional funding for curriculum development. Year two (2020) presented new challenges resulting from COVID -19. COVID -19 required the development of new teaching methods to address safety concerns. In response, class instruction was moved online (i.e., TEAMS) which ensured ongoing instruction. For administrative coordination, ACBH staff helped to strengthen the reporting systems used by creating a TEAMS administrative page to track requisite student information (i.e., attendance, class participation, grades). This tracking form was also used for grading. In year two, ACBH had a leadership transition from retiring Margie Padilla, Director of Early Childhood Program, who helped develop the program, to Dr. Clyde Lewis, EPSTD Coordinator. Dr. Lewis was selected to provide on -going program management. ACBH worke d with CSUEB to develop a plan for student recruitment. These efforts were successful in providing information about the program and the application pool increased considerably from the first cohort recruiting efforts. The second cohort had a competitive application process and will also have fifteen (15) students. The range of interest from CBO employees increased and as such, there is a wider range of organizations represented. Program Evaluation The program was evaluated by a tool developed by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland in the first year of the pilot . In the second year of the cohort, t he corresponding evaluation survey was administered by CSUEB Faculty Member and Instructor, Valerie Bellas. The evaluation focused on methodological a pproaches used for student training. To this end, the evaluation provid es ongoing feedback for managers to ensure continuous quality improvement. Evaluation methods used to assess the program include : a training evaluation (online student satisfaction s urvey); the Learning Curve Survey (to assess student measurement of knowledge, skills, and integration/application of core concepts), video observation, and reflective writing assessments. APPENDIX D-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT789 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX D-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 3 Student Evaluation Metrics From FY 20/21 evaluation data, s tudent evaluations show overall agreement that the stated learning objectives were met and that instructors were responsive, promoted the ethical and clinically sound treatment of clients. Students felt the content was both current and accurate and that th ey understood the value of the program. Students agreed that they \"...learned something useful from this program that I can put into practice in my work\". Further, most students showed high ratings of the instructors demonstrated knowledge/qualifications and clarity of content presentation. While responses showed an overall agreement that objectives were met, there was a range of responses in several areas including entering student educational experience, instructional delivery method, technology use, prog ram administration, and the physical environment. There was also a range of responses about whether course content was \"consistent with the stated objective\" and \"appropriate for the intended audience,\" indicating that a few participants were dissatisfied in these areas. A review of these areas will help address areas for improvement for future cohorts. ACBH and CSUEB management will work on addressing these issues for the upcoming cohort. Student Feedback Student feedback from the second -year evaluation was collected at the end of Fall 2020. Several students commented on the value of increased understanding of developmental concepts such as child bids for connection and exploration as part of attachment behavior; strengthened observational skills, assess ment tools, and case formulation skills, the value of reflective supervision/consultation, and application of relational models to early childhood mental health. One participant noted, \"I have always known that the relationship between caregiver and child is important, but I think I have a deeper understanding of what that means now.\" Another student commented that as a result of the program \"I will be more thoughtful of cultural impacts on children's and families functioning and consider more ways to inte grate cultural factors in treatment planning and services so that they are as relevant and respectful to each family as possible\". These responses example both the want and need for programs that address not only field -specific knowledge but an awareness o f the needs specific to the people for which graduates will support. FY 21/22 Updates Most recently, in year three (FY 20/21 ), a new second cohort of 16 students was recruited (22 applicants and 16 accepted into the program) . The recruitment process started in Spring of 2020 and was ran by Dr. Clyde Lewis. In the spirit of collaboration, meetings were conducted with Damon Eaves, CYASOC Assistant Director, CYASOC Director Lisa Carlisle, and Valerie Bellas CSUEB Cohort Instr uctor to review the recruitment and selection criteria, the steps and resources needed and the timeline. A rubric was developed to assess students that meet criteria. The planning team also discussed lessons learned from the last cohort cycle to apply be st and improving practices for the new cohort. APPENDIX D-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT790 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 4 Cohort announcements focused on individuals who focus on early childhood skill development as well as exhibit cultural competencies that can meet the unique needs of the diverse Alameda County child and family populations. Announcements were distributed to the Alameda County network of service provider agencies, to networks of CSUEB staff, and to employees and interns at current clinic and outpatient service sites. Given COVID, a number of factors had to be addressed including recruitment, class instruction and evaluations. First, recruitment is typically done in person. In -person outreach has typically worked well. Online marketing of the program was challenging yet through emails, announcements at meetin gs and encouragement to find applicants through networks, a full cohort was recruited despite not having in -person access. Second, class instruction is typically offered in person. In -peron learning allows for the group to share, explore and mak e lasting bonds with other practitioners in the early childhood community. It also allows for more interactive and tactile learning experiences in a focused learning environment. However, all parties adapted to online methods of teaching and learning. To adapt, the instructor used different methods to encourage engagement. For example, there were regular small group activities through the online platform which allowed interactive problem -solving, sharing of new concepts, and overall connection amongst cohort par ticipants. To further support participation, administratively, leadership developed a tracking tool to track class attendance and engagement group activities. This allowed timely outreach to participants to help increase attendance and the learning exper ience, as well as decrease attrition. Finally, to adopt to COVID protocols, the course evaluation tool used to survey the students was moved from an email -based format to a survey tool (Survey Monkey), which allowed for more accuracy and a higher response rate. Instructor Feedback In December 2021, t he instructor, Valerie Bellas, was asked several questions to help us receive insight on how the second cohort is progressing. Those questions were : 1. What components of the first CSUEB Early Childhood Program worked well and any special highlights? Please include things you deemed important that were both planned and organic. 2. What components of the first CSUEB Early Childhood Program could be improved? 3. Any other comments or feedback you would like ad ded to the annual report? Her responsponses are shared below, but overall she expressed that several areas of the program have worked well including recruitment, collaboration, the pedagogy, and the transition to an online learning model. She states tha t \"students have acquired a foundation [in] IECMH [Infant Early Childhood Mental Health] theory and practice approach, including development in relationships, reflective practice, cultural humility, and trauma.\" She further states that she believes \" The county and university partnership is a model that can be disseminated and replicated as a model for IEMCH workforce development and training.\" Her complete response is below.

What components of the first CSUEB Early Childhood Program worked well and any special highlights? Recruitment: This was a success. Cohort 2 [was recruited in the Fall of 2020 and] is such an active, thoughtful, and diverse group! Students share the ir perspectives, listen to each other, and bring rich professional, personal, and cultural experiences to our learning. We were able to recruit a full class with variability and commonalities. Students identify as 2 AAPI, 2 Black, 8 Latinx, 3 White, with bi-cultural representation in the group as well, and vary in age and number of years in the field. We recruited a group of students who are primarily mental health direct service providers, which was a focus of our recruitment. Collaboration: We have buil t a strong collaboration with CSUEB and ACBHS with regular contact and communication. I have appreciated how we work together and have developed common language and partnered in roles. In addition, we have established longitudinal connections with local ag encies many of whom have supported their staff to engage in the IECMH program for this second cohort after hearing good things from their staff who participated in the first cohort. I am so pleased that we have built a reputation in the community as a high quality, engaging, and useful program. Pedagogy : This was a fantastic learning year! We engaged in a variety of learning activities, including lecture, large and small group discussion, written assignments, and readings. We achieved all of this as we tra nsitioned to telelearning model during the pandemic. Across this first year, students have acquired a foundation IECMH theory and practice approach, including development in relationships, reflective practice, cultural humility, and trauma and resilience. Development in relationships: We have covered core content, such as development prenatal to five and attachment. Students have built skills in observation and application of developmental principles to understanding young children's relationships, needs, a nd strengths in the context of their families, communities, and systems of care. Reflective Practice: Students engaged in personal self -reflection and shared with each other cultural and family experiences as they relate to IECMH work. We have explored h ow to approach the work with families through a lens of family -driven care. The group is creating relationships with each other to serve as collegial support to sustain a diverse workforce. Cultural Humility: We have centered health equity and social justi ce, including the impact of racism, xenophobia, and the COVID -19 pandemic. We have actively identified inequities in models of service delivery and awareness of our social location and the intersectionalies of identities across relationships. We have benef itted from our guest speakers' contributions, including parents who have generously shared their experiences with systems of care. Trauma and Resilience : We have come together to understand the impact of trauma on young children and their primary relation ships from multiple angles. We have actively engaged in identifying protective factors in children, families, communities, and how our services and systems can uphold these core protective functions. We have highlighted the importance of self- care to mitig ate the impact vicarious trauma on the IECMH workforce. Q: Please include things you deemed important that were both planned and organic. APPENDIX D-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT792 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 6 What was important to me was to balance core content and its application to a dynamic and developing field, alongside personal and group process centering the perspectives and experiences of a diverse workforce to develop a reflective and inclusive approac h to IECMH service provision for children, families, and communities. What spontaneously has arisen is the rich diversity of perspectives and experiences of our workforce and the students' clear passion and commitment to learn about, engage in, and re - envision the IECMH field and to develop their practice with children, families, communities and the systems of care within which they work. Q. What components of the first CSUEB Early Childhood Program could be improved? Recruitment: The program could be nefit from a larger pool of applicants. Although the class was fully enrolled, there were few applicants above the enrollment cutoff. Increased applications will help to form a group that is both cohesive and diverse for our next cohort. Early considerat ion of recruitment approaches may be beneficial for our next cohort. Collaboration: We engaged in strong collaboration, but I believe our process would have benefited from representation by dedicated early childhood coordinator/director at the county. My understanding is that this position has remained unfilled after a staff retirement left a vacancy. In our first cohort, the former early childhood director had a central role in coordination and direction with a focus on early childhood mental health need s. Ongoing, this role could serve to increase collaborative and sustained relationships with community agencies who employ and supervise the IECMH workforce. Additionally, the first cohort had access to an outside evaluator. Re -engaging a collaboration wi th an outside evaluator would benefit the program, both to keep track of how the students continue to engage in service delivery and apply their learning across time, as well as to more systematically assess the effectiveness of the program, build its sust ainability, and support the dissemination of the model. Pedagogy: Despite its overall success, there are areas that could be improved. It is always a challenge to find the right balance of foundational content, reflective process, and applied learning. T his is an ongoing focus of curriculum development. The group is working toward continuing to find ways to address racism and other forms of systemic oppression and the dynamics power and privilege in our interactions and practice. This is an unfolding pr ocess across relationships and within our communities and will be a continued explicit focus of the program, utilizing identified tools, approaches, and centering lived- experience and perspectives of BIPOC and other targeted identities and communities. The amount and type of reading for the class did not always fit with the busy lives of students who are working full -time as they complete this program. I am working to tailor the readings to these needs, by identifying accessible, targeted, and useful readin gs and resources. The cumulative impact of the pandemic has increased challenges for students to participate and engage in the program. Supporting students as they navigate personal and professional challenges and provide services during the pandemic is of the utmost importance, including APPENDIX D-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT793 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG APPENDIX D-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 7 increased opportunities to connect with each other and access to available community resources. Q. Any other comments or feedback you would like added to the annual report? I believe that the IECMH program is state of the art. The county and university partnership is a model that can be disseminated and replicated as a model for IEMCH workforce development and training. The program is an invaluable resource in building a diverse IECMH specialty workforce in Alameda Cou nty and centralizing training in the crucial area of Early Relational Health. The program offers a foundation for IECMH work, as it centers service providers' perspectives and diversity of experience to increase workforce capacity and retention. These elem ents are key to building an informed, culturally responsive, ethical, and effective approach to service delivery for the children and families we serve. Student Feedback Student surveys were issued and collected at the end of the spring semester (late June and early July 2021) as well as at the end of the fall semester (in December 2021). Of 21 students completing post - semester surveys, data showed that ... There was a range of experienced practioners represented including LCSWs, ASWs, and LMFTs with active licenses. Key areas in which students strongly agreed or agreed with included feeling that this course...: o Trained me to be equipped with the skills necessary to demonstrate knowledge of the transactional nature of development and the centrality of relationships in early childhood using 1 -2 frameworks (e.g., development of attachment, secure -base/safe -haven behaviors, reflective practice.) o trained me to describe the role of environmental stressors, including trauma, in a developmental context using 1-2 related concepts (e.g., the role of early memory, ghosts and angels in the nursery, the impact of racism, xenophobia, and COVID -19 pandemic.) o trained me to identify the philosophy and key elements of family -driven care across content and processes using 1 -2 approaches to IECMH (e.g., centering fatherhood, cultural humility), and had an instructor(s) [who] demonstrated knowledge, promoted clinically sound and ethical treatment of client/customers, and was responsive to participants. o APPENDIX D-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT794 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 8 o Ongoing Evaluation The final evaluation by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland for the first cohort was issued in Spring 2021 (after the MHSA report was submitted) and has been used for ongoing programmatic improvement. ACBH management shared that Child & Young Adult community stakeholders shared that they felt that students benefitted greatly from the program and that this resource will continue to strengthen quality services o ffered by their providers. FY 2 2/23 Anticipated Changes: This program has been approved through the end of the second cohort in which participants will graduate in December 2022. The future direction of the program will be discussed in the coming months towards the goal of sustaining the program beyond this pilot. WET funds have supported these efforts as well as the complimentary evaluation services.

As a provider to primarily Black and Latinx perinatal populations, Blue Skies offers interventions and strategies to clients who would otherwise not access o r seek mental health services. The Blue Skies Program provides culturally responsive and immediate care to a critical and significant time in the lifes of pregnant people and families with young children. So many of our program participants suffer from dep ression, anxiety, trauma and violence that Blue Skies services are imperative. Thank you for the support and please continue to fund this program. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. ACBH values this partnership with the Public Health Department and has been pleased by the positive results this program has been able to achieve and the families that have been served. 4/6/22 3.

ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment s. For clarification \"explorating\" means a thorough analysis of a theme; an exploration of a subject, or an inquiry; as such, ACBH has conducted a thorough exploration of possible sites for the African American HUB .

This method is being tested to explore whether it is more e fficient in accessing a mobile crisis unit. CATT - pg 562 - Why the change from calls/served to contacts? ACBH/MHSA Response: For clarity, this is on page 563. Not every call ends with the CATT team serving a client. Sometimes the client is no longer a t cited location; was taken to hospital; or some other outcome occurred in which the CATT team was unable to assist serving anyone who may or may not have been in crisis. 4. Barbara Benzwi, MD I'm both a medical provider at a community clinic in Alameda county, as well as a family member of a loved one with serious mental health problems. As a provider, I'm concerned that there is a dire lack of sufficient numbers of therapists for our patients, even when they have finally decided that they want ongoing weekly therapy, and even when they finally have MCAL or other insurance. With the pandemic, most therapists' practices are full with many months' wait list. As a family member, I've learned the ha rd way of a serious gap in our mental health care system. There are very very few psychiatrists/Psych NP prescribers (on our HMO insurance, which has a huge panel of psychiatrists) who are willing to treat patients who are currently abusing or misusing sub stances, including cannabis. In trying to find care for my loved one, I heard time and time again that such prescribing providers would only take on a patient if the patient was seeking sobriety. Guess what? Probably nearly all substance misusers are tryin g to cope with unbearable feelings! They have anxiety, depression, suicidality, maybe bipolar or schizophrenia. It's unethical, in my view, for prescribers to refuse to take them on as patients, or if they do, to harangue them at every visit about getting sober, and eventually drop them from their practice if they dont; seek sobriety. Sure , sobriety would be the very best thing for my loved one, but THEY have to choose it!! What happened to meeting someone where they're at? Harm reduction? ACBH/MHSA Resp onse: Thank you for your public comment. ACBH has sponsored a Fellowship Training Affiliation agreement with the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine since 2015. The program allows one psychiatry fellow from UCSF Public Psychiatry Fellowship Program (PPF) to obtain clinical training and education in a public setting. Please read more about this in the WET section. 4/7/22 5. Marshall Williams The ACMHSA draft report was very informative on the countys awareness of the mental health issues for its citizens. In addition to human citizens, we should also look at the animals in pet familes and how the human animal bond is displayed. When attempting to attract underserved communiti es to mental health services, pets provide the direct path to get the attention of parents long enough to funnel additional county based services to families. Working with animals also creates pathways to message the parents about mental health by drawing correllations between the behavior they notice in their pets and their personal feelings and emotions. Combining the two will drive awareness on key themes that will produce action that stimuulates positive life outcomes.

ACBH is continuing to explore innovative therapeutic strategies for our Alameda County communities. 6 Daphina Melbourne Blue Sky's Mental Wellness is essential to the mental health of our Black Birthing community in Alameda County. Our community deals with so much trauma and loss, and this service is essential to maintaining their mental health. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. As mentioned above in comment #2, ACBH values this partnership with the Public Health Department and has been pleased by the positive results this program has been able to achieve and the families that have been served. 4/12/22 7. Tameko Jones Mental Health Programs such as Blue Skies are a critical component to serv ing community members residing in Alameda as it pertains to maternal mental health. The department does great work serving the Alameda County pre and post natal population. Through -out major cities in the US, including Alameda County, Latino and Asian peop le face high childbirth risk, but for Black women, there seems to be a relationship uniquely influenced by toxic stress regardless of education. Also, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Black women are substantially more likely to be employed at jo bs that provided inadequate health coverage, wages and maternal leave/ All these factors can lead to an increased pressure to return to work immediately after birth, which had negative outcome for both mother and baby. For these reasons alone, it is impera tive that programs such as Blue Skies stay intact. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment.

Nicole Sudduth I recommend ACBH use as much of the MHSA rollover fun ds as possible, to leverage federal funding and increase funding for CBOs providing behavioral health services. There is such a dearth of service providers available for hire and part of the reason is because we cannot pay them a livable wage for the Bay A rea. This work is rewarding, but also very challenging. Our clients are suffering because they cannot get services when they need them. I would like to prohibit my staff from burning out because they are trying to accommodate all the needs of our clients w ith limited resources and too many people on their caseloads. Please increase the funding to our contracts so we can hire enough people to provide the quality services our clients need. Thank you.

ACBH demonstrates its support for ongoing mental health education to communities through its focus on reducing seven primary negative outcomes which may result from untreated mental illness: suicide, school failure, unemployment, incarceration, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and the removal children from their homes. Efforts and strategies to educate about these outcomes include: outreach, and stigma reduction, and prevention. Please see the MHSA Plan for more information. 4/18/22 18.

Warren Cushman One unmet need that I would like to capture for the 3 year mhsa cycle is the unmet need of services to blind and visually impaired individuals with mental illness! As far as I am aware there hasn't been a specific program or service that covers this popula tion any where in the state of California! The blindness community is a diverse population that encompasses persons who are struggling with the reality of vision loss and finding struggles that can effect mental health! There are those who are developmenta lly delayed or suffer from autism that have specific kinds of needs! There are those who have been diagnosed with mental illness at some point in their lives! In short the blind community is like any other disadvantaged class of persons! We represent all t ypes of challenges including those of us who have mental illness! The unusual thing is that this year a bill in the legislature ab1999 attempts to address these concerns! I hope that an opportunity can be found in Alameda County to serve this particular population through the mhsa process! I would be interested in discussing any future pilot programs or projects that might come out of the ab1999 efforts or any other effort that Alameda County Behavioral Health department might be interested in investigatin g! As a member of the mental health advisory board I am pleased to have this opportunity and do support any ideas that can be generated through the mhsa process in the future that would attempt to meet this need! Thank you for listening and considering the se comments! Warren Cushman ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment.

Angela Dant I recommend ACBH use as much of the MHSA rollover funds as possible to leverage federal funding and increase funding for CBOs providing behavioral health services. Through our agency's work, I see first -hand the mental health crisis our most vulnerable county residents are in and the positive impact services like those Family Paths and other CBOs provide make in their lives. I'm also the parent of a 15 -year -old who suffers from anxiety and depression and has had some suicidal ideation, and knowing that the CBOs who can help children and families like mine are dealing with workforce crises and that services are getting harder to come by makes my heart sink. My child needs services, and I' m one of the lucky ones who has the means to get my child what he needs. Many others in my community are not as lucky and rely on CBOs like Family Paths who serve very low -income families to get the help they need. Please use the MHSA rollover funds wisely !

Carter Mehl Crisis Support Services of Alameda County (CSS) needs greatly expan ded funding in order to meet the growing needs of County residents. The well -known increase in community stress, mental health issues, and drug and alcohol misuse related to the pandemic -driven societal disruption, bad economic and health outcomes (includi ng excess deaths) has already increased the workload on crisis agencies such as CSS. The change to a 988 National Crisis Line is sure to dramatically increase the demand for services even further. As a 24 -hour crisis agency, CSS needs seriously increased f unding for more staffing on the crisis line, specially to cover nights and weekends when there are more high need callers. Additionally, funding for 24/7 text services and expanding the reach of the text line beyond youth -focused is needed, as well as increased funding for bilingual crisis line providers to ensure all communities have access to linguistically and culturally appropriate services. All County crisis services need enhancement, but if the initial call for help does not get handled effectively an d rapidly, whether due to service delays or technology or language barriers, the outcome is guaranteed to not go well. I urge you to increase the priority for CSS funding in the MHSA Annual Plan Update. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment.

Malcolm Stanislaus In support of the proposed African American Mental Health Center for the descendants of African American slaves... Africans throughout the diaspora today remain riddled with the emotion of Toxic Shame, as Dr. Frantz Fanon observed, due to the emotional impact of oppression, racism, slavery, colonia lism, and imperialism. I call the specific factor Oppression Depression (the critical, multi -layered component in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome). The importance of understanding how emotions play a critical role in the mass traumatic response of black peop le everywhere on the planet, which cannot be healed through intellect/thinking, cannot be over emphasized. There is a dire need for increased and improved mental/emotional health services. It is impossible to be fully, healthily functioning when African Am ericans continue to suffer from internalized toxic shame about who we are and from where we originate. As a brief glimpse, here is a short explanation of the nature of Shame as an emotion. I worked for the late John Bradshaw at his international codependen cy center at Ingleside hospital for close to 5 years. In support of that work, I studied the work of Gershen Kaufman, the works of Sylvan Tomkins' Affect Theory, as well as the clinical understandings of Dr. Fanon. John made a unique and quite insightful c ontribution to the field in making the distinction between healthy vs. toxic shame. He clarified that the emotion of shame is inherently uncomfortable, but provides a healthy function in giving us feedback that indicates that behaviorally we have made a mistake and, as such, the energetic experience allows us to correct our course. The healthy experience of shame is correctly connected to our doing. The experience of toxic, or unhealthy, shame is connected to our being, our existence. Toxic shame is the ex perience of being flawed, broken, defective, unlovable, or unworthy and makes us into an object, a thing to be devalued or ridiculed. Dr. Allan Shore (UCLA) correctly categorizes shame as the only truly social emotion. That is, it is engendered only in s ocial settings or interactions. John Bradshaw correctly states that toxic shame can only be truly healed in a group psychotherapy setting, supported by individual trauma recovery services because of this social origin. That means that dyadic therapy by i tself cannot uproot toxic shame. We need a number of other eyes and ears to compassionately witness our toxic shame to heal. 4/25/22 APPENDIX E PUBLIC COMMENTS821 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 27 of 75 APPENDIX E: PUBLIC COMMENTS MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE, FY22/23 MARIANA REAL, MPH, MCHES Even Mr. Bradshaw did not go deep enough regarding shame versus guilt. Guilt is NOT a feeling. It is a cognitive recognition of t ransgression. The FEELING that accompanies guilt is SHAME. Shame is at the root of attachment difficulties, characterological disorders, and our racialized self- hatred. If it is improperly handled, the clinical picture is unnecessarily made unclear and leads to a person's inability to find deep, long -lasting healing and a resumption of their developmental journey, as well as an inability to experience an increase in our self -esteem. There IS a protocol for healing and a mental health center specifically designed to address the issues is sorely needed. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your comment. ACBH values culturally congruent service delivery to ethnic and language populations. ACBH has increased funding for the African American Wellness Hub Compl ex Planning phase and the PEI portfolio, funds several programs which are directed specifically to serve members of the African American and African immigrant communities and their families.

Tom Abate I'm a person in recovery from mental i llness trying to help an adult relative admit that they suffer from a brain disease made worse by substance abuse. Admitting that is the first and toughest step toward treatment break the downward spiral. I watched the April 4th webinar to learn how Alamed a County planned to spend roughly $150 million in funds from the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA). In addition to this written comment, I ask to be informed of when this matter will come before the Board of Supervisors so that I might make some remarks in person. MHSA Senior Planner Mariana Real gave an excellent presentation. But I believe the report was over 700 pages and there was no way to comprehend it in an hour.

Real pointed me to the Family Education and Resource Center (FERC), whose Family Advocates help people in my situation. I've reached out to FERC a time or two but have not yet been contacted. I'm sure I will in time, and do not write for special attention. But the same day I called FERC, I emailed the local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). A couple of days later, volunteer Liz Rebensdorf got back to me with information about IHOT, or the In -Home Outreach Team, whose members call on people in the deni al stage of mental illness to try and convince them to enter treatment voluntarily. I've not yet figured out how to contact IHOT. Other priorities in my life have pushed this rescue mission aside for now. So, I do not mean to be accusatory when I echo the frustration that drove a group of parents to stage a Valentine's Day camp out at Frank Ogawa Plaza to say that the country isn't doing enough to help their adult children who've gone homeless due to mental illnesses. So, before the county allocates $150 mi llion of MHSA funding next year, let's see if we can't improve how we can assist the family and friends of people with mental illness and drug dependencies help their loved ones avoid homelessness, criminality, suicide, or other self -destructive behaviors. Almost everyone who gets into a downward spiral has loved ones who see the problem before the person with the diseased brain. Money spent to leverage their help to intervene as early as possible seems like public funding well spent. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment.

Over the course of the pandemic, our staff have been out in the community with our clients, helping build their resiliency in the face of extraordinary stressors. I have seen how our teams can help a family feel a sense of safety and stability when that had previously been in doubt.

Kendra F Dunlap Over the past two years, I have seen a great increase in the mental health needs of the community and have heard firsthand the difficulties and challenges in accessing services. I worked providing EPSDT mental health services for 12 years in Alameda County the strict criteria that was needed to access those services prohibited many from getting the help they needed. I have seen a significant incre ase in the number of individuals trying to access services but not only are they not able to qualify for services, but when they can, they are not able to find a therapist or are subsequently placed on long waitlists because of the therapist shortage. As a supervisor, many of my supervisees would be interested in working in community based mental health, however the high cost of living in the Bay Area and the challenges of Medi -Cal based care makes it prohibitive to work in these spaces. It is my hope that these issues can be addressed and make services more accessible and increase the number of providers. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your comment.

Cardum Harmon Penn I am a board member of a new nonprofit, R -Evolution, which focuses on facilitating community healing through global immersion experiences. With experienced leadership in the fields of mental health for youth, adul ts and families, AOD, restorative practices and education, we have created a new train -the-trainer program called the Global Resilience and Healing Fellowship. This program will provide training for providers, professionals, peer support specialists, and community health workers working in the areas of mental health and mental health related fields, including AOD and violence prevention. The purpose of this fellowship program is to help clinical and community providers, who support communities of color, to learn from international communities of color who have recovered from trauma and are demonstrating resilience through traditional, indigenous and innovative practices. Fellows will be led through hands -on, and experiential learning processes, demonstrating how others have healed themselves, their communities and countries through mental health programs, restorative justice, economic empowerment and peace building efforts. Fellows will develop toolkits on how to implement healing programming in their respect ive communities and organizations. Our global training sites will focus initially on Rwanda and South Africa. We strongly feel this immersion experience can be used as staff training for those working in mental health and expanded community healing, and th at Alameda County should fund this innovative and impactful mission. Our goal is to send two cohorts of 10 individuals each during the first year, and up to four cohorts in the years to follow. The Fellows included in this funding will be selected from a m inimum of 10 Alameda County CBOs, who serve at least 500 individuals 4/27/22 APPENDIX E PUBLIC COMMENTS835 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 41 of 75 APPENDIX E: PUBLIC COMMENTS MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE, FY22/23 MARIANA REAL, MPH, MCHES (youth, adults and family) annually. The impact of funding this fellowship program will not only benefit each organization's strengthening of their staff's knowledge of mental wellness an d restorative practices within their organizations, it will create a local and global mutually supportive cohort and collective of Alameda county providers who will increase their capacity to benefit a greater community of at least 5,000 individuals within in the initial launch year. The fellowship training is scheduled to begin the year funding is approved. The annual cost for the fellowship training program in the first year starts at $349,474. This will translate into benefitting our greater community of at least 5000 individuals at a mere cost of $69.89 per person per year. This budget includes all Fellow global and local trainings, stipends, and operational costs, including airfare, ground transportation, meals, room and board. Prior to and following travel, Fellows will convene bi -monthly to share and strengthen their knowledge in a co-learning environment, developing tools to understand and implement these healing practices within their respective communities. I strongly urge MHSA to fund this innovati ve, culturally responsive nonprofit's initiative, that takes a radical and necessary approach to healing trauma that will have a hugely positive impact in the mental health community by creating access to interventions that are culturally relevant to the u nderserved and misserved residents of Alameda County. Mental health workers and the communities they serve need this program.

Sarah Hellman There has been a high level of turnover the past couple of years due to clinicians being able to make more money through different platforms - telehealth and our agency not being able to compensate a fair wage to retain qualified clinicians. Our department provides long -term attachment based relationships for at risk youth in the foster system. The burden falls on the youth when clinicians leave the agency due to upward mobility elsewhere and needing to afford the high costs of living in the Bay Area.

Sharon Turner I am a board member of a new nonprofit, R -Evolution, which focuses on facilitating community healing through global immers ion experiences. With experienced leadership in the fields of mental health for youth, adults and families, AOD, restorative practices and education, we have created a new train -the-trainer program called the Global Resilience and Healing Fellowship. This program will provide training for providers, professionals, peer support specialists, and community health workers working in the areas of mental health and mental health related fields, including AOD and violence prevention. The purpose of this fellowship program is to help clinical and community providers, who support communities of color, to learn from international communities of color who have recovered from trauma and are demonstrating resilience through traditional, indigenous and innovative practice s. Fellows will be led through hands -on, and experiential learning processes, demonstrating how others have healed themselves, their communities and countries through mental health programs, restorative justice, economic empowerment and peace building effo rts. Fellows will develop toolkits on how to implement healing programming in their respective communities and organizations. Our global training sites will focus initially on Rwanda and South Africa. We strongly feel this immersion experience can be used as staff training for those working in mental health and expanded community healing, and that Alameda County should fund this innovative and impactful mission. Our goal is to send two cohorts of 10 individuals each cohort during the first year, and up to f our cohorts in the years to follow. The Fellows included in this funding will be selected from a minimum of 10 Alameda County CBOs, who serve at least 500 individuals (youth, adults and family) annually. The impact of funding this fellowship program will n ot only benefit each organization's strengthening of their staff's knowledge of mental wellness and restorative practices within their organizations, it will create a local and global mutually supportive cohort and collective of Alameda county providers wh o will increase their capacity to benefit a greater community of at least 5,000 individuals within in the initial launch year. The fellowship training is scheduled to begin the year funding is approved. The annual cost for the fellowship training program i n the first year starts at $349,474. This will translate into benefitting our greater community of at least 5000 individuals at a mere cost of $69.89 per person per year. This budget includes all Fellow global and local trainings, stipends, and operational costs, including airfare, ground transportation, meals, room and board. Prior to and following travel, Fellows will convene bi -monthly to share and strengthen their knowledge in a co-learning environment, developing tools to understand and implement these healing practices within their respective communities. I strongly urge MHSA to fund this innovative, culturally responsive nonprofit's initiative, that takes a radical and necessary approach to healing trauma that will have a hugely positive impact in the mental health community by creating access to interventions that are culturally relevant to the underserved and misserved residents of Alameda County. Mental health workers and the communities they serve need this program.

Denzel Herrera -Davis It is my opinion that the county can do more to support the wellness and thriving of the Black male populatio n. Overwhelming data shows that the vast majority of funding (e.g., services) that get allocated to Black males are in an involuntary manner through the justice system. Remaining support services then get distributed to people typically below the poverty l ine. The dichotomy leaves a huge service gap for Black males who: aren't yet unhoused, incarcerated, experience crisis recovery, or are marginally above the poverty line. What's more, the youth whose parents are so mentally strained at home because they ca n barely meet the rent. All Black men need help more now than ever. Those who typically have the resources are farther away from the wellness we all seek. The county should support creative and solution driven community support organizations like Create Th e Space that focus on the last mile customer - Black males \"in and around the service gap\". Partnering with culturally reflective organizations, like Black Men Speak, Create The Space has been able to use agility, innovation, technologies and a highly qual ified team to bring our community new perspectives on wellness and support.

Marc Anthony Robinson I believe some of this funding should be specifically allocated to the black male population. I have yet to see black men be targeted for funding. Yet when it comes to policing in Alameda County the numbers show black men are overly targeted. This one example affects the mental state of black men because we don't feel safe. However, we are still expected to support and carry our families and communities. We need some intentional funding to support and carry us as well. There are small instance where we get to feel safe and supported. CreateTheSpace(www.cr8thespace.com) is a program that has supported me specifically and I believe programs like these should be targeted. To whom may concern I am writing this letter through my lens as an educator and service provider. I have been supporting black families for 10 years plus. I have seen the constant struggle of black fathers. Through my experience and relationships, I have come to the conclusion that there are far mor e barriers for black men than there are support. I would love Alameda County to step up in focusing funding specifically for black men. When you support the well- being of black men, you are also supporting black families. Contrary to popular belief the bla ck man shapes the way our community looks and feels. I have been going to an event called 2me4U by Cre8TheSpace; this organization has supported black men in a way i have yet to see anywhere else. Please look into this organization and support them support us.

We offer employment and job training, supportive housing programs, permanent housing placement, counseling and case management, and legal services. Over 50 percent of veterans Swords ' serve are people of color. Our mission and vision align with the county by ensuring all veterans regardless of race, creed, culture, sexual orientation, or gender identity receive available services for meaningful help that leads to a path of self -suffic iency. Swords' Drop- In Center in Oakland is the main entry point for services which includes crisis intervention, assistance securing emergency and permanent housing, job assessment and placement, money management programs, and legal services for low -incom e, at -risk, and unhoused veterans. The Alameda MHSA plan includes laudable Community Services and Supports, and Prevention and Early Intervention directed to specific segments of the Alameda County population.

We write to express the need for focused funding and initiatives for veterans residing in Alameda County. With the exce ption of children, veterans are represented in all of the populations which the HMSA is intended to serve. However, specific outreach and services for veterans are missing from the overall plans. Veterans are a particularly vulnerable population, at risk f or mental health need, alcohol and drug concerns, and homelessness which can be mitigated or prevented through culturally congruent outreach and services. Outreach teams are vital in finding and triaging unhoused veterans for next steps in stabilization/ recovery. Veteran specific outreach teams can better establish trust through culturally congruent outreach to find and connect with at -risk veterans and properly refer them to relevant resources in the community, including assistance with accessing VA financial, health, and housing benefits. Community -based licensed clinicians are needed to provide veteran -focused, trauma -informed intensive case management for the most vulnerable veterans in Alameda County, regardless of eligibility for VA services. The N eed for Veteran Specific Outreach, Education, and Engagement in Alameda County: The Alameda County MHSA Annual Plan Update notes that the county is home to the second -highest number of veterans among Bay Area counties. In addition, the report cites homeles sness and concern regarding housing and homeless issues as a top recurring issue raised by stakeholders and through MHSA listening sessions. The draft also states that multiple populations were overrepresented in the homeless populations, veterans (9 perce nt versus 5 percent) compared to the overall Alameda County population and adults with serious mental illness (32% versus 5%) when compared to the United States population. As the following materials demonstrate, not only are veterans overrepresented among those unhoused, they are at high risk for mental health need. Further, BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and other underserviced cohorts within the veteran population are far more likely to suffer with mental health need, housing instability, and suicide. The Existence of VA and VSO Services Within Alameda County Are Not Sufficient to Reach Veterans: Not all veterans are eligible for VA services and care. They must qualify based on discharge status, era of service, and demonstrated service connection among other factors. Esta blishing eligibility is a lengthy and challenging bureaucratic process with no guarantee of success. BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and other underserved communities are more likely to be disqualified from eligibility based on Other than Honorable (OTH) discharge status. T hey are also significant cultural barriers for women, LBGTQ+ and BIPOC veterans who experienced race and gender - based discrimination and trauma during service and are hesitant to approach the VA. And finally, veterans should not be excluded from community services designed to meet their needs based on the existence or presumption that federal resources exist. Veteran Mental Health Need The following data points to increased risks and barriers to access for veterans in Alameda County and throughout the natio n. The data points to the need for the Alameda MHSA to direct funding and programs specifically to Alameda County veterans. California has the highest distribution (30 percent) of the national homeless veteran population. Oakland - Berkeley/Alameda Count y Continuum of Care (CoC) has the fourth highest number of homeless veterans, and second highest (78.8 percent) percentage of unsheltered homeless veterans. Mental health issues are the primary cause cited for homelessness among unsheltered veterans. The 2019 Alameda County PIT Count showed: Psychiatric or emotional conditions were the number one health condition among the county's homeless veterans (at 50 percent of unsheltered and 63 percent of sheltered veterans). The most frequently experienced conditions also included post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 43 percent of unsheltered and 21 percent of sheltered) and substance use (36 percent of unsheltered and 15 percent of APPENDIX E PUBLIC COMMENTS APPENDIX E PUBLIC COMMENTS860 MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE - DRAFT | FY 2022-2023 | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 66 of 75 APPENDIX E: PUBLIC COMMENTS MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE, FY22/23 MARIANA REAL, MPH, MCHES sheltered). A 2012 study of incarcerated veterans in Alameda County found the y have a higher prevalence of adverse mental health than the typical jail population: 64 percent reported a mental health diagnosis. 75 percent of incarcerated veterans who participated in the study reported substance abuse problems as well. BIPOC vete rans have higher rates of mental health need and are less likely to qualify for VA services. Rates of military -related PTSD in Black veterans are twice that of white veterans and rates for Latinx veterans are 50 percent higher compared to white veterans. Black veterans are less likely to have their service -connected disability benefits claims approved for PTSD. Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharges preclude access to benefits and healthcare. Black veterans and Latinx veterans are more likely to be d ischarged from the military less than honorably. Mental health conditions often influence behavior that leads to an OTH discharge. Black service members are far more likely to be subject to court -martial and Non -Judicial Punishment within the military: Air Force: 1.71 times (71 percent) more likely Navy: 1.40 times (40 percent) more likely Army: 1.61 times (61 percent) more likely Marine Corps: 1.32 times (32 percent) more likely Underserved veteran populations require specialized outreach and c ulturally competent care. LGBTQ+ veterans are estimated to have twice the rate of depression as other veterans and are more likely than other veterans to screen positive for PTSD, as other veterans. Veterans aged 65 years and older are twice as likely to have a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder than the general population of the same age. Women veterans have higher rates of lifetime and past - year PTSD than male veterans, and both nonveteran men and women. 40 percent of unhoused women veterans have experienced military sexual trauma (MST) and veterans who experienced MST are over twice as likely to experience homelessness. Veterans who have experienced homelessness are almost twice more likely than non -veterans who have experienced homelessne ss and 11 times more likely than other veterans to report lifetime suicide attempts. Veterans require and deserve specialized community outreach and care. Veterans receiving mental health services from community providers need treatment that takes into acc ount their military background, transition experiences, particular mental health risks, and service -related mental health conditions. There are opportunities to screen for veteran status, make appropriate referrals and assist veterans in overcoming barrier s to VA care in order to prevent and mitigate homelessness and mental health need among Alameda County veterans. For these reasons, we urge Alameda County to include veteran specific programs in future MHSA strategic plans. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you f or your comment. ACBH tracks services to members of the veteran community through its regular data collection mechanism through contracted providers. ACBH remains committed to using this data to understand service needs and to drive innovation to deliver services to specific existing and/or emerging populations, such as resident veterans and their families.

Juan Walker The county should spend mental health dollars on creative organizations like Create The Space which has been actively supporting the mental well -being of Black men in the community. This organization has many programs and activities aimed at addressing the mental health needs of Black men some which include yoga and meditation as well as programs to provide therapy and coaching for Black men. This is an underserved community that traditionally shuns mental health treatment, but Create The Space has made in roads in identifying and serving members of this community. The entire county benefits when these needs are being addressed. For these reasons, the county should fund Create The Space. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your comment.

Bre Williams I am a board member of a new nonprofit, R -Evolution, which focuses on facilitating community healing through global immersion experiences. With experienced leadership in the fields of mental health for youth, adults and families, AOD, restorative practices and education, we have created a new train -the-trainer program called the Global Resilience and Healing Fellowship. This program will provide training for providers, professionals, peer support specialists, and community health workers working in the area s of mental health and mental health related fields, including AOD and violence prevention. The purpose of this fellowship program is to help clinical and community providers, who support communities of color, to learn from international communities of col or who have recovered from trauma and are demonstrating resilience through traditional, indigenous and innovative practices. Fellows will be led through hands -on, and experiential learning processes, demonstrating how others have healed themselves, their c ommunities and countries through mental health programs, restorative justice, economic empowerment and peace building efforts. Fellows will develop toolkits on how to implement healing programming in their respective communities and organizations. Our glob al training sites will focus initially on Rwanda and South Africa. We strongly feel this immersion experience can be used as staff training for those working in mental health and expanded community healing, and that Alameda County should fund this innovati ve and impactful mission. Our goal is to send two cohorts of 10 individuals each cohort during the first year, and up to four cohorts in the years to follow. The Fellows included in this funding will be selected from a minimum of 10 Alameda County CBOs, wh o serve at least 500 individuals (youth, adults and family) annually. The impact of funding this fellowship program will not only benefit each organization's strengthening of their staff's knowledge of mental wellness and restorative practices within their organizations, it will create a local and global mutually supportive cohort and collective of Alameda county providers who will increase their capacity to benefit a greater community of at least 5,000 individuals within in the initial launch year. The fellowship training is scheduled to begin the year funding is approved. The annual cost for the fellowship training program in the first year starts at $349,474. This will translate into benefitting our greater community of at least 5000 individuals at a mere cost of $69.89 per person per year. This budget includes all Fellow global and local trainings, stipends, and operational costs, including airfare, ground transportation, meals, room and board.

Our family had numerous contacts with the ACBH through the ACCESS entry point (2018). Our family was desperate to get mental health services for our son, Jacob Bauer. Each time, we were told that because he was covered by his employer's health plan, he did not qualify to access any of the ACBH services. With that stated, from this report, and the website of ACBH ; \"As an insurance plan for Medi- Cal recipients, we are required to operate a 24/7/365 telephonic referral line to ensure that our insurance beneficiaries can have around - the clock access to their behavioral health insurance benefits. This phone number is the p oint of entry for behavioral health services and referrals.\" With the prerequisite being Medi -Cal, only 449,473 of the County population (1,510,271) have access to the services offered by ACBHS. Thus, over 1,000,000 DO NOT have access to the vital services offered by ACBHS. Page 34 of the draft report states that only 25,541 were served by ACBHS in 20/21. A penetration rate of only 1.7% of all Alameda County residents. Page 34 also states that of the 449,473 participants, ACBHS only served 25,541 people (5. 7%). One should take note of these percentages. Numerous academic studies have determined that at least 25% of the US population has a diagnosable mental health illness requiring medical attention. Some studies have place this to be as high as 40%. That me ans that Alameda County has almost 400,000 people who need medical attention for their mental health well being. From the data provided in this report, one can conclude that more than 300,000 people need medical attention, but are not receiving it, regardl ess if the provider is ACBHS or private practitioners. DE -ESCALATION The term de -escalation is mentioned many times in the report. Most often, a person who is in crisis is met with an encounter from law enforcement. It is important to note that law enforce ment becomes involved from a 911 call, where the individual has committed a small crime. The problem with a law enforcement response is that law enforcement has a totally different definition of de -escalation than the medical community. In fact (source Lex ipol), law enforcement has no constitutional or legal requirement to use any de -escalation tactics. Furthermore, (source Lexipol) it is stated that law enforcement can only initiate de -escalation tactics once: Boundaries are established, the officer has ga ined control of the situation, and the officer (hopefully) gains compliance of the person...then the de -escaltion process can start. Thus in Pleasanton, the threat or use of increased force by PPD is viewed as a de -escalation tactic. It has been stated tha t pointing a taser and sparking it is a form of de -escalation, hoping to get the person to comply; or holding back a barking police dog, telling the person to comply or the dog will be released. Regrettably, there is a stigma in the general population and media about mental illness. Stigma is touched upon many times in the report. People have the stigma that everyone who is in a state of crisis is a danger. Thus, when a call to law enforcement arrives, when asked if the person is dangerous, the caller often states \"well s/he looks dangerous\",and law enforcement consequently responds to a \"dangerous\" person. 2 items related to above: Mental health first aid should include ALL businesses that interact with the public: Hotels, restaurants, grocery stores to nam e a few. The CATT should be deployed countywide, on a 7/24 basis.

As a pilot, the CATT project is testing whether a crisis response team that includes a behavioral health clinician and emergency medical technician collaborating with law enforcement is a successful model. Expanding CATT teams countywide is a long -term goal of the project if this model proves to be successful. 267.

African American Steering Committee The 2011 African American Utilization Report (Report) acknowledged inequality and \"inappropriate provider care\" as foundational to the, long -standing African American health crisis. County data was so dire, ACBHCS Director vowed to transform the harmful Co unty system. ACBHCS, MHSA African American INNOVATION produced 14 Provider Training Curricula. Quality improvements would be accomplished through African American, INNOVATORS, training County providers, collaborating and integrating the 14 MHSA strategies into County services. It was brilliant. Providers had other ideas. They joined together, in an apparent united front, refusing to collaborate, cooperate or participate with African American INNOVATORS. Providers derailed African American's attempt to heal community **No consequences were imposed on the Providers for their refusal to change the lethal service. Instead the African American community continues to die of preventable illness and without appropriate services. TODAY, Like lambs to the slaughter, A frican Americans are incarcerated, assigned, unwittingly choose, some are mandated to these same providers and services, deemed inappropriate in the Utilization Report, a decade ago!! Today in Alameda County Asians have 3 integrated care facilities. They o utlive African Americans by 11 years.

They are 10% of the County population, but 38% of the County mental health service population They are number 1 in 8 of ten categories of death by preventable illness. With adequate preven tion services they would not die of that illness. African Americans have no appropriate prevention or early intervention services.

African American Steering Committee, member After the African American INNOVATION was derailed by County Providers refusing to participate in African American quality improvements, the African American Steering Committee for Health and Wellness (AASCHW), was constituted. To address the dilemma, AASCHW advocated for funding 12 \"African Ameri can\" contracts and is tasked with reviewing those 12 contracts for cultural responsiveness, Currently, most of these 12 contractors do not appear to be culturally responsive. They do not identify their services as African American. They do not outreach, ma rket to or locate in African American pathways. We can't find them. Most African Americans even the AASCHW Committee members are not aware that 12 African American contracts even exist, where they are located, or what services they provide. Leadership on t he other hand does know about these contracts, in fact the AASCHW Leadership included hefty contractual allocations to Leadership's own personal organizations, including the African American HUB. The extent of Leadership's beneficial interests in MHSA cont racts is unknown. Leadership may be extracting the lion's share of MHSA contracts. AASCHW membership cannot know as requests to Leadership for transparency and information are met with hostility, refusal and bullying. For years, Leadership has obstructed a ny and all attempts at a contract review process. Because Leadership is avoiding review and transparency in their own personal, AASCHW contracts, they obstruct review and appropriate services for all African Americans. As a result, none of the contracts AA SCHW forwarded for funding, have EVER been reviewed, or held accountable to be culturally responsive. They may be but we do not know 12 AASCHW contractors including those contracts held by Leadership and the HUB are providing unknown services, of an unknow n quality, to unknown populations, while African Americans die of preventable illness for lack of prevention and early intervention services. African Americans have mental health contracts. We just can't find the services. Some contractors take African Ame rican funding but do not intend African American services, one of many an issue that could be addressee by review and quality improvements could occur. AASCHW Contractors may meet numerical deliverables set by the County, however, cultural responsiveness i s a question to be reviewed by AASCHW. AASCHW Committee members cannot know about the cultural responsiveness of AASCHW programs. Leadership forbids us the necessary information and opportunity to complete this work that is foundational to the health and w ellness of the community. Lack of appropriate services cost lives Instead of recusing themselves and declaring what is an obvious conflict, Leadership obstructs delays, and denies, any and all attempts at contract reviews, maintaining secrecy, avoid scruti ny regarding the impact their various contractual relationships may have on their decisions as ASSCHW Leadership. Perhaps AASCHW Leadership's hefty AASCHW contracts make them inappropriate for Leadership? Particularly if they are willing to withhold review s of every contract to save their own. African Americans need services. AASCHW Leadership, will not let African American prevention and early intervention contract review happen.... ever. This does not seem to be a situation will resolve without outside inte rvention. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your comment. The inequities within our system are being addressed.
