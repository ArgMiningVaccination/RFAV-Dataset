According to a male voice that can be heard speaking in an indigenous Ghanaian Language- Twi in the voice note, COVID-19 vaccines contain \"poison\" and are being deployed to depopulate Africa. The 4 minutes and 38 seconds long audio has been tagged by WhatsApp as \"forwarded many times\" and according to the author of the audio clip, governments around the world would soon demand citizens to compulsorily take COVID-19 vaccines, so the only available remedy is to drink the suggested mixture. Claim \"The COVID-19 vaccines produced by the white man is a strategy to kill Africans. They want to depopulate Africa and take over our properties... At a point, this vaccination exercise would become compulsory and no matter what, you will be vaccinated... So, grind charcoal, sieve it and extract the powder. Add one tablespoon of the powdered charcoal to half a beer glass of warm water, stir very well and drink, before taking the vaccine. Even if you have already taken the vaccine, do the same. If you have relatives abroad who have gone for the vaccine make sure to send them the remedy so they drink it in the morning and evening for at least three days. It will detoxify your body or help reduce the activeness of the poison in the vaccine,\" the author of the audio clip partly said. Fact-check \"There is absolutely no poison in COVID-19 vaccines and over 2.3 billion doses have been given all around the world so far,\" World Health Organization(WHO) Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA) secretariat told GhanaFact. \"Vaccine safety is one of the highest priorities, and we're working closely with national authorities to develop and implement standards to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective,\" the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/safety-of-covid-19-vaccines) said. Millions of people have safely received COVID-19 vaccines and all of the approved vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored. Like all vaccines, [COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/safety-of-covid-19-vaccines) went through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials are specifically designed to identify any safety concerns. According to the WHO AIRA secretariat, COVID-19 vaccines substantially reduce the risk of people getting sick and dying of the virus. \"They are a crucial tool in ending the pandemic. COVID-19 vaccines could well save your life, so when you get the chance, please get the vaccine.\" GhanaFact has in the past flagged a similar claim that COVID-19 vaccines are poisonous and have been [produced to kill Africans](https://ghanafact.com/2021/04/fact-check-covid-19-vaccines-were-not-developed-to-kill-africans/). Verdict The claim that COVID-19 vaccines are poisonous is FALSE. "}
