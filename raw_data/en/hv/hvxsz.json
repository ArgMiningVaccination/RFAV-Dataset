On this scale, 7 is neutral, 0 is the most acidic, and 14 is the most basic. The pH level of your vagina plays an important role in everything from how susceptible it is to infection to how comfortable and irritation-free you are on a day-to-day basis. Read on to learn more about what constitutes a normal vaginal pH balance, how and what happens when your vaginal pH becomes unbalanced, and what you can do to re-balance an unbalanced vaginal pH. What is a normal Vaginal pH Balance? While it may have been a while since you cracked open your high school chemistry books, understanding your vaginal pH can help you understand how to keep your body feeling good. According to the National Library of medicine, a [healthy vagina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8618584/#:~:text=The%20naturally%20neutral%20pH%20is,from%20pathogenic%20organisms%20%5B4%5D.) generally has a pH level between 4 and 4.5 - this means that it is a little acidic. This level can change during different life phases and is often slightly less acidic before puberty and after menopause. The acids in your vagina are produced both by the healthy bacteria that lives there and the vaginal fluid that your body secretes. These acids are important to your overall vaginal health because they kill harmful parasites, bacteria, and fungi that can cause infection and discomfort. What Happens if Your Vaginal pH is High? During your fertile years (about ages 15-49), your vaginal pH should not be above 4.5. Levels above 4.5 provide unhealthy bacteria the perfect opportunity to grow and multiply. When you have a high vaginal pH (remember, that's anything above 4.5) you're at risk for developing infections like bacterial vaginosis and Trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an overgrowth of the bacteria that occurs naturally in the vagina. It's the most common vaginal infection in women between the ages of 15 and 49 and causes uncomfortable and unpleasant symptoms including: - Unusual discharge that may be green, white, or gray - A fishy smell - Burning with urination - Vaginal itching Bacterial vaginosis can be uncomfortable and unpleasant, is [correlated with fertility issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8618584/), and can make you more susceptible to sexually transmitted infections. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection that does not usually present with any symptoms on its own but that can cause your body to be more susceptible to more serious infections like HIV. This infection is caused by a parasite that thrives in a vagina in which the pH is above healthy levels. What Happens if Your Vaginal pH is Low? Having a more acidic vagina does not typically result in discomfort or disease but it can make it more difficult to get pregnant. If you're trying to conceive, this can be frustrating and upsetting. During sex, the vaginal pH rises temporarily. This occurs because sperm do best in a more alkaline environment. If your vagina is unbalanced and too acidic, the sperm won't be able to effectively fertilize the egg. What Causes Unbalanced Vaginal pH? There are several possible factors that can result in a vagina that does not have a balanced pH. These can include: - Douching Douching is never recommended but remains a popular practice in the United States. According to the [National Office on Women's Health](https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/douching#:~:text=Douching%20is%20washing%20or%20cleaning,problems%2C%20including%20problems%20getting%20pregnant.), around 1 in 5 women douche today. Introducing water, store-bought douching solutions, or home-mixed douching solutions into your vagina can increase your vaginal pH and contribute to the overgrowth of harmful bacteria. - Antibiotics Most doctors advise using antibiotics with caution as they kill all the bacteria in your body, not just the harmful bacteria they are targeting. Killing the good bacteria along with the bad can lead to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria. - Hormonal Birth Control Birth control pills can alter the vaginal pH for some people who use them which can create an opportunity for infection to thrive. - Your Menstrual Cycle Menstrual blood, which flows from the uterus to the vagina is usually more basic than the vagina itself. If this blood sits in the vagina, like in a tampon, or in contact with it, like on a pad, it can lead to raised pH levels in the vagina. - Some Lube While lubricants can make some people feel more comfortable during intercourse by reducing vaginal dryness, they sometimes have a pH higher than 4.5 which can reduce the quantity of healthy, helpful bacteria and lead to infection. - Unprotected Sex Semen is naturally alkaline - the introduction of semen into the vagina can sometimes encourage the growth of bacteria that can cause an imbalance. - Scented Soaps and Harsh Intimate Care Products Using scented soap and bath or intimate care products with harsh chemicals or added fragrance can cause an overproduction of the 'bad' bacteria in your vagina and lead to an imbalance. Symptoms of an Unbalanced Vaginal pH Typically, you won't know that your vaginal pH is unbalanced until you begin to experience uncomfortable symptoms associated with an infection. Some symptoms of a Vaginal pH that is unbalanced include: - A fishy or unpleasant vaginal odor - Discharge that is gray, green, foamy, or thick and white - Vaginal itching - Swelling and/or irritation around the vulva - Burning or pain with sex or urination These are all symptoms of infections like bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis. Keeping your Vaginal pH From Becoming Unbalanced Taking care of your vaginal pH can help you avoid infection and the associated unpleasant symptoms. Some things you can do to help your vagina maintain the optimal pH include: - Avoiding lubricants with a pH higher than 4.5 - Using a condom during sex - Taking a [probiotic](https://femiclear.com/products/restoratives-advanced-dual-action-probiotic-complex)regularly - Using antibiotics and hormonal birth control with caution - Changing your pad or tampon frequently during your period - Avoiding douching - Using a [restorative feminine wash](https://femiclear.com/products/feminine-wash-femiclear-restoratives) - Avoiding harsh or scented soaps or other intimate care products Correcting an Unbalanced Vaginal pH When your vaginal pH is out of whack, you'll probably want to get things under control as soon as possible.
