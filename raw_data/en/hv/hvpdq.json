(b) In no event may this Lease be assigned in part, nor may the Premises be subleased in part. No assignment or sublet may be effectuated by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of Landlord as aforesaid. The consent of Landlord to any assignment or subletting, or the implementation of any assi gnment or subletting Standard Lease 15 Picotte Companies that may be permitted hereunder without Landlord's consent, shall not be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant from liability for the performance of all covenants and obligations to be performed by Tenant under this Lease, nor sha ll the collection or acceptance of rent from any assignee or subtenant constitute a waiver or release of Tenant from any of its liabilities or obligations under this Le ase, and the assignor Tenant shall remain jointly and severally liable for the contin ued performance of Tenant's obligations. Tenant hereby waives all suretyship and similar technical defenses, including, without limitation, defense arising from t he amendment, renewal, termination or expiration of this Lease without its knowledge o r consent. Landlord's consent to any assignment or subletting shall not be construed as relieving Tenant from the obligation of obtaining Landl ord's prior written consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting.

In either of the events described in clause (i) or (ii) above, this Lease shall be terminated as of the date specified for such termination in Landlord's notice aforesaid as to the portion or all of the Premises so retaken, provided that any and all liabilities of Tenant which accrued and remained unsatisfied pr ior to the date of such termination shall survive such termination. In the event Landl ord does not exercise its aforesaid right within thirty ( 30) days of receipt of said noti ce and any processing fee required hereunder, Tenant then may assign or sublet, as the ca se may be, to the intended sublease or assignee, provided Tenant has obtained the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be given or withheld according to the stand ard set forth in Section 18.1(a). (d) Anything herein to the co ntrary notwithstanding, if Landlo rd shall not elect to exercise the right set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, suc h election shall not under any circumstances be deemed a consent to the proposed sublettin g or assignment of Tenant's interest in and to this Lease and/or the Premises, and it is expressly u nderstood that any determination by Landlord not to exercise such right s hall not preclude Landlord from withholding its consent to such proposed subletti ng or assignment. (e) In the event of any assignment or sublet, then fifty perce nt (50%) of any purchase price, assignment fee, furniture or equipment purchase or rental payme nt, incremental monthly rent or other payment due to Tenant, if any, as the result of any such assignment or sublease which is in excess of the rent (or pro r ata portion thereof) then payable by Tenant under this Lease shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as additional rent as and when received by Tenant.

(f) Tenant shall be responsible for and agrees to pay (i) a no n-refundable processing fee of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) upon submission of a proposed sublet or assignment to Landlord and (ii) any out-of pocket costs and expenses, includi ng (without limitation) reasonable legal fees, incurred by Landlord in connection with any actual, proposed or purported assignment or sublease, whether or not Landlord conse nts thereto; provided that in no event shall such fees be in excess of $2,500. 18.2 If Tenant is a partnership or limited liability company, a withdrawal or change (whether by way of one or more withdrawals or changes) \u2014 whether voluntary, invol untary or by operation of law \u2014 of partners or members owning a controlling or majority interest in Tenant on the date hereof shall be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the provisions of Section 18.1. If Tenant is a corporation, any dissolution, merg er, consolidation or other reorganization of Tenant, or the sale or transfer (whether by w ay of one or more sales or transfers) of a controlling or majority interest of the capital stock of Tenant shall be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the provision s of Section 18.1. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to corporations whose stock is traded through a national or regional exchange or over-the-counter. It is understood and agreed that a controlling interest for purposes of this Article may be less than a majority interest. 19.

The summary w ould include kilowatt hour usag e, kilowatt demand used per month and the amount billed. This tells us how our separately metered tenants are using energy, and can help us find ways to cut energy costs. In addition to the information that we obtain from National Gr id for our own meters, it is important for us to know about the electric history of all the other meters in our buildings. This way, we have a complete picture of the electric usage at each p roperty. With this combined information, we're better able to efficiently monitor and manage the entire building. It also helps to prevent or detect billings errors, defective meters and othe r problems that could cost you or us to pay more for utility costs than either of us should.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Lease may not be assigned, and the Premises may not be sublet, to any pers on or entity who may claim the defense of sovereign immunity or any similar defense. When Landlord's \"consent\" is referenced herein, it shall refer to both approval of the proposed assignee/subtenant and approval of the instrument of assignment/sublet and any amendment thereof. (b) In no event may this Lease be assigned in part, nor may the Premises be subleased in part. No assignment or sublet may be effectuated by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of Landlord as aforesaid . The consent of Landlord to any assignment or subletting, or the implementation of any assignment or subletting Standard Lease 15 Picotte Companies that may be permitted hereunder without Landlord's consent, shall not be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant from liability for the perf ormance of all covenants and obligations to be performed by Tenant under this Lease, nor shall the collection or acceptance of rent from any assignee or subtenant constitute a waiver or release of Tenant from any of its liabilities or obligations under thi s Lease, and the assignor Tenant shall remain jointly and severally liable for the continued performance of Tenant's obligations. Tenant hereby waives all suretyship and similar technical defenses, including, without limitation, defense arising from the am endment, renewal, termination or expiration of this Lease without its knowledge or consent. Landlord's consent to any assignment or subletting shall not be construed as relieving Tenant from the obligation of obtaining Landlord's prior written consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting. If Tenant is in default hereunder beyond applicable notice and cure period , Tenant hereby hereby authorizes each such subtenant to pay said rent directly to Landlord. The cost of any construction required to permit the operation of any subleased space separate from the balance of the Premises shall be an Alteration, and the cost thereof shall be borne solely by Tenant.

In either of the events described in clause (i) or (ii) above, this Lease shall be terminated as of the date specified for such termination in Landlord's notice aforesaid as to the portion or all of the Premises so retaken, provided that any and all liabilities of Tenant which accrued and remained unsat isfied prior to the date of such termination shall survive such termination. In the event Landlord does not exercise its aforesaid right within thirty (30) days of receipt of said notice and any processing fee required hereunder, Tenant then may assign or sublet, as the case may be, to the intended sublease or assignee, provided Tenant has obtained the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be given or withheld according to the standard set forth in Section 18.1(a). (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if Landlord shall not elect to exercise the right set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, such election shall not under any circumstances be deemed a consent to the proposed subletting or assignment of Tenant's interest in and to this Lease and/or the Premises, and it is expressly understood that any determination by Landlord not to exercise such right shall not preclude Landlord from withholding its consent to such proposed subletting or assignment. (e) In the event of any assignment or sublet, then fifty percent (50%) of any purchase price, assignment fee, furniture or equipment purchase or rental payment, incremental monthly rent or other payment due to Tenant, if any, as the result of any such assignment or sublease which is in excess of the rent (or pro rata portion thereof) then payable by Tenant under this Lease shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as additional rent as and when received by Tenant. If such sum is payable to Tenant in a lump sum, Standard Lease 16 Picotte Companies the lump sum shall be amortized on a straight -line basis over the then -remaining Lease Term to determine if the payment is in excess of the rent then payable by Tenant. (f) Tenant shall be responsible for and agrees to pay (i) a non -refundable processing fee of One Hundred Dollars ($ 100.00 ) upon submission of a proposed sublet or assignment to Landlord and (ii) any out-of pocket costs and expenses, including (without limitation) reasonable legal fees, incurred by Landlord in connection with any actual, proposed or purported assignment or sublease, whether or not Landlord consents thereto ; provided that in no event shall such fees be in excess of $2,500 . 18.2 If Tenant is a partnership or limited liability company, a withdrawal or change (whether by way of one or more withdrawals or changes) \u2014 whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law \u2014 of partners or members owning a controlling or majority interest in Tenant on the date hereof shall be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the provisi ons of Section 18.1. If Tenant is a corporation, any dissolution, merger, consolidation or other reorganization of Tenant, or the sale or transfer (whether by way of one or more sales or transfers) of a controlling or majority interest of the capital stock of Tenant shall be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the provisions of Section 18.1. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to corporations whose stock is traded through a national or regional exchange or over -the-counte r. It is understood and agreed that a controlling interest for purposes of this Article may be less than a majority interest. 19.

This way, we have a complete pict ure of the electric usage at each property. With this combined information, we're better able to efficiently monitor and manage the entire building. It also helps to prevent or detect billings errors, defective meters and other problems that could cost y ou or us to pay more for utility costs than either of us should.

The facility site comprises 109 acres. The parking area and facility structures comprise 12 acres that are fully fenced and gated. The site receives electric, telephone and internet service. Cultivation of marijuana, as more fully discussed herein, will be staged in a series of enclosed and secure 20' by 75' rectangular \"cells\" constructed of Stru ctural Insulated Panels (\"SIP\"). The cultivation cells have been previously used for mushroom cultivation. Cultivation of marijuana will conform to the organic production standards established by the National Organic Farm Association (NOFA) . Cultivation managers possess several decades of combined experience conducting NOFA certified agricultural operations . 1 Redacted pursuant to N.Y. Public Officers Law, Art. 6 Redacted pursuant to N.Y. Public Officers Law, Art. 61. 2 Cultivation Plan 1.2.1 Good Agricultural Practices Modeled on the Good Agricultural Practices promulgated by the United States Department of Agriculture for specific crops, CRCNY will implement a rigorous program to support proper as eptic conditions in the cultivation facility. An employee change area will be established in which all cultivation employees are required to change from \"street\" clothes into sanitized Tyvek coveralls and sanitized footwear. All cultivation employees ar e required to wear hair nets, pocketless c overalls and booties , all of which will be provided by the facility, stored at the facility and cleaned weekly. All cultivation, manicuring, processing, inventory control and packaging employees are required to wear latex or vinyl/nitrile gloves at all times handling plants or product. There will be no human skin in contact with the plants or products at any time. 1.2.2 Sanitation Daily cleaning is part of keeping the cultivation area free from pests and disea ses. CRCNY uses an organic cleaner to clean and sanitize all equipment and the growing areas before, during, and after harvests. A natural, non -toxic organic cleaner is used for cleaning. During cycle changes, when new /cloned plants are moved to vegetative stage, vegetative stage to pre -flowering stage, and pre -flowering to flowering stage, rooms will be cleaned prior to the transplant , including washing of all floors. A water and organic cleaner solution is used to clean reservoirs, aerator pumps, and water pumps , and to flush all irrigation lines. 2 Redacted pursuant to N.Y. Public Officers Law, Art. 6All hand trucks, trays, buckets, other receptacles, platforms, racks, tables, shelves, knives, saws, cleavers, other utensils, and the machinery used in handling or processing marijuana flower, clones, plants or harvested and cured products will be cleaned daily. A hand -washing sink will be easily accessible to employees and must be used prior to any employee entering into a room containing plants, flower or products destined for consumption by qualified pa tients. In addition, if working directly with the preparation of medical marijuana or the infusion of extracted marijuana oils into finished goods, employees must keep fingernails trimmed, filed, and maintained so that the edges and surfaces are cleanable; not have fingernail polish or artificial fingernails; and wear protective apparel such as pocketless coats, aprons or gowns and gloves to prevent contamination.

Each dedicated grow room will provide the requisite lighting, organic nutrients and irrigation as determined by the Director of Cultivation pursuant to protocols established by CRCNY cultivation consultants. 1.3 Harvesting At the direction of the Cultivation manager , a fully flowered mature plant will be harvested. Trained staff will use a designated multi -tool reciprocating saw to cut the stalk of the plant two (2) inches above the medium. The plant 's barcode is scanned into the NYSDOH -approved electronic tracking system which will record that the plant is designated for harvest. The harvested plant is then transported to the processing room , where the plant barcode is scanned into the NYSDOH -approved electronic tracking system , which will record that the plant has been designated for processing. 1.4 Processing Upon transfer to the processing room , the barcode of the plant will be scanned and tracked with the NYSDOH -approved electronic tracking system. A visual inspection of the harvested plant material is performed to ensure that there is no mold, mildew, pests, rot or gray or black plant material. Only leaves and flowers of female plants are processed. Strict personal hygiene and facility sanitation policies , which exceed good agricultural practices as more fully described above , will be strictly followed. Remaining stems will be weighed, barcoded, and stored in an appropriate container for further processing 6 and/or transfer to the curing room. Processed plant material will immediately enter the curing phase upon completing of processing. No part or piece of a harvested plant will be discarded or removed in a manner inconsistent with DOH regulations.

CRCNY will validate the shelf-life of unopened medical marijuana products valid ated by ongoing stability testing according to a schedule determined by the department and an expiration d ate for unopened produ cts shall be determined through the stability testing. CRCNY will develop specifications for storage conditions at the manufac turing facility once the package is sealed, during transport, at the dispensing facility, in the patient's home and for samples retained for future testing. No synthetic marijuana additiv es will be used in the production of any medical marijuana product. 104 Section 10 - Recordkeeping (\u00a7 1004.5(b)(4)(vii)) 10.1 Overview This operating plan provides a detailed description of plans, procedures and systems adopted and maintained for tracking, record keeping, record retention and surveillance systems, relating to all medical marijuana at every stage including cultivating, pos sessing of marijuana, and manufacturing, delivery, transporting, distributing, sale and dispensing by the proposed registered organization. 10.2 Seed -to-Sale Tracking Software CRCNY will await the announcement by the DOH of their selection for \"seed to sa le\" tracking software to be used by all registered organizations. Once the announcement is made, CRCNY will contact the software company to assess the capabilities of the program to meet the recordkeeping mandates of the DOH and CRCNY. Given our researc h of the major \"seed -to-sale\" software vendors, we expect the vendor to offer modules for integrated point -of-sale (POS), inventory control, cultivation process management and patient record management as well as other features. Once we understand the capabilities and shortcomings of their offerings, should it be advisable, we will seek to compl ement the product with software for general ledger accounting, financial reporting, payroll management and other features that will enhance our reporting and record keeping ability. All computer systems will be backed up to a secure location (cloud network) on a daily basis. CRCNY will maintain all records required by article 33 of the public health law for a period of five (5) years and make such records available t o the department upon request. Such records shall include : (i) documentation, including lot numbers where applicable, of all materials used in the manufacturing of the approved medical marijuana product to allow tracking of the materials including but not limited to soil, soil amendment, nutrients, 105 hydroponic materials, fertilizers, growth promoters, pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides; (ii) cultivation, manufacturing, packaging and labeling production records; and (iii) laboratory testing results. In addition to independent laboratory testing in compliance with NYS regulations, CRCNY will perform internal laboratory testing of cannabinoid profiles and impurities to ensure that the final pa ckaged product meets NYS specifications for purity, uniformity, stability and dosage. 10.3 Shipping Manifests Prior to transporting any approved medical marijuana product, CRCNY shall complete a shipping manifest using a form determined by the DOH, a cop y of which must be transmitted to the dispensing facility that will receive the products and to the DOH at least two business days prior to transport. CRCNY shall maintain all shipping manifests and make them available to the DOH for inspection upon reques t, for a period of 5 years. These documents will track all deliveries and returns between the manufacturing facility in Cambridge and each of the four dispensary locations. 10.4 Dispensed Product Reporting CRCNY will electronically file with the DOH a re cord of all approved medical marijuana products that have been dispensed, utilizing a transmission format acceptable to the department, not later than 24 hours after the marijuana was dispensed to the certified patient or designated caregiver. The informa tion filed with the department for each approved medical marijuana product dispensed shall include but not be limited to: (1) a serial number that will be generated by the dispensing facility for each approved medical marijuana product dispensed to the ce rtified patient or designated caregiver; (2) an identification number which shall be populated by a number provided by the department, to identify the registered organization's dispensing facility; 106 (3) the patient name, date of birth , and sex; (4) the patient address, including street, city, state, and zip code; (5) the patient's registry identification card number; (6) if applicable, designated caregiver's name and registry identification card number; (7) the date the approved medical marijuana product was filled by the dispensing facility; (8) the metric quantity for the approved medical marijuana product; (9) the medical marijuana product drug code number, which shall be populated by a number provided by the department, to represent the approved medical marijuana brand that was dispensed to the certified patient or designated caregiver, as applicable; (10) the number of days ' supply dispensed; (11) the registered practitioner's Drug Enforcement Administration number; (12) the date the written certification was issued by the registered practitioner; and (13) the payment method. When applicable, CRCNY shall file a zero report with the department, in a format acceptable to the department. For the purposes of this section, a zero report shall mean a report that no approved medical marijuana product was dispensed by a registered organization during the relevant period of time. A zero report shall be submitted no later than 14 days following the most recent previously reported dispensing of an approved medical marijuana product or the submission of a prior zero report. All recording and reporting of patient information will be done in compliance with HIPPA. 107 10.5 Human Resources/Facility Maintenance- Logs and Reports CRCNY's manufacturing site will keep logs and records beyond those required by the DOH and entered into our \"seed -to-sale\" system. Files will be maintained by our Director of Human Resources detailing employee training, discipline, attendance, peer and supervisory performance reviews. Logs and records will be kept detailing equipment maintenance, facility maintenance, sanitation, breaches of safety protocol and safety equipment maintenance. Other documents and logs prepared and maintained at the Cambridge facility will include CRCNY standard operating procedures and transportation manifests. 10.6 Adverse Events, Complaints and Recalls CRCNY's dispensaries will maintain adverse events, complaints and recall tracking logs that will monitor each situation from report date until resolution. At the time of any reported event, the Compliance Director will review the history contained in the tracking log to determine if there are common circumstances that could require broader action than a single incident, al though any incident will be investigated until the issue is resolved to the satisfaction of the patient, practitioner and CRCNY's Compliance Director. Also, visitor logs will be maintained for DOH inspection for anyone entering the facility without a pati ent or caregiver registration card. 10.6 Security Incident Reporting Detailed investigative records will be developed and maintained by the Compliance Director for any breaches in security or disruptions to communications between transport vehicles and the Cambridge facility. Also, any disruptions in the ability of the central security monitoring station in Cambridge to view any part of the manufacturing or dispensing facilities will be investigated to determine the cause of the disruption and correctiv e action will be taken to ensure it does not recur. 108 10.7 Storage and Retrieval The majority of reports and recordkeeping will be in electronic form stored in a secure location (cloud network). To the extent CRCNY's logs are initially recorded on paper, electronic recording systems will be set up and logs entered for easy retrieval and data sorting. Paper records will be maintained in clearly marked binders in chronological order for each set of logs or records and kept in a secure location such a s a lockable office or filing cabinet. 109 100% CS Member LLC Potential Profits Interest Profits Interest 85% 15%Compassionate Sunset LLC Organization Chart D4 M Trust CS Member LLC Compassionate Sunset LLC d/b/a Compassionate Relief Centers of New YorkCompassionate Relief Centers of New York, Inc.GNYHA Ventures, Inc Page 1N.Y.S.

The parties agree to commence bargaining within 20 business days from the date the Employer recognizes the Union pursuant to this Agreement. If they are unable to agree to a collective bargaining agreement, the parties agree to submit all open provisions and issues to arbitrators Martin Scheinman or Carol Wittenberg, whoever is available sooner, for final and binding interest arbitration. 9. The parties agree to resolve any dispute over the interpretation of this Agreement through expedited arbitration. The parties will invoke expedited arbitration by submitting the dispute for resolution to arbitrators Martin Scheinman or Carol Wittenberg, so long as he or she is available to hear the dispute within 60 days. If neither is available to hear the dispute within 60 days, then the parties shall file for arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), and comply with its procedures for expedited arbitration. The arbitrator selected through AAA's process shall hear the dispute on either the first or second date the arbitrator is available and issue an award within 20 days thereafter. The parties will equally share the arbitrator's fees and costs (but will each pay their own attorneys' fees). 10. The parties agree that the arbitrator has the authority to direct the breaching party to specifically perform its obligations under this provision. The arbitrator may award a penalty of up to $10,000 for willful breaches. A willful breach is one that egregiously violated a term of this 2 Agreement and was not corrected after the aggrieved party provided written notice of it to the violating party. The parties consent to the entry of the arbitrator's award as the order of judgment of a United States District Court, without notice. 11. The Union and the Employer recognize that this Agreement is in their mutual best interests and therefore agree to prevent evasion of the terms of this Agreement through the use of contractors and/or subcontractors. To comply with the spirit of this Agreement, the Employer shall, as a condition of its relationship with any contractor and/or subcontractor require that: (a) the contractor and/or subcontractor enter into a neutrality agreement with the Union; and (b) immediately notify the Union when seeking to form a business relationship with the contractor and/or subcontractor. 12. Labor Peace Agreement: In the event that the Union attempts to organize the Employer's employees or .actually represents the Employer's employees at any particular location, then the Union hereby promises that it will not, at any time from the date this Agreement is executed until the first collective bargaining agreement becomes effective, engage in any strikes, picketing, work stoppages of any kind, sympathy strikes, boycotts, leafleting, handbilling, or any other economic interference with the Employer's business at that location, provided the Employer has not violated any of the terms of this agreement after having been ordered not to do so by an arbitrator. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed this 3rd day of June 2015, by their duly authorized representatives.

Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP Accountants & Advisors 1375 Broadway New York, NY 10018 212 84 0-3456 www.anchin.com INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Members of Compassionate Sunset LLC : We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Compassionate Sunset LLC (a limited liability company) (the \"Company\") , which comp rise the balance sheet as of June 4, 2015 , and the related statements of operations , member s' equity and cash flows for the period May 15, 2015 (inception) through June 4 , 201 5, and the related notes to the financial statements. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implement ation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinio n on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair prese ntation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opin ion.

Exempt Employees: those employees who are excluded from the overtime requirements of the federal and state wage and hour law. Exempt employees generally include salaried professional, executive and administrative employees. These classifications do not guarantee employment f or any specified period of time. Accordingly, the right to terminate the empl oyment relationship at will at any time, with or without cause or notice, is retained by both the em ployee and the Company. The Company complies with all federal and state wag e and hour laws concerning the payment of wages and overtime. You will be adv ised of your employee classification at the time of hire, promotion or transfer. A change in c ircumstances (e.g., greater number of hours worked) will not result in a change of status to a position with greater benefits unless the employee is specifically notified of such a status change in writing. - 5 - 3.2. Overtime When required by heavy production demands or custom er service needs, the Company may require employees to work overtime. Whe n overtime is required, employees will be entitled to overtime compensation in accordance with federal and state law. All overtime work must be authorized in advance by the appropria te supervisor of the employee working the overtime or by the department head. 3.3. Salaried Employees The Company is committed to ensuring that all emplo yees are fully paid in accordance with the salary requirements established by applicable federal, state and local laws. Exempt employees will be paid on a \"salary basis,\" and receive a predetermined amount of compensation each pay period in any workweek in whi ch the employee performs any work. This predetermined amount will not be reduced because of variations in the quality or quantity of the employee's work, except that deductions from an exe mpt employee's salary may be made when an exempt employee is absent from work for one or m ore full days for personal reasons or due to sickness or disability, to offset amounts employees receive as jury or witness fees, or for military pay, for unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith for workplace conduct rule infractions, or for weeks in which an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. If you believe that an improper deduction has been made to your salary, you should immediately report this information to your direct supervisor, or to the Human Resources Department. Reports of improper deductions will be promptly investigated. If it is determined that an improper deduction has occurred, you will b e promptly reimbursed for any improper deduction made. 4.

The single 12-month period is measured from the first day the employee takes such FMLA leave. (a) \"Covered Servicemember\" means: (i) A current member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) who is undergoing medic al treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is o therwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness (\"Cur rent Servicemember\");\" or - 8 - (ii) A veteran who: (1) is undergoing medical treat ment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness; (2) was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserv es); (3) was discharged within the five-year period before the eligible employee first takes FMLA leave to care for him or her; and (4) was discharged or released from the Ar med Forces under conditions other than dishonorable (\"Covered Veteran\"). An eligible employee must commence leave to care for a Covered Veteran within five years of the Covered Veteran's active duty service. (b) For purposes of Military Caregiver Leave, \"seri ous injury or illness\" means: (i) In the case of a Current Servicemember, an inju ry or illness that was incurred by him or her in the line of duty on a ctive duty in the Armed Forces (or that existed before the beginning of his or her active d uty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces ) and that may render the Covered Servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating; and (ii) In the case of a Covered Veteran, an injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated by him or her in the line of duty, while on active duty in the Armed Forces, and which manifested itself before or after he or she became a veteran, and is: (1) A continuation of a serious injury or illness t hat was incurred or aggravated when the Covered Veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered him or her unable to perform th e duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating; (2) A physical or mental condition for which the Co vered Veteran has received a VA Service Related Disabilit y Rating (\"VASRD\") of 50 percent or greater and such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the condition precipitating the need for leave; (3) A physical or mental condition that substantial ly impairs the Covered Veteran's ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or disabilitie s related to military service or would do so absent treatment; or (4) An injury, including a psychological injury, on the basis of which the Covered Veteran has been enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Fam ily Caregivers. (c) Important limitation. If an employee does not t ake all of his or her 26 workweeks of leave entitlement to care for a Covere d Servicemember during the 12-month period, the remaining part of his or her 26 workwee ks of leave is forfeited. - 9 - (d) Maximum duration of leave in any 12-month perio d. The Military Caregiver Leave is applied on a per-Covered-Service member, per-injury, basis such that an employee may be entitled to take more than one peri od of 26 workweeks of leave if the leave is to care for different Covered Servicemembers or to care for the same Covered Servicemember with a subsequent serious injury or illness, except that no more than 26 workweeks of leave my be taken within any single 12-month period. (e) \"Next of kin.\" An employee is \"next of kin\" of a Covered Servicemember if he or she is the nearest blood relative of the C overed Servicemember (other than the Covered Servicemember's spouse, parent, or child). Unless the Covered Servicemember has specifically designated in writing a particular blood relative a s his or her nearest blood relative for the purposes of the Military Caregiver Leave, the follo wing is the order of priority used to identify the nearest blood relatives of the Covered Servicem ember: (a) blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the Covered Servicemember; (b) siblings; (c) grandparents; (d) aunts and uncles; and (e) first cousins. When no such de signation is made, and there are multiple family members with the same level of relationship to the Covered Servicemember, all such family members shall be considered the Covered Serv icemember's next of kin and may take FMLA leave to provide care to the Covered Serviceme mber, either consecutively or simultaneously. When such designation has been mad e, the designated individual shall be deemed to be the Covered Servicemember's only next of kin. . Procedure for Requesting Leave Who to notify of need for leave. An employee is re quired to notify the Company, through the Human Resources Department, of any requ est for FMLA leave. Foreseeable leave. If the leave is foreseeable, su ch notice must be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which t he FMLA leave is to commence. If thirty (30) days notice is not practicable, notice must be give n as soon as practicable (normally no later than the next business day after learning of the need fo r leave). Foreseeable qualifying exigency leave. For foresee able leave due to a qualifying exigency, notice must be provided to the Company as soon as practicable regardless of how far in advance such leave is foreseeable (normally no l ater than the next business day after learning of the need for leave). Unforeseeable leave. When the approximate timing o f the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide notice to the Company as soon as practicable and, absent unusual circumstances, in accordance with the Compa ny's normal call-in procedures. Foreseeable medical treatment. If an employee is p lanning medical treatment, he or she must consult with the Company and make a rea sonable effort to schedule the treatment so that it does not unduly disrupt the Company's opera tions. Periodic reports. While on leave, employees are re quired to furnish the Company with periodic reports regarding his or her status a nd intent to return to work. - 10 - Early return from leave. If an employee on leave d iscovers that he or she is able to return to work earlier than previously indicated , he or she should notify the Company at least two (2) business days prior to the date he or she i ntends to return to work. Subsequent change in need for leave. The employee must advise the Company as soon as practicable if dates of scheduled leave cha nge or are extended, or were initially unknown, and provide supporting documentation. . Intermittent Leave or Reduced Schedule Employees may take leave on an intermittent or redu ced schedule basis in certain situations where there is a medical need for the em ployee or his or her parent, child, or Covered Servicemember for such leave and that medical need is best accommodated through intermittent leave or reduced schedules. Intermittent leave or reduced schedules shall be provided only in consultation with the Human Resources Department. If an employee requests intermittent leave or a red uced schedule, the employee shall provide the Company with the anticipated timi ng and duration of the leave or reduced schedule. The Company may transfer the employee to an available alterative position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommod ates recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular position. If an employee ne eds intermittent leave or a reduced schedule for planned medical treatment, he or she must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so that it does not unduly disrupt the Company's op erations. . Status of Accrual Benefits During FMLA Leave All benefits that the Company provides which operat e on an accrual basis (e.g., vacation, sick, and personal days) will ceas e to accrue during any period of unpaid FMLA leave. . Substitution of Paid and Unpaid Leave An employee approved for FMLA leave will be require d to use all accrued, unused paid leave days (e.g., vacation, personal, a nd sick days) during the leave period. These paid leave days will run concurrently with unpaid F MLA leave. Once such paid leave days are exhausted, the balance of the leave will be unpaid leave in accordance with the FMLA. Unpaid leave that also qualifies for FMLA leave (e.g., lea ve for short-term or work-related disability or injury) will be designated as FMLA leave. . Employee Status and Group Health Benefits During FM LA Leave Employee status An employee on approved FMLA leave will not have an y previously accrued benefit altered while on FMLA leave. - 11 - Health benefits An employee on approved FMLA leave will continue to be covered by the Company's group health plan on the same terms that would have applied if he or she had continued working during the entire leave period. Thus, any share of premiums which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must conti nue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave period. The Company may elect, in its discretion, to termin ate the health benefits of an employee on FMLA leave if that employee is more tha n thirty (30) days late in paying the required premiums. An employee's use of leave cons titutes his or her consent to have the Company promptly deduct any unpaid employee health insurance premiums upon his or her return to work. An employee on approved FMLA leave will be subject to any changes in the Company's group health plan that occurs while he or she is on FMLA leave (e.g., changes in coverage, premiums, deductibles). . Return to Work An employee on approved FMLA leave who fails to ret urn to work at the end of the leave will be required to reimburse the Company for all premium payments expended by the Company on the employee's behalf during the period of unpaid FMLA leave, unless the reason the employee does not return to work is due to: (a) the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition of the employee or the emp loyee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent; (b) the serious injury or illness of a spouse, son, dau ghter, or parent, or next of kin, who is a Covered Servicemember; or (c) other circumstances beyond th e employee's control. . Certification Requirement. Any request for FMLA leave must be su pported by an appropriate certification from a health care provider or the Un ited States military, as the case may be, when the request is necessitated by: (a) An employee's serious health condition; (b) A serious health condition of an employee's spo use, child, or parent; (c) A qualifying exigency; or (d) An employee providing care for a Covered Servic emember who sustained a serious injury or illness in the line o f duty. Consequences for not providing certification. Fail ure to provide the required certification may delay the start of FMLA leave or result in the denial of FMLA leave. - 12 - Additional certifications and medical opinions. If , at any time, the Company questions the validity of the need for leave, a sub sequent recertification and additional medical opinions may be required consistent with the FMLA. 4.2. Holidays The Company normally provides [ NUMBER ] paid holidays to all eligible employees, as explained below. A holiday schedule will be posted each year. For full-time, exempt employees, holiday pay is cal culated on a salary basis. To be eligible for holiday pay, regular non-exempt full-time employees must have completed three (3) months employment with the Comp any and must work or receive paid leave the last scheduled day immediately preceding and th e first scheduled day immediately following the holiday. Holiday pay for regular full-time emp loyees is calculated based on the employee's straight-time pay rate (as of the date of the holid ay) times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on that day. To be eligible for holiday pay, regular part-time n on-exempt employees must have completed three (3) months employment with the Company and the holiday must fall on a scheduled work day. Holiday pay for regular part-t ime employees is calculated based on the employee's straight-time rate (as of the date of th e holiday) times the number of hours the employee was scheduled to work that day. An approved vacation day or any other excused and p aid day off is considered a day worked for the purposes of holiday pay eligibil ity. Holidays falling on a Saturday are normally observ ed on the Friday preceding the holiday, and those falling on a Sunday are normally observed on the Monday following the holiday. When an employee is absent on an observed holiday due to a death in the immediate family, holiday pay will supersede the coincidental day(s) of bereavement; an employee will not receive both holiday pay and bereavement pay. During periods where an employee is on either an em ergency leave of absence military leave of absence, or unexcused absence, th e employee will not be eligible for holiday pay. 4.3. Military Leave Leaves of absence without pay for military or Reser ve duty are granted to full- time and part-time regular employees. If you are c alled to active military duty or to Reserve or National Guard training, or if you volunteer for th e same, you should notify your supervisor and submit copies of your military orders to him or her as soon as is practicable.

The Company will make reasonable efforts to provide a room or other location for the employee to express milk in private. An employee in need of such an accommodat ion should contact the Human Resources Department as soon as possible so that necessary ar rangements can be made. The Company prohibits discrimination on the basis of the need t o express breast milk. 4.6. Voting Leave If an employee is qualified to vote and desires to do so but his or her normal work hours make voting impossible, the employee should n otify his or her supervisor and Human Resources in writing not more than ten (10), nor fe wer than two (2), working dates before the day of the election.

General a. Provide a complete electrical system in accordance with all applicable codes, to include modifications to the existing electrical distribution systems , general power, lighting, lighting controls, telecommunications systems and support of the Owners securit y systems as appropriate for the renovation s to this industrial building to retrofit to the needs of the Compassionate Relief Centers of New York (CRCNY) . Codes applicable to the electrical work on this project are the Building Standards and Codes as deve loped by the State of New York Department of State, Office of Planning and Development. These Codes are based upon 2010 International Code Council (ICC) Codes and include , but are not limited to: i. 2010 Building Code of New York State ii. 2010 Existing Building Code of New York State iii. 2010 Fire Code of New York State iv. 2010 Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State v. NFPA 70 -2008 National Electrical Code (NEC) b. Provide electrical inst allation, specifically lighting, lighting controls and maximum voltage drops meeting the requirements of the Energy Conservation Construction Code and the Federal Energy Code . c. Coordinate with contractors of other trades (general, civil/site, mechanical, plumbing, temperature control) as necessary to provide an overall profess ional and complete project. 2. Existing Electrical a. The existing electrical service will be replaced, from the utility transformer outside, into the building and including the main switch and distribution equipment. b. There will be selective demolition of electrical equipment and wiring throughout the building to accommodate the needs of CRCNY. c. Scope of electrical demolition will be identified during the development of the construction documents. 3. Electrical Service and Distribution a. Existing electrical service from National Grid exists into the site, underground, to a utility owned, pad mount, liquid filled transformer. Page 2 CRCNY Electrical Basis of Design Engineering Services of Vermont, LLC 05/28 /2015 b. A new, 2,500 Amp, 277/480V, 3 phase, 4 wire electric service wil l be provided to the building. i. This electric service is sized to serve the load of the renovated West Cultivation Wing, the Central Processing and Administration area and the future loads of the East Cultivation Wing. ii. Preliminary load calculati ons indicate that the connected electrical load associated with the present proposed renovations (West Wing, Central Area ) will be 1,004 KVA (1,209 Amp at 480V, 3 phase). iii. Preliminary load calculati ons indicate that the connected electrical load associated with the full build out of the project (West Wing, Central Area, East Wi ng) will be 1,938 KVA ( 2,334 Amp at 480V, 3 phase). iv. The National Electrical Code (NEC) provides little allowance for considering the diversity in the loads of an industrial building when sizing an electric service and distribution. Although there will be diversity in the operations of the loads (scheduled lighting, scheduled HVAC), there will be cases where the schedules are altered and the loads could potentially operate simultaneously. c. The new electrical service will require coordination with National Grid, but it is likely that the primary wiring into the site will be adequate. Likely the only work necessary will be to replace the National Grid transformer, and potentially the concrete pad/va ult that it sits on. d. Secondary service to the building is underground; multiple parallel sets of aluminum conductors in conduit. e. A standby power generator system sh all be installed which will provide complete back -up to the facility. It is estimated that the generator s will be three paralleled 300KW/ 375KVA, 277/480V , 3 phase, 4 wire. Generator s will be diesel fired, self -contained units with weatherproof enclosure s and base fuel tank s to provide a minimum 24 hours of standby power to the facility. The generator s shall connect into the electrical distribution system through an automatic transfer switch es. f. Electrical distribution will be fed from the main switchboard to a series of smaller circuit breaker panels. There will be 277/480V distribution as well as 120/208V distribution, sub fed throu gh dry transformers. i. In general, loads are expected to operate at the following voltages: 1. General lighting: 277V 2. Production process equipment: 120V g. There is the potential that p hotovoltaic panels will be installed in the future and either tied into the existing building distribution system or connected directly to the utility. h.

Compassionate Relief Centers will serve as a true upstate/downstate collaboration, bringing together the agricultural expertise of the North Country, the health care expertise of the Hudson Valley, and the business acumen of the metro area. This organization incorporates New York State's most valuable features for the benefit of the people. The CRC, located in Washington County, is a New York grown company. It is housed at the gateway to the Adirondack Park and th e northernmost reach of the Capital Region. Washington County prides itself as a true agri -business community. The founders live in our community and have applied as an RO to ensure that the agri -business tradition remains cutting -edge and diverse. CRC has sited its dispensaries in locations across the state, which, when puzzled together with other ROs, ensures statewide coverage as well as a successful business model. They have been conscious of the economic development opportunities in areas of the state that have been longing for decades, while maintaining an eye for the access ibility of dispensaries for the patient population. There is no more logical location for a n RO. By expanding our crop diversification to include cannabis (for the purpose of producing Medical Marijuana), the agricultural industry of the region has demons trated itself as a natural fit for the crop. The expertise of the workforce our county has to offer ensures CRC's ability to meet the state's deadline. Our continued support for the agricultu ral industry will ultimately benefit the patients who are afflict ed with a number of approved diseases and conditions. As the Assemblymember representing the 113th Assembly District , I am confident in the State's Medical Marijuana Program and welcome a cultivation site . The highly regulated and security -focuse d site that CRC will be adding to our community will provide an appropriate environment for the patients in my dist rict a nd beyond. I firmly support the Compassionate Relief Centers of New York's application to receive a registration as a Registered Organiz ation in the New York Medical Marijuana Program.

Through the Compassionate Car e Act, which I supported in the State Legislature, I'm extremely pleased that m edical marijuana under regulation of the Department of Health will soon be providing benefits to patients with serious cond itions including cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Parkinson's diseas e, multiple sclerosis, and neurological conditions. CRCNY is a responsible and reliable entity to administer medical marijuana, given the outstanding track records of its partner, The Durst Organi zation and Greater New York Hospital Association, each of which have existed over a century . While there are no zoning changes required to locate a medical marijuana dispensary at this location in Community Board 4, I assure you that I will be working clos ing with the community board to ensure the facility is well -managed and integrated seamlessly in the neighborhood . Thank you for moving this important initiative forward.

Its partnership with Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA ) and the Durst Organization (Durst) will create economic development acro ss the entire state. In addition, it will ensure that each facet of the enterprise is managed by top experts i n the ir respective fields. GNYHA and Durst each possess more than 100 years of exp erienc e, maki ng this a dynamic team. For many people suffering from terminal illnesses, marijuana has the ability to treat o r diminish debilitating side effects that render life all but unlivable. My constituents on the Upper West Side and I have long supported providing those who suffer from chronic pain and serious diseases with access to medical marijuana, and we applaud the New York State Department of Health for moving this init iative forward in a timely and r esponsible manner.
