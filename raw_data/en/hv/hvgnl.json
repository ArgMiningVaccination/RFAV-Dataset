It's hard workand requires lots of motivation, but ultimately is highly rewarding and a great career\". Con Tsang, UK space scientist. Space technology affects almost every part of our lives: weather forecasting, satellite TV, global communications and satellite navigation. A career in the space industry couldinclude any of these areas and much more. In fact, the UK is a world leader in space technology and science. UK teamsare involved in dozens of missions from spacecraft orbitingother planets to the many satellites monitoring the Earth. The UK space industry is worth some \u00a34.8 billion. British companies manufacture satellites for communications,navigation and research. They provide expertise incomputers, control systems and broadcasting. There are also plenty of opportunities available both in the UK andacross Europe through the European Space Agency (ESA). Careers in space might include working on a new satellite or developing technology to map a distant planet. You could behelping to make new discoveries about our Solar System or using satellites to study pollution on Earth. You might beconnecting the world's most remote communities or helpingaid agencies reach a disaster zone. Because the opportunities are so varied, the qualifications needed to work in the space industry also vary considerably.Some space-related jobs require technical or engineeringqualifications, others good science degrees. Severalcompanies operate apprenticeship schemes and graduatetraining programmes. ESA runs an internship programme for students and also takes on young graduate trainees. There are web links to help you find out more on the back of this leaflet. Science in space How many other jobs allow you to make new discoveriesabout the universe? The UK has scientists working onmissions to Mars, Venus, Saturn and Mercury. Achievementsover the last few years include the landing on Saturn's moon,Titan, the discovery of a frozen sea on Mars and dramaticclose-up pictures of the Sun. Research institutes and universities offer many opportunities, ranging from positions building instruments to explore otherworlds, to research posts investigating the galaxy around us.Many of those working in space science have a relevantdegree, and often a PhD. The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, University College London, The Open University, Imperial College and theUniversity of Leicester are some of the largest employers of space scientists but are by no means the only ones. 1 2 1 1.

SpaceI was always a bit of a space cadet!Astrophysics is a fascinating subject,but I also love flying, so planetaryscience was a compromise betweenthe scientist and the adventurer. Mission I work on Venus Express, a Europeanscience mission to our nearestplanetary neighbour, Venus. It carries sophisticated cameras andinstruments designed to investigatethe atmosphere at different heightsabove the surface. Venus Venus has evolved very differently to Earth in the past for reasons westill do not fully understand. Thesurface temperature, which is twiceas hot as a household oven, is causedby a runaway greenhouse effect.Understanding this effect will help usunderstand climate change on Earth.

EADS Astrium is the largest UK employer in these areas and is responsible for spacecraft such as the enormousInmarsat-4, one of the world's most advancedcommunications satellites. Engineers at EADS Astrium are currently working on Europe's first Mars Rover. Smaller companies such as Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) also design and manufacture spacecraft and instruments. SSTL has built the Disaster MonitoringConstellation of satellites which detect and monitor naturaland man-made disasters and environmental damage.Technology company, QinetiQ, is behind the development of TopSat, a small satellite that has produced remarkableimages of the Earth. Computer systems specialist,LogicaCMG, provides software and support systems forspacecraft. Other companies produce advanced instruments,components and software. Most companies offer training opportunities and several have schemes for new graduates. EADS Astrium runs anapprenticeship scheme to train skilled technicians andengineers. These companies also employ well qualifiedengineers, scientists and software developers. Using space Increasingly, space technology is being used to benefitpeople on Earth. There are lots of career opportunities in theareas of satellite communication, broadcast and navigation.With the development of broadband, digital broadcasting and 3G phone technology, many people are being employedin this rapidly growing sector. There are also opportunities in areas which use satellite data, for example in weatherforecasting, pollution monitoring and mapping. Many of the key companies, such as Inmarsat and Avanti Communications, are based in the UK. Careers range from satellite operations to marketing new technologies or developing new TV or satellite navigation services. The Met Office runs a placement scheme and there arecareers in climate science available at UK universities andresearch institutions. 1 2 1 21. The prototype ExoMars Rover under test in Tenerife.

There are ten Inmarsatsatellites in various orbits over the equator, at a distance of about36,000km from the Earth. Career I studied Telecoms and Aeronauticsat University. I joined Inmarsat for a five-month internship to complete my degree and have stayed for eightyears so far! Highlight 1 Relocation of the fleet of satellitesprovides me with a rare opportunity. I work independently and with peoplefrom different backgrounds. Workingwith specialists, and with some veryclever people, helps me to continueto learn through my job. Highlight 2 One of my most exciting roles was solutions manager for oursponsorship of the World RallyChampionship, in which Inmarsattechnology was used to maintaindata links for the race organisers and teams in remote locations.Career file: NameBen Boyse Job Mission Systems Engineer, EADSAstrium. Mission ExoMars Rover Project. This is aEuropean Space Agency (ESA)mission to explore the surface ofMars to search for evidence of life. Career At School I took Maths, Physics andElectronics A-levels to get into anengineering degree at University. I was surprised to find I didn't have to look very far to find a job and thereare companies like Astrium that offergraduate schemes with benefits likerotational placement opportunities. Highlight 1 I am fascinated with what is outsideof our planet. By working in the space industry, I get a chance to workon complex engineering projects that are not only very challenging,innovative and interesting, but alsohave the end goal of solving some of the questions I have been askingsince my childhood, like \"What is out there?\". Highlight 2 I get to play with a remote controlledsix-wheeled Mars Rover prototype,the size of a car, every day!
