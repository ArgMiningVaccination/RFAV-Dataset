Clinical Presentations of Influenza Case definition The spectrum of illness associated with influenza virus infections is wide, and ranges from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease, frequently associated with viral pneumonia. Theprevious experience of a population with antigenically related virus variants is a determinant of the severity of the disease. Therefore, with a pandemic strain, which would be new in the population, the anticipated clinical spectrum will be more severe . Age and pre-existing co-morbidities (Table 1) also influence the outcome. Young children, elderly adults, pregnantwomen, and individuals with chronic diseases are at greatest risk of complicatedinfluenza 77,151,78,71,79,80,1,183,158 . A general \"Clinical Case Definition\" for an influenza-like illness (ILI) and a review of recent literature describing the most common presentations and complications of influenza in adultsand children are given below. This is a general definition and applies mainly to the clinicalpresentation of interpandemic influenza; it may need modification once the pandemicoccurs 17,42,28,85,146,71,1,235,207,92 . Confirmed cases of influenza are cases with laboratory confirmation (i.e., virus isolation from respiratory tract secretions, identification of viral antigens or nucleic acid in therespiratory tract, or a significant rise in serum antibodies) or clinical cases with anepidemiological link to a laboratory confirmed case 59,77,151 . Forsurveillance purposes, the Health Canada definition of ILI is: Acute onset of respiratory illness with fever (>38 /c176C) and cough accompanied by one or more of the following: sore throat, arthralgia, myalgia or prostration, which could be dueto an influenza virus (used by FluWatch for the 2000-2001 season 67. For the 2001-2002 season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used the following case definition for surveillance in the USA (as of November 29, 2001): Temperature of >100 \u00b0F (>37.8 \u00b0C) and either cough or sore throat in the absence of a known cause30. Annex G /c45215 February 2004Clinical Case Definition : When influenza is circulating in the community, the presence of fever and cough of acute onset are good predictors of influenza. The positive predictive value increases when fever is higher than 38/c176C and when the onset of the clinical illness is acute (less than 48 hours after the prodromes). Other symptoms, such as sore throat, rhinoorhea, malaise, rigors or chills,myalgia and headache, although non-specific, may also be present.Pathogenesis of influenza The major site of infection by influenza viruses is the ciliated epithelial cell in the mucous layer of the respiratory tract. In the first few days after infection, necrosis of these cells and localedema occur, followed by infiltration by lympho cytes, plasma cells, histiocytes and polymorphonuclears. The incubation period may last 24h or up to 4-5 days (average of twodays), varying with the infecting virus, size of the viral inoculum, and immunological status ofthe individual. The infectious period starts, typically, one day before the symptoms appear,and lasts approximately five days after the onset of clinical illness 77,151,1 . This may be longer for children and elderly patients. Infectious virus has been recovered from respiratory secretions2-3 weeks after the onset of disease. Viral antigens have been detected in cells and secretionsfor several more days 21,183,135,70,29 . Asymptomatic carrier state, however, is not associated with influenza183. In uncomplicated influenza, repair starts 3-5 days after the beginning of symptoms; however, restoration of ciliated cells and mucous production are not restored until up to 15 days. Ifthere is secondary bacterial infection, the inflammatory destruction of the basal cell layer isgreater and the regeneration of the epithelia may take much longer 210,151 . Fatal cases of viral pneumonia have varying degrees of interstitial cellular infiltrate, alveolar edema, and hyalin membrane deposition. The virus also infects polymorphonuclear andmononuclear leucocytes, depressing their response to chemotactic stimuli and decreasingcellular functions (phagocytosis, proliferation, costimulation, etc.). This, together with thenecrosis and desquamation of the ciliated epithelial cells and the general distortion in mucussecretion, favours the development of bacterial pneumonia (or combined viral/bacterialpneumonia). Bacterial sinusitis and/or otitis media following influenza apparently resultthrough similar mechanisms 151,77,210 . The virus replicates throughout the respiratory tract and it is possible to recover infectious particles from the upper and lower tract of individuals naturally or experimentally infected withinfluenza 151,77,210 . The hemagglutinin of the virus (HA) binds to the receptor molecules of cells, while the neuraminidase (NA) facilitates release of viral particles, liquefying the mucoussecretions to promote access to new cells. At 1-2 days post infection, there is a peak in virusreplication, which decreases over the next 5-10 days. There is a direct correlation betweenvirus shedding and severity of disease, with higher titres and longer shedding, in severely illindividuals (up to 10 9in severe influenza pneumonia77,109. Children and elderly patients generally have high titres of virus in their secretions, and continue shedding viruses for longerperiods of time (8-13 days); promoting transmission 21,183,135,232 . In some patients, viral antigens may be detected in secretions and cells for prolonged periods, even when virusisolation is negative 151. Influenza viruses have been isolated from blood only on rare occasions153,118,179,178,179,176,151 ; however, it is possible to isolate the virus from the muscles of patients with rhabdomyositisand from other extrapulmonary sites in individuals with fatal influenza. Foetal transmission isalso possible 77,117,189,151 . It has been suggested that the virus may circulate in infected lymphocytes227,77. An increase in the number of leukocytes in blood is usually detected between days 1 and 3 after influenza infection, with a rise in neutrophils and a fall in lymphocytes. This lymphopeniaincludes T cells, B cells, and null cells 48,128. A recently described protein, encoded by some influenza A virus, is a candidate for inducing apoptosis of human monocytic cells with theCD8+T cell phenotype, and may be related to the high lethality of some strains 33. 216 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004The severity of clinical disease during an influenza pandemic is determined by the immunological status of the population and viral factors. For example, the cleavage of the HAmolecule in Influenza A, is critical in determining the virulence of two avian strains: the H5strain, which is very virulent, and the H7 strain, which is almost avirulent. In the less virulentstrains, proteases able to cleave the HA were present only in the respiratory andgastrointestinal tracts of poultry, thus limiting virus replication to these areas. Changes in theamino acid composition of the HA (as seen in H5 virions), rendered this protein cleavable bymore ubiquitous enzymes and allowed the virions to replicate systemically, causing ageneralized, fatal disease 210. A similar mechanism, i.e., high cleavability of the HA glycoprotein, has been suggested to explain the high human-lethality of H5N1 influenza Ainfections in Hong-Kong in 1997 95. Recently, a new viral protein, PB1-F2, was described in some avian influenza virus; this protein may be involved in the ability of avian H5N1 and H9N2influenza A virus to infect humans and cause disease 190,33. Following infection by influenza virus, antibodies are produced against four major components of the virion: HA (hemagglutinin), NA (neuraminidase), NP (the predominantprotein of the nucleocapsid), and M protein (matrix protein). Nevertheless, only antibodiesagainst HA and NA have been linked with resistance to infection by influenza 151. Anti-HA antibodies are the primary neutralizing antibodies and participate in complement-mediatedlysis of infected cells, aggregation of virions, and cell cytotoxicity. Anti-NA, on the other hand,reduce the number of new infectious units released from infected cells, and may reduce theseverity of disease and even prevent clinical illness if present in high titre. In nasal secretions, the neutralizing antibodies are predominantly IgA, but IgM and IgG are also secreted locally. Local antibodies are associated with resistance to infection and can bedetected for 3-5 months after illness. There is also local memory. B cells producing specific IgG, IgA, and IgM can be detected in peripheral blood of normal individuals and of subjects with influenza infection. The level of anti HA and anti NA antibodiesin blood has been associated with resistance to infection and with recovery from thedisease 41,151. A protective effect for maternally transmitted antibodies can be inferred from the relation existing between age in months of infants and symptomatic influenza, and issupported by studies measuring levels of maternal antibodies in cord serum 174. The replication of influenza viruses in a new host activates a cascade of inflammatory cytokines, which is followed by fever and by the symptoms of the disease. Nasal lavagespecimens from humans infected with influenza A contain 1 /c97and 1-/c98 /c49/c56/c55. Studies performed in volunteers with experimental infection and in patients with influenza A of less than 36 h of duration, showed that the levels of IL-6 and of TNF- /c97in upper respiratory secretions correlate directly with virus replication, fever, respiratory and systemic symptoms, and with an increase in respiratory secretions. High levels of IFN- /c103, on the other hand, were associated with an early decrease in viral titre109,97. IL-6 is a potent pyrogen that induces fever, chills and fatigue when administered to humans220, it is also involved in the initiation of the immune response to the virus109. TNF-/c97, on the other hand, correlates with fever but not with symptoms, and recent experiments demonstrated that it has potent anti-influenza activity109,187 . Very high levels of both cytokines, IL-6 TNF- /c97, were also found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy. In a study done in Japan, Il-6 levels wereused for diagnosis and prognosis of the course of the disease: the lower the level of IL-6, themilder the CNS participation. Values higher than 6,000 pg/mL were found in children withbrain stem dysfunction, about 150 pg/mL were present in children without brain stem Annex G /c45217 February 2004dysfunction and less than 80 pg/mL in controls; children with values higher than 15,000 pg/mL did not survive2. Human monocytes are highly susceptible to influenza A virus and die 24-48 hours after infection. Although the release of complete virus particles from these cells is very low, they secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF- /c97,I L - 1/c98, IL-6, d chemotactic factors responsible for the mononuclear infiltrate characteristic of influenzainfected tissues 115. In addition, secondary trigger signals, such as very small amounts of LPS (or other secondary bacterial products) could cause an excessive increase in cytokineproduction and secretion by the monocytes. This priming-triggering effect may beresponsible for the severe complications of secondary bacterial super-infections observedafter influenza A infections 115. It has been shown that H5N1 influenza viruses infecting humans in 1997 can avoid the antiviral activity exerted by TNF- /c97and by the interferons186. Post-mortem reports from two patients suggested that virus replication in the respiratory tract caused an increase in the levelof inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a reactive hemophagocytic syndrome that was themain cause of death. The authors propose that the synthesis of high levels of cytokines wasstimulated after the virus could escape their antiviral effect and continued to replicate 186. 1.1 Most Common Clinical Presentations 1.1.1 Adults The typical clinical presentation of uncomplicated influenza is tracheobronchitis with some small airway involvement. The onset of disease is usually abrupt: headache, chills and dry cough, followed by fever of 38-40 \u00b0C that may peak as high as 41 /c176C within the first 24 hours, together with myalgia, malaise, and anorexia. Physical signs include hot and moist skin,flushed face, injected eyes and clear nasal d ischarge. Some patients also have nasal obstruction, sneezing, pharyngeal inflamma tion, excessive tearing and mild cervical adenopathy 77,151,1,17,42,28,183,26,147,27,146 . Chest x-rays and auscultatory findings are usually normal, with occasional crackles and wheeze. In uncomplicated influenza, the airflow in largeairways remains relatively normal. There is, however, a transient increase in bronchialreactivity and some temporary alterations in gas exchanges in small peripheralairways 151,133,104 . Bronchial hyper reactivity may continue well beyond the clinical illness, even in subjects without a history of bronchospasm133. In uncomplicated influenza the fever usually declines after 2-3 days and disappears by the 6th day (median three days). Biphasic fever patterns are usually associated with secondarybacterial infections, but may be observed in some cases of uncomplicated influenza. Whilethe temperature declines, some respiratory symptoms, like cough and rhinorrhea, mayincrease, followed by the production of small amounts of, usually mucoid, sputum. Cough,weakness and fatigue can persist for 1 to 2 weeks and up to 6 weeks 77,151,1,17,42,28,183 . The disease is more severe in individuals younger than 5 years or older than 65 years1,183,12,13,193,195,196 . The risk of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is much higher in young children, smokers, geriatric patients and persons with underlying cardio-respiratorydisorders (most frequently asthma in younger patients and chronic bronchitis andemphysema in older persons 78,71,119,42,56,135,158,11,57,112 . Viral pneumonitis is most frequent in young children, while bacterial superinfection is common in the elderly. Streptococcus pneumoniae ,Haemophilus influenzae ,Moraxella catarrhalis , and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common agents of secondary bacterial pneumonia. Gram-negative bacteria, 218 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are also found in some patients77,78,80,130,140,16 . Different strains of influenza may be associated with different symptoms or severity of disease71,42,28 . Two influenza A subtypes: A (H1N1) and A (H3N2), and one influenza B strain, have been circulating worldwide in the last decade (with minor strain variations) and areassociated with yearly epidemics. Influenza A (H3N2) is frequently associated with moresevere clinical diseases and pneumonia 71,76,135,42,158,11,196,122 . It affects young and old equally, and accounts for up to 28% of acute cardiopulmonary hospitalizations of older persons135,11. Focal outbreaks in nursing homes are usually caused by A (H3N2) viruses56,102,9 . Influenza A (H1N1), on the other hand, infects children every year but has only a minor impact in theelderly, and influenza B preferentially causes disease in children, with frequent gastrointestinalsymptoms 135,11,26,69,195 . During the 2001-2002 season, a new subtype, influenza A (H1N2) was isolated in several countries. These new viruses resulted from gene reassortment between the circulating A(H1N1) and A (H3N2) viruses. Because both viral proteins were similar to the homologousantigens in the circulating strains and in the vaccine strains, the new viruses did not causemore severe illness or higher influenza activity in this season 32. Human infections by influenza A (H5N1) were first detected in Hong Kong in 1997, where six of 18 patients admitted to hospital died42,35,235 . These infections were characterized by a high case-fatality rate, a high incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in adults, and a high rate ofpulmonary, renal, hepatic and haematologic complications in patients without previouslyidentified high risk conditions 42,235,95 . Influenza C viruses are usually associated with mild illnesses, which are sometimes asymptomatic. For that reason, virus isolation has not been performed regularly, and thespectrum of diseases produced by influenza C is not well characterized. Studies in Japan found temperatures of 38-40 /c176C for 2-3 days in young children, who also had coryza and cough lasting for a period of 2 weeks in up to 50% of the patients 183,114 . Adults had similar but milder symptoms, and complained mainly of malaise, sore throat and headache. In anotherstudy, however, the symptoms reported in young adults were as severe as those associatedwith influenza A infection and lasted longer 51. Only influenza A has been associated with pandemics, however interpandemic epidemics can be attributed to both A and B viruses42,75,151 . Although almost all deaths related to annual epidemics of influenza occur in the elderly or in the very young, and approximately 90% of excess deaths during epidemics occur amongpersons older than 65 years 12,122, in pandemic periods, adults younger than 65 years have accounted for 50% of the deaths193. For example, nearly half of the influenza-related deaths during the 1918-1919 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic occurred in the 20-40 years olds. Most ofthe deaths during the 1968-1969 influenza A (H3N2) pandemic occurred in adults 45-65years old (half of them were previously healthy and without any detectable co-morbidillness 192,193 , and a large proportion of influenza-related deaths during the 1957-1958 influenza A (H2N2) pandemic occurred among persons younger than 65 years85,193,195,122,196 . 1.1.2 Children Children have the highest rates attack rates of influenza, and are the major disseminators of the virus192. In a regular \"influenza season\", influenza infections are the most important causes of consultation in outpatient clinics and account for one half of lower respiratory tractinfections that result in hospitalizations of children 80,183. During most influenza epidemics, Annex G /c45219 February 2004influenza viruses supplant all other major respiratory viruses as causes for consultation for respiratory infection in children80,183,205 . The highest rate of influenza-related serious illness in children occurs in the 6-12 months old age group, after the waning of maternal antibodies183,192,82 . Although uncomplicated influenza in children may be similar to the disease in adults, there are some age related differences intoddlers and infants 77,151,1,147 : 1)Young children usually develop higher temperatures (over 39.5 /c176C) and may have febrile seizures151,80,233,21,42 . 2) Unexplained fever can be the only manifestation of the disease in neonates and infants151,80,233,21,119,170,29,110,7,18 . 3) Influenza viruses are an important cause of laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), pneumonia and pharyngitis-bronchitis in young children. Both types, A and B, aresignificant causes of low respiratory tract infections 151,78,80,76,233,21,119,170,183 . 4) Gastrointestinal manifestations, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, are found in 40-50% of patients, with an inverse relation to age (mainly in 3 years oldor younger) 151,170,42,183 . 5) Otitis media and non-purulent conjunctivitis are more frequent in young ages151,233,21,119,170,36,101 . 6) A variety of central nervous system findings, including apnea, opisthotonos and seizures may appear in as many as 20% of the infants183. Children may also present with symptoms suggestive of meningitis, e.g., headache, vomiting, irritability andphotophobia 77,171. 7) Myositis is a complication in young children, especially after infection with influenza B.In children over 5 years and adolescents the most frequent symptoms are fever, cough, non-localized throbbing headache, chills, myalgia and sneezing. The fever is usually in the 38-40/c176C range and a second peak, without bacterial superinfection, may occur around the fourth day of illness. Backache, sore throat, conjunctival burning with watery eyes andepistaxis may be present, but gastrointestinal symptoms are infrequent. Chest auscultation isusually normal, but occasionally coarse breath sounds and crackles may be heard 183. Respiratory illness caused by influenza is non-specific and difficult to distinguish from illness caused by other respiratory pathogens on the basis of symptoms alone. Many viral infections(respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], parainfluenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus), as well as otherpyrexial diseases, can cause an illness that is clinically indistinguishable frominfluenza 183,135,219,191,161 . 1.1.3 Special Populations: High-risk Conditions (Table 1) The Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) considers the following groups to be at \"increased risk for complications from influenza\"152: Adults and children with chronic cardiac or pulmonary disorders (including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis and asthma) severe enough to requireregular medical follow-up or hospital care . Chronic cardiac and pulmonary disorders are by far the most important risk factors for influenza-related death. 220 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004People of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities . Such residents often have one or more of the medical conditions outlined in the first group. In addition, their institutional environment may promote spread of the disease. People /c17965 years of age . The risk of severe illness and death related to influenza is moderately increased in healthy people in this age group, but is not as great as in peoplewith chronic underlying disease. Adults and children with chronic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases, cancer, immunodeficiency, immunosuppression (due tounderlying disease and/or therapy), renal disease, anemia, and hemoglobinopathy . Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for influenza infection, morbidity andmortality. Influenza may result in significant morbidity and mortality among HIV-infectedindividuals. Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) with conditions treated for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid (e.g., Kawasaki disease, juvenile rheumatoidarthritis, acute rheumatic fever, and others 59. This therapy might increase the risk of Reye's syndrome after influenza. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the CDC in the USA also include as \"persons most susceptible to complications or death from influenza\": \"Women who will be in the second or third trimester of pregnancy during the influenza season (fall or winter)1,29. \"Children younger than 2 years of age\"29. The CDC also include people /c17950 year old rather than /c179recommended by NACI29 1.1.3.1 Pregnant women Women with influenza infection in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy are at increased risk of hospitalization for cardio-respiratory disorders158,159,40 . This is probably due to the increase in heart rate, stroke volume, and oxygen consumption observed in thesemonths, as well as to decreases in lung capacity and changes in immunologicalfunction 1,123,144,189,120 . Fatal influenza in pregnant women is characterized by the rapid development of cardiovascular and/or pulmonary insufficiency after several days of classicalILI. Fulminating viral or bacterial pneumonia may follow the initial viral infection 123,144,189,120 .I n some cases the virus has been isolated from the offspring86. An increase in mortality of pregnant women, miscarriages, premature births and stillbirths was documented during the 1918-1919 and the 1957-1958 pandemics42,94,231,86,144,224 . The reported mortality rate of pregnant women admitted to hospital with influenza in 1918 was51.4% compared with 33.3% in hospitalized influenza patients from the generalpopulation 94,231. Mortality rates among these hospitalized women were higher if pneumonia was present, with a peak at 61% during the last month of gestation94,231,144,42 . Influenza deaths in pregnant women represented 50% of all deaths in women of childbearing age, and 10% ofdeaths from influenza during the epidemics of 1957-1958 in New York City andMinnesota 86,72. These women experienced illness lasting 1-10 days and died from respiratory insufficiency associated with pulmonary edema and pneumonia (bacterial and/or viral). Areview of 30 deaths from pneumonia and influenza in pregnant women in Massachusettsbetween 1954 and 1974 showed more fatalities towards the last trimester and earlypuerperium (no deaths occurred in the first trimester), and the risk was higher with increasing Annex G /c45221 February 2004maternal age189. Only four of the thirty women who died had underlying medical pulmonary or cardiac conditions. During 17 inter-pandemic influenza seasons159the relative risk for hospitalization for selected cardio-respiratory conditions among pregnant women increased more than three timesbetween weeks 14-20 and weeks 37-42 of gestation. The respective increased rates ofhospitalization were 1.4 and 4.7 compared with women who were 1-6 months postpartum.Women in their third trimester of pregnancy were hospitalized at a rate comparable with thatof non-pregnant women who had high-risk medical conditions (i.e., 250/100,000 pregnantwomen 159. 1.1.3.2 Elderly adults in long-term facilities Excess hospitalization and death, and functional decline, occur in elderly individuals after epidemics of influenza. Community dwelling adults 65 years of age or older, and particularlyfrail elderly in long-term care institutions, are at increased risk of influenzacomplications 56,10,65,8,58,57,13,12,102,196 . Although influenza pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia following influenza are considered the main causes of influenza related hospitalization in the elderly, many influenza relatedhospitalizations are attributed to the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease orcongestive heart failure following the viral infection 56,11. The symptoms and signs seen in older adults are similar to those in younger individuals, but most cases are characterized by the presence of dyspnea, wheezing, sputum production, and temperatures of 38 /c176C56,207. In addition, any unexplained acute deterioration in health status associated with fever, may be a manifestation of influenza infection in elderly individuals11. Influenza-like illness in older adults can also be caused by other viruses, mainly RSV or parainfluenza. RSV infections are an important cause of hospitalization and death of elderlyindividuals and it is impossible to distinguish between RSV and influenza on the basis ofclinical manifestations alone 56,135,11,65,57,219 . 1.1.4 Preexisting co-morbidity 1.1.4.1 Respiratory Patients with chronic pulmonary conditions constitute the largest high-risk group, and the exacerbation of pulmonary diseases is the most frequent cause of hospitalization after influenza infection77,151,78,1,79,158 . Among children and young adults ( /c6035 years), asthma is the most common co-morbidity requiring hospitalization for complicated influenza; emphysemaand COPD predominate in individuals older than 45 years, and chronic bronchitis is observedin all ages 160,77,208,78,93 . Clinical studies have shown that influenza can trigger wheezing episodes in children with asthma77,78. A decrease in mucociliary clearance and phagocytic function (with the consequent reduction in local defences and local immunity) are frequentlyobserved after influenza infection, and can be particularly severe in patients with chronicbronchitis or COPD 93,155. 1.1.4.2 Cardiovascular In several population studies, cardiac disorders were the most common co-morbidity reported as a cause of death in influenza patients78,158,13,93,162,154 . Deaths attributed to heart disease increase during the peak period of culture positive influenza, and precede by twoweeks the peaks of pneumonia and influenza deaths 81. 222 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Although pre-existing cardiovascular pathology is the most frequent cause of death in individuals older than 65 years, serious and sometimes fatal myocarditis may be acomplication of influenza infection in otherwise healthy people 93,154. 1.1.4.3 Diabetes Individuals 25 to 64 years old with diabetes were 3.7- 4.0 times more likely than those without diabetes to have pneumonia and influenza as a cause of death during influenza seasons216.I n addition, individuals 65 years old or older with diabetes were twice as likely to die frompneumonia and influenza than their non-diabetic counterparts 216. The elevated morbidity and mortality attributed to influenza in diabetics is expected, given the high risk of complicationsfrom respiratory infections in this group 158,74,216,124, 46,136 . Mechanisms of defence like phagocytosis and intracellular killing may be decreased in these patients46.Staphylococcus aureus andStreptococcus pneumoniae are the most frequent causes of bacterial infection. In addition, combinations of risk factors increase mortality rates exponentially, and diabetes isfrequently associated with secondary cardiac and/or pulmonary diseases and with immuneimpairment 46. Influenza infection may also provoke severe metabolic deterioration and ketoacidosis in diabetic patients, increasing the risks for complications of the diabetes46.93,54 . 1.1.4.4 Immunocompromised patients and patients with HIV Influenza virus infections in immunosuppressed individuals and transplant recipients may be similar to the immunocompetent population. However, an extended clinical course andprolonged shedding of virus is more common in these patients, as well as more severe, lifethreatening, diseases 132,184,14,55,141,134,180,221 . Persons Infected with HIV : Influenza in AIDS patients is prolonged and more frequently associated with complications184,14,55,175 . In a cohort of young and middle-aged women HIV infected, the risk for cardiopulmonary hospitalization was higher during influenzaseasons than during the peri-influenza periods. This risk was even higher than for womenwith other high-risk conditions, like chronic heart and lung diseases 158. Influenza-associated excess mortality was found for the adult and adolescent USpopulation with AIDS during three influenza seasons. Among persons aged 25-54 years,the risk for influenza-related death was estimated at 9.4-14.6/10,000 persons with AIDScompared with 0.09-0.10/10,000 in the general population, and 6.4-7.0/10,000 forpersons older than 65 years 132. Deaths of AIDS patients due to pneumonia and influenza followed a seasonal pattern (and also a virus isolation pattern) with peaks inDecember-January, as in the general adult population. More than 90% of AIDS deathsoccurred in the 25-54 years age group. The excess death rate in this age group was81-155 times higher in AIDS patients than for the general US population in this agerange, compared with the summer. These death rates are comparable and even higherthan those seen in the general population 65 years or older 132. Other studies reported that AIDS patients experience more severe respiratory symptoms and prolongedduration of illness with an increased risk of complications 184,14,55,141 . Immunocompromised children : No prospective studies of influenza in immunosuppressed children or in children with AIDS have been published. It is known,however, that children with HIV commonly have severe and persistent viral respiratoryinfections, including influenza. Children with cancer receiving immunosuppressivetherapy had similar clinical manifestations to control populations, but the duration of thedisease was longer 183,134,180 . In a study of transplant recipients, two of 19 patients Annex G /c45223 February 2004developed severe infections, one child died and the second was febrile for 21 days with persistent virus isolation in respiratory secretions183,134,180 . 1.1.4.5 Other chronic illnesses, neoplastic diseases, renal diseases, etc. Any patient suffering from a chronic disease that compromises the immune and/or metabolic homeostasis (other than the mentioned above) may develop complications of influenza.These include neoplastic diseases, renal diseases, hemoglobinopathies, some congenitaldiseases, and illnesses due to autoimmunity 183,61,116,134,64 . 1.2 Complications of Influenza (Tables 2 and 3) Influenza can exacerbate underlying medica l conditions (e.g., pulmonary or cardiac disease), lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia, or cause primary viralpneumonia 77,151,1,13,193,195,196,194,81 . Influenza infection has also been associated . Hospitalization rates for children aged 0-4 years ranged from approximately 100/100,000 for those withouthigh-risk conditions to 500/100,000 individuals, for those with high-risk conditionsrespectively 78,160. Hospitalization rates are highest among children younger than 1 year of age and adults older than 65 years1,160,106,96 . Since the influenza A (H3N2) virus pandemic in 1968, influenza-associated hospitalizations have been highest during epidemics caused by type A(H3N2) viruses195,196 . Influenza-related deaths during influenza epidemics can result from pneumonia as well as from exacerbationsof cardiopulmonary conditions and other chronic diseases. Older adults account for >90% ofdeaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza 1,193,10,65,8,58,57,13,12 . Sudden deaths have also been observed during influenza epidemics167,68,171 . 1.2.1 Lower respiratory tract complications Involvement of the respiratory tract is found in 10% of cases in individuals 5-50 years old and up to 73% after 70 year of age210. Three different syndromes of severe pneumonia have been described as influenza-associated complications in adults and children (Table 3). Additionalpresentations of viral and/or bacterial respiratory tract infection are also seen frequentlyduring interpandemic outbreaks of influenza (Table 2). a)Primary viral pneumonia: This is actually a manifestation of the disease at the more severe end of the spectrum 77,151,183 . It occurs mainly in high-risk patients, although 25% of reported cases are in young healthy individuals, and 13% in healthy pregnant women. Primary viralpneumonia develops abruptly following the onset of influenza illness and progresseswithin 6 to 24 hr to a severe pneumonia with tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, high fever (>39-40/c176C) and hypotension. The illness may progress to hypoxemia and death in 1-4 days. Frothy haemoptysis, tachypnea and cyanosis are poor prognostic signs. Clinical, physiological and laboratory findings are not specific. Bilateral crepitant inspiratory crackles are frequent, as well as mottled densities and diffuse symmetricalinterstitial infiltrates or areas of consolidation in the X-rays. The presence of cavitations orpleural infiltrates, suggests bacterial superinfection. The pathology reveals interstitialpneumonitis with severe hyperaemia, broadening of the walls of with intraalveolar haemorrhage and and capilla ry dilatation and thrombosis. Autopsy specimens have high virus titres. Nonfatal cases recover 5 to16 days after theonset of pneumonia, but require up to 4 months for resolution of the x-rays and residuallung damage is frequent 77,151,183 . Milder forms of influenza viral pneumonia involving only one lobe or segment have been described (Table 3). This \"localized viral pneumonia\" is less serious than the primarypneumonia described above and is frequently confused with pneumonia due toMycoplasma pneumoniae 210. b)Combined viral-bacterial pneumonia This is three times more common than viral pneumonia, from which it may be clinically indistinguishable. The symptoms usually appear later; chest x-rays frequently showcavitations or pleural effusion. The diagnosis requires isolation of pathogenic bacteria inthe sputum or pleural fluid and the radiological findings. The most frequent agents are:Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus orHaemophilus influenzae . Mortality of viral or combined viral-bacterial pneumonia is ~10-12%. Some strains ofStaphylococcus aureus have a synergistic effect with the virus and increasedpathogenicity 77,151. Decreased leukocyte chemotaxis and tracheobronchial clearance increases the severity of bacterial infections and may lead to the development of fatalpneumonia and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in healthy young individuals. c)Secondary bacterial pneumonia After initial improvement from viral infection (~ 4 days), the patient develops chills, pleuritic chest pain, increased productive cough and purulent or bloody sputum. Chestx-rays reveal local areas of consolidation and leukocytosis is common. The fatality rate isabout 7%. These patients are more often elderly and have chronic diseases (i.e.,pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, etc.). Gram staining and culture of sputum . d)Other pulmonary complications children, pneumonia is less common, although bronchitis or bronchiolitis may also occur as manifestations of influenza infection. It may be difficult to distinguish influenzafrom RSV or parainfluenza infections. Croup associated with influenza A seems to bemore severe, but less frequent than after parainfluenza or RSV 210. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is frequent seen with influenza infection and can result in permanent loss of function, mainly in elderlypatients. Other diseases exacerbated by the virus are asthma and cysticfibrosis 148,210,131,62,208 . 1.2.2 Otitis media and conjunctivitis Any viral or bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract, including influenza A and B, increases the likelihood of otitis media in children36,101. Influenza A and B may cause otitis media either by direct viral invasion or by predisposing to bacterial superinfection. Little isknown about influenza conjunctivitis, but the virus has been isolated from the conjunctiva insome patients 77,125. Annex G /c45225 February 20041.2.3 Cardiovascular Sudden death of young patients has been reported after influenza myocarditis or pericarditis, probably due to arrhythmia167. Even though influenza primarily involves the respiratory system, 43% of patients with confirmed influenza A had transient electrocardiographicchanges in one community with epidemic disease 167,218 . During the Asian pandemic in 1957, one third of fatal cases with autopsies had signs of focal or diffuse myocarditis. In a case study of nine patients with influenza-like symptoms and serological conversion for influenza A, cardiac involvement with increasing dyspnea was found after 4-7 days postinfection 169. The ECG and echocardiography showed abnormalities and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were increased. Two of the patients had fulminant myocarditis and a thirdpatient died of pneumonia. The remaining six patients returned to normal left ventricularfunction. Theories explaining the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis include direct invasion of the cardiac muscle, autoimmune mechanisms, or vascular damage 167. In some cases of myocarditis, the virus could be grown from heart tissue167,176,53 . The most frequent finding in adults, however, is the aggravation of pre-existing cardiac pathologies. Atrial fibrillation is common in olderpatients, and myocardial infarction may occur following influenza infection 162,154 . 1.2.4 Central Nervous System (CNS) Influenza infection of the CNS has been associated with a wide spectrum of manifestations, from drowsiness and irritability to seizures and severe coma. Two specific syndromes havebeen described: a sometimes-fatal encephalopathy occurring at the disease, andoccasional postinfluenzal encephalitis, seen 2-3 weeks after recovery. There is high incidence of serious neurologic manifestations in children in Japan, that has not been observed in other countries 43,188,66,103,73,142 . In 5 influenza seasons in this country, 64 infants and children were identified with influenza-related encephalitis or encephalopathy.Forty-three percent of these children died and 20% had neurological sequellae 43. Generalized vasculopathy was found in an autopsy. Another study identified 217 cases of encephalo-pathy/encephalitis in children in an epidemics of A H3N2 in Japan, 82.5% were younger than6 years. Some of these cases were associated with acute necrotizing encephalopathy 43,113. Another complication associated with influenza is Reye's syndrome: acute encephalopathy with fatty micro-infiltration of the liver and liver failure. It has been described in children andadolescents younger than 18 years of age (most commonly in the 4-12 year range) withinfluenza and receiving acetylsalicylic acid (also after acetylsalicylic acid administration tochildren with chickenpox or other viral diseases). It is rare in adults 15,105,129,151,5 . The classic presentation is a change in mental status, ranging from lethargy to delirium, seizures andrespiratory arrest. The most frequent laboratory abnormality is the elevation of ammonia inblood, seen in almost all patients. As death is usually due to cerebral edema, loweringintracranial pressure is the most effective treatment. The recognition of the association of thissyndrome with the use of acetylsalicylic acid lead to the recommendation for the use of otheragents to manage children with influenza, and to a decrease in the number of cases. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and myelitis have also been reported after influenza infections, but epidemiological studies supporting a causal association are lacking 66,103,77,185 . 226 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20041.2.5 Muscular system Acute rhabdomyolisis, with tender leg muscles and elevated serum CK occurs most frequently in children with influenza B infections; but it is also observed, occasionally, in adultsor after influenza A infections. The course is usually benign, but sometimes-severemyonecrosis and myoglobinuria may lead to acute, occasionally fatal, renal failure. Influenzaviruses have been recovered from affected muscles of some patients 117,145,47,151,150,234,45,182 . 1.2.6 Systemic: Toxic shock syndrome Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is characterized by fever, hypotension, erythroderma followed by desquamation, and multiorgan failure. This syndrome is associated mainly with infections byStaphylococcus aureus and the production of an exotoxin (TSST-1or exotoxin B); group A Streptococcus may also be involved. TSS was originally associated with cutaneous and subcutaneous infections, and with menstruating and postpartum women. A link withpost-influenza complications in previously healthy children and adults was found recently,after outbreaks of influenza A and B. The supposed pathogenic mechanism is a change in thecolonization and replication of S. aureus (patients may be asymptomatic carriers of S. aureus ) facilitated by the influenza infection. The patient may develop staphylococcal tracheitis orpneumonia and only a superficial infection of the tracheobronchial tree is required for thedevelopment of TSS 199,138 . 1.2.7 Other Another complication that has been related to influenza infection is the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), but a usal relationship has not been demonstrated236,49,225,19,156 .

Patient Management I 2.1 Initial Assessment Management The algorithms shown in this chapter were designed to be used by healthcare staff and also by volunteers with minimal triaging experience to identify influenza patients who present to thehealth clinics, doctor's offices, emergency rooms, temporary emergency services, or otherinfluenza triaging centres. Assuming that there will be a large number of cases and limitedresources during a pandemic, the assessment guidelines are intended to evaluate the needsof each individual, and triage influenza patients efficiently in a crisis situation. Triage personnelwill decide when patients can be managed in an ambulatory setting, redirected home, sent toan alternate care site, or admitted to an acute care hospital. Two algorithms are included in this chapter, one for adults and adolescents (Section 2.1), and a second for children (Section 2.2). There is no clear age limit for the use of these algorithms.Depending on the age of the patient, place of consultation, and on the number of cases ofinfluenza in a given community, young children and adolescents may be seen by personnelspecialized in childcare or by the same staff and volunteers who assess the adult population.Nevertheless, influenza can be more severe in youngsters, and different criteria should beused to judge the seriousness of the illness in children (Section 2.2). Healthy seniors living in the community can be evaluated as other adults (Section 2.1). Nevertheless, elderly individuals are also at increased risk for complications of influenza andthose over 65 years of age should be monitored closely (see Chapter 1). Management of patients/residents in long-term care facilities is discussed in Chapter 3. Because of their age and/or underlying medical condition, most individuals living in long-termcare facilities are at increased risk for developing complications after influenza infection. In apandemic situation it is expected that long-term care residents will remain in the long termcare facility for treatment. These algorithms were designed mainly for urban centres that have a variety of health resources as well as alternative sources of assistance. See Chapter 6 for assessmentrecommendations tailored to the health care resources found in rural and isolatedcommunities. 230 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Triage of adults ( /c17918 years) Annex G /c45231 February 2004Triage Centre : Doctors office Walk-in clinicOther1 ' Local triage centre : Non-traditional andCommunity centres1 Hospital Emergency Department1 1 Symptoms consistent able 2-1-1)Assessnon-flu area Reassess PhoneVisit4Initial Clinical Needs further assessment Pneumonia, no co-morbidity Functional impairment (unable to cope) Evaluation not definitivePneumonia & Co-morbidity Acute confusionMetabolic derangementRespiratory failureAcute illness 2 3 Stable Co-morbidity2 3Legend: 1) Triage centres may be located at doctor's offices, clinics, and in non-traditional (NT) sites such as schools, churches, community centres, military field hospitals, etc. Whenpossible, hospitals should assign a special \"emergency\" area for the triage, secondaryassessment and treatment of influenza patients, avoiding the passage of these patientsthrough the regular Emergency Department. 2) Stable: Patient with ILI but without abnormalities meeting the criteria for secondary assessment (Table 2.1.2). 3) Co-morbidity: /c17965 yr pregnancy chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, asthma) congestive heart failure renal failure immunosuppression (due to underlying disease or therapy) haematological abnormalities (anemia, haemaglobinopathies) diabetes hepatic disease socially unable to cope (i.e., without personal support at home, such patients mayneed an alternative centre of care). An alternate care arrangement may also beconsidered if a high-risk individual lives in the same household as the influenzapatient. Patients on long-term acetylsalicylic acid therapy (increased risk of Reye'ssyndrome). 4) Neighbourhoods should develop local plans for the support, assessment and control of influenza patients at home (e.g., \"Flu-block\" watch). Some individuals may not be able toself-care at home and will therefore need community support or an alternate care centre.When possible, individuals from the same household should be kept together. 5) In addition to providing sub-acute care, some local NT sites may be able to handle patients more critically ill (Please see Non-traditional Site Guideline, Annex J). 232 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Symptoms consistent with flu like illness Adults ((18 years) a)Systemic Fever Chills Headache Aching muscles and joints Stiffness Weakness b)Respiratory Cough Sore throat Hoarseness Stuffy or runny nose Shortness of breath (patients with influenza and shortness of breath should undergo chest radiography) Chest symptoms: thoracic pain when taking a deep breath, retrosternal trachealpain, pleuritic pain (see legend of Table 2.1.2) Red and/or watery eyes Earache c)Digestive (seen mainly in children and elderly) Vomiting Diarrhoea Abdominal pain d)Neurological Confusion, drowsiness Convulsions Symptoms suggestive of meningitis (mainly in children) Annex G /c45233 February 2004Clinical Case Definition : When influenza is circulating in the community, the presence of fever and cough of acute onset are good predictors of influenza. The positive predictive value increases when fever is higher than 38/c176C and when the onset of clinical illness is acute (less than 48 hours after the prodromes). Other symptoms, such as sore throat, rhinorrhea, malaise, rigors or chills,myalgia and headache may also be present. Any case definitions developed prior to thepandemic may need to be modified once the pandemic occurs. A history of contact withanother patient with influenza-like illness or with an influenza case confirmed by the laboratoryshould be sought. If present, it is of diagnostic value.Initial influenza illness assessment ( /c17918 years) Primary Assessment Results Requiring Secondary Assessment Temperaturea/c16335\u00b0C or/c17939\u00b0C Pulse New arrhythmia (irregular pulse) >100 beats/min (if /c17916 years) Blood pressure /c163100 systolic Dizziness on standing Respiratory rate /c17924/minute (tachypnea) Skin colour (lips, hands) CyanosisChest signs or symptoms b Any abnormality on auscultation or chest pain Mental status New confusionc Function New inability to function independentlyc Persistent vomiting ( /c1792-3 times/24 hr.)d Oxygen saturatione/c16390% room air aFor indications about types of thermometers and how to take the temperature see Appendix 2.I. High fever ( /c179 39/c176C) in adults or in adolescents needs further assessment. bChest pain should always be investigated because it may be a sign of pneumonia (chest pain on inspiration), or may be a sign of cardiac failure. It may also appear as retrosternal pain (tracheal/bronchial pain) or as a pleuriticpain. When positive, it is an indication for secondary evaluation. cA deterioration in level of consciousness or inability to function independently compared with previous functional status should be further investigated, particularly in elderly patients. dVomiting ( /c1792-3 times/24 hr.), particularly in elderly patients, requires further assessment. eDetermination of blood gases by pulse oximetry as sign of respiratory failure (see Appendix 2.III) If no abnormality and no co-morbidities are found: home with instructions for self-care (2.1.4 and Appendix 2.I). If no abnormality, with instructions for self-care (2.1.4 andAppendix 2.I) and with reassessment send to non-hospital domicile.Follow-up. Co-morbidities: >65 yr, pregnancy, chronic lung disease, renalfailure, immunocompromised, haematological a bnormalities, diabetes, neoplastic disease, hepatic diseases, socially unable to cope (i.e., non supportive household). If secondary assessment is required, and the patients are sent to another centre/ward forcomplementary evaluation (see 2.1.3) each individual should be provided with a summaryof the clinical/laboratory data. Some triage centres may have the facilities to performsecondary assessment and treatment without transferring patients. 234 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Secondary influenza illness assessment ( /c17918 years) When the patient's secondary assessment has to be completed in a different setting, a new clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis at the primary triage centre should precedelaboratory studies. Not all the tests mentioned below will be needed for all patients, and clinicalassessment should determine which procedures are done, particularly if resources are scarce: Complementary laboratory studies Results requiring supervision or admission CBC (core battery, if appropriate)aHgb/c16380 with severe pain) CK /c1791,000/c109/L Blood saturation /c16390% room air Chest x-ray (CXR)a Abnormal, consistent with pneumonia or with congestive heart failure EKG (clinical criteria) Evidence of ischemia, new arrhythmia aUnder optimal circumstances, blood work and CXR should be obtained before admission. If resources are limited, priority should be given to patients with co-morbidity or suspected complications (i.e., pneumonia,etc.). Patients with normal gases and normal chest auscultation do not need CXR. Likewise, when the clinicaldiagnosis of pneumonia is unquestionable and the resources are scarce, no CXR need to be taken unless thereis suspicion of a complication of the pneumonia (i.e., empyema). If antibiotics are limited, however, CXR maybe indicated to confirm pneumonia before prescribing any drug. Conversely, if pneumonia is suspected but theradiology resources are limited, antibiotics may be prescribed without radiological confirmation. bAn increase in the number of circulating neutrophil-bands (i.e., immature neutrophils, with an elongated, non-segmented nucleus) suggests bacterial infection. Mean normal values of bands are 12.4% (range9.5-15.3%) 229. In a typical acute bacterial infection, the ratio bands/segmented neutrophils may go up to values of 16-17%228. Annex G /c45235 February 2004Microbiologic Diagnostic tests Microbiologic diagnostic tests (bacteriologic and/or virologic) may be appropriate for secondary assessment. They will be performed depending on the clinical presentation andavailability of resources. Once the pandemic strain is confirmed in a community, virologictests will be needed only to confirm diagnosis in atypical cases and for surveillance purposes.Rapid tests are useful for diagnostic and treatment decisions (see Appendix 5.II). Isolation andculture of the virus is needed for surveillance purposes. Ideally, purulent sputum will be analysed by Gram staining and culture to identify infecting bacteria and their susceptibility. In a pandemic, these studies should be reserved for patientsadmitted to hospitals, especially those in intensive care or those failing initial antibiotictherapy. If culture is not possible, Gram staining should be attempted. Ideally, blood cultures should be obtained prior to antibiotic therapy in patients with pneumonia. If resources are scarce, blood cultures will be reserved for patients who are veryill, with toxic signs and low blood pressure; for patients who fail to recover after 48 hours oftreatment with antibiotics; or for patients admitted to intensive care units.

The classic presentation is a change in mental status, ranging from lethargy to delirium, seizures and respiratory arrest.The recognition of the association of this syndrome with the use of acetyl salicylic acid to treat viral symptoms,lead to the recommendation for the use of other agents and a decrease in the number of cases. The province of Alberta developed a self-care plan for the management at home of uncomplicated cases of influenza200. It has been developed for interpandemic influenza and will be evaluated during the 2002-2003 influenza season. Appendix 2.I. is a summary of thisplan, which has been adapted to be used nationwide, and in a pandemic. Annex G /c45237 February 20042.2 Pediatric Triage This algorithm was designed to help medical and healthcare staff, as well as lay persons with minimal knowledge and experience, to manage children with influenza-like illness during apandemic. Triage centres may be located at the doctor's offices, clinics, hospitals, and innon-traditional care settings (schools, churches, community centres, military field hospitals,etc). The numbers in each of the following boxes refer to sections within this document whereadditional information can be found. 238 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Primary triage centre Danger signs present (2-2-3) Assessment forCo-morbidity(no signs LRTI)(2-2-6) illness (ARI,107) (i.e., one respiratory symptom and fever) Systemic: Fever (/c17938/c176C core temperature) Apnea Respiratory symptoms: Cough, Nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea (second most common presentation), Difficulty breathing (including chest retractions, stridor, etc.) Fast breathing* (tachypnea) Hoarse voice Earache *Definitions of fast breathing (tachypnea)222 < 2 months = >60 breaths per minute 2-12 months = >50 breaths per minute> 12 months to 5 years = >40 breaths per minute> 5 year s=>3 0 breaths per minute Associated non-respiratory symptoms: Not feeling well, malaise Low energy, lethargic Not playing, Needing extra care Poor feeding Vomiting, diarrhoea Irritability, excessive crying, fussy Annex G /c45239 February 2004The most common presentation of influenza in children is fever and cough of sudden onset. The term ARI is preferred for children since most distinguishing features in adults are notcharacteristic in children until the second decade. Young infants (less than 2 months old) canbecome ill and progress to severe illness rapidly. They are much less likely to cough withpneumonia and frequently have only non-specific signs such as poor feeding, apnea, and feveror low body temperature.Initial influenza illness assessment (<18 years) Primary Assessment Results Requiring Secondary Assessment Temperaturea/c163/c32/c51/c53/c176 Co r/c179/c32/c519\u00b0C Respiratory rate < 2 months = >60 breaths per minute 2-12 months = >50 breaths per minute> 12 months to 5 years = >40 breaths per minute> 5 year s=>3 0 breaths per minute Skin colour and temperature (lips, hands) Cyanosis, sudden pallor, cold legs up to the kneeChest signs and symptoms b(pain may be difficult to detect in young children)Chest indrawing, wheezing, grunting, inquire for chest pain Mental status Lethargic or unconscious, confusedc Function Unable to breastfeed or drink, persistent vomiting (>2-3 times/24 hr.)d Inability to function independentlyc Neurologic symptoms and signs Convulsions, full fontanelle, stiff neck, photophobia Oxygen saturatione/c163/c32/c570% room air a For indications about types of thermometers and how to take the temperature see Appendix 2.I. High fever (/c163/c519/c176C) in adolescents is a warning sign and needs further assessment. b Children with ARI and chest pain should always have medical evaluation, since it may be a sign of pneumonia (chest pain on inspiration). It may also appear as retrosternal pain (tracheal/bronchial pain) or as a pleuriticpain. c A deterioration of consciousness and functional status, lack of interest in playing and inappropriate sleepiness should be further investigated. d Vomiting (>2-3 times/24 hr.), particularly if the children are not feeding or drinking well, requires secondary assessment. e Determination of blood gases by pulse oximetry as sign of respiratory failure (see Appendix 2.III) Note: If the child must be transported for secondary assessment (see 2.1.3) a summary of the clinical/laboratory data should accompany the patient. Some triage centres, however, mayhave the facilities to perform secondary assessment and treatment without moving thepatients. Danger signs (paediatrics): (2 months to 5 years old) 222 Difficulty breathing (chest indrawing or nasal flaring or grunting or stridor or fast breathing) Cyanosis Unable to breastfeed or drink Vomiting everything (continuous vomiting) Lethargic or unconscious or confused Convulsions/seizures Full fontanelle 240 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Stiff neck, photophobia When these danger signs are present in infants younger than 2 months, they suggest very severe disease and may be life threatening. These children should always be referredimmediately for physician assessment. Additional danger signs in children under 2 monthsinclude: The child stopped feeding well (less than half of the usual amount of fluids) Fever or low temperature (high fever can represent a serious infection, but lowtemperature may also be present) Wheezing Grunting or stridor when calm Severe chest indrawing Abnormally sleepy or difficult to wake Poor circulation: sudden pallor, cold legs up to the knees Less than four wet diapers in 24 hours Signs of pneumonia (pneumonia in young infants is considered very serious and thesechildren should be referred urgently to a hospital for evaluation) Urgent medical assessment (paediatrics) While a primary care provider may give first aid, children with danger sign must be seen by a physician. Annex G /c45241 February 2004Secondary assessment (<18 years) When the patient's secondary assessment has to be completed in a different setting, a new clinical evaluation to confirm the primary assessment should precede laboratory studies. Notall tests will be needed for all patients, and clinical judgement should be used, particularly ifresources are scarce.

When resources are restricted, priority should be given to patients withco-morbidity or suspected complications (i.e., pneumonia, etc.). Similarly, when theclinical diagnosis of pneumonia is definite and resources are scarce, no CXR is needed,unless there is suspicion of a complication of the pneumonia (i.e., empyema). Whenantibiotics are limited, CXR may be an indication to confirm pneumonia beforeprescribing any drug and, if pneumonia is suspected but the resources for CXR are inshort supply, antibiotics may be prescribed without radiological confirmation. b) Values of haemoglobin for young children are age related.

Determine if patient has co-morbidity of concern (No evidence of lower respiratory tract infection).According to NACI, patients at \"high risk for complications from influenza\" include 152: Chronic cardiac or pulmonary disorder (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, asthma) severe enough to require regular medical follow up or hospital care, Chronic conditions such as diabetes and other metabolic diseases, Cancer, Immunosuppression (due to underlying disease and/or therapy), Renal disease, Anaemia, hemoglobinopathy, Residents of chronic care facilities, Patients on long-term acetylsalicylic acid therapy (increased risk of Reye's syndrome). Asthma and diabetes are the most frequent co-morbidities found in young children. Premature babies and low-weight infants should also be included in this list. All childrenyounger than 2 years of age may be considered as high-risk patients 29. Socio-economic issues such as age and education of the parents, single parents, multiple young siblings, support at home by other family members, etc., should also be taken intoaccount when sending a child back home. Similarly, whether other individuals at home havehigh risk of influenza associated complications (siblings with chronic diseases, elderlygrandparents, etc.) should be evaluated. 244 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Children at risk for influenza-associated complications (no signs of LRTI). Consider physician assessment to determine eligibility (in agreement with the pandemic guidelines) for: Antiviral therapy (within the framework of antiviral prioritization for pandemic influenza,Appendix 5.III). Stopping ASA * Immunization of patient and family if not already done (according to the pandemicguidelines). Plan follow up Setting for care (admission, home, institution etc). When possible, members of the samehousehold should be kept together. Parental/patient education Children without co-morbidities presenting with uncomplicated influenza infection may be sent home with parental education regarding: Maintaining hydration Fever management (avoid salicylic acid*) Watching for signs of deterioration, failure to improve When to return Follow up plan if necessary Mothers of young infants should be told to return to the health centre immediately if thechild worsens or does not feed well, or if breathing becomes difficult. Immunization/prophylactic treatment of high-risk contacts in the household (abide byexisting pandemic guidelines). Infection control practices such as avoiding close contact with othersand paying attentionto hand hygiene, proper disposal of tissues, etc. See Appendix 2.I.: CARING FOR YOUR-SELF: \"When a child is unwell\" and \"how to take a child's temperature\". * A syndrome characterized by acute encephalopathy with fatty micro-infiltration and liver failure, Reye's syndrome , has been described in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age (most commonly in the 4-12 year range) with influenza and receiving salicylates(ASA) 15,105,129,151,5 . The classic presentation is a change in mental status, ranging from lethargy to delirium, seizures and respiratory arrest. The recognition of the association of thissyndrome with the use of acetyl salicylic acid to treat viral symptoms, lead to therecommendation for the use of other agents and a decrease in the number of cases. Annex G /c45245 February 2004Appendix 2.I. Caring For Your Self I. Staying Well A. Be Informed About Influenza What is Influenza? Influenza (flu) is an infection of the cells that line the lungs and airways (the respiratory system). In North America it usually affects people during the winter (November - April). It iscaused by one of three types of viruses - Influenza A, Influenza B, and Influenza C. Influenza Ausually causes the worst illness, Influenza B is more common in children and Influenza C is rare. Only influenza A has been associated with pandemics . The influenza viruses that circulate every winter are related to those from the preceding epidemics. These viruses spread among people with varying levels of immunity (bodydefences) following infections earlier in life. Over a period of 2 or more years, this circulationpromotes the selection of new viruses that have changed enough to again cause epidemicinfection among the general population. At unpredictable intervals, \" novel influenza viruses emerge, which are totally different from strains circulating the year before. If such viruses have the potential to spreadreadily from person-to-person, then more widespread and severe epidemics may occur,usually to a similar extent in every country within a few months to a year, resulting in apandemic .\" 223 How is Influenza Spread? Influenza is very contagious. People can pass the virus for up to seven days or more, beginning from the day before they have the first symptoms of the illness. People breathe-in the virusfrom particles in the air when they are around those who have the flu and who have beentalking, coughing, or sneezing. The virus can travel fro m1-2 meters in the air, and can live several hours on your hands and surfaces. People can also become infected when they touchthose who are ill (e.g., kiss them or shake their hand), or contact objects on which viruses havelanded (e.g., telephones, door knobs, dishes, handrails), and then touch their own nose,mouth or eyes. It is especially easy for the virus to spread where there are crowds or wherepeople live or work/study close together. The flu virus lives longer in cool, dry places. It can livefor one or two days on hard surfaces, and 8-12 hours on cloth, tissue and paper. 246 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004This appendix is prepared from a draft written by Ms. Diane Spillett for Alberta Health and Wellness (September 2001). The orig inal document was designed for the province of Alberta, to reduce hospital overload during interpandemic influenza. It hasbeen adapted to be used nationwide in a pandemic situation.What are the Symptoms of Influenza? A person develops symptoms of the flu within one to three days after becoming infected with the virus. They suddenly develop a fever and possibly chills, and may have a headache andaching muscles, especially in the back and legs. They usually have a dry cough and feel weakand tired. Some people have a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose. They probably won't feellike eating. In general, people feel very sick and want to stay in bed. The fever usually falls inthree to five days, and the person begins to feel better. However, tiredness and a cough cansometimes continue for several weeks. People often mistakenly refer to stomach upsets and colds as \"the flu\". Influenza is quite different from both of these. It rarely causes vomiting and diarrhoea, but may do so in youngchildren or elderly individuals. Unlike influenza, the common cold comes on gradually, rarelycauses a fever, and is usually limited to a sore throat, coughing and sneezing, and a stuffy,runny nose. It is generally milder than influenza and people can carry on with their usualactivities. How Serious is Influenza? Most healthy people recover from influenza without any serious problems. However, there are certain groups of people who are \"at risk\" of developing complications which can be veryserious, and even cause death. Some people, such as very young children and the elderly, are \"at risk\" because they have weaker body defences (immune systems). Pregnant women, particularly those who are in thesecond and third month of their pregnancies, have also increased risks of pneumonia, lunginsufficiency, and death after influenza infections. Similarly, those with diseases such ascancer and HIV/AIDS, people who have had organ transplants and persons who take certainmedications frequently develop complications. Another group of people \"at risk\" are those who have chronic (long term) conditions such as heart disease, lung disease (asthma, cysti c fibrosis, emphysema), kidney disease and diabetes. When a body system is not strong, it is easier for bacteria to invade the cells thathave been damaged by the flu virus and cause other illnesses such as pneumonia. Influenzacan also stress the body so much, that the underlying chronic illness may be worsened. Children under the age of eighteen years and who have influenza should avoid taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), e.g., Aspirin , because they can develop a very serious illness affecting the nervous system and liver, called Reye's syndrome. It is important for parents ofchildren who need to take ASA on a regular basis for a health problem, to discuss possiblecomplications associated with influenza with their doctor, and find out what they can do toreduce the risk. For More Information If there is an outbreak of pandemic influenza in your community, watch the television or listen to the radio for up to date information, or access the Health Canada website athttp://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/. If you have questions about somebody in your household that may have the flu, call the Public Health Centre in your area. Annex G /c45247 February 2004B. Protect Yourself Against Influenza Immunization Vaccination is the best way to avoid or to lessen the severity of influenza. Vaccination is advised once a vaccine with the pandemic strain becomes available. Priorities for vaccination, including the types of individuals that should be immunized first if vaccinesupply is limited, have been identified in the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan and will beconfirmed at the time of a pandemic. Who Should Get the Flu Vaccine? Vaccine supply may be limited during the early stages of the pandemic; therefore the Pandemic Influenza Committee (PIC) will define priority groups, which should be immunizedfirst. This prioritization will evaluate the impact that the vaccine may have on: a) reducingmorbidity and mortality by maintaining the health services response, and by individualprotection of high-risk groups, and b) minimizing societal disruption by maintaining essentialservices (as stated in the pandemic guidelines, Vaccines section). Call the Public Health Centre in your area to learn about vaccine availability and to find out if any of the members of your household belongs to a priority group. They will also inform youwhere they are holding \"Flu Clinics\" for immunization. Some doctors may provide the vaccineto their patients. Two shots may be required (as per pandemic guidelines). The vaccine is safe for pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers and children. It is not effective for children under the age of 6 months. Who Should NOT get the Flu Vaccine? People who are severely allergic to eggs should not receive the vaccine, as viruses used in making the vaccine are grown in eggs. Rarely, a person has had an allergic reaction to someother ingredient in the vaccine - a raised itchy rash, swollen throat or tongue, red itchy eyes orpossibly a swollen face within 12 hours of getting the injection. These people should not getbe vaccinated again. If a person is \"at risk\" for getting serious complications from influenza and cannot be vaccinated, their doctor may wish to prescribe an antiviral drug to give them some protectionduring the pandemic. Antivirals stop the flu virus from multiplying. It is a good idea to ask yourdoctor about this medication, if you are allergic to the vaccine. He/she will need to consideryour medical problems, available medications (the Pandemic Influenza Committee will alsodefine priority groups, if antivirals are in short supply), and possible side effects of the drug. Doctors may also prescribe antivirals for:1. People at high-risk even though they were vaccinated, if they need extra protection,2. People who were vaccinated after the virus was present in the community, and need to be protected for the two weeks required for a response to the vaccine. 3. The public at large, if there is a pandemic and the vaccine with the pandemic strain is not available or is insufficient. If a person has a minor illness, they can still get the flu shot. However, tell your doctor if you have a temperature of 37.8 /c176C (100/c176F) or more or if you have other symptoms. 248 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004What Reactions do People have to the Flu Shot? Some people think that they will get the flu from the flu shot. This is not possible, because the virus in the vaccine has been killed. The most common reaction to the flu shot is someredness and soreness where the needle entered the skin. This is usually gone in two days.Some people may develop a fever, tiredness and aching after six to twelve hours that may lastfor a day or two. More serious reactions are rare. The benefits and risks of this vaccine shouldbe discussed with your vaccine provider as part of the informed consent process. Hygiene In addition to getting vaccinated, the single most important step people can take to prevent the flu is to wash their hands often. Wash your hands often, especially after being in contact with someone who has a respiratory infection, or with children who get the virus easily and are the main spreaders of the virus in thecommunity. Do not shake hands. It is good for everyone to get into the habit of washing theirhands before meals, after using the toilet, and after they cough or sneeze or blow their nose.The sooner children are taught this, the better. It is best to wash your hands with warm soapand water, scrubbing your wrists, palms, fingers and nails for ten to fifteen seconds. Rinse anddry with a clean dry towel. Be aware of the times you rub your eyes or touch your nose or mouth, and try to avoid these habits. This can bring the virus into your airways, if you have recently touched someone whohas the flu, an object that they have used, or a surface on which the virus has settled. Remember not to share eating utensils or drinks. Don't visit people who have the flu unless it is absolutely necessary. If a member of your family has the flu, keep their personal items, such as towels, separate from the rest of the family.Clean surfaces (such as bathroom sinks and taps, kitchen sinks and counters) after the illperson has handled them. Wash hands after cleaning a child's nose. Avoid large crowds.Care for Your Self Taking good care of yourself physically and emotionally strengthens your overall well-being and the ability of your body to fight off infections and to stay healthy. Not smoking isparticularly important for the health of the lungs and airways, and drinking plenty of waterhelps to keep the airways moist and able to cleanse the system of unwanted material. Annex G /c45249 February 2004C. Plan Ahead Spend a little time thinking about what you would need if you got the flu. If you live alone, or are a single parent of young children, or are the only person caring for a frail or disabled adult, it might be a good idea to: Have enough fluids (juices, soups etc.) on hand to last you and your family for 1-2 weeks. Have enough basic household items (e.g., tissues) to last for 1-2 weeks. Have acetaminophen and a thermometer in your medicine cabinet. Do you know how touse/read a thermometer correctly? If not, don't be shy about asking someone to show youhow. Think of someone you could call upon for help if you became very ill with the flu anddiscuss the possibility with him or her. Think of someone you could call upon to care for your children if their school or daycarewas closed because of the pandemic, and you were required to work, and discuss thepossibility with them. If you cannot think of anyone who could help you in such a situation,you can call the Public Health Centre in your area to find out what is available in thecommunity to help with these difficulties. 250 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004II. If You Are Unwell A. Is It The Flu? The most prominent characteristics of the flu are the sudden appearance of a fever (38\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F or more), a dry cough and aching in the body, especially in the head and lower backand legs. Usually the person feels extremely weak and tired and doesn't want to get out of bed.Other symptoms can be chills, aching behind the eyes, loss of appetite, a sore throat and arunny, stuffy nose. After your symptoms first appear you can spread the virus to others for 4-6days or more. B. What Can You Do For Yourself? Rest - Probably, you will feel very weak and tired until your temperature returns to normal (about three days), and resting will provide comfort and allow your body to use its energyto fight the infection. You should avoid contact with others while the infection iscontagious (at least six days after the first symptom appears). Drink plenty of fluids - Extra fluids are needed to replace those lost because of the fever (sweating). If your urine is dark, you need more to drink. Liquids, especially warm ones likechicken soup, help loosen mucus. Try to drink a glass of juice/water or an equal amount ofsome other fluid every hour while you are awake. Take acetaminophen or ibuprophen as recommended on the package to bring down your fever and ease your muscle pain (unless your doctor says otherwise). CHILDREN UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE SHOULD NOT TAKE ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASA)OR ANY PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASA . The combination of influenza and ASA in this age group has been known to cause Reye's syndrome, a very serious condition affecting the nervous system and liver. ANTIBIOTICS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AGAINST INFLUENZA because it is a virus, and antibiotics fight bacteria. A hot water bottle or heating pad may also relieve muscle pain. A cup of Epsom salts in a warm bath may besoothing. Gargle - with a glass of warm water to ease a sore throat. Sugarless hard candy also helps, as do lozenges. Use saline nose drops or spray (ones that contain salt water but no medicine) to help soothe or clear a stuffed nose. Try not to blow your nose as this could send infectedsecretions into your sinuses. Wipe your nose with disposable tissues and put them in thegarbage can immediately. Cover your nose and mouth with tissues when you cough or sneeze and throw them in the garbage as well. Wash your hands often . Do not smoke - it is very irritating to the damaged airways. If you are a single parent, or you are responsible for the care of someone who is frail or disabled, you may need to call someone to help you until you are feeling better . If you buy medicine at the drug store to treat your symptoms (\"over-the-counter\" medications), check with the pharmacist to see if it is the best one for you. Mention if youhave a chronic illness or are taking any other medicine. Take into consideration that: It is better to buy a remedy that treats only one symptom. This way you are nottaking in substances that are doing nothing, or that may trigger an adversereaction. Annex G /c45251 February 2004Read the label to be sure that the ingredient treats the symptom you have. Extra strength remedies contain a higher dose of the ingredient. Try the standard dose first. It may work fine and not have the same risk of side effects. Long acting medications tend to have more side effects than short actingmedications. Read the label and note any possible side effects or interactions with other drugs orhealth conditions. If you have a chronic condition and are taking prescription medications, it is a goodidea to ask the pharmacist to suggest a medication that would be safe for you totake, if you have not already discussed this with your doctor. Muscle pain and fever - Acetaminophen is a good choice because it causes less stomach irritation than other drugs. Acetylsalicylic acid should not be given to children under the age of eighteen . A cough can be helpful if it gets rid of mucus. If a dry cough is keeping you awake, a cough suppressant, Dextromethorphan is safe and effective. If you need help loosening mucus, anexpectorant such as Guaifenesin is good. It is not helpful to take a suppressant and anexpectorant together. A stuffy nose - Decongestants help shrink swollen blood vessels in the nose. There are two kinds pills and nose drops/sprays. Nose drops/sprays act in minutes. They work better andhave fewer side effects than the pills. However, they only work for 2 or 3 days, and then they make matters worse . Oxymetazoline, Phenylephrine and Xylometazoline are nose drops/sprays. If your nose is still stuffy after three days, you may want to switch to the pills. Thepills take 1/2 hour to work. They may cause dry mouth, sleep disturbances and other sideeffects. Pseudoephrine is a decongestant in pill form. Sore throat - Some medications work by numbing the throat, Dyclonine works the best. Others are Benzocaine, Hexylreorcinol, Menthol and Phenol. These are lozenges or throatsprays. Other lozenges act by coating the throat. They may contain honey, herbs or pectin. Ingredients to avoid : Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) has been linked with strokes. Note: Older people may become much more sensitive to medications in general and may experience more side effects, especially to the nervous system (e.g., confusion). It is best totake no more than three or four medications at a time. This includes both prescription andover the counter drugs. If you have any questions at all about medications, don't hesitate to talk to your pharmacist. Generally, people begin to feel better after their temperature returns to normal, in about three days, and are ready to return to their normal activities/work in about a week. It is common fortiredness and a cough to linger on for several more weeks. 252 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004C. When To Seek Medical Attention If you are a normally healthy person and have been suffering with the flu, it is time to call the doctor, EMS or health help line if : You become short of breath while resting or doing very little; Breathing is difficult or painful; You are coughing up bloody sputum; You are wheezing You have had a fever for three or four days and you are not getting better - or you may be getting worse; You have started to feel better, and suddenly you get a high fever and start to feelsick again; It is noted by yourself or others that you are extremely drowsy and difficult to wakeup or that you are disoriented or confused; You have extreme pain in your ear. Seek medical care as soon as possible, in order to prevent your condition from worsening. Bacteria may have invaded your damaged tissues. At this point your doctormay consider giving you an antibiotic. If you have heart or lung disease or any other chronic condition that requires regular medical attention, if you are frail, or if you have an illness or are on treatments ormedications that affect your immune system and you get the flu, call your doctor . If you are living with a long-term illness, your doctor may suggest changes to your usualmanagement routine and/or provide you with extra help in treating the flu and preventing complications e.g., antiviral drugs. These medications must be taken within 48 hour of the first symptoms to be effective so call your doctor right away . What your Doctor May Prescribe: Recently, drugs called antivirals have been developed which can fight viruses. To treat influenza, they must be started within 48 hours of the first symptoms of the flu - the sooner, the better. At the time of a pandemic, antivirals will likely be in short supply. Health Canada will provide advise as to who should get antivirals as a priority. For example, persons with underlyingchronic diseases may be one of the first groups to receive treatment with antivirals. If you arein a priority group and you have symptoms of the flu, you should call your doctor straightaway. If you are a healthy person and have not been identified as being in a priority group forantivirals, you do not need to call your doctor unless you have the more severe symptomslisted above. Annex G /c45253 February 2004D. When A Child Is Unwell Older children and teens have the same symptoms of the flu as adults. Very young children and infants probably have similar symptoms, but do not know how to tell people they havesore muscles or a headache. These children may be irritable and eat poorly. They sometimesdevelop a hoarse cry and barking cough (croup). Younger children may also have diarrhoea,vomiting and stomach pain - especially children under 6 months. Some of the things you can do for your child are : Give acetaminophen or ibuprofen every four to six (ibuprofen) hours for the fever in the dose recommended on the package (unless your doctor says otherwise). DO NOT GIVE ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID CONTAINING MEDICATION (e.g., Aspirin, Bufferin etc.) Your pharmacist can provide advice on appropriate over-the-counter medications fortreating fever. Do not expect to be prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated influenza, as they will haveno benefit. Antibiotics may be prescribed for complications of influenza such aspneumonia or ear infection. Dress the child in lightweight clothing and keep the room temperature at 20 /c176C. Offer cool fluids frequently when the child is awake. Avoid cool baths. Allow the child to rest and stay at home if possible for 6 days or more, so the virus isn't spread to other children. Use salt-water nose drops to treat a stuffy nose. Throw away tissues as soon as you havewiped your child's nose. Teach the child to cover their mouth when they cough or sneezeand then to throw the tissue away. Wash your hands often and teach your child to do soafter wiping the nose. Take your child to the doctor if your child : Has heart or lung disease or any chronic illness requiring regular medical care; has a disease or is taking drugs or treatments that affect the immune system; takesacetylsalicylic acid (ASA) e.g., takes ASA regularly for a medical condition; Has trouble breathing; Is less than 6 months old and has any temperature over 38.5 /c176C; Is constantly irritable and will not calm down; Is listless and not interested in playing with toys; Has a fever that lasts more than 5 days; Drinks so little fluid that they are not urinating at least every 6 hours when awake; Has vomiting for more than 4 hours, or has severe diarrhoea; Note: green or yellow nasal discharge does not mean a child has a bacterial infection and needs antibiotics. 254 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004TAKE YOUR CHILD TO THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR CALL 911 IF YOUR CHILD : Has severe trouble breathing not caused by a stuffy nose Has blue lips Is limp or unable to move Is hard to wake up, unusually quiet or unresponsive Has a stiff neck Seems confused Has a seizure (convulsion/fit) Has not had a wet diaper in 12 hours. Annex G /c45255 February 2004Attachments A) How To Take A Child's Temperature There are 4 ways to take a child's temperature: by the mouth (oral) by the bum (rectal) under the armpit (axillary) in the ear (tympanic) The best method to choose depends on your child's age: Birth to 2 years : best choice for an exact reading-rectal, second choice -armpit (to check for fever) Between 2 and 5 years : best choice-rectal, second-ear, third-armpit Older than 5 years : first choice-oral, second-ear, third-armpit There are two types of glass thermometers: one for oral and axillary temperatures (it has a long slender bulb at one end, containing mercury) and one with a short, stubby, larger bulb forrectal temperatures. As the mercury expands, in response to the heat from the child's body, itmoves up the column. A digital thermometer can be used for rectal, oral and armpit temperature taking. It is made of unbreakable plastic, is easy to read and measures temperature faster than glass. Earthermometers are available but are expensive. A fever strip is not recommended because it does not give an accurate temperature reading. Rectal Method If you are using a glass thermometer , be sure it is a rectal thermometer. Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse (hot water causes the mercury to expand and may burst the thermometer). Hold the thermometer at the end away from the mercury and shake it with firm downward flicks of the wrist so that the mercury goes below 36 /c176C (96.8/c176F). Cover the silver tip with petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) Place the baby on his/her back with his knees bent. Gently insert the thermometer in the rectum, about 2.5 cm (1 inch), while holding it with your fingers. Hold for at least two minutes. Remove the thermometer. Hold it near the light and slowlyturn it until the line of mercury is seen. Read the temperature where the line of mercury ends. 256 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Clean the thermometer with cool soapy water and rinse. Use a cotton swab soaked in alcohol to rub down the thermometer. Store the thermometer in a container to prevent breakage. NB. This method is not recommended for children with illnesses/treatments affecting theirimmune system. Armpit Method Use an oral glass thermometer. Clean the thermometer and shake down the mercury as in \"rectal method\". Place the silver tip of the thermometer in the center of the armpit. Make sure your child's arm is tucked snugly against his/her body. Leave the thermometer in place for at least 4 minutes. Remove, read, clean and store the thermometer as in \"rectal method\". To use a digital thermometer: Press the button to turn the thermometer \"on\". Put the thermometer under your child's armpit. The silver tip must touch the skin. Hold the top of the thermometer with one hand and hold down your child's arm with the other hand. Wait for the thermometer to beep. Read the temperature on the display. To clean a digital thermometer, wash only the tip with soap and warm (not hot) water andwipe off with alcohol after use. Dry well. Mouth Method Clean the thermometer and shake down the mercury as in \"rectal method\". Do not give the child cold or hot liquids for 1/2 hour before taking his/her temperature. Carefully place the tip of the thermometer under the child's tongue. Tell him/her to close the mouth but not to bite down. (NB. This method is not recommended for children under5 years of age.) With the child's mouth closed, leave the thermometer in place for 3 to 4 minutes. Stay withchild and make sure he/she remains still. Remove thermometer, Read, clean and store as in rectal method. Ear Method Use a clean probe tip each time, and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Gently tug on the ear, pulling it up and back. This will help straighten the ear canal, and make a clear path inside the ear to the eardrum. Gently insert the thermometer until the ear canal is fully sealed off. Annex G /c45257 February 2004Squeeze and hold down the button for one second. Remove the thermometer and read the temperature. NB. This method is not recommended for children under one year of age. Ask the pharmacist any questions you may have when you purchase your thermometer. If you are purchasing a glass thermometer, look for one with a mercury column that is easy to see,and degree markings that are easy to read. What is a normal temperature?The normal temperature range varies, depending on the method you use: Rectum : How To Take An Adult's Temperature Normal body temperature is regulated between 35.8 /c176C and 37.2 \u00b0C in healthy persons, it may vary by 0.5-1 degree during the day. Body temperature shows a definite pattern: low in themorning, gradually increasing during the day, and reaching its maximum during the lateafternoon or evening. There are 3 ways in which an adult's temperature is usually taken: by the mouth (oral) in the ear (tympanic) under the armpit (axillary). This method is less accurate, and is usually only used if the person is extremely drowsy or not clear mentally. There are two types of glass thermometers: one for oral and axillary temperatures (it has a long slender bulb at one end, containing mercury) and one with a short, stubby, larger bulb forrectal temperatures. (These are usually used with children). As the mercury expands, inresponse to the heat from a person's body, it moves up the column. A digital thermometer can be used for oral, armpit (and rectal) temperature taking. It is made of unbreakable plastic, is easy to read and measures temperature faster than glass. Earthermometers are available but are expensive. A fever strip is not recommended because it does not give an accurate temperature reading. Oral Method If you are using a glass thermometer , be sure it is an oral thermometer. Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse (hot water causes the mercury to expand and may burst the thermometer). Hold the thermometer at the end away from the mercury and shake it with firm downward flicks of the wrist so that the mercury goes below 36 /c176C. 258 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Make sure that you/the person whose temperature is being taken has not smoked a cigarette, had a hot or cold drink or taken a hot bath for 1/2 hour, or the reading will not beaccurate. Carefully place the silver tip of the thermometer under tongue. Close mouth but do not tobite down. (NB. This method is not recommended for children under 5 years of age.) With mouth closed, leave the thermometer in place for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the thermometer. Hold it near the light and slowly turn it until the line of mercuryis seen. Read the temperature where the line of mercury ends. Clean the thermometer with cool soapy water and rinse. Use a cotton swab soaked inalcohol to rub down the thermometer. Store the thermometer in a container to prevent breakage. If you are using a digital thermometer: Press the button to turn the thermometer \"on\".

Squeeze and hold down the button for one second. Remove the thermometer and read the temperature. Axillary Method Use an oral glass thermometer. Clean the thermometer and shake down the mercury as in \"oral method\". Place the silver tip of the thermometer in the center of the armpit. Make sure the person's arm is held snugly against his/her body (forearm across chest). Leave the thermometer in place for at least 4 minutes. Remove, read, clean and store the thermometer as in \"oral method\". Ask the pharmacist any questions you may have when you purchase your thermometer. If you are purchasing a glass thermometer, look for one with a mercury column that is easy to see,and degree markings that are easy to read.

Pulse Oximetry and Oximetry the \"in vitro\" saturation of arterial blood is still the golden standard for measuring arterial oxygen, it involves repeated sampling of arterial blood, iscostly and time consuming, and only gives intermittent and delayed results. Two non-invasiveprocedures have been developed recently for continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation:pulse oximetry and trans-cutaneous oximetry. Both procedures, however, have someshortfalls; and, ideally, they should be used in combination 214,172 . In a pandemic situation, this will not be possible in most facilities, and, therefore, clinicians should be aware of thelimitations of each device, particularly when testing critically ill patients. Taking the mean oftwo or more measurements, if possible, can reduce variability and increase reliability 172. 1.Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive, continuous monitoring procedure that has supplanted arterial sampling methods for studying patient's oxygen saturation. It allows theestimation of the arterial tension of oxygen [SPO2 is the oxygen saturation (PO2)measured with a pulse oximeter, given in %] in the ranges that are clinically relevant (i.e.,75-95%, Fig. 2.1). It has been reported to be accurate within 5% ( 2% for SPO2 > 70%,and responds to that affect tissue oxygenation 181,165,172,108 . Pulse oximetry has, however, some limitations: It does not provide information regarding patient's ventilation and carbon dioxidetension. The patient may have a normal reading and still be hypercapnic and haverespiratory failure. Carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, on the other hand,have light absorption similar to oxyhemoglobin, and, therefore, both can modifythe SPO2 readings (similarly: intravenous dyes testing, bilirubin, skin colour, and brown-red nail polish, canalso modify the readings 108). Pulse oximeters require careful sensor placement and adequate pulse pressures (>20 mm Hg), and they are prone to movement artefacts (which is a seriousshortcoming with young children). Sensors should be placed 2-3 mm apart fromeach other, and any optical shunt should be avoided (i.e., light received by thesensors without passing through the skin). It must be ensured that all light emittedpass through the tissues, that the receiving diode is located exactly opposite to theemitter, and that both are shielded from ambient light 172. Skin burns are possible and, therefore, the sensors should be checked carefullybefore use, and patients should be checked each 6-8 hours 172. Probes may be placed in the ear or in the fingers, although finger probes are considered moreaccurate 108. Patients with low perfusion states may hinder the performance of pulse oximeters.In these patients the results become blood-flow dependent. During shock, theproportion of wrong or missing values sharply increases 172. Increased venous pulsations may occur if probes are secured too tightly, or in cases of right heartfailure, tricuspid regurgitation, etc. and they may, mistakenly, be detected by thepulse oximeter 108. Although the response time is the time it takes for the blood to travel from the lungsto the sensor, pulse oximeters usually average their values over periods from 2-15seconds or from 4-32 heartbeats. This intends to level out any erroneous Annex G /c45281 February 2004measurements and minimize false alarms; however, this procedure prolongs the response time, and also may lead to false readings after body movements or maymask intermittent hypoxemia 172. Some brands have the option to be used in a beat-to-beat mode (i.e., without averaging their readings), what may be preferredfor same patients. Pulse oximeters derive their results from an \"empiric\" table elaborated with datafrom healthy adults. Therefore, each instrument should be validated ifmeasurements are done in infants and young children. In addition, saturations <70-80% were not attained in healthy volunteers, and are, therefore, extrapolated,which may lead to an underestimation of the true degree of hypoxemia. There are considerable differences in bias (or systematic error, this indicates theoverestimation or underestimation of one brand relative to the other) and precision(variability or random error) between brands, and it is important to determine whichbrand of oximeters is used, mainly when the values of PO2 are in the low ranges 165. Available data shows considerable differences not only between instruments butalso between studies 172. The algorithms used to calculate the SPO2, and the way these measurements are displayed can partially explain these differences. Usersshould be aware of this fact and know the brand of oximeter and software they areusing. Data from one brand cannot be transferred to another brand. 2.Transcutaneous sensors may also be used to determine the tcPO2 (transcutaneous tension of oxygen, given in mm Hg), a variable that reflects the PO2 in the peripheraltissue. Sensitivity to PO2 < 50 mm (hypoxemia) and > 80 mm (hyperoxemia) isapproximately 85% 172. Limitations tcPO2 are: to arterial PO2 with increasing patient's age172. Values are influenced by skin thickness (results will be low in areas of thick or poorlyperfused skin), sensor temperature (should not be <44(C and it takes 15 minutesto heat the skin, otherwise the values will be unreliable), amount of gel used (if toomuch gel is used, the values will be wrongly high), and peripheral perfusion 172. Additionally, the sensor must be regularly relocated (particularly in young children)to avoid skin burns. In the presence of severely reduced cardiac output and peripheral perfusion, thetcPO2 values deviate from the arterial PO2 and become blood flow dependent. Ifinterpreted correctly, it may provide an early warning of cardiac failure,hypotension, or acidemia 214. Response times are delayed, caused by the time required for the oxygen to travelfrom the capillaries through the skin into the electrodes. The average responsetime to a rapid decrease in the PO2 is approximately 16 seconds and up to 30seconds. 282 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Normal values (Fig. 2.1) Normal values for children and adults are published in some papers (see below). However, the interpretation of the results obtained with the different brands should follow instructionsincluded with the instrument's manuals. 1.Pulse oximetry (always refer to instrument's manuals): Data on baseline SPO2, controlled for movement artefacts and taken in a beat-to-beat mode, for neonates, infants and children, was obtained with onebrand, Nellcor oximeters. Baseline SPO2, during quiet sleep and away of apneicpauses is between 95-100% in preterm infants and 97-100% in older infants andchildren. The frequency of episodic desaturation varies considerably with age. Inchildren 2-16 years SPO2 almost never reaches 80% and even reductions to 90%are infrequent, while in newborns short episodes of SPO2 ( 80% are quitecommon 172. In healthy newborns, the mean SPO2 was 97.2% ( 1.6% with a median value of97%. Only age and activity affected the SPO2 significantly; values obtained whilethe infants were fussy and crying were lower compared to measurements donewhen they were sleeping 127. Values measured in 60 term infants (with a Nellcor N200) in the first 4 weeks of life, detected episodes of desaturation ( /c16380% for/c1794s) in 35% of the recordings obtained in the first week and 60% in weeks 2-4. Theclinical significance of these values remains to be determined 173. Values taken from 150 normal adult volunteers (not arterialised in advance) with apulse oximeter, resulted in 13.3% individuals with values <94%, none below 90%.When patients receiving anaesthesia were studied, only 1.1% of the patients whoreceived O2 following anaesthesia had values below 90%, while this value was16.7% for patients not receiving O2. The alarm limit for Criticalcare Systems 501oximeter, used for this study, is 90% 198. In a study of stroke patients, the overall SPO2 was above 90%, and similar tocontrols of the same age, when patients were sitting up 197. Episodes of desaturation were defined as SPO2 < 90%. All night pulse oximetry values from a total of 350 healthy subjects with agesranging from 1 month to 85 years were compared to 25 individuals with obstructivesleep apnea (OSA) and 21 individuals with asthma. Mean values +/- SD for thehealthy patients were: 1) the lowest saturation recorded during the night = 90.4%+/- 3.1; the saturation below which the individuals spent 10% of the night was94.7% +/- 1.6; and was 96.5% +/- 1.5%. No relation wasfound with sex, obesity, or race. Asthma patients did not have differences withhealthy controls, but OSA had significantly lower saturation values. Healthy oldersubjects (>60 years) had lower O2 saturation than younger individuals 87. Annex G /c45283 February 20042.Trans cutaneous PO2 monitoring Mean tcPO2 of newborns and infants during both, quiet sleep and wakefulness (excluding feeding or crying) was about 70-80 mm of Hg with a deviation of 6-10mm of Hg 172. Index values for tcPO2 in adults have been reviewed by Tremper and Barker214. O2 in blood Blood concentration of haemoglobin (Hb) in adults is 14(2 g/dL blood (140 /c17720 g/L) and it can carry about 20ml oxygen per dL, as oxyhemoglobin. The Hb binding sites bind oxygen inaccordance with the partial pressure of the gas in solution (PO2), and the percentage ofsaturation of the Hb is given by the percentage of binding sites occupied. The relationbetween the PO2 and the Hb saturation is non-linear and has the shape of an S (Figure 2.1),which has physiological advantages: In the arterial part of the graph, it is fairly flat, what meansthat moderate changes in PO2 cause only small decrements in saturation. However, the curveis fairly steep in the normal ranges for venous PO2, which allows delivery of oxygen to thetissues with minor changes in the PO2 (Figure 2.1) 44,137. The relative affinity of the Hb for oxygen is given by the parameter P50, i.e., PO2 at 50% saturation; it is decreased by physiologic factors like pH, PCO2 and temperature (Figure 2.1). In clinical practice, patientsrequiring blood gas measurements also have altered temperatures, blood pH and CO2excess. Blood gas machines usually take these factors under consideration 44,137. Figure 2.1 Legend . The centre curve is the normal curve under standard conditions. The other graphs show the displacements caused by changes in blood pH, with all other parameters remainingconstant. Venous and arterial saturation points are also shown, based an arterial/mixedvenous oxygen saturation difference of 25%. Arterial saturation for these graphs corresponds to a PO2 of 13.3 kPa (100 mm Hg). Temperature 37 /c176C, base excess =0 137. 284 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004120 06 0 100 80 40 20 Arterial Points 7.8Oxygen 15 Oxygen tension (kPa)Percentage saturation of HaemoglobinChapter 3. Patient Management II Management of Patients in Long Term Care Facilities 3.1 Long-Term Care Facilities Long-term care facilities (LTCF) include a heterogeneous group of establishments. Although they accommodate mainly elderly individuals (nursing homes are the most common), thespectrum of services provided is wide and there are establishments for residents with physicalor psychiatric disability, pediatric centres and geriatric centres. Some institutions providepermanent custodial care, however other organizations provide only temporary rehabilitationcare 166,100 . Because of their age and underlying medical conditions, most individuals living in long-term care facilities are at increased risk for developing complications after influenza infection.Health-care personnel and visitors may introduce the virus, and the closed environment willfavour transmission 88,166. During influenza outbreaks in hospitals or nursing homes, as many as 70% of individuals (either personnel or patients) may become infected. The increased useof invasive devices such as central lines, chronic respirators, feeding devices, etc. facilitate thedevelopment of infections and complications 88,166. A goal, in the pandemic situation, will be to manage patients within the facility without transferring them to an acute care facility. This may require that the long-term carefacility designate an area for more acute care, where closer monitoring and moreintensive nursing care can be provided, and where parenteral therapy and oxygentherapy may be given. Prior to any pandemic, long-term care facilities should have in place policies to support appropriate management of residents and personnel. The inter-pandemic epidemics sufferedalmost every year are an opportunity to develop such policies and test their efficacy. They should include:a) An institutional policy for the management of influenza outbreaks;b) Immunization of residents and staff;c) Plans to establish an area within the facility for management of more acutely ill patients;d) Advanced directives for all residents, which should be completed and updated regularly and are consistent with provincial legislation and institutional policy. The goals of an institutional influenza plan are: To prevent influenza illness and complications in residents and staff; Timely diagnosis and appropriate management of influenza infection in patients; Timely diagnosis and management of an influenza outbreak within the LTCF; To provide care for ill residents within the facility without transfer to another facility. Annex G /c45285 February 20043.2. Assessment and management of long-term facility residents 3.2.1 Prevention a) Yearly influenza vaccine for all residents and staff according to national/local recommendations (interpandemic influenza). If a pandemic is declared, pandemicvaccine priorities will be considered. b) Pneumococcal vaccination of all residents, consistent with NACI guidelines.c) Comprehensive, timely surveillance for influenza-like illness in residents and staff, including rapid laboratory confirmation and viral culture (interpandemic influenza).Microbiological tests (bacteriologic and/or virologic determination) may be requireddepending on the clinical presentation and on the availability of resources. Once thepresence of the pandemic strain has been confirmed in the facility, virologic tests will beneeded only to confirm diagnosis in atypical cases, and for surveillance purposes.Current rapid tests may be useful for confirmation of diagnosis and treatment decisions(see Appendix 5.II). d) Facility guidelines for use of prophylactic antivirals, within the framework of antiviral prioritization for pandemic influenza, should be in place in all LTCF. The following algorithms are general, and designed for \"nursing homes\", where residents are elderly and have multiple co-morbidities. Nevertheless, the approach is applicable to otherLTCFs, although specific needs for other populations should be considered in advance. 286 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20043.2.2 Diagnosis and management of residents with influenza Triage of long term care facility residents The algorithm suggested in this page is intended to help personnel in LTCFs to identify patients with influenza, to assess the severity of the disease, and to determine follow up duringa pandemic. Annex G /c45287 February 2004Resident ClinicalDeterioration Symptoms with diagnosisother than Rapid influenzaManage appropriate for alternate diagnosis Resident: Assessment (3.2.2.2)Management (3.2.2.3)ObservationTreat for any likely alternate diagnosisAssess and manage as an influenzaillness if symptoms are compatiblewith influenza and there is no specificalternative diagnosis (3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.3) Facility: Institute outbreak management plan Report to Public Health authoritiesDesignate an area for acute care withincreased monitoring and nursing care,and where parenteral therapy or oxygentherapy may be given.3.2.2.1 Symptoms consistent with flu like illness. Long-term care facility residents These recommendations assume that influenza is known to be present in the community or region. In this situation, any resident of a long-term facility who deteriorates clinically and forwhom there is no clear alternate diagnosis may have influenza illness 84. Influenza infection of elderly residents in a long-term care facility may present with: a) Fever (could be only a low grade fever) or hypothermia.b) Anorexiac) Vomitingd) Increased confusion or decreased functional status e.g., a decreased ability to walk independently. e) White cell count may be normal, with or without a shift to the left.Rapid diagnostic tests are useful to confirm or discard influenza in elderly patients with uncertain clinical presentations. They are helpful if antiviral therapy is considered, as theseshould be started shortly after the onset of disease (within the 48 hours of onset) to getmaximum results (see Appendix 5.II). Rapid tests may not be available in a pandemic situationand there may be many false negatives tests. Therefore, patients with symptoms compatiblewith influenza should be assessed and managed as such, especially if there are no otherobvious diagnoses. 3.2.2.2 Influenza illness assessment. Long-term care facility residents Theinitial assessment and evaluation of the residents should be consistent with advance directives, and include the following: a) History: age, duration of residence in the facility, co-morbid illnesses, documentation of last influenza vaccination, documentation of pneumococcal vaccination, time of onset ofsymptoms. b) Physical assessment: temperature, skin colour, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, peripheral oedema, chest auscultation, chest pain on inspiration, mental status, function(ability to function independently, continuous vomiting, etc.). c) Diagnostic testing should include 02 saturation. For residents who are clinically stable and not judged to be severely ill this may be sufficient. In residents where there are concerns about metabolic status, or the degree of illness, additional tests which may be considered include a CBC with white cell count, electrolytes,blood glucose, CPK, BUN and creatinine, an EKG if there is a new arrhythmia or evidence ofsignificant deterioration in cardiac status. A chest x-ray should be considered for all residentswith an oxygen saturation of (90% on room air, with new purulent sputum, or respiratory rate(30 per minute. A sputum culture may be helpful for residents producing sputum, and blood 288 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004The clinical presentation of any infectious illness in an elderly impaired long-term care facility resident may be non-specific, and non-classical. Alternate diagnoses must be consideredwhen the patient is initially assessed, including non-infectious causes such as deterioration ofco-morbid illness or medication adverse effects. A diagnosis of influenza should be excludedwith any non-specific presentation.cultures should be considered in individuals who appear to be severely toxic (depending on the availability of resources, see Chapter 2). Long-term care facilities should have in place arrangements by which portable chest x-rays may be obtained, and should consider a phone reporting system to ensure that results arereturned promptly and in a standardized fashion. In addition to nursing homes, some elderly adults live in residences for the old, where there are basic health services. These residences should be considered as potential sites for triageand care of residents (non-traditional sites) in a pandemic, and should be equipped to providebasic diagnostic tests and healthcare services to residents with influenza. 3.2.2.3 Instructions for the management of subjects remaining in the long term care facility A written plan for the timely management of patients should be in place. This will include diagnostic and follow-up tests, responsibilities of medical and non-medical personnel, anduse of medications. a)Diagnostic and follow-up tests (in selected patients, see Chapter 2): Chest X-Rays (as required, see Chapter 2) Blood tests, urine analysis, etc. (as required) Viral/Bacterial studies: sputum, cerebrospinal liquid, nasopharyngeal aspirate , blood culture (see Chapter 2). b)General management : The goals of general management are to maintain comfort, to preserve functional status, and to limit complications60,84,204 . Specific aspects of management for influenza and its complications include: 1.Maintenance of hydration . This may be achieved through oral fluids or if necessary through parenteral fluids. Where parenteral fluids are necessary hypodermoclysis isan option rather than intravenous therapy and may be more practical in thelong-term care setting. 2.Oxygenation . Patients with an oxygen saturation of <90% on room air should have oxygen supplementation. This may usually be given by portable oxygen with nasalprongs. Where this is insufficient, patients may require more aggressive efforts ofoxygenation including non-intubation methods of respiratory therapy. 3.Antipyretics and analgesics may be required to limit discomfort associated with myalgia and arthralgia. Usually acetaminophen will be sufficient. 4.Other therapies such as antitussives may occasionally be indicated depending on the clinical features of the given patient. Annex G /c45289 February 2004c)Specific therapy : Specific therapy is directed at the influenza infection itself and influenza complications including secondary pneumonia and/or aggravation ofpre-existing disease. During the early stages of the pandemic, LTCFs should determineaccess to antivirals and antibiotics. When a ntivirals/antibiotics are not available, symptom control and oxygenation may be the only management approaches. Strategiesto manage patients pending antivirals should be developed. 1.Antiviral agents including amantadine (for prevention), zanamivir, and oseltamivir (for treatment) may be given for the prevention and treatment of influenza.Treatment with these drugs is, usually, only indicated if symptoms have beenpresent for less than 48 hours. They may not be available, depending on suppliesand on the priorities for the pandemic situation. When amantadine is used, dosageadjustment for renal function is necessary. Zanamivir may be impractical because itrequires cooperation from the individual to use an inhaler. This may not beachievable in many long-term care facility patients, especially those who are acutelyill. (See Appendix 5.III) 2.Antibiotics should be given only for the management of presumed or diagnosed secondary bacterial pneumonia (see Chapter 2 and Appendix 5.IV). 3.Management of preexisting disease : Cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, etc. 4.For patients who are acutely confused and in whom correction of oxygenation or limitation of fever are not sufficient to control confusion, management for acuteconfusion may be necessary. 3.2.3 Discharge Criteria: (from the care sector designated for influenza patients) It is important to define when patients are clinically stable and can be moved back to the usual residential area. Patients will be considered clinically stable when, in the preceding 24hours 171: They are not acutely confused They are able to be fed orally or by naso-gastric tube Their vital signs are stable. Values should be established (e.g., O2 saturation > 90%, heartrate < 100/minute, respiratory rate < 24/minute, blood systolic pressure > 90 mm Hg,temperature < 38 \u00b0C). Once the patients have been clinically stable for 48 hours and intravenous medication has been switched to oral therapy, the attending personnel should consider discharge from the\"acute care area\". In the pandemic setting, prioritization for earlier discharge may benecessary due to limitations in resources. 3.2.4 Transfer to and from Acute Care facilities A goal, in the pandemic situation, will be to manage patients within the same facility. In some special circumstances, however, the transfer to acute care services may be considered andthis has to be planned in advance. 290 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20043.3 Timely diagnosis and management of an influenza outbreak within the LTCF The early detection of any outbreak occurring in a LTCF is essential to implement control measures and to stop the diffusion of the disease. In a pandemic situation, the first case ofconfirmed influenza would likely lead to outbreak management for pandemic influenza. Every LTCF should have in place surveillance for the early detection and control of an outbreak. This includes 88: 1) Preparation of a written plan for the management of an influenza outbreak, avoiding unnecessary delays. This will include the identification of diagnostic tests, responsibilitiesof medical and non-medical personnel, and use of antiviral medication. 2) Identification of personnel responsible for the surveillance and for the transmission of information within the establishment. This will usually be the individual with responsibilityfor infection control in the facility. The Public Health authorities will inform this individualif influenza is circulating in the community and he/she will report to the authorities whenan outbreak has been detected in the facility. 3) Education of all staff and attending physicians in the importance of early identification and notification if a case is suspected. 4) A response capacity maintained 7 days per week.5) Specific reporting mechanisms and standardized data collection (Appendix 3.I).Once the outbreak is confirmed, the authorities responsible should take all the measures required to control the propagation of the virus within the facility (among the residents, and topersonnel and visitors; see Infection control guideline). Studies and treatment of patients willbe done in the area of the facility assigned for this purpose; and prophylactic treatment ofsome residents may be initiated (following the existing framework for antiviral prioritizationduring the pandemic).

Completed by: _________________________________ Date: ________________________________________Chapter 4. Patient Management III Management of patients in Non-traditional Facilities and Telephone advice 4.1 Non-traditional facilities (NTF) Definition It is expected that the number of individuals requiring care during pandemic influenza will exceed the number of beds available in health care institutions. Admitting to hospitals only theseriously ill requiring specialized medical care (Chapter 2), and making use of alternativecentres (such as rehabilitation facilities, community centres, schools, churches and hotels) forless ill patients, will optimize the provision of care. Non-traditional health care facilities will be used for two main purposes:a) As an extension of overloaded hospitals and clinics, for the care of influenza patients that are not critically ill or not yet well enough to return home, and b) As domiciliary care, for individuals unable to care for themselves at home.Rehabilitation facilities, hotels, and other sites, should be provided with additional basic support equipment (like oxygen therapy supplies). Community halls and schools areequipped with toilets and have some cooking facilities; they may be an alternative to hospitalsin case of need. 4.2 Telephone advice Section to be developed. Annex G /c45293 February 2004A Non-Traditional Site is a site that is : a) currently not an established health care site, orb) is an established health care site that usually offers a different type or level of care. The functions of an Non-Traditional Site will vary depending on the needs of the community but will focus on monitoring, care and support of influenza patients during an influenza pandemic. (seeannex on Non-Traditional Sites and Workers).Chapter 5. Patient Management IV Hospital Management: Emergency Room, Short-term observation and Ward management, Intensive Care Unit Patient management in the hospitals will be similar to interpandemic- influenza care. Changes may be required, however, to operate with limited resources, or if the pandemic strain showsan unusual pattern of disease. Prior planning should consider actions to follow in the event ofinsufficient resources (beds, personnel, equipment and/or drugs), and alternatives.Cancellation of non-urgent admissions and elective surgery will help to relieve pressure forsupplies. Unnecessary admissions of influenza patients should be avoided, and alternativecommunity services should be used appropriately. The pandemic influenza committee andthe communications network will activate the influenza contingency plan after the WHOinforms them of the onset of the pandemic, and will update the provinces about the evolutionof the pandemic 206,223 . 5.1 Emergency Room A separate assessment/admission area should be identified for patients with suspectedinfluenza. These patients should be rapidly diverted there to minimize disease transmission.Admission forms will be completed at this point 171(Appendix 5.I). Patient-triaging and initial assessment are discussed in Chapter 2. If the patient is not admitted to hospital and is sent home, or to an alternative care centre, provide the patient a copy of: a) Assessment sheetb) Instructions for self-managementc) Contact names/numbers to notify if they deteriorate clinicallyd) Arrangements for follow-up as required: usually 48 hours later for adults and 24 hours for children. 5.2 Short-term observation A special area of the hospital should be assigned for \"short-term\" observation of thosepatients whose clinical assessment does not lead to a definitive admission (seepatient-triaging in Chapter 2). 294 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20045.3 Ward management Standard ward management of influenza patients should occur. Local plans to address potential shortages of beds, personnel, equipment and/or drugs should be in place. 5.3.1 Diagnostic and follow-up tests The following tests and criteria for patient management, based on clinical assessment of each case, should be considered on admission to hospital. Availability of resources and thepandemic guidelines must be considered. Tests may include (as required, see Chapter 2) Chest Radiograph Blood cells count Urea, creatinine, electrolytes Nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid for viral studies (antigen/nucleicacid determination, virus culture), and/or bacterial Gram stain and culture Blood culture Electrocardiogram, urine analysis, blood glucose. 5.3.2 Specific management 5.3.2.1 Anti-viral therapy (see pandemic guidelines) Antivirals are most efficient when started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Since supply is expected to be limited, drugs may be reserved for patients severely ill or those with high risksfor influenza-related complications (for priority groups, see section Antivirals in the pandemicguidelines). Clinical guidelines for the use of antivirals are in Appendix 5.III. 5.3.2.2 Antibiotics Antimicrobial therapy is indicated for treatment of patients with secondary bacterial pneumonia (Appendix 5.IV) 130,140,63 . In any upper respiratory tract infection, runny nose and sinus inflammation (Rhinosinusitis) are common. In some cases, when severe symptoms arepresent or persist for more than 10-14 days, a bacterial sinusitis may be present. Acutesinusitis presents clinically with purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain(especially unilateral), unilateral sinus tenderness, and worsening of these symptoms afterinitial improvement of influenza. In children, suspected sinusitis at 10 days to 2 weeks ofsymptoms would likely be treated, although it may not be in adults. Antibiotics may also beneeded to treat bacterial otitis media, which is uncommon in adults but can complicateinfluenza in children younger than 12 years 36,101. Clinical guidelines for the use of antibiotics are in Appendix 5.IV. Annex G /c45295 February 20045.3.3 General management Fluid therapy. Ensure adequate fluid intake (fluid management in patients with primary viral pneumonia must be well assessed and closely monitored, because some of thesepatients may develop adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and under thesecircumstances restricted intake of liquids may be indicated 171. Oxygen therapy based on pulse oximetry Management of associated cardiovascular illness 5.3.4 Symptom control 5.3.5 Discharge Criteria and follow-up A shortage in hospital beds is anticipated; therefore identification of patients who can be discharged or transferred to an alternative care centre must be timely. Patients will beconsidered clinically stable when, in the preceding 24 hours 171: Their mental state returned to normal (or baseline) They are able to maintain oral intake Their vital signs remained within a specified threshold. Cut-off values should be established (e.g., O2saturation > 90%, heart rate /c163100/minute, respiratory rate /c16324/minute, blood systolic pressure /c17990 mm Hg, temperature /c16338\u00b0C). Once the patients are clinically stable for at least 24 hours, symptoms and signs have improved, oral therapy is being given, and they are functionally independent, discharge fromthe hospital with designated follow up may be considered. The use of an alternative centre ofcare (domiciliary care) should be contemplated if more prolonged observation is necessaryfor patients with pneumonia, co-morbidities, or for individuals who are not functionallyindependent. Release and follow-up: If the patient is sent home, provide a copy of:a) Assessment sheetb) Instructions for self-managementc) Contact names/numbers to notify if they deteriorate clinicallyd) Arrangements for home care/follow-up as required: usually 48 hours later for adults and 24 hours for children. e) Arrangements for alternate care may be required by some patients 296 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20045.4 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Management of patients in the ICU will be similar to interpandemic influenza care. The clinical presentation of the disease and the availability of resources will determine which changes maybe desirable throughout the pandemic. Infection control in the ICU, on the other hand, will beessential to avoid transmission of the virus to critically ill, non-influenza, patients. The isolationof influenza patients should be planned in advance . 5.5 Death Registration (see Infection control guideline for information on mortuary care) A substantial increase in mortality throughout the pandemic is anticipated. To ensure appropriate handling of bodies, a plan for death registration must be developed beforehand. Death registration is a provincial/territorial (P/T) responsibility and each P/T has its own laws, regulations, and administrative practices to register a death. Therefore, provincial regulationsmust be followed. In the pandemic situation, each jurisdiction should have a body collection plan in place to ensure that there is no unnecessary delay in moving a body to the (temporary) morgue. If theperson's death does not meet any of the criteria for needing to be reported to a coroner, thenthe person could be moved to a holding area soon after being pronounced dead. Then,presumably on a daily basis, a physician could be found to complete the death certificate. Funeral directors generally have standing administrative policies that prohibit them from collecting a body from the community or an institution until there is a completed certificate ofdeath. In the event of a pandemic with many bodies, it seems likely that funeral directors couldwork out a more flexible practice if directed to do so by some central authority (e.g., provincialattorney general). These special arrangements must be planned in advance of the pandemicand take the regional differences in resources, geography, and population into consideration.

Once the pandemic strain is confirmedin a community, virologic tests will be needed only to confirm diagnosis in atypical cases andfor surveillance purposes. Rapid tests are useful for diagnostic and treatment decisions (seeAppendix 5.II). Isolation and culture of the virus is needed for surveillance purposes. Ideally, all purulent sputum will be analysed by Gram staining and culture (and in some cases, sensitivity tests), to identify infecting bacteria and their susceptibility. If culture is not possible,at least Gram staining should be attempted. Ideally, blood cultures should be obtained when the white blood cell number is over 12,000/ml, or less than 3,000/ml, the percentage of bands is higher than 15%, or ifpneumonia is suspected. If resources are scarce, blood cultures will be reserved for patientswho are very ill, with toxic signs and low blood pressure; for patients who fail to recover after 48hours of treatment with antibiotics; or for patients admitted to intensive care units.

Rapid Virologic Diagnostic tests After the first isolation of the pandemic strain in Canada, diagnostic tests will be needed to follow the course of the pandemic in the country and for the timely detection of the virus indifferent communities. Early diagnosis will direct prophylaxis and may allow limiting thepandemic spread until vaccines are available. Similarly, in isolated rural areas and in northerncommunities as well as in semi-closed groups in urban areas (e.g., jails and long term carefacilities), the early detection of the virus will permit the institution of appropriate measures tocontrol the spread of the outbreak and to start prophylaxis and/or treatment of high-riskcontacts and of indispensable individuals. Once the pandemic strain has been isolated in a community, virologic tests will be required only for surveillance purposes (virus isolation), and to test atypical cases if the result of the testwill change the management of the patient and/or contacts (rapid tests and, in some cases,virus isolation). Rapid diagnostic tests detect influenza antigens or viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions or swabs, nasal wash, or sputum (see Table). Rapid tests for novel viruses ofpandemic potential should be developed during the inter-pandemic period. At the time of apandemic, rapid methods that will detect the new pandemic strain will have to be identified;information regarding the reliable and affordable methods should be communicated to thefront-line diagnostic laboratories. Samples should be collected within the first 4 days of illness.The quality of the sample is critical for the sensitivity of the test, and nasopharyngeal aspiratesare the best samples. 226,31. Using culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity for most rapid tests that can be done in a physician's office is approximately 70% and the specificity is about 90% (i.e., that ~ 30% ofsamples that will be positive by viral culture may give negative results by rapid tests, and about10% of positive tests will be false-positives 31). Point-of-care tests have a role in the timely diagnosis of outbreaks and in providing guidance for antiviral treatment or prophylaxis. However, rapid tests cannot replace culture but need tobe used in combination with viral culture. This is because presently only culture can identifysubtypes and aid with surveillance and vaccine planning. 306 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Table 5.1.

Antiviral Drugs for preventing and treating influenza Two classes of drugs, adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (NI, zanamivir and oseltamivir) are currently available for prevention and treatmentof influenza 211,3. Adamantanes act by inhibiting the activity of the M2 protein, required for the release of viral genetic material inside the cells126,211 . These drugs reduce viral shedding and decrease the duration of illness by approximately one day if started within 48 hours of illnessonset 40,164,213 . However, reduction of complications, or improved outcomes for hospitalized patients has not been adequately evaluated yet. Amantadine is the only adamantaneapproved in Canada for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza; it is active only againstinfluenza A 126,34. Intolerance, and the rapid development of resistance to amantadine and rimantadine are major limitations to the use of these agents. Resistance is the consequence of a single pointmutation in the M2 gene that completely abolishes the binding of the drug without affectingthe transmission to susceptible contacts 98. Adamantanes have a relatively long half-life, and, since amantadine depends on renal function for excretion, dose adjustments and closesupervision are required in cases of renal insufficiency. In addition, central nervous systemside effects are relatively frequent after amantadine (10-30%) 40,211. Teratogenicity as well as embryo-toxic effects have been reported in animals, and studies of pregnant women receivingamantadine to treat Parkinson's disease, show variable adverse effects in the offspring,including miscarriage 83,91. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NI), on the other hand, inhibit the neuraminidase molecule (NA), indispensable for the release of new-formed virus from infected cells. Neuraminidaseinhibitors are active against human influenza A (all 9 known NA molecules) and B viruses, andalso against avian viruses 210,212,211 . Two drugs of this group are presently approved in Canada for the treatment of influenza infections: zanamivir, which is delivered by an aerosol andoseltamivir, an oral drug. Zanamivir has a short plasma half-life, but it can be found in thetracheobronchial tree for over 24 hours after inhalation of a single dose. It should be used withcaution in patients with underlying airway disease (asthma or COPD) because of thepossibility of bronchospasm, an infrequent but potentially serious side effect 211,40. Oseltamivir, on the other hand, requires dose reduction for patients with low creatinine clearance (<30mL/min) 1. Gastrointestinal intolerance (usually lasting less than a day) occurs in 5-15% of oseltamivir recipients but seldom (< 2%) leads to drug discontinuation. Oseltamivir causes noother important side effects 213. Neuraminidase inhibitors decrease the duration of illness approximately by one day, when used within 48 hours of the onset of illness211. Although there are no studies to date demonstrating improved outcomes after hospitalizations or reduced mortality after treatmentof patients with influenza with NI, a drop in antibiotic use for lower respiratory complications,and fewer secondary complications such as clinically diagnosed bronchitis and sinusitis havebeen reported 213. Neuraminidase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use only recently (19991), therefore, more studies are required to confirm their safety and activity in preventing and treating influenza in high-risk individuals. 308 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Prophylaxis and Treatment with Antiviral Drugs Indications, Doses, Toxicity The current indications (year 2002) for the use of antivirals in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza in Canada are3: 1.Amantadine (SymmetrelR): Prophylaxis : Prevention of respiratory infections caused by influenza A virus strains. Treatment : Treatment of respiratory infections caused by influenza A strains. 2.Zanamivir (RelenzaR): Treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza virus in patients 12 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days . 3.Oseltamivir (TamifluR): Prophylaxis : Since December 2003, oseltamivir is licensed in Canada for prophylaxis in adults and adolescents 13 years of age and older. The safety and efficacy of oseltamivirfor prophylaxis in pediatric patients younger than 13 years of age have not beenestablished. Please refer to the Health Canada website http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ for futurerecommendations by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. Treatment : of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza infection in adults who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. Amantadine is protective when used for prophylaxis up to a 6-week period. When used for treatment, the drug does not interfere with the development of protective antibodies. Drugresistance has been induced with amantadine, when used for prophylaxis and concurrenttreatment in outbreaks. Special issues need to be considered when amantadine is used forprophylaxis, especially for a long period (6 weeks was the longest period formally studied incontrolled trials). These issues include 1the need for individualized prescriptions for amantadine use due to its low toxic: therapeutic ratio and its dependency on renal function forelimination 2, the need to monitor subjects for side effects and3the need to consider the relatively high risk of emergence of drug-resistant virus and to adjust the management ofpatients when prophylaxis fails and treatment has to be started 3. Neuraminidase inhibitors showed efficacy for post-exposure prophylaxis and for treatment of influenza infections. To date, resistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir has been shown to occurinfrequently in normal hosts 210,211 . In one immunocompromised child treated with zanamivir for influenza, zanamivir resistant virus was detected210,89, but to this time, intensive surveillance for resistant mutants has demonstrated that NI-resistance emerges uncommonlyduring therapy. Intense surveillance for NI-resistance emergence is ongoing (F. Aoki, personalcommunication). On the other hand, viruses resistant to zanamivir have been isolated in vitro,after passages in cell cultures, and the mutations that abolish the binding of the drug havebeen characterized 210,90. Since the functional groups of the two neuraminidase-inhibitors have some differences in their binding sites, mutants resistant to one drug may be susceptible tothe other 210,90.

Please refer to the current product monographs for dosage recommendations. ** Level of evidence (I-V) and Grade of Recommendation (A-C)3. Grade A recommendation for therapy (i.e., good support) requires the support of level I evidence (i.e., evidence from at least one properly randomizedcontrolled trial, or from trials with large samples, or from meta-analysis of multiple smaller studies withconsistent results). aFor children 1-9 years of age the recommended doses of amantadine are: 5.0 mg/kg per day, up to a maximum of 150mg/day, in two divided doses. For children (10 years old, who weigh > 40 kg, the recommended dosesare 200 mg/day in two doses 1,3,152. Treatment will continue until defervescence, up to a maximum of 3-5 days. For prophylaxis up to 6 weeks. Doses have to be reduced and monitored in individuals with seizures (100mg/day) and in individuals with renal dysfunction.

Serious effects have been observed, however, associated with high plasma concentrations of the drug. Toxicity is observed morefrequently in individuals with renal insufficiency, seizures, in the elderly, or after higher doses. ** Zanamivir is not recommended in individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; however, if the benefits surpass the risks, the drug should be used with caution and under proper monitoringand supportive care. Drug interactions Limited clinical data are available regarding drug interactions and careful observation is recommended when administered concurrently with drugs that affect the nervous system,antihistamines, or drugs that may interfere with the excretion by the kidneys (i.e., probenecid). Package inserts should be consulted . New developments New drugs are being developed for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections, and such developments may change the existing guidelines. Particularly, a single dose dimerizedzanamivir 177is presently in early trials, and may be a good candidate in case of a pandemic. Pandemic use of antivirals Limited data are available about the potential of antivirals to prevent infection and/or treatdisease in pandemic situations. Amantadine was observed to be efficacious and safe forprevention and treatment of infection due to influenza A/Hong Kong/68 in the year after itsappearance in 1968. During a pandemic, the antiviral strategy should utilize all anti-influenza drugs available to Canadians. Either M2 ion channel inhibitors (e.g., amantadeine) or neurominidase inhibitors(e.g., oseltamivir) can be used for prophylaxis but only neuraminidase inhibitors should beused for treatment. 312 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Rationale for the roles of amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors (Annex E): 1. Rapid emergence of resistance has been observed during amantadine treatment but resistance has been uncommonly observed during therapy with neuraminidaseinhibitors. 2. Neuraminidase inhibitors are currently approved for treatment. Oseltamivir is now licensed for prophylaxis in adults and adolescents over 13 years of age . 3. Although neuraminidase inhibitors are associated with fewer side effects and viral resistance may be less likely to develop as compared to amantadine, evidence that theyhave a greater efficacy than amantadine for prophylaxis is still required. The cost of thesedrugs is substantially greater than that of amantadine. Chemoprophylaxis is not a substitute for vaccination; however, it is expected that vaccines are not going to be available (or will be available only in limited amounts), during the first monthsof a pandemic. In addition, not all patients can be vaccinated and some individuals may needsupplementary protection until their antibodies reach a protective level or because theirimmune system is defective. Since the pandemic strain will be new for the population, asecond dose of the vaccine may be required before protective immunity is developed;therefore, protective prophylaxis may be needed for up to 6 weeks: 4 weeks after the first doseand 2 after the second dose 1. It is expected that there will be a limited supply of anti-influenza drugs available during a pandemic; therefore, priorities for the use of these agents have been established.Epidemiological surveillance during the pandemic will confirm these priorities or identify newpriority groups. (Preliminary) priority groups (Annex E) Annex G /c45313 February 2004The following groups in descending order of priority, are offered as planning guidance but will need to be re-examined at the time of a pandemic alert when epidemiologic data about the pandemicvirus is available. 1. Treatment of persons hospitalized for influenza2. Treatment of ill health care and emergency services workers3. Treatment of ill high-risk persons* in the community4. Prophylaxis of health care workers5. Control outbreaks in high-risk residents of institutions (nursing homes and other chronic care facilities) 6. Prophylaxis of essential service workers7. Prophylaxis of high-risk persons* hospitalized for illnesses other than influenza8. Prophylaxis of high-risk persons* in the community *Note : during a pandemic the definition of high risk persons may change based on epidemiologic evidence. The mass prophylaxis of children to control a pandemic is currently not recommended.Appendix 5.IV. Antibiotics Antimicrobial therapy will be indicated for treatment of patients with secondary bacterial pneumonia130,140,63 . Acute bacterial sinusitis is another secondary bacterial infection, but antimicrobials are not indicated for this complication unless symptoms are severe. Otitismedia, another potential bacterial superinfection, is uncommon in adults but very common inchildren. Diagnosis of secondary bacterial pneumonia should be considered with: 1. Clinical deterioration after a period of clinical improvement following the initial onset of influenza; especially if there is a new onset of purulent sputum or dyspnea. 2. Radiographic consolidation.Purulent sputum without radiographic consolidation is not an indication for antimicrobial therapy, unless the patient has pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Expectoration of purulent sputum with a normal chest radiograph, concomitant or shortlyafter the onset of influenza (up to 14 days), however, suggests bacterial bronchitis. If it issevere, or occurs in individuals vulnerable to superinfection, the use of antibiotics should beconsidered 171. In any upper respiratory tract infection, runny nose and sinus inflammation (Rhinosinusitis) are common. In some cases, when severe symptoms are present or persist for more than10-14 days, a bacterial sinusitis may be present. Acute sinusitis presents clinically withpurulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain (especially unilateral), unilateral sinustenderness, and worsening of these symptoms after initial improvement of influenza. Inchildren, suspected sinusitis at 10 days to 2 weeks of symptoms would likely be treated,although it may not be in adults. Acute bacterial sinusitis does not require antibiotic treatmentif symptoms are mild or moderate. Most patients with a clinical diagnosis of rhinosinusitisimprove without antibiotic treatment and, therefore, only appropriate doses of analgesics,antipyretics and decongestants should be offered. Only patients with severe or persistentsymptoms and clinical findings specific for bacterial sinusitis should be treated withantimicrobials. Narrow spectrum antibiotics are reasonable first line agents for these patients. Issues to be considered in providing antimicrobial therapy in the pandemic influenza setting include: The availability of antimicrobials during a pandemic may be limited because of increaseddemand. Provincial and federal governments should have antibiotics stockpiled for such acontingency. However, the potential limited supply means antimicrobials should beprescribed judiciously. Influenza infection, by itself, without secondary bacterial complications, should not be treated with antimicrobials. A wide variety of antimicrobial agents will be effective for the treatment of secondarybacterial pneumonia. As a general rule, it is not desirable to treat all individuals with thesame antibiotic, as this may promote resistance to that antimicrobial and limit efficacy. A variety of antimicrobials that are effective are listed in Table 1. Antimicrobials for empiric treatment should be reviewed and updated regularly, considering the availability ofnew antimicrobials and the evolution of bacterial resistance among respiratorypathogens . Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen isolated frequently in secondary bacterial pneumonia and initial antimicrobial therapy should include coverage for methicillin 314 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004susceptible Staphylococcus which provide a broader coverage for resistant organismsshould be considered in selected circumstances: patients known to previously have hadinfection with a resistant organism; patients who have failed or recurred following initialantimicrobial therapy; and patients who have severe clinical presentations includingrespiratory failure or hemodynamic instability. Antimicrobial resistance is a consideration in antimicrobial selection. Current levels ofresistance are low but increasing, and the clinical impact of antimicrobial resistance inrespiratory infections remains controversial. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance incommon respiratory pathogens should be monitored in the pre-pandemic period andduring the pandemic in patients with bacterial pneumonia. This information must beprovided to practicing physicians in a timely manner. For adult patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, a sputumspecimen for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained, whenever possible.Once culture results are available, usually in 48-72 hours, antimicrobial therapy should bereassessed and modified based on these results. Sputum specimens from ambulatorypatients would not be routinely recommended, but should be obtained if patients haverecently received antimicrobial therapy, or if the clinical response to initial antimicrobialtherapy is sub optimal. Patients not admitted to hospital may be treated with oral therapy. Patientsadmitted to hospital will usually require parenteral therapy, but oral therapy may beconsidered for selected cases. Parenteral therapy should be modified to oraltherapy once the patient has stabilized. The selection of an antimicrobial agent willbe based on sputum and blood culture and sensitivity results, patient tolerance,local prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, and availability.

When possible, the Gram stain of sputum or trachealaspirate should be obtained. If not, an empiric treatment should be started (based on thefrequency of pathogens for the different age groups and on the most common agentsidentified in the community) 121,157,143 . Children with mild disease can be treated at home; however, hospitalization (or alternative centre of care) will be indicated for very young children(first year of life), those children with severe disease, those who look toxic and/or have severepulmonary dysfunction, and also for those children who may not receive appropriate care athome.

Special circumstances 6.1 Remote Rural areas and Aboriginal Communities The last Census of Population, in 2001, revealed that 79.4% of Canadians live in urban areas with a population of 10,000 people or more202. This also means that about 6.2 millions of Canadians live in communities with a population of less than 10,000 individuals, includingseveral communities of less than 1,000 individuals. Although some of these groups live insemi-urban settings adjacent to metropolitan areas in the south of Canada, about 6% of thetotal Canadian population (i.e., about 1.8 million persons, 30% of them aboriginal people) livein remote areas in the north, \"shaped by distances, weather, limited resources, and littlebackup from urban centres\" 139. Registered Nurses are the predominant primary healthcare providers for remote and isolated communities in the north, and for southern rural areas. They work in community healthclinics, outpost nursing stations, small rural hospitals and other facilities. In small towns ofless than 5,000 inhabitants, the hospital (if there is one) is usually the only health-care facilityavailable, and nurses (less than three in any shift) manage patients in collaboration withon-call physicians (frequently living 100 km or more away). Patients who cannot be managedin their communities are transported by air or road to secondary or tertiary centres,sometimes located at considerable distances (200 or more kilometres) 139,111 . In some northern First Nations' and Inuit communities, low density of human population has led to regional, instead of community-centred services. While resident nurses andparaprofessionals provide primary health care for larger populations, smaller communitieshave only a community health representative who works alone, with the support of a nursevisiting once a week and of long distance telephone consultations. In the event of a crisis,patients have to be taken out to larger urban centres. In some areas four out of fivecommunities are accessible only by airplane 20,111. Co-morbidities Past epidemics of respiratory illness in remote communities in the north were characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Particularly influenza A has been associated with high attackrates (86-100%) and high case fatality (5-10%, sometimes higher). Improvements in healthcare decreased the burden of disease, but it remains higher than in the rest of the country 217. The reasons for that include co-morbidity factors like high prevalence of underlying lungdisease, environmental factors like smoking and living under crowded conditions in houseswith poor ventilation, and low antibody levels to common pathogens 217,6. Inuit infants suffer from a high rate of low respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and often require mechanical ventilation. Their rate of admission to hospital for LRTI is one of the highest of theworld, and infant mortality in the north is at least twice the Canadian average 6. Annex G /c45319 February 2004First Nations' communities in the north have a high prevalence of coronary disease and type-2 diabetes and the incidence of myocardial infarction is increasing111. After the pandemic is declared in Canada, most influenza patients living in remote areas will have to be managed within their communities, without transferring them to larger cities. Thisrequires that each community elaborate guidelines in advance, to direct the appropriatemanagement of patients, medical personnel, and volunteers. The inter-pandemic epidemicssuffered almost every year in Canada are an opportunity to develop such strategies and testtheir efficacy. Each community will need:a) A policy for the management of an outbreak, with timely diagnosis and appropriate management of influenza infection in patients. b) Guidelines for the immunization of citizens, medical personnel, and volunteers once a vaccine is available (in agreement with the national influenza pandemic plan). c) Guidelines for the use of antivirals if they are available (in agreement with the national influenza pandemic plan). During the early stages of the pandemic, each communityshould ascertain access to antivirals and antibiotics. d) Plans to establish an area for triaging patients with respiratory illnesses, with resources and personnel to carry out primary and secondary assessment. e) To assign a place for the management of more acutely ill patients, where acute care (parenteral therapy and oxygen therapy) and closer monitoring and more intensivenursing care, may be performed. Emergency preparedness plans for isolated communities are critical, and the influenza pandemic guidelines should be part of these strategies. 6.1.1 Management of an influenza outbreak in isolated communities The timely detection of an outbreak in a community is essential to implement control measures and to stop the diffusion of the disease. In a pandemic situation, the first case ofconfirmed influenza would likely lead to outbreak management for pandemic influenza (seeAppendix 6.I). Every community should have in place surveillance for the early detection and control of an outbreak. This includes: 1. Preparation of a written plan for the management of an influenza outbreak, avoiding unnecessary delays. It will include the identification of diagnostic tests, responsibilities ofmedical and non-medical personnel, and use of antiviral medication. 2. Identification of a person responsible for the surveillance and for the transmission of information in the community. This will usually be the individual with responsibility forinfection control; he/she will be also in charge to report to the pertinent authorities whenan outbreak has been detected in the area. In an isolated community, the personresponsible for surveillance and transmission of information in an outbreak is the Nursein Charge, the most senior health professional working at the community health centre. 320 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20043. Education of all medical and non-medical volunteers of the importance of early identification and notification if a case is suspected. 4. A response capacity maintained 7 days per week.5. Specific reporting mechanisms and standardized data collection (see appendices in Chapters 2 and 4). Once the outbreak has been confirmed in the area, the authorities responsible should take all the measures required to control the propagation of the virus within the locality and toneighbour towns (see Infection control document). Studies and treatment of patients will bedone in the area assigned for this purpose, and prophylactic treatment of high-risk contactsmay be initiated (following the existing framework for antiviral prioritization during thepandemic). People in rural areas and remote communities usually face unique geographic and resource challenges in the delivery of health care. For these reasons, a pandemic plan that is suitablefor urban centres may not be adaptable to rural or remote jurisdictions. The interpandemicperiod is the best time to plan for health care delivery in an emergency. Each Province andTerritory should identify needs, capacity to respond to a pandemic threat, and alternativeoptions in both, large urban centres and in small or remote communities. The Health Protection Unit, Health and Social Services, in the North West Territories developed a protocol for the management of outbreaks, which is included in theirCommunicable Disease Manual (February 2000). Appendix 6.I. has a summary of thisprotocol, adapted to be used in an influenza pandemic. Annex G /c45321 February 20046.1.2 Triage of patients in small communities1 322 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Patient with Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) 1) Primary selfMetabolic Admit Local Health Care facility: 6.1.5Alternate care site (if available)Transported by air or land to largercity with resources to treat criticallyill patients (Medivac, etc.) 6.1.7)YesNo Needs further assessmentLegend for Table 6.1.2 1) This algorithm would apply to isolated cities or towns with a population of less than 10.000 habitants, where only emergency and sub-acute care services are available. Mostrural towns as well as some First Nation and Inuit communities may be included in thisgroup. Individuals living in these communities are usually sent to larger cities/towns whenthey need acute or chronic hospital services. It is advisable that influenza patients, or their relatives, learn to evaluate the seriousness of the disease, and to determine if they can care for themselves at home or need furtherassessment. Appendix 2.I. contains some helpful self-evaluation criteria and instructionsfor self-treatment. Basic instruction can be given to the general public by TV (anexplanatory video), radio, newspapers, pamphlets, and the Internet. Telephoneconsultation (or consultation through Internet) with competent personnel or volunteerstrained for this purpose, may be provided. Triage centres may be located at community health clinics, outpost nursing stations, small rural hospitals and other places like pharmacies, schools, churches, communitycentres, military field hospitals, etc. A special \"emergency\" area for the triage, secondaryassessment and treatment of influenza patients, should be assigned. This should bedifferent from the area regularly used for the triage and treatment of other emergencies.The Health-Care-Centre may be the only recognized centre of treatment in some areas;to alleviate the burden at these centres, alternative places of triage and care and appropriate staffing and resources should be planned in advance . At the triage centre, all patients will be evaluated following the primary assessment algorithmsdescribed in section 6.1.2 (see also Chapter 2). Some patients more seriously ill mayneed further evaluation (secondary assessment, section 6.1.3). Treatment and advicemay be given. Some health care sites will be able to handle patients more critically ill aswell as providing sub-acute care. 2) For some small communities (some have less than 1000 individuals) it may not be possible to operate an alternate centre of care. In these situations, the triage site may be adesignated area close to, or in the health care centre. Additional staff must be trained anddedicated to these designated areas in advance of the pandemic, because one or twonurses constitute all the health-care personnel available in these communities. In somesmall communities, the only health centre available is designed to house patients for upto four hours, until evacuation to hospital is possible. Those patients requiring attention,who cannot be cared for by family, friends or home support workers, may have to beevacuated to a larger centre in other community. Annex G /c45323 February 20046.1.3 Initial assessment The initial assessment and evaluation of respiratory patients should be consistent with advance directives, and may include the following (see Chapter 2): a) History: age, co-morbid illnesses, respiratory and extra-respiratory symptoms, time of onset. b) Physical assessment: temperature, skin colour, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, chest auscultation, chest pain on inspiration, peripheral oedema, mental status, function(ability to function independently, continuous vomiting, etc.). c) For patients who are clinically stable and not judged to be severely ill this may be sufficient. 6.1.4 Secondary assessment When there are concerns about metabolic status, or the degree of illness of an individual, additional tests may be considered. These may include (see Chapter 2): CBC with white cell count, Electrolytes, Blood glucose, CPK, BUN and creatinine, EKG if there is a history of cardiovascular disease and/or evidence of significantdeterioration in cardiac status. Diagnostic testing should include 0 2saturation, and a chest x-ray should be considered for patients with an oxygen saturation of /c3590% on room air, with new purulent sputum, or respiratory rate /c3630 per minute. A sputum culture may be helpful for patients producing purulent sputum (depending on the availability of resources, see Chapter 2). Laboratory and radiology testing will be very limited. For most health centres in small communities, routine testing is WBC and blood glucose. Chest X-rays and O2 saturation maybe done to those who are suspected to have pneumonia, to confirm diagnosis and to decide ifthey have to be transferred to a larger centre for treatment. Trained support staff will beneeded to help the nurses with the testing and for the care of patients remaining in thecommunity. Other testing will have to be referred. Portable chest x-rays may be needed in some nursing stations. 324 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20046.1.5 Management of influenza patients in local health care establishments A written plan for the timely management of influenza patients who are more seriously ill, but will be treated in the community, should be prepared in advance. It will include diagnostic andfollow-up tests, responsibilities of medical and non-medical personnel, and the use of medications. Resources and support (by medical personnel and volunteers) should be planned in advance. a)Diagnostic and follow-up tests (in selected patients, see Chapter 2): Chest X-Rays Blood tests, urine analysis, etc. Viral/Bacterial studies: sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate. b)General management : The goals of general management are to maintain comfort, to preserve functional status, and to limit complications. Specific aspects of managementfor influenza and its complications include: 1.Oxygenation . Patients with an oxygen saturation of <90% on room air should have oxygen supplementation. This may usually be given by portable oxygen with nasalprongs. Where this is insufficient, patients may require more aggressive efforts ofoxygenation including non-intubation methods of respiratory therapy. 2.Maintenance of hydration . This may be achieved through oral fluids or if necessary through parenteral fluids. Where parenteral fluids are necessary hypodermoclysis isan option rather than intravenous therapy and may be more practical. 3.Antipyretics and analgesics may be required to limit discomfort associated with myalgia and arthralgia. Usually acetaminophen will be sufficient. 4.Other therapies such as antitussives may occasionally be indicated depending on the clinical features of the given patient. c)Specific therapy : Specific therapy is directed at the influenza infection itself and influenza complications, including seco ndary pneumonia and/or aggravation of pre-existing disease. When antivirals/antibiotics are not available, symptom control andoxygenation may be the only management approaches. 1.Antiviral agents including amantadine (for prevention), zanamivir, and oseltamivir (for treatment) may be given for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza.Treatment with these drugs is, usually, only indicated if symptoms have beenpresent for less than 48 hours. They may not be available, depending on suppliesand on the priorities for the pandemic situation. When amantadine is used, dosageadjustment for renal function is necessary. (See Appendix 5.III) 2.Antibiotics should be given for the management of presumed or diagnosed secondary bacterial pneumonia (see Chapter 2 and Appendix 5.IV). It has beenreported that First Nations' and Inuit children have more severe low respiratoryinfections than other children hospitalized for pneumonia; the frequency andseverity of upper respiratory infections and otitis media is much higher than in otherchildren 209,6. 3.Management of preexisting disease : Cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, etc. Annex G /c45325 February 20046.1.6 Discharge Criteria Once the patients are clinically stable for at least 24 hours, symptoms and signs have improved, oral therapy is being given, and they are functionally independent, discharge fromthe local hospital (or designated health care establishment), with follow up, may beconsidered. The use of an alternative centre of care (domiciliary care) should be contemplatedif more prolonged observation is necessary for patients with pneumonia, co-morbidities, orfor individuals who are not functionally independent. Domiciliary care may also be used toalleviate local hospitals and care centres; less ill patients that for personal or social reasons are not able to self-care at home will be directed to these places. Training and support should be planned in advance. If the patient is discharged, provide a copy of:a) Assessment sheetb) Instructions for self-managementc) Contact names/numbers to notify if they deteriorate clinicallyd) Arrangements for home care/follow-up as required: usually 48 hours later for adults and 24 hours for children. e) Arrangements for alternate care if this is required. 6.1.7 Transfer to and from Acute Care facilities Severely ill patients may need to be evacuated to larger cities with appropriate services to provided complex or critical care. Territorial plans need to be established during the interpandemic period to determine evacuation criteria and to designate which hospitalswill receive patients from each community. 326 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 20046.2 Correctional and penal institutions 6.2.1 Federal Correctional Institutions Federal correctional institutions accommodate inmates who are serving 2 years plus one day or more and provincial institutions house individuals sentenced 2 years minus one day or less.Federal institutions can be classified as: maximum, medium, or minimum-securityinstitutions, and establishments with multiple levels of security. Maximum-security institutionscan generally accommodate up to 400 inmates while medium security institutions can houseup to 525 offenders and minimum-security institutions accommodate from 80 and up to 200individuals. The rated capacity for women's institutions is much lower. Health resources Health services in federal correctional institutions are provided by health care professionals who are registered or licensed in Canada. Access by inmates to health services is available ona 24-hour basis. It can be provided through on-site coverage (nursing care coverage fluctuatefrom eight to twenty-four hours, depending on the institution security level and location), onan on-call basis, or through other CSC institutions or community services. Contractedmedical care is provided in every federal correctional facility, either on-site or off-site. Most inmates residing in high and medium security institutions live in individual cells, where they may be treated in case of influenza infection. The majority of minimum-securityinstitutions, on the other hand, offer either residential style unit accommodation or regularcell units. Most institutions also have a special area, with some \"medical beds\", for patientswho need special attention and may be treated in the same establishment. However, thesebeds are not used regularly, because of the lack of nursing supervision after regularoperational hours. In case of a pandemic, and provided that they receive night care, such bedsmay be useful to treat more seriously ill influenza patients within the same institutions 39. 6.2.2 Provincial Correctional Institutions Provincial institutions can also be classified as maximum, medium, or minimum-security institutions; they provide lodging to individuals sentenced 2 years minus one day or less(about 87,000 per year, roughly 8.000 in a given day). Health resources (this applies only to Ontario) Provincial correctional institutions receive the regular support of registered nurses (380 nurses in Ontario, about 3 nurses per shift per institution). The number of hours of availableon-site nursing care coverage varied from sixteen to twenty-four hours per day, depending onthe size and location of the institution. Contracted medical care is provided in an \"on call\"manner. Inmates live in cells (2 or 3 individuals per cell) or share dormitories (about 12 individuals each). It would be possible to segregate them to private/semi-private areas where they may betreated in case of influenza infection. Most institutions also have a special \"health-care\" area,with some beds for patients who need special attention and may be treated in the sameestablishment. In case of a pandemic, and provided that they receive nursing care, these bedsmay be useful to treat influenza patients within the same institutions. Emergencies that cannotbe treated in the same institution may be referred for treatment to close community hospitals.Provincial institutions count with the same facilities available to neighbour communities. Annex G /c45327 February 20046.2.3 Triage of patients in correctional institutions*: Federal and provincial correctional institutions 328 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004Patient with Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) (Chapter 1 & 2) Non-flu centre Uncomplicated influenzaNo co-morbidityStable with co-morbidity Treatment in cell :Chapter 2, Appendix 2.12Secondary Clinical Assessment: (6..2.3.2)Symptoms consistent with influenza Initial Clinical Assessment : (6.2.3.1)1 Health Care Area in the same centreTransported to an acute care facility with resources to treatcritically ill patientsNo Yes Pneumonia and Co-morbidity Acute confusionInability to for selfMetabolic derangementRespiratory failureAcute cardiac deteriorationLegend for Table 6.2.3 1. A special \"emergency\" area should be assigned for the triage, assessment and treatment of influenza patients. All patients will be evaluated following the primary assessmentalgorithms described in Chapter 2, and some patients more seriously ill may need furtherevaluation (secondary assessment, Chapter 2). 2. Some influenza patients will be able to care for themselves in their cells; Appendix 2.I. (Chapter 2) contains some helpful self-evaluation criteria and instructions forself-treatment. Other patients, however, may need more intensive care in a special areaassigned for this purpose. Only critically ill patients may be transported to an acute carecentre. A goal, in the pandemic situation, will be to manage patients within the same institution without transferring them to an acute care facility. This will require that each institutiondesignate an area for the acute care of inmates, with some monitoring and nursing care. Mostlarge federal institutions, and some provincial institutions, already have an area for sub-acutecare that can be used for this purpose in case of a pandemic. Prior to any pandemic, correctional institutions should develop policies that will support appropriate management of inmates and personnel. The inter-pandemic epidemics sufferedalmost every year are excellent opportunities to develop such policies and test their efficacy.Non-compulsive vaccination of inmates in federal correction centres is performed every year,before the beginning of the \"flu-season\". Pandemic preparedness should include: a) An institutional policy for the management of influenza outbreaks.b) Implement immunization of inmates and personnel when/if vaccine is available.c) Plans for the establishment of an area within the facility for management of more acutely ill patients. These plans should also include 24 hours of nursing care forinfluenza patients who require close observation or care. 6.2.3.1 Initial assessment of patients with an influenza like illness: The initial assessment and evaluation of the inmates will include(see also Chapter 2, Table 2.1.1) d) History: age, length of residence in the detention centre, co-morbid illnesses, documentation of previous influenza vaccinations, time of onset of symptoms. e) Physical assessment: temperature, skin color, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, peripheral edema, chest auscultation, chest pain on inspiration, mental status, function(vomiting, etc.). f) For individuals who are clinically stable and not judged to be severely ill this may be sufficient. Annex G /c45329 February 20046.2.3.2. Secondary assessment (Chapter 2, Table 2.1.3) If there are concerns about metabolic status, or the degree of illness of an inmate, additional tests may be done, as required by the clinical presentation (ideally CBC with white cell count,electrolytes, blood glucose, CPK, BUN, creatinine, an EKG if there is a history ofcardiovascular disease and/or evidence of significant deterioration in cardiac status). Somecorrectional institutions have the facilities to do blood work regularly - in some institutions itcan be done daily or biweekly (depending mostly of the size and location of the institution). Depending on the availability of resources, the determination of 02 saturation in patients severely ill will be desirable. Individuals with an oxygen saturation of (90% on room air, withnew purulent sputum, or respiratory rate (30 per minute should have a chest X-Rayperformed. A sputum culture may be obtained from patients who are producing sputum andappear to be severely toxic or who have pneumonia (see Chapter 2 for further guidelines). Most federal maximum and medium institutions have X-Ray equipment and technician in place (the number of clinics per week depends of the size of the institution). Minimum-securityinstitutions are affiliated with larger institutions with which they share the ground and somehealth care services such as radiography and laboratory services. Some provincial institutionsalso count with X-Ray equipment. Correctional centres should have in place arrangements by which timely chest X-Rays and laboratory results may be obtained (conditional upon availability and pandemic guidelines,see Chapter 2), and should also consider a phone reporting system to ensure that results arereturned promptly and in a standardized fashion. 6.2.3.3 Co-morbidities Some inmates may suffer from diseases that will increase their risk for complicated influenza, like diabetes, COPD, asthma, etc. (see Chapter 1). In addition, the percentage of offenderswho smoke is very high and high rates of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C (up to 22% in some federal jails), HIV/AIDS ( /c1791.6% in some federal jails), tuberculosis, etc. are frequently observed in this population. The presence of one or more of these co-morbidities should beconsidered when treating or preventing influenza infections in inmates. 6.2.3.4 Instructions for the management of subjects remaining in correctional establishments A written plan for the management of more seriously ill influenza patients who stay in the establishment should be in place in each institution. This will include diagnostic and follow-uptests, responsibilities of medical and non-medical personnel, and use of medication(consistent with the national pandemic plan). a)Diagnostic and follow-up tests : as required (conditional on availability and the national pandemic guideline, see Chapter 2): Chest X-Rays Blood tests, urine analysis, etc. Viral/Bacterial studies: sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate. 330 /c45Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan February 2004b)General management : Specific aspects of management of influenza and its complications may include: 1.Oxygenation . Patients with an oxygen saturation of <90% on room air should have oxygen supplementation. This may usually be given by portable oxygen with nasalprongs. Where this is insufficient, patients may require more aggressive efforts ofoxygenation including non-intubation methods of respiratory therapy. 2.Antipyretics and analgesics may be required to limit discomfort associated with myalgia and arthralgia. Usually acetaminophen will be sufficient. 3.Maintenance of hydration . This may be achieved through oral fluids or if necessary through parenteral fluids. 4.Other therapies such as antitussives may occasionally be indicated depending on the clinical features of the given patient. c)Specific therapy : Specific therapy is directed at the influenza infection itself and influenza complications including secondary pneumonia and/or aggravation ofpre-existing disease. When antivirals/antibiotics are not available, symptom control andoxygenation may be the only resources. 1. Antiviral agents including amantadine (for prevention), zanamivir, and oseltamivir (for treatment) may be given for the prevention and treatment of influenza.Treatment with these drugs is, usually, only indicated if symptoms have beenpresent for less than 48 hours. They may not be available, depending on suppliesand on the priorities for the pandemic situation. When amantadine is used attentionto renal function must be assured (See Appendix 5.III). 2. Antibiotics should be given only for the management of secondary bacterial pneumonia (abide by availability and pandemic guideline, see Appendix 5.IV). 3. Management of preexisting disease: Cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, AIDS/hepatitis C, etc. 6.2.3.5 Transfer to and from Acute Care facilities A goal, in the pandemic situation, will be to manage patients within the same correctional institution; however, some patients may need to be moved to an acute care facility for moreintensive treatment. The regulation of these transfers should be planned in theinterpandemic period. Annex G /c45331 February 2004References 1. ACIP April 20, 2001, posting date. Prevention and control of influenza.
