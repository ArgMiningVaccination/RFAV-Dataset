[#VaxforKids](https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/educational-assets-1) - resources to promote the COVID-19 vaccine for 6 months and older. [#VaxtoSchool](https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/educational-assets) - resources to promote the COVID-19 vaccine for school age kids in grades K-12. The New York State Department of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and pediatricians across New York and around the country, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend that all eligible babies, toddlers, and children 6 months and older stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines. If you're the parent of a baby or toddler, you might be wondering whether you should get your child vaccinated against COVID-19. You may have questions, as well as some concerns, about whether it's safe, effective, and even necessary. The COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and provides the best possible protection for your child against getting very sick from the virus. This website has information and resources including frequently asked questions and answers, resources, and scheduling information for each eligible age group. Data from the American Academy of Pediatrics shows that pediatric cases continue to increase and more than 13 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 in the U.S since the pandemic began. Getting your child vaccinated can help keep them: from getting really sick if they get COVID-19; in school or day care; and safely participating in sports, playdates, and other family activities. Children who get COVID-19 can develop serious complications like multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). COVID-19 vaccination reduced the likelihood of MIS-C in ages 12-18 years by 91%. Parents and guardians are encouraged to contact their child's healthcare provider about scheduling a vaccine appointment for children under five years of age. Parents and guardians can also visit vaccines.gov, text their ZIP code to 438829, or call 1-800-232-0233 to find nearby locations. Please note, due to federal regulation, pharmacies are only able to vaccinate children three years and older. If you are scheduling a vaccine appointment at a pharmacy for your child three years and older, you may need an authorization code from your pediatrician to validate their age. Make sure the provider is administering the vaccine to children under five years of age.
