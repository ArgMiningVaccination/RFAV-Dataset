In the process of aging, the risk of many chronic diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson's and cardiovascular diseases increase [2]. Numerous studies indicate that nutrients, food components and whole diets can influence cognitive and ageing [1]. Nutrients are basic for survival and growth of organisms. However, people usually consume foods that are available or palatable. In addition, with the development of food processing technology, nutritional composition of food can be largely affected by the processing. Therefore, it is urgent to produce foods that are palatable, nutritional and capable to fight against aging process. Colla corii asini (E'jiao), a solid glue prepared from donkey (Equus asinus) skin, has been considered as a health-care food and used as a traditional Chinese medicine in life-nourishing and clini - cal antianemic therapy for more than 2000 years [3]. E'jiao is main - ly composed of amino acids, low molecular weight hydrolyzates of collagen proteins, polysaccharides, volatile substances and inorganic substances [4]. It has attracted great attention due to its biological activities in hematopoiesis, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-ageing, improving immunity, etc [5-8]. E'jiao Gao (EJG), one of the popular edible forms of E'jia o, is made up of E'jiao, walnut, semen sesame nigrum and rice wine. The walnut is a high nutritional food containing high contents of protein, essential fatty acids, polyphenols and to copherols, which has been re-ported to reduce risk of cancer, coronary heart disease and to improve antioxidant as well as antiproliferative activity [9,10]. Semen sesame nigrum not only benefits in nourishing the liver and anti-ageing, but also in anti-wrinkling, keeping the balance of nerves and beautify - ing [11]. Rice wine is popular in China and is not only for drinking but also for medical use in traditional Chinese medicine all over the country. Rice wine has been claimed to have physiological functions in preventing aging, cancer and cardio cardiovascular diseases [12]. Free radicals are one of the reasons that associated with aging. In organisms, there are two antioxidant defense systems, antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds, preventing or - ganisms from damages of free radicals [2]. However, oxidative stress occurs when antioxidant defense systems is too weak to scavenge the Cao F, et al., J Food Sci Nutr 2019, 5: 043 DOI: 10.24966/FSN-1076/100043 HSOA Journal of Food Science and & Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 2National Engineering Technology Research Center of Glue of Traditional Medicine, Shandong Dong-E-E-Jiao Co., Ltd., Donge, Shandong, ChinaNutrient Compositions and Antioxidant Capacity of E'jiao Gao Abstract Background Aging is a major public health issue and is considered to be as- sociated with oxidative stress. Additionally, foods are basic for nu- trients, survival and growth of organisms, and are a good source for antioxidants. E'jiao Gao (EJG, made up of E'jiao, walnut, semen sesame nigrum and rice wine) is a well-known traditional food in China, however, little nutritional and bioactive information is avail - able. Therefore, in the present study, nutritional compositions of EJG, including protein, amino acid, vitamins, fatty acid and mineral contents, were investigated. Furthermore, 55 female aging ICR mice were used to evaluate the anti-aging activity of EJG in vivo, and their antioxidant enzyme activities, including SOD, GPx and CAT, and MDA contents were determined. Results EJG is abundant in protein, amino acids, vitamin E, essential fatty acids (linoleic acid and linolenic acid), mineral elements (calcium, potassium, magnesium,) and other biological nutrients (selenium, zinc and iron). After administrated with EJG, the activities of SOD, GPx and CAT were remarkably improved (P<0.05) and the content of MDA remarkably decreased (P<0.05). Conclusion Overall, EJG is a functional food for supplementation of protein, vitamin E, amino acid or calcium, and is a potential food for promot- ing the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzyme to fight against aging. Therefore, these data are essential theoretical basis for the development of the traditional food of EJG and useful for encourag - ing people to pay attention to the nutritional composition and bioac - tivities of food they consume.

It has been reported to suppress the aging process through enhancing antioxidant activity, scavenging free radicals, and modulating expression of ag- ing-related gene [5]. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the nutri- tional composition of EJG and evaluate the effects of EJG on antiox - idant enzymes in aged mice Materials and Methods Materials and chemicals EJG was provided by Shandong Dong-E-E-Jiao Co., Ltd (Dong'e, China). The measurement kits of were purchased from Nan- jing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). The other solvents and chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical or High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) grade. Determination of main nutrients Moisture, proteins, fat and ash in the samples were analyzed ac- cording to the recommended methods of AOAC [13]. Moisture con-tent was determined using a direct drying method (the fresh sample was dried in an oven at 105 \u00b0C until constant weight. Crude protein and crude fat contents were determined using a Kjeldahl and Soxhlet methods, respectively [13]. Ash was determined by incineration at 600 \u00b115\u00b0C in a Muffle furnace for 48h [13]. Determination of detailed composition Analysis of fatty acids analysis: Fatty acids were analyzed accord - ing to [14,15]. The oil obtained by soxhlet extraction was saponified with 8mL of 2% NaOH at 80\u00b0C until the oil droplets disappeared and methylated with 7mL of 15% boron trifluoride methanol solution at 80 \u00b0C for 2min. After cooling, the n-heptane and saturated sodium chloride solution were added to obtain phase separation. The analysis was performed by a gas chromatographer (Agilent 7890A, Agilent Technologies Co. Ltd., USA) equipped with flame ionization de- tector and a column (60m\u00d70.25mm i.d.\u00d70.25md f) after the upper phase was recovered and filtered with 0.2m Nylon filter from Mil-lipore in a vial. The column temperature program was set as follows: 130 \u00b0C(1min); to 170\u00b0C at to at 4\u00b0C/min. 1.0L of sample was injected and fatty acids were identified by comparing the relative retention times with standards. Analysis of amino acids: Amino acids were determined according to [16]. The sample was hydrolyzed by 6M HCl at 110\u00b0C for 22h under nitrogen gas. The hydrolyzed mixture was filtered to remove residue and the filtrate was dried under vacuum. Before being analyzed in amino acid analyzer, the dried filtrate was redissolved in sodium ci- trate buffer (pH 2.2) and filtered with 0.2mmillipore filter. Analysis of elements: Mineral analysis, including heavy metal ele- ments (Mn), macro-elements (K, Ca, Mg) and trace elements (Fe, Zn, Se, F, I), was determined according to the Chinese National Standards (CNS). The sample was ashed at 550 \u00b0C for 4 to 5h using a muffle fur - nace. After cooling, the sample was digested with HNO3 and then di- luted with deionized water to 25mL. A blank was treated in the same way. The concentration was determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS) on the ICE 3500 Thermo Scientific or Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP MS) on the ICP-MS X2 Thermo Scientific. Analysis of vitamins: The contents of vitamin C and vitamin E were determined using a liquid chromatography method with an Agilent 1100 Auto Analyzer [17]. Analysis of antioxidant activity Animals and treatments: In the present experiments, 10 adult fe-male ICR mice (20~23g, 40~42 days old) and 55 aged female ICR mice (35~45g, 8months old) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. The animals were housed in barrier lab in Institute of Basic Research, Zhejiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 25\u00b12 \u00b0C, 50%-60% humidity and 12h daylight cycle with water and food available. After a week of adjust-able feeding, the aged mice were divided into 5 groups (n=11 for each group) and the adult mice were regarded as the young control group. The details were as follows: High-dose EJG group (72mgkg -1b.w., i,g) 60 saline (20mlkg - 1b.w., i,g) for 60 Young control group (YC): administered (20mlkg-1b.w., i,g) antioxidant system: During the experi- ment, the mice were weighed once a week and sacrificed after treat - ment for 60days. The serum was obtained from the collected blood after centrifugation using eye enucleation method. The liver and brain tissue were collected immediately, weighed and homogenized at 4 \u00b0C with normal saline to the concentration of 10% for biochemical as-say. MDA is an end-product of lipid peroxidation during oxidative stress and is frequently used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation. In addition, the contents of SOD, CAT and GPx largely represent the antioxidant capacity. Therefore, the contents of MDA and the activi - ties of SOD, CAT and GPx in the serum, liver and brain tissues were measured using the commercial kits (Nangjing Jiangcheng Bioengi - neering Institute, Nanjing, China). Statistical analysis The results were expressed as mean values\u00b1Standard Deviations (SD). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way Analysis of Vari- ance (ANOV A) using SPSS.18.0 software. A P<0.05 was indicative of significant difference. Results Chemical composition Proximate compositions of the studied EJG were presented in table 1. The contents of ash, moisture and protein in EJG were Citation: Cao F, Chen Y , Chang C, Ru W , Chen J, et al. (2019) Nutrient Compositions and Antioxidant Capacity of E'jiao Gao.

Moisture is one of the most important components of food, affecting physical, textural characteristics and self stability of food products. Lower moisture content of food products means higher nutrients and typically has longer shelf life [18]. The moisture content in EJG was found to be 11.3g/100g. The content of ash (3.4g/100g) in EJG was higher than many fruits, such The content of protein in EJG was 20.90%, and was mainly composed of 20 amino acids, including 8 essential amino acids, 10 non-essential amino acids and 2 conditionally essential amino ac-ids. 10g EJG contributes to more than 4% of the RDI. The ratio of essential amino acids to non-essential amino acids was 0.44, a little bit lower than the reference value of 0.6 recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [21]. Lysine is the first limiting amino acid in EJG when compared to the RDI. However, EJG is a rel- atively good source of cysteine, which the potent antioxidant ac-tivity against linoleate oxidation and superoxide due to its higher re- activity of the thiol toward the radical species [22]. In addition, EJG contenting 2287mg/100g, and E content of the EJG was 6.525mg/100g, and Vitamin C was 1.100mg/100g. Per 10g of the EJG represents 4.35% of RDI in vitamin E. Vitamin E is a lipophilic antioxidant that can increase the proliferation and survival of fibroblasts and elevate the production of collagen, which finally can protect skin from UVB-Irradiation [23]. Linolenic acid and linoleic acid are two essential fatty acids for human beings. In our study, the contents of linolenic acid and lin- oleic acid were 1.35g/100g and 10.42g/100g, respectively. Lack of essential fatty acids would cause slow growth as well as dermatitis, and supplementing linoleic acid and linolenic acid can prevent these symptoms [24]. What's more, linoleic acid and linolenic acid have certain effects on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, hyperten - sion and rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and allergy [25]. It implicated that supplementation of EJG could be good for pro- moting health. Nine kinds of minerals of in EJG were analyzed in the present study. The results showed that calcium was the most abundant (454.09mg/100g) among these minerals. In terms of RDI per 10g, the EJG presents 34.93%. Ca, K and Mg are essential for the energy metabolism, bone development and protein synthesis in humans [26]. She was also found in EJG (0.013mg/100g), which was an essential nutrient element in humans due to its possible roles in oxidative dam-age, chronic diseases and inflammatory [27]. Weight gain and organ index The effects of EJG on the weight gain and organ indexes were shown in table 2 and figure 1. After administrated with EJG, the weight gain between groups EJG (HE, ME and LE) and group MC showed insignificant difference (P>0.05); liver indexes in the group ME and group VE were significantly higher than that of group MC, while insignificant difference was found in the brain (P>0.05) .Constituents Per 100g RDI %CS Moisture 29.00 78a3.72 Protein (g) 20.90 50a4.18 3.40 Total fiber (g) 2.96 28a1.06 Lnoleic acid (g) 10.42 Linolenic acid (g) 1.35 Per E 6.525 15a4.35 Vitamin C 1: Chemical composition of E'jiao Gao (EJG).

In liver, the MDA content remarkably decreased after being supplemented with EJG, compared to the group MC (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Same results occurred in the serum, except that unremarkable was found in the group ME. However, as for brain, a statistically significant difference was only observed in the group HE (P<0.001). In addition, group VE had insignificant difference to EJG groups.Effect of EJG on SOD activity in aged mice As shown in figure 3, the SOD activity of group MC was lower than that in the group YC, but no statistically significant difference was found (P>0.05). The SOD activities in both groups EJG (group HE, ME and LE) and group VE were remarkably increased in the se-rum and liver, compared to the group MC (P<0.05 or P<0.01). How- ever, in brain neither EJG groups nor group VE could significantly improve SOD activities. The effects of EJG and VE on SOD activity were insignificantly different in serum, liver or brain. Effect of EJG on GPx in aged mice As shown in figure 4, a remarkable decrease in group MC was found when compared to group YC (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In serum, EJG and VE supplementation can improve the GPx activity, except group ME. As for liver, neither EJG groups nor group VE found sig-nificant difference. Effect of EJG on CAT activity in aged mice As shown in figure 5, the CAT activity in group MC was remark - ably lower than the group YC in the liver (P<0.01) but not in the serum (P>0.05). Administrated with EJG can significantly improve the CAT activity in the serum, compared to group MC (P<0.05). As for liver, the same situation was not found in EJG groups or in group VE (P>0.05).Figure 3: SOD activities of all groups in Serum (A), Liver (B) and Brain (C).

There are two kinds of nutrients: macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients. Mac- ro-nutrients, including carbohydrates, fiber, fats, protein and water [28], is an energy provider for metabolism of an organism, while mi- cro-nutrients, including at least iron, vitamins, cobalt, copper, manga-nese, chromium, iodine, selenium, zinc, and molybdenum take part in building and repairing of tissue and regulating body processes. Organisms obtain nutrients from environments and their growth and health conditions are largely influenced by what they eat. A poor diet, especially a Western pattern diet, is associated with many diseases, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even deficiency disease of blindness [29-32]. Food intake is greatly influenced by availability, the processing and palatability of food. However, with the development of food pro- cessing technology, the nutritional components in food can be largely affected by the processing. Nowadays, nutritional value becomes an important factor in people's choice of food. EJG is a snack that is mixed with walnut, semen sesame nigrum and rice wine, which is delicious and nutritional and is popular with women in China. Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals [33], which can be found in many fibrous tissues, and is believed to be the main active component in E'jiao. It is widely used to nourish the blood. A previous study isolated two collagen-derived peptides from E'ji - ao and confirmed exhibition of strong hematopoietic activity ele-vated CFU-E (colony-forming units-erythroid) and granulocyte-monocyte) of mouse bone marrow cells [6]. Collagen is important for women, which is not only because of its ability to treat gynecologic diseases but also its importance in de-laying natural ageing process by tightening and smoothing the skin internally [34]. Nowadays, many people use the cosmetic products of collagen, such as creams and lotions, to keep skin health. However, these products can only treat some lines and smaller wrinkles on the surface, and to do some substantial effect was considered to take oral applications [35]. From nutrients analysis, protein was a dominated component in EJG and it was mainly from E'jiao. It is known that E'jiao contains about 80% collagen; therefore EJG can be a good sup-plementation of collagen to fight against aging. EJG contains many essential or non-essential amino acids that have various biological functions. For example, glycine has been considered an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain stem and medulla [36]. Hydroxyproline is an important component of the syn- thesis of the connective tissue collagen. The deficiency of L-arginine is frequently associated with aging, and L-Arginine supplementation can improve endothelial function and decreased systolic blood pres-sure by normalizing plasma L-arginine and L-argining/L-ornithine ratio [37]. Recently, many studies suggest that vitamins, minerals and botan- icals are natural ingredients to improve antioxidant activities and an- ti-ageing. In the present study, Vitamin E was extremely abundant in EJG, which suggested that EJG was a potential antioxidant. Vitamin E is considered to be a good peroxyl radical scavenger and has been developed as a commercial antioxidant, protecting tissues from dam- age of free radicals, protecting lipids and preventing the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids [30]. In addition, many macro-elements and trace elements of mineral that are beneficial for humans have been found in EJG. Among these detected mineral elements, seleni- um is an essential nutrient for its important antioxidant functions and neuroprotective actions [38]. Human usually obtain natural selenium from dietary, such as meat, eggs and vegetables [39]. EJG contains about 0.013mg/100g selenium, which would be another choice for humans. Reactive oxygen species or free radicals, including superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide, are un- stable and reactive. In general, they play an important role in signal transduction, leukocyte adhesion, gene transcription and many other critical cellular reactions. However, though the excess of free radicals can be detoxified by cell-produced antioxidants, such as will hap-pen with aging or other pathological conditions. Oxidative stress can damage many critical molecules, increase DNA mutations and cause cell death [40]. Supplementation with antioxidants can decrease cel - lular damage from excess reactive oxygen species. After administrated with EJG, the activities of endogenous antiox - idant enzymes in aging mice (SOD, GPx, and CAT) were remarkably improved and the content of MDA was decreased, when compared to the model control group. SOD is the first line of antioxidant-defense systems, the best characterized, to catalyze the dismutation of O 2 into non-toxic of H2O2 and O2 [41]. GPx protects the organism from oxi- dative damage mainly by reducing lipid hydroperoxides [42]. CAT is also a very important enzyme that catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide into less-reactive gaseous oxygen and water molecules [43]. There - fore, it is essential for the organisms to keep the activity of endoge- nous antioxidant enzymes. The capability of EJG in improving SOD, GPx and CAT activities in aged mice, may be due to the containment of some potential antioxidant nutrients. For example, zinc and man-ganese are critical cofactors for superoxide dismutase; vitamin E and other vitamins reduce reactive oxygen species [44]. In conclusion, EJG is a nutritious snack food, which is abundant in protein, essential amino acids, vitamins, essential fatty acids and minerals. In vivo experiments, EJG exhibited a good ability to im- prove the activities of SOD, GPx and CAT in aged mice. In addition, it decreased the content of MDA in aged mice. It indicated that EJG was a healthy food, containing potential anti-ageing capacity, for con-sumption.
