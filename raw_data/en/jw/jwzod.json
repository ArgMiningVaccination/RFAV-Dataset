Lowrie Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at The Ohio State University Doug Montjoy March 2014 Thesis Committee: Dr. Kristy Ainslie (Advisor) Dr. Jessica Winter ii Abstract The use of polymers to enhance the delivery of vaccines is a growing area of research. Microparticles formed from polysaccharides can be formulated into vaccines by encapsulating a protein tar get (an antigen) and an immune danger signal (an adjuvant). The adjuvant is needed since most synthesized or subunit vaccines lack the immunologic potency that the entire pathogen would stimulate. Immunostimulatory polymers such as Inulin obtained from dahlia root could be used in place of a separate adjuvant. Inulin can be used as a base material to form chemically -modified polymers, such as acetalated (Ace) or trimethylsilyl (TMS) Inulin. To this end, the degradation of chemically modified Inulin micr oparticles of varying reaction times and modifications was tested at pH 5 and 7.4 using a spectrophotometer. The results showed a much slower release in extracellular conditions (pH 7.4) with a burst release at pH 5, corresponding to the acidity of the pha gosome of phagocytic cells, which are the gatekeepers to a vaccine - mediated immune response in vivo. Additionally, the immunostimulatory effect of Inulin microparticles was evaluated using a TNF - ELISA and the toxicity was evaluated using an MTT assay. Ma crophages were incubated with five different concentrations (1000, 500, 250, 100, 50 \u00b5g/ml) of various types of Inulin microparticles are biocompatible and displ ay a dose - dependent increase in TNF - production. Currently, groups of inulin microparticles loaded with ova-albumin (a sample antigen) are being tested in vivo. Blood samples are being withdrawn from mice every 2 weeks, with a final sample at the end of s ix weeks. These samples will be tested using antibody titers, flow cytometry, and antigen recall. iii Acknowledgements This thesis project was supported in part by the Ohio State University College of Engineering Undergraduate Research Fellowship and the Ohio State University College of Pharmacy Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship.

Attenuated (live) viruses cannot be broadly applied due to safety risk associated with many diseases . Heat inactivated vaccines are safer but lack efficacy in generating a strong immune response. Subunit vaccines are considered to be a safer alternative to live or attenuated vaccine formulations because th ey can establish protective immunity, yet lack the molecular machinery to cause an infection.2 Currently, aluminum salts are the most commonly used vaccine adjuvants in FDA - approved vaccines. However, alum salts have been shown to induce allergenicity3, form granulomas at injection sites4, and only stimulate humoral responses5,6. The optimal vaccine should activate both the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity.7 Additionally, alum - adjuvanted vaccines have been shown to lose potency upon lyophil ization, which could create an issue with long -term storage of the formulation.8 An increasing amount of research has investigated the use of polymers to improve delivery of vaccines. Microparticles fabricated from FDA -approved polymeric biomaterials including -hydroxy acids such as poly(lactic -co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) are used broadly. However, PLGA has a slow degradation rate that is not ideal for delivery of antigenic payloads.9 Additionally, the pH inside PLGA microparticles is acidic and provides an uncontrolled pH environment which can be an issue for antigen stability.10 For use in drug delivery and controlled release applications, polymers sensitive to external stimuli such as magnetic fields, temperature , electric field and pH have been developed. An important channel to achieve controlled release 2 involves using pH -sensitive polymers to fabricate microparticles and nanoparticles that capitalize on natural pH differences in vivo .11 pH-sensitive polymers have been used to target tumors12,13, facilitate escape from endolysosomal pathways14, and for uptake in the GI tract15. A pH -sensitive carrier allows for protein to be expediently delivered to antigen presentation systems due to the pH gradient in the endocytic pathway .16, 17 Acetalated polymers have been shown to have pH -sensitive characteristics ideal for delivery of vaccine elements to immune cells.18 The degradation rate of acetalated dextran is easily tunable through the reaction time used to synthesize the polymer.19 Additionally, silylated polymers are a recently developed biodegradable polymer that have many of the same features as acetalated polymers .20 These polymers can be easily formed into microparticles using standard emulsion techniques since they become solub le in organic solvents. Microparticles produced from polysaccharides can form vaccines by encapsulating a protein target (an antigen) and an immune danger signal (an adjuvant). The adjuvant is often needed since most synthesized or subunit vaccines lack t he immunologic potency that the entire pathogen would have such as inulin obtained from dahlia root can act as the antigen delivery vehicle and could be used in place of including an additional adjuvant drug. To improve long -term storage of vaccine formulations, plant polysaccharides such as inulin can be used to prevent the degradation of proteins during lyophilization and storage .22 Inulin is a biocompatible polymer used in the food industry23 and has been used clinically to measure renal function.24 Specific isoforms of i nulin have been shown to activate the alternative complement pathway .25 Inulin -based adjuvants have successfully been tested in multiple animal models in combination with such antigens such as diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and hepatitis B .1 Inulin -derived adjuvants have also been shown to promote both Th1 and Th2 immune responses 3 in vivo.26 Inulin is an optimal adjuvant due to its biocompatibility, ability to promote both a cellular and humoral immune responses, and its cryoprotectant properties. This study aims to use an immunostimulatory polymer (i nulin) to produce a more effective vaccine carrier that does no t require the addition of a separate adjuvant . Inulin has been shown to be biocompatible and is commonly used in food and clinical settings . Chemical modifications of the inulin allow for easy fabrication of delivery vehicles with pH-sensitive properties o ptimal for vaccine delivery. Inulin also serves as a cryoprotectant and prevents degradation of protein.22 Additionally, inulin microparticles deliver antigens in particula te form which has been shown to be more immunogenic tha n the soluble form and to result in increased antigen uptake .27,28 4 Materials and Methods Materials. All materials were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used as received unless otherwise noted. Acetalated Polymer Synthesis Ace-Inulin (Ace-IN) was reacted in a similar method as used by Kauffman et al.29 Briefly, lyophilized inulin (DMSO, mL ) and then reacted with 2 - ethoxypropene (37 mmol, Waterstone, Carmel, IN) under nitrogen gas. For l onger reaction times , chloroform (4 mL) was added to the reaction mixture after one hour . The reaction was quenched with triethylamine (TEA, 1 mL) a t set timepoints ( 20 min, 24 hr, 72 hr ). The product was then precipitated in basic water (0.02% v/v triethylamine in water, pH 9), isolated using vacuum filtration, and lyophilized. The polymer was further purified by dissolving in ethanol (200 proof) and centrif uging (5 min, 10,000 \u00d7 g, Thermo Le gend Micro 21). The supernatant was precipitated again in basic water, filtered, and lyophilized to yield Ace-IN polymer (1 g), a white powder . TMS -IN Polymer Synthesis Inulin (0.5 g) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO (5 mL). Triethylamine (1.2 g, 23.6 mmol / gram inulin) was added dropwise. The silylation of the inulin was performed by dropwise addition of the TMS -Cl (1.2 g, 22.4 mmol / gram Inulin). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temper ature under nitrogen gas. After 30 min of reaction, 5 mL anhydrous chloroform was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for two more hours. Following the 2.5 hr, the reaction was quenched by dilution with 200 mL chloroform. The organic layer 5 was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution followed by deionized water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and TMS -IN was collected as a white solid after lyophilization. Particle Synthesis Ace-IN OVA -loaded microparticles were prepared using a double -emulsion technique (water/oil /water ) as previously described with Ac e-DEX .10 Briefly, a stock solution of ovalbumin (OVA ) in PBS (200 L) was prepared. 100 mg of Ace-IN was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM, 1 mL) and added to the OVA solution. This two -phase mixture was then homogenized for 30s (IKA -25 Ultra Turrax Homogenizer, S25N -18G head, 18,000 RPM). 12 mL of 3% poly (vinyl alco hol) (PVA) in PBS (12 mL) solution was then added to the emulsion formed and homogenized using the same settings . The resulting double emulsion was immediately poured into a spinning solution of 0.3% PVA in PBS (40 mL). After two hours of spinning to evaporate the solvent and allow for particle hardening , the mixture was centrifuged (10 min, 14,000 \u00d7 g). The supernatant was discarded, and the resulting sediment was washed with basic water (pH 9) and centrifuged under the same conditions several times in order to remove excess PVA. Finally, the microparticles were suspended in basic water (pH 9) and lyophilized for two days to yield Ace-IN . Acetalated Dextran (Ace-DEX ) microparticles were prepared with the same procedure as described above, except Ace -DEX was used in place of Ace-IN. This Ace -DEX polyme r (MW = 71k) was synthesized as previously described in Kauman et al .29TMS -IN microparticles were also prepared with the same procedure, except TMS -IN polymer was used in place of Ace -DEX. Empty Ace-IN and TMS -IN Particles that did not contain protein w ere made in the same manner as the double -emulsion particles omitting the first emulsion with the OVA solution . 6 Particle Degradation Empty Ace-IN and TMS -IN particles were suspended in triplicate at a concentration of 3 mg/mL in either a sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) or PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker plate at 200 RPM. At various timepoints (0 to 336 hours) samples were analyzed us ing a spectrophotometer (600 nm). A standard curve was created with a range in concentrations of Inulin microparticles in PBS to determine percent degradation of the particles . Quantification of Encapsulated OVA Blank and OVA -loaded particles were prepar ed at 3 mg/mL in 1% (w/v) Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate ( SDS) in 0.3 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The solutions were incubated at 90 C until complete degradation of the particles was observed. A standard curve using free OVA was treated the same way. 150 uL of the samples/standards were reacted with 50 uL of 3 mg fluorescamine / mL in DMSO for 15 min. The fluorescence was read at Ex :390 / Em :470 nm. Scanning Electron Microscopy Particle suspensions were prepared at 10mg/mL in basic water (pH 9.0), and a 50 uL drop was put on an aluminum pin stub specimen mount (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) and allowed to air dry. The sample was sputter -coated with AuPd for 90 sec using a Sputter Coater 108 (Cressington Scientific Instruments, Watford, England). Images were acquired using a Nova NanoSEM 400 scanning electron microscope (Field Emission, Inc., Hillsboro, OR). Endotoxin Levels Particle suspensions were prepared at 1mg/mL in endotoxin free water and incubated overnight at 4 C. The amount of endotoxin was me asured following the manufacturer's instructions using a Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). 7 Cell Preparation Macrophages (RAW 264.7; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown and maintained according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Media was made with fetal bovine serum (50 mL; Hyclone, Pittsburgh, PA), penicillin -streptomycin (5 mL; Fischer, Pittsburgh, PA), and Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle's Medium (450 mL; Fischer, Pittsburgh, PA). Cells were maintained at 100% relative humidity, 37 \u00b0C, and 5% CO2. Macrophages were seeded at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/mL in a 96 -well plate. After 4 hours, the media in each well was r eplaced with treatment media containing blank Ace-IN and TMS -IN microparticles at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 \u00b5g/mL . Controls included three wells with only media, three wells with untreated cells, and three wells with 10 ug/ml LPS as a positive control. Cells were then incubated for 48 hours. Cell Viability analysis . After 48 hours of treatment , the MTT assay was perfo rmed to dete rmine cell viability. Media was removed from wells and replaced with 150 uL of fresh media and 20 L of 3 -(4,5 dimethylthiazol -2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dissolved in medium (5 mg/mL) was added. The plate was incubated for 3 hours until purple formazan crystals formed. Then, the supernatants were removed and crystals were dissolved in isopropanol (200 L) . The plate was analyzed with a plate reader at an absorbance of 560 nm, and the background ab sorbance at 670 nm was subtracted. The net absorbance scaled by the net absorbance of the untreated cells (100%) corresponds to the cell viability. Cytokine Analysis. After 48 hours of treatment to the cells , supernatants from each well were removed and frozen at -80\u00baC. A Mouse TNF - ELISA Ready -SET-Go!\u00ae kit (Affym etrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to assess TNF - Alpha levels in the samples . A 10 L aliquot of each sample was pipetted into a 96 8 well plate for cytokine analysis. Th is and a Mouse IL -6 Ready -SET-Go!\u00ae kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) ELISA were performed following the manufacturer's directions. Nitrite Analysis Nitric oxide production by the macrophages was measured using a Greiss Assay . After 48 hours, the supernatants from each well were removed and centrifuged (14,000 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), and 50 L of the resulting supernatant was withdrawn and pipetted into a 96 well plate . Standard nitrite concentrations were prepared and the Greiss reagents (Promega, Madison, WI) were added following th e manufacturer's directions . The absorbance was measured at 540 nm and compared with the standard curve to determine nitrite concentration . 9 Results and Discussion Physical Characterization of Microparticles Ace-IN and TMS -IN polymer was synthesized using the reaction scheme s shown in Figure 1. Microparticles were synthesized from three reaction times for the Ace-IN polymer (20 min, 24 hour, 72 hour) and for the TMS -IN as seen in Figure 2. The microparticles were fairly polydisperse with d iameters ranging from a few hundred nanometers to a couple micro ns. In order to ensure there was no contamination that could lead to false positives, p articles were tested for endotoxin using a quant itative LAL Endotoxin test which resulted in a negligible amou nt of endotoxin being detected. Figure 1 : Reaction schemes used to synthesize: (A) Acetalated Inulin and (B) Trimethylsilyl Inulin 10 Figure 2 : Scanning electron micrographs of blank microparticles fabricated by . Microparticle Degradation , Encapsulation Efficiency of Antigen, and Antigen Release Reaction time has been shown to control the degradation rate of Ace-DEX particles.29 It was e xpected that Ace-IN would have a similar degradation to acetalated dextran due to its acetal groups. The degradation of Ace-IN and TMS -IN microparticles synthesized using the emulsion method was analyzed in pH 5 .0 and pH 7.4 buffe rs. The pH 5.0 buffer was used to model the physiological pH of phagosomal conditions of antigen presenting cells (e.g. macrophages) a s well as sites of inflammation . Acid sensitivity is advantageous for a microparticle carrier since it allows for the payload to be localized t o acidic sites (e.g. phagosomes) instead of physiological pH-neutral sites making delivery more efficient and reducing potential side effects intracellular. 11 Figure 3 shows the degradation of 20 minute Ace-IN particles, 24 hour Ace-IN particles, and TMS -IN particles. Figure 3 : Degradation of blank inulin microparticles at 200 RPM, 37 \u00baC in (A) pH 5 Sodium Acetate buffer and (B) pH 7.4 Phosphate -Buffered Saline buffer performed at 200 rpm, 37\u00baC, n=3. As expected, the lower reaction time Ace-IN degraded faster than the 24 hour Ace-IN particles , which show s degradation tunability based on the reaction time. Furthermore, TMS -IN particles 12 degraded slower than the Ace-IN particles , which implies an ability to further tune the degradation based on th e chemical modification . All of the particles show a more triggered degradation in the pH 5 .0 buffer as compared to being more stable at pH 7.4. Double -emulsion microparticles loaded with OVA were prepared to investigate antigen release from the Ace-IN microparticles. The re lease is shown below in Figure 4 . pH 5.5 was used instead of pH 5.0 to avoid OVA 's isoelectric point and assure that it would remain in solution. A burst release was observed at the pH 5.5 and a slower release at pH 7.4 demonstrating th e pH sensitivity and ability for the microparticles to release an antigen in a tunable fashion . This demonstrates the ability of particles to rapidly deliver antigen at a lower pH which has been shown to correspond with greater antigen presentation.30 Figure 4 : Release of ovalbumin (OVA) from Ace-IN: 72hr microparticles at pH 5.5, and pH 7.4 performed at 200 rpm, 37\u00baC, n=3. 13 After determining the degradation profile of the inulin microparticles, the ability of microparticles to encapsulate a model ant igen ( OVA ) was tested. Issues arose with the encapsulation efficiency in TMS -IN, and therefore various polymer blends of Ace -DEX and TMS -IN were used to alleviate this problem. The encapsulation results can be seen in Table 1. With an increasing percentage of Ace -DEX , a non -immunostimulatory polymer, in the blend the encapsulation efficiency increased demonstrating tunability based on the amount of ovalbumin loading desired. Table 1: Encapsulation Efficiency of OVA in TMS -IN/Ace -DEX blended Microparticles Empty p articles were tested for their cytotoxicity using the MTT assay and ability to induce an immune response using a tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF -) ELISA. TNF - is a pro - inflammatory cytokine produced in response to infectious agents and has been shown to play an important role in immune and inflammatory activities.31 Previous ly, it has been shown that inulin is immunostimulatory, so it was expected for the particles to result in cytokine rel ease.24As seen in Figure 5 , there was a significant TNF - release with the Ace-IN particles. It can also be seen that there is a trend, with increasing reaction time resulting in a sma ller TNF - release. This demonstrates potential tunability for the degree of immunogenicity based on the reaction time of the polymer . One potential mechanism explaining this is a rapid degradation for lower reaction time acetalated inulin (as can be seen earlier in Figure 3 ) resulting in expedient delivery of inulin 14 to phagosomes for greater antigen presentation.30Additi onally, there was a relatively high TNF - release d with treatment of TMS -IN particles . Viability for all the particles was above 80 percent for concentrations equal to or below 250 ug/ml , indicating that the particles are relatively not cytotoxic. Figure 5 : (A) Viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages determined by an MTT assay after 48 hours of treatment (B) Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) levels produced by RAW 264.7 macrophages treated for 48 ho urs with blank microparticles. 10 \u00b5g/mL of lipopolysa ccharide (LPS) was incubated for a reduced amount of time to act as a positive control. Data are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation , n=3. In Figure 6 , the TNF - production from free Inulin at the same concentrations as the particulate form of inulin is displayed . With free inulin , there was no TNF - release seen for any of the concentrations. This indicates that especially when in microparticle form, i nulin results in a Th1 immune response. This is consistent with the results that have been obtained previously by Kumar et al . using soluble inulin microparticles.32It can also be seen from the MTT results that free i nulin , a degradation byproduct of the particles, is biocompatible . 15 Figure 6 : (A) Viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages determined by an MTT assay after 48 hours of treatment. Data are presented as relative to untreated cells and are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. (B) Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) levels produced by RAW 264.7 macrophages treated for 48 hours with free inuli n. 10 \u00b5g/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was incubated for a reduced amount of time to act as a positive control. Data are display ed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, n=3. Additional experiments assessing the ability for inulin to induce a Th1 response were performed including tests for IL-6 and nitric oxide, other inflammatory markers, but no response was detected as can be seen in Figures S -1, and S -2. Ace-IN blended with Ace -DEX microparticles were also tested for TNF -alpha emission as seen in Figure S -3. In Vivo Experiment s After characterizing the physical and immune -modulating properties of inulin microparticles , microparticle degradation, and ability to encapsulate sample antigen, in vivo experiments were planned. In vivo experiment s are ongoing and will characterize the humoral and cellular immune response s to the particles with anti-OVA antibody titers, flow cytometry and antigen recall. The encapsulation efficiency of the particles used in the in vivo experiment is displayed in Table 2. 16 Table 2: Encapsulation Efficiency of m icroparticles (MPs) used for in vivo experiment . Particle Type Encapsulation Efficiency chosen for the in vivo experiment are in Table 3. Delivery of OVA - loaded particles and free OVA in combination with blank particles were chosen with the appropriate controls. Table 3: In vivo experimental groups Group 1 PBS 2 Blank Ace:IN:24hr MPs 3 Blank TMS:IN MPs 4 Free OVA 5 Free OVA + Alum 6 Free OVA + Ace:IN:24hr MPs 7 Free OVA + TMS:IN MPs 8 Ace:IN:24hr/OVA MPs 9 TMS:IN/OVA MPs 10 Ace-DEX:71k:50min/OVA MPs The experimental plan for the in vivo experiment is displayed in Figure 7. Mice will be injected on Day 0 with a booster injection on Day 14 and will have blood samples taken every 2 weeks for 6 weeks total . Following euthanasia, the spleens will be excised and splenocytes recovered to determine the cell populations (e.g. CD8+) and ability of the splenocytes to recall the OVA antigen. Additionally, anti -OVA antibody titers will be analyzed to quantify the immune cell activation. 17 Figure 7 : Schedule for in vivo experiment 18 Conclusions It can be concluded that chemically -modified inulin has numerous properties that are optimal for a vaccine carrier. Both TMS -IN and Ace-IN show pH -sensitive cha racteristics beneficial for delivery of vaccines to phagocytic cells. Additionally, both types of microparticles are relatively biocompatible and immunostimulatory, causing a dose -dependent increase in TNF - alpha production . Due to the immunostimulatory effect of Inulin, these microparticles when formulated into a vaccine may not require a separate adjuvant drug. Tunability in degradation and immunogenicity has been demonstrated with Ace-IN particles based on the reaction tim e of the polymer synthesis . An increase in antigen loading can be achieved with TMS -IN by utilizing polymer blends containing Ace -DEX , another biocompatible polymer. Once results are obtained from the in vivo experiment s, the effect of a chemically -modified inulin as a potential vaccine carrier can be further evaluated as part of a vaccine formulation for a specific disease . 19 References 1.
