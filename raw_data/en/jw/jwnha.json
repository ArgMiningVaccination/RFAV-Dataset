Meet your go-to herbal remedy that could help! Find out all about agnus castus, including what it does, the benefits of taking it and how much you might need. When the balance of progesterone and oestrogen changes during your menstrual cycle, you may experience the classic symptoms of [premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/pms/) such as irritability and low moods. A 2012 Iranian study found that agnus castus could offer relief from mild to moderate PMS symptoms, including headaches, depression and bloating,5 while German researchers reported in 2000 that the herb could reduce - and in some cases, entirely stop - PMS symptoms.6 In addition to this, evidence collated by the University of Michigan Health System found that taking vitex once in the morning over several months can help stabilise your hormones and relieve the symptoms of PMS.7 Bothered by sore breasts before your period? Doctors say this happens due to hormone changes before your period starts.8 It may be partly down to high levels of the hormone prolactin. In 2003, a review of studies by the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, reported that stress in the premenstrual phase of the month can trigger a rise in prolactin.9 But the review also found agnus castus can help normalise prolactin levels and ease breast tenderness. More recently, a 2012 study from Hamedan University of Medical Science in Iran looked at 128 women with symptoms of PMS, including breast tenderness and fullness, and gave them 40 drops of either agnus castus or a placebo for six days before their period. The women taking agnus castus reported significant improvements in breast tenderness and other symptoms.10 According to a study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2009, there is enough 'emerging pharmacological evidence' to recommend agnus castus for [menopause](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/womens-health/menopause/what-you-should-know-about-the-menopause/) symptom management, particularly the PMS-like symptoms that occur during the perimenopause.11 An earlier 2003 study concluded that applying agnus castus essential oil to the skin could ease symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, sleep patterns and irregular periods.12 Agnus castus is often used by herbalists to treat [fertility](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/womens-health/fertility/) problems. Again, it's the herb's hormone-balancing effects that are thought to help. As agnus castus can normalise progesterone levels, it can be helpful for women whose luteal phase - the second half of the menstrual cycle, after ovulation - is too short to maintain a pregnancy. Several studies have found that agnus castus can rebalance hormones and lengthen menstrual cycles, regulate periods and even lead to successful pregnancies.13 A study carried out by Medizinische Hochschule, Hamburg, Germany, looked at 52 women with luteal phase defects and gave half of them 20mg of agnus castus for three months, while the other half took a placebo. After this time, the luteal phase normalised in the agnus castus group.14 As it can take a few months to work, be patient - and stop taking it once you get pregnant.

Handpicked content: [What happens in the early days of pregnancy?](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/happens-early-days-pregnancy/) Vitex agnus castus could offer some protection against some insects like flies, mosquitos, ticks, head lice and fleas. One study found that an extract made from agnus castus seeds helped to repel mosquitos, ticks, flies and fleas for around 6 hours.15 Another study found that a spray made from agnus castus and other plant extracts protected the participants from head lice for at least 7 hours.16 More research shows that agnus castus could reduce adult lice reproduction and kill lice larvae.17,18 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female hormonal conditions, affecting up to 6-8% of girls and women of reproductive age. It's caused by an imbalance of the female sex hormones paired with higher levels of male hormones called androgens. This is because women with PCOS produce more androgens in their ovaries, which then affect the development and release of eggs in the ovulation process. A review of 33 studies researching the effects of various herbal medicines on the management of PCOS symptoms found angus castus to be effective in improving the symptoms of PCOS. One animal study found angus castus to be effective in reversing the adverse effects of hormonal imbalance of PCOS.19 [Anxiety](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/mental-health/different-types-of-anxiety-and-the-symptoms/) is a common symptom that women experience due to hormonal changes and fluctuations in the body. As agnus castus could be effective for easing PMS symptoms, it may also help to reduce hormone-induced anxiety. One study on 210 women with mastalgia (breast pain caused by hormones) found that when they took vitex agnus castus, their anxiety levels reduced significantly compared to the control group.20 However, more studies are needed to conclude any correlation between PCOS symptom relief and agnus castus. Although it is likely safe for most people, some known side-effects of agnus castus include:22 Allergic reactions, Swelling, Difficulty breathing, Headaches, Nausea, Stomach aches, Irregular periods, Trouble sleeping & Weight gain If you experience any of these side effects, stop taking agnus castus and seek medical attention - particularly if you're having an allergic reaction. Yes, weight gain is one of the potential side effects of taking agnus castus, but it is not very common. Because of the herb's effect on the pituitary gland, those with a pituitary disorder should not take it without talking to their doctor first. If you're taking any other hormone medications, such as the contraceptive pill or hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), do not take agnus castus without proper medical advice from your GP or a healthcare professional.23 You can take agnus castus supplements in the morning or in the evening - it doesn't really matter which. Just make sure you take it at roughly the same time every day for best results.
