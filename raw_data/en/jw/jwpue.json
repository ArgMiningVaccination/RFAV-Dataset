It is a traditional holistic system of Indian medicine, practiced for millennia, that aims to invite health and happiness. The concept of Ayurveda sees gems as a source for health, beauty and energy. Ayurveda gem therapy claims that every gem has properties that can help to balance specific doshas and heal certain physical or emotional conditions. A dosha is one of three bodily bio elements that make up one's constitution: Vata (Air), Pitta (Fire) or Kapha (Water). This gem blend is inspired by the ancient teachings of Ayurveda originating in India over 3,000 years ago. Traditional Naturopathic Uses: In the natural healing arts, the gemstones in this blend are believed to equalize chakra imbalances and to bring a state of overall harmony to the body. Its intensely colorful appearance is inspired by the vibrant colors of the Holi Celebration in Rajasthan, India. "}
