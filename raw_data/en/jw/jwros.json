Aids in weight loss: Herbal detox aids in [weight loss](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-and-cleanses-what-you-need-to-know)because when one goes in for this type of detox, they invariably end up eliminating high-calorie, low-nutrition foods, which tend to help the body shed those extra calories. However, most of the weight that one loses during a herbal detox is water weight. Herbal detox drinks act as diuretics that push the body to lose water through urine and bowel movements. Herbal detox also includes drinks and teas that have a laxative effect, which eases and speedens the flow of food through the digestive tract, thereby maintaining sound gut health and aiding in a healthy weight loss. Reduces inflammation: This is one of the most important benefits of herbal detox. The body is constantly under attack due to oxidative stress. This occurs when there is an imbalance of free radicals and [antioxidants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411016300529)in the body. During oxidative stress, the cells in the body tend to produce free radicals, which are unstable atoms that cause serious damage to cells, proteins and DNA. This can then cause inflammation and all forms of chronic illnesses in the body. Herbal detox helps the body get rid of toxins. They contain ingredients that are rich in antioxidants, which slows down the free radical activity in the body, thereby reducing the risk of inflammations and chronic diseases. Liver Detoxification: To ensure that your [liver](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499388/)functions properly from time to time, it is important that it gets a regular dose of detox. Herbal detox drinks help to filter out the toxins that enter your body through the food/alcohol/caffeine/ carbonated drinks/nicotine you consume. They also aid in proper digestion and help maintain the balance between the good and bad bacteria in your gut. Herbal detoxes also help reduce liver inflammation and prevent the onset of diseases like liver cirrhosis or non alcoholic fatty liver. Improves skin health: As stated above, [herbal detox](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151377/)helps fight oxidative stress by lessening free radical activity. This slows down the aging process, which is primarily reflected in one's skin health. Herbal detox helps to purify blood, which prevents your skin from breaking out into pimples and acne. It keeps the skin looking clean, youthful and supple. Boosts Immunity: Your body has an innate ability to expel toxins thereby strengthening your [immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1297498/). When the body's detoxification system, comprising all essential organs such as the gut, liver, kidneys, lymphatic system etc, work effectively, toxins get eliminated from the system from time to time, building a strong defense system, keeping all sorts of infections at bay. Herbal detox gives the immunity a boost, by effectively improving the workings of each of the aforementioned organs/systems that play a vital role in the body's detoxification process, thereby strengthening the immune system.
