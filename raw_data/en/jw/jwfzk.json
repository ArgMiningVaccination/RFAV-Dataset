This is so that more people can get their first doses and a certain level of protection already, according to health minister Ong Ye Kung in a press conference held on Sunday. Right now, experts from around the world and in Singapore believe that the two required doses of the Covid-19 vaccine can be spaced further apart without the vaccine losing its efficacy. In fact, the doses can be given up to six to eight weeks apart which is up from the current three to four weeks.

That means give as many people as possible one dose of Covid-19 vaccination, without reducing the effectiveness, and there have been many international studies and it showed that even with one dose, it confers good protection, without compromising efficacy.\" He added that those who already have an appointment for their second dose will not be affected as these plans were only considerations the government was thinking of for the second phase of the vaccination exercise. More details will be announced when plans are finalised. Related: [Covid-19 Singapore: No Dine-in, Group Sizes Down "}
