It improves the function of the Nervous system as they structurally work together. Two peas in a pod: The nervous system transmits information to the brain from the entire body and can influence the receptors in the immune system. The combination of the brain, immune, and nervous systems communicate back and forth. If the immune system detects any foreign antigens (toxins or foreign substances) in turn it can tell the nervous system to react.
