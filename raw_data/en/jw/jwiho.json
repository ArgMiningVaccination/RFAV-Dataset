Duke Integrative Immunobiology: Excellence in Research, Education, and Science Culture Integrative Immunobiology is a basic science department that seeks to understand the function of the immune system and how information derived from patients can help frame the research questions we ask to best understand human diseases. This is reflected in our training mission with multiple interdisciplinary research projects for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to tackle. Also critical to our success as a department is fostering a culture of diversity and inclusivity in all its dimensions as well as an ethos of service to society. Research Immunobiology is an expanding field that touches multiple scientific areas. From cancer biology, to neurosciences, to microbiology, the immune system determines whether health or disease ensues. The spectrum of research performed in Duke Integrative Immunobiology includes vaccinology, cellular immunology, cancer immunology, neuroimmunology, and adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity. Education Integrative Immunobiology aims to train scientists that are well versed in basic, clinical, and translational immunology. Doctoral students in the Immunology Graduate Training Program can participate in a variety of research projects from basic molecular mechanisms of how lymphocytes function, to the analysis of immune responses in human populations, to the engineering of new vaccines and cell based immunotherapeutics. Culture Duke Integrative Immunobiology seeks to create an environment that fosters an open and robust exchange of ideas. Diversity in all its forms strengthens our science programs and community. Our goal is to train outstanding scientists who effectively engage with all communities to communicate the value of their scientific discoveries and who advocate for the prominent role that science education and research needs to play in our society.
