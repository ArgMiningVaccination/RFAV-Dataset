Torrence, Chaplain, Key West Police Department, Key West, Florida, offered the fol-lowing prayer: Almighty God, I thank You for the privilege and the honor to be here this morning in these hallowed halls on this, our Nation's National Day of Prayer. We as a people of many faiths and religions and backgrounds come together in a sign of unity to ask for Your guidance and blessings on this very important day. We not only remember those who have given their lives to protect our great country in military service, but we also remember the men and women in law enforcement who risk daily and give their lives to protect each and every one of us.

Amen. f THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam- ined the Journal of the last day's pro-ceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour- nal stands approved. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from New York (Mr. M CNULTY ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. M CNULTY led the Pledge of Alle- giance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Mr. Monahan, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed without amendment a concurrent resolution of the House of the following title: H.

There will be 10 1- minutes on each side after that of the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. R OS- LEHTINEN ). f WELCOMING THE REVEREND STE- VEN M. TORRENCE OF KEY WEST, FLORIDA (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today we welcome a distinguished member of the clergy, Reverend Ste- phen M. Torrence, from my district of Key West, Florida. Reverend Torrence was ordained in the Universal Fellowship of Metropoli-tan Community Churches, and in 1985 was called to pastor the Metropolitan Community Church in Key West. Among his many community accom-plishments, he was instrumental in or-ganizing a nonprofit community-based AIDS organization, AIDS HELP, that serves Monroe County. For over 12 years, Reverend Torrence has also served as a fully sworn officer, and is the Department Chaplain in the Key West Police Force. Reverend Torrence has witnessed many tragedies as well as victories and always offered comforting spiritual guidance and gladsome praise. Monroe County, and especially Key West citi-zens, are grateful and blessed to have him help us through difficult times and join us in joyful celebrations. We welcome Reverend Torrence to the people's House. f INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO HELP HOLOCAUST SUR-VIVORS COLLECT ON INSURANCE POLICIES (Mr. FOLEY asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Speaker, today at 12:30 I, along with my Democratic co-sponsor, the gentleman from New York (Mr. I SRAEL ), and Minnesota Senator NORM COLEMAN will introduce our leg- islation to help Holocaust survivors and their families collect on Holo-caust-era insurance policies. Mr. Speaker, I am fed up watching insurance companies thumb their noses at Holocaust survivors. I urge the Su-preme Court to rule in favor of the sur-vivors and their heirs in a case pending before the Supreme Court. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3574 May 1, 2003 Holocaust survivors and their heirs are being denied what is rightfully theirs. This is nothing more than white collar theft, and it is morally reprehen-sible. These heirs and survivors deserve what is rightfully theirs, and we will not give up until they are fully com-pensated. f AMERICA MUST REMAIN ENGAGED FOR PEACE TO TAKE HOLD IN THE MIDDLE EAST (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on this day of focusing on na-tional prayer for those who wish to ex-press their faith in their different ways, I think it is an appropriate time to reinforce the importance of peace throughout this world. Particularly as the road map for Mideast peace has been unveiled, it is important to rein-force the key element of that process. Two years ago, approximately, in February of 2001, I rose to the floor of the House to indicate that the only way that we would have peace in the Middle East is if the United States re-mained engaged. Unfortunately, that did not occur for a number of months, but I do believe that we are now on the road to peace. The key element again will be, even if there are difficulties, we must re-main engaged. Even as we work with the Palestinians to cease immediately the violence, to break up the terrorist groups, to remove the illegal weapons, we must work with the Israelis as it re-lates to the road map in stopping the expanding of the settlements, and, as well, the attacks on Palestinians. These are not easy challenges, and we cannot be daunted by failure. We must continue to work for peace, be-cause it is worth it for all of the people of that region. f THE JUDICIAL NOMINATION OF PRISCILLA OWENS (Mr. HENSARLING asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my outrage with the treatment of Justice Priscilla Owen, a fellow Texan and a highly qualified nominee for the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Mr. Speaker, despite unanimously re- ceiving the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association, despite appearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary twice to answer every single question posed to her, despite the fact that the bench to which she has been nominated has been designated a judicial emergency, de-spite the strong bipartisan support of former Texas supreme court judges and 15 past presidents of the state bar of Texas, Justice Priscilla Owen has still not received an up-or-down vote in the Senate for almost 2 years. When Republicans held the majority during President Clinton's term, no ju-dicial nominee was ever deprived of a vote due to a filibuster. Now Demo-crats want to undermine our Constitu-tion and change the rules. Mr. Speaker, the President has a right to get a vote on his nominee. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LATOURETTE ). The Chair would remind all Members that it is not appropriate to characterize the action or inaction of the other body. f TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE ECONOMY (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on telecommuni-cations and the economy. The tele-communications industry, Mr. Speak-er, is in a state of crisis. Telecom jobs continue to shrink and capital con-tinues to flow away from the industry. When given the opportunity to help lead the telecommunications industry back on the road to health and fitness, the Federal Communications Commis-sion failed miserably. I completely agree with the Communication Work-ers of America that the FCC ''missed an opportunity to set out an effective national policy that would promote fa-cilities-based competition in tele-communications.'' Instead, the FCC left in place rules that require carriers to lease their net-work, or pieces of it, to competitors for below-cost rates. This policy has had a disastrous effect on the industry. Over half a million telecom jobs have been lost and investors have lost billions of dollars. The industry is in crisis, and some of that crisis can be traced di-rectly to bad policy at the FCC. It is clear to me that the FCC did not adopt the right rules to promote tele-communications investment. I sincerely hope that the FCC fixes this mess, or Congress will have to fix it. f FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE AIDS EPIDEMIC (Mr. PENCE asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, there is an epidemic of AIDS and HIV in Africa. It is heartbreaking to report this pan-demic affecting 42 million souls, 8,500 deaths every day, and entire villages without a single adult. Earlier this week we heard the Presi- dent describe a compassionate vision of moral obligation for the American peo- ple addressing this crisis that would bring not only $15 billion, but would put a priority on the values of the American people, namely, abstinence and faithfulness to marriage, over condom distribution. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, unless the House amends the bill today and adopts the Hyde-Pitts amendment that specifies that 33 percent of the prevention money will be spent on abstinence and monogamy programs first over and above condom distribution, the global AIDS bill will not reflect the values of the American people or the vision of the President of the United States of America. The timeless values of abstinence and marital faithfulness before condom dis-tribution are the cure for what ails the families of Africa. It is important that we not just send them money, but we must send them values that work. f b1015 AMERICAN PRIORITIES (Mr. BROWN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, perhaps some of us on our side of the aisle have been a little bit too critical of President Bush. After all he has in his budget a universal health care plan for 23 million people. He has in his budget money for school construction, 25,000 new schools, renovated schools, repaired schools. The problem, Mr. Speaker, that is the President's budget for Iraq. Uni-versal health coverage for 23 million Iraqis, school construction of 25,000 and renovation of 25,000 schools, but not a penny in the President's budget for school construction in this country, in spite of the fact that our school build-ings, many of them are in awful shape, and not a penny for universal coverage of 40 million Americans without health insurance. The reason? The tax cuts the Presi- dent has asked for of $500 billion in tax cuts. Half of those tax cuts go to the richest one percent of the people in the country. The people whose incomes av-erage $968,000. Money for school con-struction and health care in Iraq. No money for school construction and health care in the United States and tax cuts for the most privileged. It is the wrong priorities. f ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN PEACE (Mr. INSLEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to note an encouraging sign that yester-day, the President of the United States evinced a willingness to become an ac-tive player in seeking a peaceful reso-lution of the Israeli/Palestinian con-flict. And I do so because it is clear VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3575 May 1, 2003 that the United States of America is the only world force that has the abil-ity to offer both peoples meaningful hope in this region. And as such, it is very important that our President of whatever party be engaged in that process. This President evinced some reluctance to do so early in his term. But I believe now has, by issuing this road map, stated an interest to become personally involved in trying to find a resolution of this dispute. Both Democrats and Republicans have to note that is a positive step at a very difficult time. Ending the vio-lence by the Palestinians is para-mount. And there is going to be daunting challenges working with our Israeli allies involving settlement issues; but the American President has to stay engaged. This is a first step. We welcome it. We look forward to its suc-cesses. f PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1298, UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA ACT OF 2003 Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, by the direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 210 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. R ES. 210 Resolved, That at any time after the adop- tion of this resolution the Speaker may, pur-suant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 1298) to pro-vide assistance to foreign countries to com-bat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. General de-bate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and con-trolled by the chairman and ranking minor-ity member of the Committee on Inter-national Relations. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute rec-ommended by the Committee on Inter-national Relations now printed in the bill. The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. No amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this res-olution. Each amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the re-port equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be sub-ject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consider-ation of the bill for amendment the Com-mittee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amend- ment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without in-structions. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LATOURETTE ). The gentleman from Florida (Mr. L INCOLN DIAZ-BALART ) is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to my good friend, the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. H ASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consider-ation of this resolution, Mr. Speaker, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. (Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida asked and was given permis-sion to revise and extend his remarks.) MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MR . LINCOLN DIAZ -BALART OF FLORIDA Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during consideration of H.R. 1298, pursuant to House Resolu-tion 206, it shall be in order to consider the amendment that I have placed at the desk as amendment No. 8 in House Report 108-80. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Modification to Amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 108-80 offered by Mr. L IN- COLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida: Page 83, line 14, strike ''For'' and insert ''(a) T HERAPEUTIC MEDICAL CARE.\u2014For''. Page 83, after line 22, add the following new subsection: (b) O RPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN .\u2014 For fiscal years 2006 through 2008, not less than 10 percent of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropria-tions under section 401 for HIV/AIDS assist-ance for each such fiscal year shall be ex-pended for assistance for orphans and vulner-able children affected by HIV/AIDS, of which such amount at least 50 percent shall be pro-vided through non-profit, nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based organi-zations, that implement programs on the community level. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the modification be considered as read and printed in the R ECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the modification is agreed to. There was no objection. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 210 is a structured rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. The rule provides 1 hour of gen-eral debate evenly divided and con-trolled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on International Relations. Additionally, this rule makes 11 out of 13 amendments submitted to the Committee on Rules in order. Nearly half, 5 of the 11 of the amendments made in order were sponsored by mem-bers of the minority party. This is a fair rule that will allow all Members ample opportunity to debate the im-portant issues associated with this bill. The underlying legislation is as cru- cial as I think it is timely. The AIDS pandemic has affected the world like no other in recent history. The epi-demic has claimed, just in the year 2002 alone, more than 3 million lives. I think we need to pause for a second and think about what that means, 3 million lives in one year. Also, an esti-mated 5 million people acquired the virus, the human immuno-deficiency virus, HIV, in 2002, according to the best estimate, bringing the number of people globally living with the virus to over 40 million. This is, by all means, by every con- ceivable estimation, a catastrophe. However, this is not just a moral ques-tion, this critical situation has begun to threaten the security of the world, especially the developing world. The fragile governments often do not have the resources or the capability to han-dle threats as dangerous and as grow-ing as this one. If states in the devel-oping world begin to implode, collapse, the effects on the United States' na-tional security and on the security of the international community could be absolutely disastrous. A state absent of all order makes for a perfect climate for terrorists and drug traffickers to grow their enter-prises to develop their enterprises. For example, Mr. Speaker, in key states in Africa, including Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, it has been reported that over a third of their armed forces may be infected with this deadly virus. This is an inconceivable catastrophe. The pandemic of AIDS also threatens on the prospects for democracy and economic prosperity, especially in Afri-ca. According to the U.S. National In-telligence Council, ''AIDS and the health problems associated with AIDS will hurt prospects for transition to democratic regimes as these problems undermine civil society, hamper the evolution of sound political and eco-nomic institutions, and intensify the struggle for power and resources.'' The National Intelligence Council also estimates that the disease could reduce gross domestic product in some sub-Saharan African countries by 20 percent or more by the year 2010. We should consider the following fact from the most recent U.N. aids epidemic up-date, ''In 4 southern African countries national adult HIV prevalence has risen higher than thought possible, ex-ceeding 30 percent.'' If the necessary investments, Mr. Speaker, to combat this pandemic is not made today, there will undoubtedly VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3576 May 1, 2003 be significantly higher costs for all, in- cluding for the United States in the fu-ture. It is time for the Congress to act. At the podium before you, Mr. Speak- er, the President, President George W. Bush, laid before Congress a bold vision in his State of the Union address. This legislation will make President Bush's vision a reality. The underlying legislation authorizes $3 billion for the executive branch, for the President under his leadership to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide in each of the next 5 years for a total of $15 bil-lion. Additionally, this legislation will create the position of coordinator for HIV/AIDS assistance at the State De-partment to administer the Global AIDS Initiative Fund. Response to the AIDS crisis cannot come too soon when one considers the far reaching effects of this horrible disease. A fact that gives us all pause is that, for example, in Malawi alone, some 470,000 children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by AIDS. The un-derlying bill supports United States participation in the global fund and specifically authorizes up to $1 billion in fiscal year 2004 and such sums as may be necessary through 2008. The underlying legislation was re- ported favorably out of committee by a bipartisan vote of 37 to 8. I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) for his extraordinary lead- ership on this issue, as well as the dis-tinguished ranking member, another extraordinary leader, the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ). Mr. Speaker, this bill provides cru- cial relief for those directly as well as indirectly affected by this crippling disease. This has been a bipartisan ef-fort throughout the consideration of the bill, from consideration in the Committee on International Relations to this very balanced rule that has been reported out of the Committee on Rules, which continues this construc-tive debate by allowing nearly every Democrat amendment in order. I re-peat that this process has been bipar-tisan, Mr. Speaker. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support both the rule and the under-lying legislation. I think there are few things that we could do in this Con-gress of more importance that will help more of our fellow human beings. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. HASTINGS of Florida asked and was given permission to revise and ex-tend his remarks.) Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend and neighbor to the south, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. L IN- COLN DIAZ-BALART ) for yielding me the customary time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support in the strongest possible terms for the United States leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, H.R. 1298. b1030 I have long been concerned with the problem of HIV/AIDS, not just in our own country but also as it affects the poor countries of the world. I am proud that the response to this disease has been truly a bipartisan one. AIDS is blind to party stripes or political affili-ation. Mr. Speaker, this bill provides $15 billion over the next 5 years to increase and expand in a significant way our program to fight HIV/AIDS in sub-Sa-haran Africa and the Caribbean. The scientific community has not yet found a cure for HIV/AIDS, but there is a vast body of knowledge that has greatly im-proved the quality of treatment for those who have HIV and AIDS. Sub-Saharan Africa is far more se- verely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world. In fact, AIDS has surpassed malaria as a leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, and it kills many more people than armed conflicts. The statistics, Mr. Speaker, are startling. Africa, where an esti-mated 3 12million people were newly infected with HIV in 2002, has approxi-mately 10 percent of the world's popu-lation but more than 70 percent of the worldwide total of people infected with HIV. In 2002, the joint United Nations pro- gram on HIV/AIDS, commonly referred to as UNAIDS, reported 29.4 million people were living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the Congressional Research Service, at the end of 2001 an estimated 19 million Af-ricans had lost their lives to AIDS, in-cluding an estimated 2.2 million who had died during that year alone. UNAIDS estimates that by the year 2020 an additional 55 million Africans will lose their lives to this awful dis-ease. Additionally, this pandemic is having a much greater impact on children in Africa than is the case in other parts of the world. According to UNAIDS, more than 600,000 African infants become in-fected with HIV each year through mother-to-child transmission, either at birth or through breast-feeding. These children have short life expectancies, and the number of them currently alive with HIV is approximately about 1 mil-lion. In 2001, about 11 million children became orphans because of AIDS in Af-rica. And because of the stigma at-tached to AIDS, children who become orphans through AIDS are at a high risk of being malnourished, abused, and denied an education. In the Caribbean, the AIDS epidemic does not compare to the severity of the pandemic in Africa, but it has reached alarming levels. There are an esti-mated 420,000 people living with AIDS in Caribbean countries. Moreover, the HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate in sev-eral countries in the Caribbean is among the highest outside of sub-Saha-ran Africa. Haiti, the Dominican Re-public, and Guiana are the countries crying out for assistance. Every day AIDS claims the lives of thousands of innocent people. Accord-ing to the latest United Nations AIDS report, roughly 600,000 people die of AIDS on a daily basis. While this legis-lation directs action toward the AIDS problem in Africa and the Caribbean, the disease wreaks havoc in other re-gions of the world, including the United States. The fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemic is in Eastern Eu-rope and Eurasia. Further, Asia and the Pacific may also face a huge growth in this epidemic. The impact of AIDS can extend be- yond the direct loss of life. It has indi-rect effects on life and health costs not normally associated directly with the disease. Recently, for example, AIDS fueled deadly famines in east and southern Africa. The HIV/AIDS pan-demic is a global human challenge that demands a global comprehensive re-sponse, and I am proud that the United States has signified that it is going to take the lead. This legislation author-izes up to $1 billion for the global fund as a way to show our international leadership in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic and to leverage funds out of other countries to reach the lev-els needed annually to address this problem. I had the good fortune during the break to meet with the executive direc-tor of the Global Fund and our own Secretary of Health and Human Serv-ices and the minister for health in Italy when they signed an agreement indicating the Italian-American under-standings with reference to approach-ing this problem. And I assured, and I am sure many of my colleagues can as well, the director of the Global Fund that we would do everything that we can to ensure appropriate resources are in the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS and malaria and tuberculosis. This is a good bill. In fact, it mirrors many of the provisions of a bill I intro-duced on Tuesday. Mr. Speaker, the toll of this disease has brought un-speakable sorrow and distress to Afri-ca, the Caribbean and other areas of the world. Our government has not done enough to address this disease in Africa and elsewhere. We should be proud of this effort and view it as a new start on the road to eradicating AIDS. That is the purpose of this legis-lation, Mr. Speaker. With the addi-tional resources, both financial and human, provided for in this legislation, we can begin to stem the tide of this disease. We know what works in the ef-fort to combat HIV and AIDS, and we need to get on about the business of doing it. Mr. Speaker, America is a great country in many ways. In the long his-tory of humankind, our greatness will be measured as much by what we do for the needy and the less fortunate of the world and in our country as it is by the quality of life we achieve right here in America. The real measure of our hu-manity as a Nation is our ability to VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3577 May 1, 2003 share our treasure, our time, and our talents with truly needy people. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. I yield to my good friend, the gentleman from California and the ranking member of the Committee on International Rela-tions. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my distinguished colleague for yielding to me, and since he may not participate in the debate on the bill itself, I wished to publicly pay tribute to his leadership role on this most im-portant issue. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Reclaim- ing my time, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS). I appreciate that very much. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no speak-ers at the present time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 min-utes to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L EE), who has, since she has been a Member of Congress, been to-tally committed to trying to alleviate AIDS in the world and has been the leader in legislation with reference to this problem, and certainly working with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS), has been directly involved in this particular piece of legislation. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida, for yielding me this time and for his leadership and his assistance and guidance throughout this entire process. Since I have been here in Congress and since 1998, we began to introduce and bring forward to this Congress the notion, really, of an AIDS Marshall Plan, which former Congressman Ron Dellums, my predecessor, conceived, brought to us, and indicated why the Congress should begin to go on record to take the lead in the world to fight this global pandemic. I would like to thank our chairman, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), and our ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS), for their leadership and for mak- ing sure that this continues to be a bi-partisan effort. This is not really a po-litical issue. Both gentlemen have made sure that throughout this overall process that the people and their needs and the issues with regard to this pan-demic stayed foremost in our mind and would not allow us to break down into our partisan squabbles that oftentimes we break down into. So I thank them both for their leadership. I would like to now talk just a little bit about the Uganda model of success, which is, of course, the model the President has cited as the model he is looking to to address this pandemic in this bill, and also why I believe the 33 percent set-aside offered by the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS) is an amendment that goes counter to what the President's intentions and stated reasons for moving forward in the Uganda fashion. First of all, each country, each vil- lage, each organization knows what strategies work best in terms of how they address this pandemic. This pan-demic is killing so many people, there are so many orphans, there is so much disaster on the continent of Africa, that we have to marshal each and every effective way to stop it. So we should not in any way constrain this bill to a 33 percent set-aside that places for the most part abstinence as a pri-ority. Again, this flies in the face of what our agreement was in committee, and that is the ABC approach, which is the Uganda approach: abstinence, be faith-ful, use a condom. The three-pronged approach should be balanced, is bal-anced, and should be the approach we use in this bill. I do not know why this requirement now, after our committee debate and committee discussion, would be put into the bill when we know the President has called for all three approaches. In fact, the Wash-ington Times today indicated its sup-port for the three-pronged approach and not for us prioritizing one versus the others. And let me just read what the Ugan- da model really is. I do not think we should be misled or misinformed about what Uganda is doing. Sophia Monico, who was the director of TASO, which is Uganda's premier HIV/AIDS group, said, and this is quoted in The New York Times article, she said: ''It is so unfair to pull out one element of a big-ger picture, a very small percentage of the whole picture, and say 'this is what works.''' She goes on to say that ''Uganda is indeed a model for nations fighting AIDS, but it is not quite the model the religious right would like to believe. Ugandans are responding to a campaign known as ABC, which says: Abstain. If you can't abstain, be faith-ful. If you can't be faithful, use a condom. Contrary to the assertions,'' the article goes on to say, ''of Mr. P ITTS and others, there is really noth- ing unusual about this slogan.'' The WHO has sanctioned this. This is the standard public health approach to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. And so, Mr. Speaker, today, as we de-bate this bill, I hope Members of Con-gress will understand that setting aside 33 percent for abstinence only flies in the face of ABC. It flies in the face of the Uganda model. It does us a dis-service as we put forward this very good bill to now take a step backwards and put a requirement on our organiza-tions that makes no sense, that will not work, and, quite frankly, that was defeated in committee. So I want to see this move forward in a way I know the President wants to see it move forward, and that is the ABC approach, the standard multi-faceted approach that gives all three approaches equal weight. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, precisely because issues like these are so important and need to be discussed is why we have made them in order in the Committee on Rules for discussion. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. P AUL). (Mr. PAUL asked and was given per- mission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I want to call attention to something in the committee report that I consider an error, and I would like to make a suggestion so that it might not occur again. This particular legislation, not the rule as much as the legislation, I am not in support of for various reasons. b1045 One, I think the odds are very slim that it is going to do a whole lot of good. It is very well-intended. I am a physician, and I cannot think of any-thing better than to wipe out AIDS in Africa, or in the United States, for that matter. But $15 billion going to Africa on a questionable program bothers me because at the same time, we are cut-ting benefits to our veterans and also the elderly have a hard time getting medical care here. So there is a prac-tical argument against the legislation. In the bill and in the amendments, there is a lot of social engineering going on. I think if we are going to do any social engineering or social sugges-tions, it ought to be here and we ought not be naive enough to think we can change habits that exist in Africa. But the point I wanted to bring up is the authority for doing programs like this. We have a rule in the House that we have to cite the constitutional au-thority, for the legislation we're deal-ing with. The committee report cites the authority from a very important section of the Constitution, article I, section 8, because literally we, the Con-gress, get our marching orders from ar-ticle I, section 8, which is the section of the Constitution relating to making all laws necessary and proper for car-rying into execution the powers vested by the Constitution. Well, that is where the shortcoming comes because if we read the Constitu-tion, at the end of article I, section 8, it says, ''To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.'' Therefore, the ''necessary and proper'' clause is explicitly designed to give the authority to write the laws for the foregoing powers. Believe me, we will not find any authority in article I, sec-tion 8 for dealing with medical care problems in Africa. I find it interesting here because quite often one side of the aisle when they do not like legislation will use my VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3578 May 1, 2003 argument in this case, and other times it is the other side of the aisle. So ev-erybody makes my argument one time or the other. My suggestion is if the Constitution means anything, and if article I, section 8 means anything, it ought to be applied across the board or we ought to change the Constitution and say this is a mandate from the American people that we should pursue missionary work in Africa. But most likely nobody is going to propose a change in the Constitution, the Constitution will not be changed, so the Congress chooses to ignore the Constitution when it feel like it; there-fore, we have reduced the Constitution to something that has very little value anymore. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. W YNN) who has stood out on this issue for all the time he and I have served here in Con-gress. Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time and for his leadership on this issue. It is very good to stand here in sup- port of a bipartisan bill that addresses some of the real problems in the world today. Particularly in the wake of the situation in Iraq, it is important for the United States to show the world that we care about the big problems that affect other people in other coun-tries as well as issues that affect Amer-ican interests. Let me take a moment to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) for her leadership. If anyone in this body has stood up on this issue, it is the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), as well as the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), and the gen- tleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE). This is truly a bipartisan bill. I would also like to applaud the President because he has pushed this issue $15 billion to fight AIDS in Africa. I think that is a very good thing. I hasten to note that many of these programs started under the Clinton ad-ministration, and for years, Demo-cratic activists have been fighting for additional money to fight AIDS in Af-rica. I intend to support this bill; how-ever, the rule allows amendments which I believe are problems. Some of my conservative brethren come to this debate and argue that we ought to give more priority to absti-nence. In a tone of some self-righteous-ness they suggest that abstinence ought to be the preferred method, and that this reflects American values. I think on the issue of fighting AIDS, the American value is saving as many lives as we possibly can. And for that reason when later today we have this amendment to prioritize and single out abstinence, I am going to oppose it. I think our responsibility is to make resources available to be used in the best, most efficient way possible. Ab-stinence does have merit, I will be the first to say that. And where it can be used effectively and advocated to young people, I would support that. But to say that abstinence should get a specific share of the money, even if it is not the most effective proposal, does not make sense. The American value is to save lives. Now, it seems to me that we ought to use all available approaches and use our money most effectively and most efficiently. My conservative colleagues say look at the Uganda model. And as the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) just pointed out, they have some- what distorted it. They would have us believe that Uganda, which has been very successful in reducing AIDS, pri-marily relies on abstinence. That is not true. It is true that Uganda has been suc- cessful in reducing infection rates from 26 percent to 6 percent over a 20-year period. It is not true that they rely solely or even primarily on abstinence. Abstinence is only part of their Anti-aids program. In fact, Ugandans used 80 million condoms last year. 80 million condoms. Condom use by prostitutes in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda, has increased from zero to 95 percent. It has been proven that condom use is an important part of the program. What we are saying today is that we need to include all approaches: Absti-nence, faithfulness, and condom use, and not single out any particular ap-proach. Let the affected communities in Africa decide what works best and spend the money accordingly. If we do that, this is truly a great bill and we should be proud to support it. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 12minutes to the gen- tleman from Oregon (Mr. B LUMENAUER ) who also has been in the leadership on this matter and serves on the Com-mittee on International Relations. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of what transpired in the Committee on International Relations this last couple of months in moving this legislation forward. It was re-ported out of committee by an over-whelming bipartisan majority, and it shows what we can do when we come together in a bipartisan fashion. I com-mend the administration for its sup-port of a creative solution for the HIV-AIDS epidemic that Members from both parties can support. It has been referenced that some of our colleagues have interpreted ABC as ''anything but condoms,'' and we are going to talk about that on the floor as various amendments come forward; but I think it is critical that we take a step back and not put a political agenda ahead of a program with proven suc-cess. I hope that my colleagues can with- hold their desire to impose their stand-ards on hundreds of millions of people that live in different countries with different cultures, in wildly different communities. There is too much at risk for global health, which certainly includes our own in this country. Ad-dressing the AIDS epidemic, tuber-culosis, and malaria not only benefits the health of those individuals, it is going to stabilize communities and re-gions that are devastating. And, yes, it is going to help us at home as we work to alleviate global issues of health, safety and security. The SARS epidemic provides the most recent, graphic, current example of the need to address epidemics at a global level before they affect us here in America. I hope we can reflect not just on the hard work of the adminis-tration, our chairman, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), the gen- tleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), active leaders like the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), but reflect on how when the legislative process works when we put the imperative of problem solving ahead of political con-cerns. We have more at stake these days than just dealing with the AIDS epi-demic. I hope that this will be a tem-plate not just moving forward in this critical area, important as it is, but this is the way that we can solve home-land security issues, economic issues, and the great issues on the inter-national arena as well. Mr. Speaker, I commend our friends who were there, and I urge adoption of the rule and moving forward with ap-proval of this and then going home this weekend thinking about what we have accomplished, how we have done it and where we can take it from here. Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. H ASTINGS ). I reit- erate and strongly believe there are few things that we could do more im-portant than what we are going to do today. I am very proud to have been able to bring forward this rule to pro-vide for consideration of this extraor-dinarily important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f GENERAL LEAVE Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on the bill H.R. 1298, which we are about to con-sider. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. L IN- COLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida). Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Illinois? There was no objection. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, 1, 2003 UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBER-CULOSIS, AND MALARIA ACT OF 2003 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 1298. b1058 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1298) to provide assistance to foreign countries to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and for other purposes, with Mr. L ATOURETTE in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered as having been read the first time. Under the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE). Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, not since the bubonic plague swept across the world in the last millennium killing more than 250 million people has our world con-fronted such a horrible, unspeakable curse as we are now witnessing with the growing HIV/AIDS pandemic. In the very short time that we will spend today considering this legisla-tion, thousands of people around the world will die of HIV/AIDS. The num-ber of dead or dying is grotesquely high: 25 million already dead worldwide and growing at the rate of 8,500 every day, with the horror of entire villages populated only by orphans because the adults are dead or dying from AIDS. I do not mean to demean the work of this House, but so much of what we do is really unimportant and trivial; but not today. Today we have an oppor-tunity, the opportunity to do some-thing significant and of lasting impor-tance. Today we have an obligation, the obligation to do something reflect-ing our commitment to human soli-darity. We have a privilege today, the privilege of doing something truly compassionate. It is no exaggeration to compare the AIDS pandemic in Africa to the bu-bonic plague in medieval Europe. This plague took one-third of Europe's en-tire population, creating political chaos and set the course of civilization back for decades, perhaps centuries. AIDS in Africa is well on its way to doing something terribly similar, and similarly terrible. Tuesday's Wall Street Journal tells us 42 million peo-ple are infected with HIV/AIDS, 30 mil-lion in sub-Saharan Africa alone. b1100 Today we need to consider H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. We would not be here today with this bill, that I think is an excel-lent one, without the sincere and heartfelt and invaluable assistance of the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), which makes this a truly bi- partisan effort. This legislation authorizes the Presi- dent's 5-year $15 billion emergency plan for treatment and prevention of AIDS in those countries already facing crisis. The legislation creates a more responsive, coordinated, and effective approach among the various agencies of the U.S. Government involved in this global fight. The legislation pro-motes an approach that provides funds for antiretroviral therapy for more than 2 million people living with HIV. It encourages a strategy that extends palliative care for people living with AIDS. It supports efforts to find vac-cines for HIV/AIDS and malaria. It em-phasizes the need to keep families to-gether with particular focus on the as-sistance needs of children and young people with HIV. It endorses preven-tion programs that stress sexual absti-nence and monogamy as a first line of defense against the spread of this dis-ease and contributes to multilateral initiatives that leverage the funds of other donor nations. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is more than a humanitarian crisis. Increasingly, it is a threat to the security of the devel-oped world. Left unchecked, this plague will further rip the fabric of de-veloping societies, pushing fragile gov-ernments and economies to the point of collapse. So to those who suggest the U.S. has no stake in this pandemic, let me observe that the specter of failed states across the world certainly is our concern. Africa is a central concern. Today radical Islam is spreading in several African countries, especially Nigeria. This threatens to undercut democracy and make Nigeria a failed state. It is in our interest to counter this movement by doing what we can to build democ-racy and a growing economy in Nigeria and elsewhere. The spread of HIV/AIDS frustrates this important mission. We also have a strong interest in seeing the development of professional Afri-can militaries, militaries capable of maintaining stability in their country, but also capable of contributing to peacekeeping operations elsewhere in Africa. Yet an examination of the HIV/AIDS rates among the armed forces of key African countries, including Nige-ria, South Africa, and Kenya, reveals infection rates between 30 and 40 per-cent. HIV/AIDS is a national security issue for those countries and for us. The President's proposal is based on America's deep conviction about the dignity of every human life, and these proposed remedies for the AIDS crisis in Africa recognize that human dig-nity. In adopting this proposal, we show the world that conviction and compassion go together as we dem-onstrate that compassion is not a sign of weakness but of strength. America does not have to take on the African AIDS crisis alone; but as is often the case, American leadership, political or financial, is necessary if our friends around the world are to bear their fair share of the burden. That is what the President's proposal does. It sets a pat-tern of American leadership that oth-ers we believe will follow. This bill is a compromise, a deli- cately arrived at, painstakingly nego-tiated compromise between various factions interested in this legislation; but it hangs together, and it works and it will advance the cause that we so desperately need to support. AIDS is a mortal challenge to our civilization. Let us today be animated by compas-sion and, yes, vision that always have defined what it means to be an Amer-ican. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of this grand humanitarian legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to make history today by securing its passage. Mr. Chairman, we could not have reached this day had it not been for the heroic efforts of the gentleman from Il-linois (Mr. H YDE), my distinguished chairman and good friend. His leader-ship on this issue has been a true pro-file in courage, and I salute him. I also want to identify myself with his power-ful and eloquent opening statement. Our colleagues on the Committee on International Relations, the gentle-woman from California (Ms. L EE) and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ) on the Republican side, have also been critically instrumental to our success thus far as have many other members of the committee. With the support of every single Democrat and most Re-publicans on the Committee on Inter-national Relations, we have crafted a bipartisan piece of legislation worthy of this body's support. Mr. Chairman, the $15 billion author- ized in this legislation to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria world-wide is an enormous sum by any meas-ure. It is five times the amount we con-sidered authorizing for this cause just last year. For those of us who have long called for a real commitment of resources to address the HIV/AIDS cri-sis, our day has arrived. As impressive as these amounts are, they are no more than the crisis demands. Every day AIDS claims the lives of thousands of innocent men, women, and, yes, chil-dren, old and young, sick and able-bod-ied, destitute and affluent, unemployed and professional, African, Asian, and American. This disease, Mr. Chairman, does not discriminate. It targets us all; and in doing so, it ruins families, deci-mates communities, and fuels the vio-lence and bloodshed that destroys whole nations. The political, economic, social, and humanitarian impact of this scourge cannot be contained to one region or to one population. It is a VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3580 May 1, 2003 global human challenge that demands a global humanitarian response with the United States in the lead. The tragic history of this disease has shown that there are no silver bullets. We must use every means at our dis-posal to defeat it. All legislation builds to a significant extent upon Uganda's success in curbing the spread of AIDS through a combination of abstinence, monogamy, and condom use. In lending his support to this bill earlier this week, President Bush endorsed this three-pronged approach. In the Presi-dent's words, preventing spread of HIV/AIDS requires a strategy emphasizing abstinence, marital fidelity, as well as condoms. Each element is crucial. Uganda's success in combating HIV/AIDS required not only abstinence and marital fidelity education programs but the distribution of nearly 80 mil-lion condoms per year. Countless lives will be lost if we fail to learn this les-son and undermine the balanced ap-proach exquisitely negotiated and em-bodied in this bill. Mr. Chairman, in the his State of the Union address earlier this year, the President issued a challenge to Con-gress to join him in a new global cam-paign to combat HIV/AIDS. Today we take up the President's challenge and seek to fully fund this bold initiative. An overwhelming vote by the House of Representatives today to pass H.R. 1298 without crippling amendments will bring the President's vision, a vision most of us share, close to reality. The time for words has passed and the time for action has arrived in our struggle against HIV/AIDS. I urge my col-leagues to join me today to pass this historic legislation. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ). Mr. LEACH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Perspective is the most important and most difficult thing to apply to issues of the day. If one were to look at the 14th century, clearly the seminal event was the Bubonic plague in which some 20 million people died. Now, as many have died from AIDS as of the plague. Within a decade it will be a multiple of that figure. If sitting on the Moon, one might suggest that the most important public policy issue of our day is dealing with disease control, most particularly AIDS. In a very moral sense, it is probably the deepest philosophical issue of our time. Indeed, the global AIDS epidemic might be considered an epidemic of Biblical pro-portions. Everyone in this Congress under- stands that foreign assistance is con-troversial, but we are, after all, our brother's keeper and we must be con-cerned for the global family. We also have to be concerned for our own fami-lies. To the degree AIDS is not thwart-ed abroad, it threatens our own shores. As a Congress, obviously we have to be concerned with the allocation of the people's resources. This bill is a lot of money, but it is an extraordinarily sparse amount compared with the need; and I think of all the bills we are going to vote on in the near future, this is going to be the most justified financial expense the United States Congress has undertaken. In conclusion, let me just say we are all indebted to a lot of people from the outside, the President of the United States; the singer, Bono; and then our colleagues, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), and from a distinct perspective the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS) for rais- ing concerns of America's faith-based community. But most of all I want to simply express my appreciation for the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE). This is the most important bill he has ever shepherded through Congress. It is going to be a seminal mark in his ca-reer, and we are all in his debt. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Before yielding to our distinguished whip, let me also underscore the impor-tant contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS of Bono who has worked with us on all aspects of this problem and whose leadership worldwide is deeply appreciated by all of us con-cerned with this issue. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. H OYER ), the distinguished Democratic whip, a leader on this and all issues in this body. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding me this time. I join the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ) in congratulating the gen- tleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), ranking member, as well as the extraordinary work that has been done by the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L EE) as a Member of Con- gress and before she got to Congress. b1115 Mr. Chairman, the great Dr. Martin Luther King, one of the world's great humanitarians, once said, ''We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.'' Today, through this truly historic, bipartisan legislation authorizing $15 billion over the next 5 years for over-seas care, treatment and prevention of AIDS, we recognize that our Nation has a moral obligation and a national secu-rity interest in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as malaria and tuberculosis. We ignore the world's increasing interdependence at our own peril, Mr. Chairman. And, frankly, while many of my colleagues have fought for many years to bring needed resources to bear on this problem, their call to arms has not, until now, been fully embraced. The source scourge of AIDS knows no borders. It does not discriminate. It targets every one of us, infecting some 42 million people around the world, two-thirds of them from Africa. As my good friend the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), who has worked with the gentleman from Illi-nois (Chairman H YDE) to bring this leg- islation to the floor today, stated in the markup of this bill, this health care crisis ruins families, communities and whole nations, fueling violence and bloodshed across borders. It cannot be contained in one region or in one popu-lation. And, thus, it is a global chal-lenge that demands a global, humani-tarian response with the United States in the lead. The ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), the gen- tlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), and certainly the gentleman from Illi-nois (Chairman H YDE), deserve our con- gratulations, our thanks and admira-tion for their leadership in crafting this bill's balanced approach to treat-ment and prevention. It is a real com-mitment to addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis. I would hope that amendments to be offered later today that would upset this carefully crafted, balanced piece of legislation, that those amendments would be rejected. In particular, the Pitts amendment would upset the bal-anced HIV/AIDS prevention approach called for in the bill by requiring that one-third of the prevention funds be used solely for abstinence-only pro-grams. Certainly we are supportive of abstinence, but not to wall it off for sole use resources. This historic legislation reflects our values, protects our interests, and ex-tends, Mr. Chairman, a handle of hope to millions of vulnerable people across the world. We need not ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for us. This legislation is a response by us to reach out to save lives, to heal, and to make our Nation and our global community more se-cure. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to the dis-tinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. W ELDON ) who, as an original co- sponsor of this legislation, has made an invaluable contribution. Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I rise today in strong support of this legislation, and I want to com-mend the chairman and ranking mem-ber for their open-mindedness in allow-ing me to be a part of this process. The bill before us today is a dem- onstration of the American people ex-tending the hand of compassion and hope to millions of people suffering worldwide from AIDS. The level of commitment to end HIV/ AIDS demonstrated in this bill before us today is long overdue. Previous at-tempts to address the issue of global HIV/AIDS channeled millions of dollars into unaccountable multilateral efforts VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, 1, 2003 and programs that showed little effec- tiveness and did little to stem the death toll. H.R. 1298 reforms the status quo, en- sures the most effective use of every dollar and puts new policies in place to help save lives. The bill sets a new course by focusing on real solutions, such as the model provided by Uganda. The bill requires financial account- ability and opens doors to programs that have a history of doing much with little. H.R. 1298 features a strong absti-nence education component that has been proven to save lives by elimi-nating risky sexual behavior. This is a very important point. One of the key components of H.R. 1298 is a clear focus on prevention through education. The bill promotes primary prevention by funding activi-ties that help individuals avoid HIV in-fection. Instead of just working to-wards reducing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, this bill seeks to help young peo-ple adopt behaviors where the risk of HIV/AIDS can be eliminated. No longer do we just seek to manage the sure death of HIV infection. This bill em-powers young people to participate in a future free from the behavioral risks of contracting HIV/AIDS. The bill distinguishes between true primary prevention efforts, such as ab-stinence education, from intervention activities that promote condoms under the guise of prevention. The bill distin-guishes between prevention services that are appropriate for everyone and preventive intervention that helps a segment of the population engaging in risky behavior. As a physician who pre-viously cared for AIDS patients, I know that encouraging this primary prevention approach will save lives, and save money. Another key component of the bill is bringing faith-based organizations into full participation with efforts to com-bat HIV/AIDS. Local churches and faith-based groups promote behavior change to prevent HIV, reduce the stig-ma associated with HIV infection, and treat those afflicted with the disease and care for orphans. The Catholic Church alone currently cares for one in four people being treat-ed by HIV/AIDS worldwide. Mission or-ganizations already possess much of the infrastructure, experience, knowl-edge and compassion necessary to com-bat AIDS. They also have a history of respecting the culture and values of in-digenous communities and peoples so that lasting relationships and change can occur. And faith-based groups are doing this in the most remote areas with the greatest need. Up until now, resources that could have helped the efforts of churches and faith-based approaches have been soaked up by large international spe-cial interests. My missionary friends in Africa tell me about the many hats, T-shirts and conferences that UNAIDS provides to promote condoms and HIV/AIDS awareness. Unfortunately, few real resources are provided to help pre-vent HIV/AIDS infection. I am personally aware of faith-based organizations that have been in-coun-try for years, that have the support of the community, that have the support of the government and have brought people of different faiths together around strategies that are culturally and age-appropriate, but yet have been refused resources through USAID and UN-funded programs. Or they have been given a deal to promote condoms or get nothing. H.R. 1298 will open up new avenues to fund powerful faith-based efforts that save lives in the poorest and most re-mote places. I strongly encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to be an original cosponsor of the bill, and I again commend the chairman, the ranking member and their staff for crafting what I feel is a very, very good piece of legislation. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield 5 minutes to my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), who has brought boundless energy and bold pas-sion to this legislation. She has been the leader on our side on this entire matter. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman. Let me first thank our ranking member, the gen-tleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), for those very kind and generous re-marks, and let me thank the gen-tleman for his leadership in helping to ensure that our Democrats really saw the goal and understood our mission and helped to work to make sure that this was a bipartisan bill. I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) for his leader- ship, and for, again, I think, setting an example that on issues of common con-cern and where the survival of the human family is at stake, we all can come together and agree that we should work together. I also want to thank our staffs, espe- cially Christos on my staff, and Pearl Alice, Peter and the entire committee staff, for their very diligent, competent and dedicated work. Mr. Chairman, today we really do stand at the crossroads in this global battle gains HIV/AIDS. With an esti-mated 42 million individuals infected worldwide, the disease has already dev-astated the African continent, where 30 million people, 30 million, are cur-rently living with AIDS and over 11 million children have been orphaned by this pandemic. Throughout Africa, AIDS has had a devastating impact, not only on health, but on education, agriculture, the economy, the military, on govern-ments, as people at all levels of society have struggled to cope with this dis-ease. Even now, the ongoing famine in Sub-Saharan Africa has been aggra-vated by the AIDS crisis. Food Insecu-rity and malnutrition have contributed to the spread of the virus, and both have sped up the onset of AIDS in HIV-infected individuals. The Caribbean, which is ranked as the second most affected region behind Africa, is also facing a devastating sit-uation because of AIDS. In Haiti, where over 90 percent of all AIDS cases in the Caribbean are, Haiti has the un-fortunate distinction of being the only country outside of Africa with an adult prevalence rate of over 6.5 percent. Despite the devastation that HIV and AIDS has caused within Africa and the Caribbean, the disease is truly a global killer. Even here at home, in my own district in Alameda County, we have been forced to declare a state of emer-gency to deal with the AIDS crisis. Now the disease is poised to run ramp-ant through India, China and Russia, where a lack of information is contrib-uting to the spread of the disease among poor and rural populations. So without a truly global effort to halt the spread of this disease, to pro-vide care and treatment to those who are infected and affected by HIV and AIDS, we will all face a humanitarian disaster, the likes of which the world has never seen before. But there is hope. We have the know- how to stop the spread of HIV, and we have the drugs to prolong the lives of those infected with AIDS. The chal-lenge is how we translate this know-how and these resources to people liv-ing in the developing world. Yet even in a country as poor as Haiti, there are already programs on the ground that are making a dif-ference with minimal resources, like the Zanmi Lasante Clinic, run by Dr. Paul Farmer and the dedicated people at Partners in Health. And we also know from the indica- tion of Uganda that when a country unites in the battle against AIDS, through the leadership, through its president, members of the government and civil society, and when everyone really engages in open dialogue about sex and AIDS, the need for abstinence, faithfulness and safe sex through the use of condoms, the HIV/AIDS rate can be reversed. In this case, it came down from 15 percent in 1991 to 5 percent 10 years later. But it took all three strat-egies. No preference is given to one over the other. This bill we have before us today really recognizes these possibilities. But, more importantly, it sends a mes-sage to the world that the United States will not sit idly by and allow AIDS to wreak havoc on the human family. By committing $3 billion a year to fighting global HIV/AIDS and the two largest opportunistic infections that feed off of AIDS, tuberculosis and ma-laria, we will virtually double our glob-al AIDS budget in the next year. Several years ago when we won a $40 million increase in global AIDS spend-ing in 2000 under the leadership of our distinguished minority leader, the gen-tlewoman from California (Ms. P ELOSI ), we felt that that was a major victory and a major accomplishment. This leg-islation now puts those living with VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3582 May 1, 2003 AIDS and those at greatest risk of get- ting infected ahead of ideological and political differences, and that is why the Pitts amendment does such a dis-service to the bill and to those who desperately need our help. This bill at-tempts to create a comprehensive strategy to deal with the AIDS pan-demic. Comprehensive. Finally, let me just say how impor- tant it is that this be new money. The President said that this was new money. We must make sure that this is new money. We face many challenges as this bill moves forward, but we hope that the President will receive the bill on his desk intact and sign it before Memorial Day, as he said he wanted to do. Mr. Chairman I want to thank again the chairman of our committee and the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS) for their leadership, and once again hope that we can pass this bill intact, as it moved out of committee. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the learned gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. G REEN ). b1130 Mr. GREEN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair- man, I thank the gentleman from Illi-nois (Mr. H YDE) for yielding me this time. During the course of the debate today, we will hear a lot of numbers, thousands and millions of percentiles. We will have a lot of platitudes. Plati-tudes are important, numbers are im-portant; but they are just lines on a page. Let me give my colleagues an image that may help us put this all into per-spective. Not so very long ago, I met a missionary who had served in the very area where I taught high school in Af-rica some 15 years ago, and I asked her what the changes were that she had seen over her time. I thought she would say to me, cell phones, electricity, run-ning water, which we did not have; and she said, no, that is not it. She said, now as you walk down that mud path, you will stop and suddenly say to your-selves, my God, there are no adults here. There are children and there are grandparents, but there is an entire generation missing. Mr. Chairman, so many here are talking about why we must do this for the sake of the impoverished and the needy around the world, and it is true. I would also suggest we need to pass this legislation for our sake. Two rea-sons: number one, it makes us more human. Every one of the great faiths in this world calls upon its followers to care for their neighbor. I know my faith does. My faith requires me to take up issues like this. Secondly, it is a matter of national security. If we do not get our arms around this pandemic, this plague, entire regions of the world will be destabilized; and when they are destabilized, we will see openings for radicalism, and where radicalism grows, dangers emerge, dangers to us and our way of life. So yes, we must do this for the im- poverished and the needy around the world, but we do this for us too. We are Americans. It is in our nature. It is the thing that we should do. This is impor-tant legislation. It is historic legisla-tion. I commend the chairman. I agree with one of the previous speakers that this will be our most important legisla-tion. It will save lives; it will shape history. I am proud to be part of this. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, before yielding to our next speaker, I want to express my deep appreciation to sev-eral members of our staff. Pearl Alice Marsh, David Abramowitz, Peter Yeo, Bob King, and on the staff of the gen-tlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), Christos Tsentas. They have done an outstanding job in bringing this legis-lation to the floor. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 1 minute to my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. C ROW- LEY), a distinguished member of the Committee on International Relations and a leader on this issue. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) for yielding me this time. I want to applaud the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) for his work on this bill. I want to voice my strong support for the United States Leadership Against the HIV/AIDS, Ma-laria, and Tuberculosis Act of 2003. Make no mistake, this bill is a big step in the right direction. This bill means more help for those infected with HIV/AIDS. It means more hope and help for children who are dying from malaria. It means that fewer families will live in fear of tuberculosis. This bill is a true victory. But we must take the steps to ensure that what this bill stands for, protecting the health of individuals around the world, is also protected. And that is why we must see that this bill is not the end of the debate, but rather a step in the right direction. The prevention and treatment of these diseases requires funding; but, of course, it requires even more. It re-quires accurate information, cultural sensitivity, rapid response. It requires real dedication. Mr. Chairman, $15 billion over 5 years is real assistance for some of the world's most vulnerable, but only if it is allowed to be spent as those on the ground see fit. This bill can mean real hope for countless people around the world. I only hope that what this bill stands for survives as well. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. M CCOTTER ). Mr. M CCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, one of our Nation's seminal principles holds that all human beings have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Inherent in this principle, in this promise, rests the belief that to truly and fully live, every human heart needs hope. National borders neither define nor diminish this need. And today, millions of our fellow human beings throughout the world have no hope, for they suffer under the perceived certainty of an AIDS death sentence. For years they have done so with no hope for relief or reprieve until our Nation brought them this proposal's promising ray of hope. Due to this historic legislation, mil- lions of ravaged bodies have hearts beating with hope. And thus, it is mor-ally imperative that we pass this his-toric legislation, continue tending and kindling the sick and sufferings' faint rays of hope and, as Americans, reaf-firm and retain our revolutionary role as a herald of hope for all humanity. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield 1 12minutes to the dis- tinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P AYNE ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Committee on International Relations, my good friend who has been one of the strongest leaders on this whole issue in the Congress. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Chairman, let me express my strong support for this leg-islation and begin by commending the Bush administration for this initiative of 15 billion new dollars. I would like to also commend the gentleman from Illi-nois (Mr. H YDE), the chairman of the Committee on International Relations, for standing up to criticism primarily from his own friends. In spite of the criticism, the gentleman from Illinois showed that he still has the competi-tive drive that he had as an out-standing basketball player, that when the game got close, when it got tough, when it was needed, that last push, he stayed the course; and I would like to certainly commend him for that. We appreciate the work of the gen- tleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ). We have all come to- gether. But let me just say that I have seen the devastation with my own eyes. Over the 15 years that I have been in Congress, I have spent time during my first year visiting hostels and hospitals where HIV and AIDS patients were dying, and it was a time when many people throughout the world were cry-ing out for help. I was devastated be-cause their voices were not being heard. People were dying all around us. Voltaire said, ''Nothing is as power- ful as a dream whose time has come.'' The dream that we should really fight this devastating disease, the fact that people around the world are being dev-astated, not because of anything that is abnormal, but because of something that has just entered into this society. And so I hope that we will keep the leg-islation intact. I am proud to stand here and say that we are doing prob-ably the greatest thing that we have done since I have been in the Congress, as has been mentioned earlier today. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the dis-tinguished gentleman from Delaware (Mr. C ASTLE ). VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 H3583 May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the administration as well, as a lot of others have spoken to today. The leadership of this House, and particularly the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the rank- ing member, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), two extraordinary Members who really care about issues such as this. This is important legislation that will dramatically increase the United States' participation and role in com-bating HIV and AIDS. The HIV/AIDS scourge is not only an international health threat killing millions and spreading each year, but it is also a major detriment to the economic secu-rity and well-being of our Nation and many countries around the world. As we have seen with the current SARS virus, economic partners as close as Canada have been seriously impacted in just a very short time period. While SARS is a new major health risk that experts are working to halt in recent weeks, we must not forget that HIV/AIDS is a killer disease that continues to plague the entire world. Specifically, the legislation before us today will authorize more than $15 bil-lion for combating HIV/AIDS globally over the next 5 years. In President Bush's State of the Union address he called for an increase in the U.S. com-mitment to combat the global AIDS pandemic. I am pleased that today we are debating a holistic approach to combat such a destructive disease. The legislation creates a more responsive, coordinated, and effective approach among the various agencies of the United States Government involved in the war against HIV/AIDS and approves up to $1 billion for the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria for fiscal year 2004. I have seen firsthand the devastation that AIDS has had on the people of Af-rica, and I firmly believe that the United States and the rest of the devel-oped world must act now to help end the suffering and hardship caused by this terrible disease. When I visited Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and South Africa several years ago, I saw the overwhelming impact that AIDS was having, not only on those adults afflicted with the disease, but also on thousands of orphans that the disease creates. In some countries, one-fifth to one-third of the children have already been orphaned by the disease. I am pleased that today's measure au-thorizes the President to establish pilot programs to create and treat or-phans and young children. Through the work of my constituent, Jeff Busch, I have learned about and supported the work of the Safe Blood for Africa Corps. This small, not-for-profit company has the goal of safe-guarding the blood supply in sub-Saha-ran Africa from infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. I have supported their efforts to fund a first-strike program of HIV/AIDS pre-vention in sub-Saharan Africa that would immediately begin to save be-tween 350,000 and 500,000 lives by uti-lizing rapid blood testing to provide for the transfusion of safe blood. The President has cited Uganda as the model country for putting together an effective plan to combat HIV/AIDS. Uganda has been very aggressive in their approach, and it is important to note that they first addressed the prob-lem of cleaning the blood supply. In conclusion, the Bush administra- tion has designated the war on HIV/AIDS in developing countries a top pri-ority, and I strongly believe that this important legislation will push this goal forward. Mr. Chairman, 40 million people are currently infected and 25 million have died of AIDS worldwide, including more than 3 million people last year alone. Now is the time for our Nation to step up and halt this most deadly disease. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield 1 minute to my good friend, the gentleman from Pennsyl-vania (Mr. H OEFFEL ), a distinguished member of the Committee on Inter-national Relations and a strong leader on this and on so many other issues. Mr. HOEFFEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1298. I want to salute the great work of the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE); the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ); and President Bush for coming together to make this $15 billion commitment over 5 years to help curb the spread of AIDS around the world. One of the best parts of this bill is its balanced approach that treats equally importantly abstinence, marital fidel-ity, and the use of condoms to fight the spread of AIDS. I salute that balanced approach, and that is why it is so im-portant to defeat the Pitts amendment and the Smith amendment. The Smith amendment would allow faith-based or-ganizations that can be funded under this bill under the terms of the legisla-tion to actively discourage the use of condoms. That makes no sense, and that destroys the balance that is cur-rently in this legislation. The Pitts amendment would allow a particular amount of funding to go specifically and only for programs that only pro-mote abstinence. Listen, abstinence works perfectly if it is used perfectly, but it is not. Not everybody abstains. We need to pass this bill as is. It is balanced and it is very good. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Iowa (Mr. K ING). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, our Nation is greatly blessed. We have a re-sponsibility to our fellow man. When rampaging machete mobs began mas-sacring Rwandans, I believed then and I believe now that we should have de-ployed troops to save them. I agree with the principles expressed by President Bush in this very Cham-ber in his State of the Union speech when he said: ''We exercise power with- out conquest and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers. Americans are a free people who know that freedom is a right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world; it is God's gift to all humanity.'' Now we face an AIDS crisis in Africa. It is severe. We have the unique oppor-tunity to help save and extend the lives of Africans. However, we must ensure that our efforts to fight AIDS in Africa do not infringe upon their liberty, their freedom, and the right to life of unborn Africans. The travesty of family planning and population control funding being used to subsidize abortion providers and counseling is not new to Congress. In fact, in 1970, Congressman John Schmitz of California accurately pre-dicted the consequences of providing funding without restrictions. b1145 We know the results of that. He said on that day: ''The bill before us today . . . would commit the U.S. Govern-ment to the life prevention business at an initial cost of more than a quarter of a billion dollars.'' As we know, the rise in the cost of the program is under way, with no end in sight. Congressman Schmitz was right. In 1999, Planned Parenthood received $51 million. Effec-tively, we are subsidizing abortion services. Today we are poised to distribute AIDS assistance to those who are cur-rently without hope in Africa. Hope-fully, a large portion will go to proven abstinence, medical treatment, and as a last resort, condom distribution. However, none of the billions for re- lief in Africa should be used to fund abortions. No United States taxpayer money should fund groups that provide abortion services or counseling. We will save lives by providing humani-tarian AIDS relief to Africa. No lives are as innocent as those lives of babies taken by abortion. We must show compassion for Afri- cans and ensure that the words of Con-gressman Schmitz when we committed the United States to the life prevention business do not come true with this ex-cellent bill. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to my good friend and distinguished col-league, the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Mrs. C APPS ). Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding time to me, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill and in opposition to the Pitts amendment. Devoting significant re-sources to the biggest health threat in the world, the global HIV/AIDS pan-demic, is an excellent use of taxpayer dollars, as long as we focus on preven-tion efforts that work. For example, the people of Uganda have had great success controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS, and they did it with a comprehensive program that did VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3584 May 1, 2003 stress abstinence and fidelity, but also emphasized the importance of using condoms. The Pitts amendment would move significant dollars away from that proven model by providing $5 billion to strictly abstinence-only programs. It will push aside proven comprehensive programs in favor of questionable mod-els designed to appease a right-wing constituency. Let us not miss the opportunity to do good by misspending precious resources on abstinence-only programs. We should not condemn more people to death by AIDS by tying hands with ide-ology. I urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on the Pitts amendment and strongly support H.R. 1298. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the dis-tinguished gentleman from Arizona (Mr. K OLBE ). Mr. KOLBE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I rise in my capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs on the Com-mittee on Appropriations to discuss this bill, H.R. 1298. It is our sub-committee that will be called upon to fund this authorization. The legislation has three critical ele- ments that are important to the issue of funding: first, the requirement for the President to establish within 9 months a comprehensive 5-year strat-egy to combat AIDS; second, within the Department of State the establish-ment of a new coordinator of U.S. ac-tivity to combat HIV/AIDS; and, third, providing statutory authority and suf-ficient authorization for additional United States contributions to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuber-culosis, and malaria. There are many other provisions, some of which appear unnecessary to this Member, others of which are clear-ly contradictory; but I want to address these three core provisions in the time that I have available. I commend the gentleman from Illi- nois (Chairman H YDE) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), for their work in crafting legislation that could bring much-needed policy coherence and ef-fective management to the outpouring of well-meaning but, frankly, scatter-shot Presidential and congressional initiatives designed to arrest the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic. I would ask the gentleman from Illi- nois (Chairman H YDE) and the members of the Committee on International Re-lations to take into consideration sev-eral of our subcommittee's concerns as they move this bill toward enactment. First, as the proposed 5-year strategy will not be in place, at the earliest, until midway through the next fiscal year, the funds appropriated for fiscal year 2004 will have to reflect the strat-egies and use the delivery systems now in place. For that reason, I would cau-tion against legislating the Uganda model on a global basis or limiting in- creased funding to only 14 countries be-fore that strategy is in place or Con-gress has had an opportunity to review it. Second, the legislation under consid- eration today proposes to turn the role of the AIDS coordinator into a de facto agency administrator. I have serious reservations about giving someone who was designated a coordinator within the State Department the authority to make grants, operate in foreign coun-tries, or to, in effect, replace the Glob-al Health Bureau of USAID or the Cen-ters for Disease Control. Why are we creating an entire new Federal bu-reaucracy to administer the program when one already exists? I also object to the language which would allow the coordinator to transfer money from prior-year appropriations or to establish a new account in the Treasury for which no funds have been appropriated. Third, I welcome the flexibility to continue funding for the Global Fund at or above the current level of almost $350 million. But in all candor, the budget resolution does not permit fis-cal 2004 funding anywhere near the $1 billion authorized by this legislation. Thus, we are only creating false expec-tations about what our Committee on Appropriations might be able to do this year. Mr. Chairman, having spent much time over many years on the critical issues addressed by this bill, I am real-ly pleased to see that the Congress is grappling with HIV/AIDS as an inter-national issue. The legislation before us today is a helpful start, but much work remains to be done if we are to have effective implementation of pro-grams to combat HIV/AIDS around the world. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield 1 12minutes to my good friend, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. L OWEY ), the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financ-ing and Related Programs. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bill. I con-gratulate the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), for their impor- tant work. I have always believed that dealing with the AIDS crisis is both a national security priority and a moral imperative for the United States. I am pleased to see that we are authorizing a significant infusion of resources and broad-based commitment. However, I caution my colleagues that despite strong administration and bipartisan congressional support for this bill, the $3 billion authorized for the upcoming fiscal year simply does not exist in the bill. The administra-tion's request for 2004 for all global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs is about $1.7 billion, not $3 billion. While my colleagues and I on the Committee on Appropriations will try to find the $1.3 billion necessary to fill the massive funding gap, it will be difficult in an already tight budget. I would urge the administration to request the funds necessary to fulfill the President's promise. I hope our Re-publican leadership will make sure we have the resources we need to fully fund this historic initiative. Mr. Chairman, we have before us today an opportunity to do a great deal of good in the world: to improve the lives of people living with AIDS, to help AIDS orphans survive and thrive, and to prevent millions of those who are most at risk from contracting this horrible virus. Our efforts will have massive implications for the stability and prosperity of whole communities, societies, and regions of the world, a tremendous privilege and an awesome burden. It is not every day that Members of Congress have the opportunity to jumpstart a process. So let us appro-priate the money, let us fulfill the promise, and let us make sure we use it wisely and well. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to my good friend and distinguished col-league, the gentlewoman from Min-nesota (Ms. M CCOLLUM ), a member of the Committee on International Rela-tions. Ms. M CCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, today, while Congress debates this bill, every 15-year-old boy in Botswana is living with a 90 percent, a 90 percent chance of dying from AIDS during his life. AIDS is destroying millions of lives, families, and entire nations in Africa. Congress should and must act now. America possesses the wealth, the knowledge, the leadership to partner with the people of Africa to save lives, offer dignity to the dying, and provide opportunity to orphans struggling for survival. Our fight against AIDS at home, in Africa, and around the world is both a strategic and humanitarian battle that reflects the greatest strengths and the absolute goodness of the American people. Standing together, let us pass this bill today and empower the people of Africa to use every means available and necessary to treat and stop the spread of AIDS. Today, the people of America and Africa stand together in our fight against AIDS. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) for their work. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield 1 minute to my good colleague, the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. W ATERS ), a distinguished Member of this body and a leader on this issue. Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS), for their superb leadership on at- tacking the HIV/AIDS disaster in Afri-ca. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 H3585 May 1, 2003 I take this moment to rise in strong support of H.R. 1298, and to thank my friends and colleagues for the many years of struggle and hard work that has brought us to this point of getting President Bush to support this effort. Thanks to all of the AIDS activists, the developmental activists. Thanks to the work of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. P ELOSI ) when she served on the Committee on Appropria-tions; and the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L EE) for the leadership she has provided; and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P AYNE ) and all the other Members of Congress. Thanks to President Bill Clinton for establishing the Global AIDS Fund we are putting the money in today. Thanks for the trip that he made to Af-rica, where we all had the opportunity to visit what was going on, the clinics in Uganda and other countries of Afri-ca. It has been a lot of hard work. I am pleased and delighted that we are here today working in a bipartisan way to put money into this Global Fund, but it did not happen overnight. Again, I thank Members for all the years of work and struggle. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 1 12minutes to my good friend and distinguished col-league, the gentleman from New York (Mr. E NGEL ), a valued member of the Committee on International Relations. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding time to me. I want to congratulate the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ) for their strong support and leadership on this bill. I particularly want to sin-gle out my colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), who has led a good, long fight for so many years. This is truly something all of us can take pride in. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) has certainly led the way. Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan, middle-of-the-road bill, a good bill. We should allow no ideological fights in this bill. This is not a fight about abor-tion; it is a fight about saving lives. The Uganda approach, which has absti-nence and marital fidelity and condoms, and we have to have condoms if we are going to fight this battle, is a very well-balanced approach. Let us look at AIDS. AIDS has killed over 20 million people since the epi-demic began. Another 8,000 people die each day, with 68,000,000 deaths pre-dicted by 2020 unless the world takes action. Experts say a strong global re-sponse could prevent nearly two-thirds of those new infections, saving tens of millions of lives. What this bill does is respond to this crisis. It authorizes the bold initiative announced by President Bush. I want to say I was pleased to be in the White House 2 days ago with President Bush when he announced this initiative. This will provide $15 billion, including $10 billion in new money to fight HIV/ AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean. The proposed bill will help prevent 7 million new infections, provide care and support for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and AIDS orphans, and offer antiretroviral therapy for 2 mil-lion of those in need. H.R. 1298 is only an authorization bill. We need to fight in the appropria-tions process for real resources to match the promises made in H.R. 1298. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield 1 minute to my good friend, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. M ALONEY ), a distinguished Member of this body. Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me, and for his leadership. I rise in strong support of the bill and in opposition to the Pitts amendment. We must remember that HIV/AIDS is preventable. That is why I support the ABC approach to prevention, which en-courages a balanced approach to pre-venting the spread of HIV/AIDS. While we all believe that abstinence and fidelity are important methods of prevention, a full, balanced, and com-prehensive range of options, including condoms, is a more responsible plan of attack; and attack is what we must do. We must attack this rampant epidemic with full force, full funding, and full freedom of information. I remember when then Ambassador Richard Holbrooke first brought the issue of HIV/AIDS as a national secu-rity crisis to the U.N. Security Coun-cil. We quickly learned that HIV/AIDS is not only a public health crisis; it is an economic crisis, an international se-curity crisis, and a moral crisis. b1200 In Africa the need and the will to combat the spread of AIDS is there. What is missing is the resources. That is what this bill brings in. No country should struggle to rise out of poverty while fighting a disease that can cut life expectancy by as much as 30 years. I strongly support this bill and com- mend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) and the gentleman from Cali- fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), the ranking mem- ber, and the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L EE) and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ) for their leader- ship. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana (Mr. P ENCE ) for the pur- poses of a colloquy. Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless ef-forts in crafting this HIV/AIDS relief bill. I have, as the gentleman knows per- sonally, the utmost respect for him and for his distinguished career and leader-ship of this committee in particular. I appreciate him granting me this col-loquy. Many of us have learned, Mr. Chair- man, that there are a number of for-eign countries that actually use abor-tion as a means of preventing mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS. It is my hope that the distinguished chairman would today confirm that in carrying out this foreign assistance program, that it is the policy of the United States that abortion is not pre-vention of or treatment of mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. PENCE. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. HYDE. The gentleman is correct. Nothing this in this legislation should suggest that it is United States' policy that abortion is a proper and appro-priate method for prevention of or treatment of mother to child trans-mission of HIV/AIDS. Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my good friend, the gen-tleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ), a dis- tinguished member of the Committee on International Relations, our rank-ing member on the Subcommittee on Health. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) for his leadership. The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria represents the best tool we have to provide relief on a scale that matters. Some of my colleagues want to eliminate the U.S. commitment to the Global Fund. They will say it is ef-fective when it only began disbursing funds in the past year. They will say it is a blow to bureaucracy, when, in fact, it is a model of efficiency in coordina-tion. They will say that evidence shows that it does not work, and then fail to produce any evidence. The Global Fund stresses account- ability. Each proposal is reviewed by 22 physicians and health experts from a variety of nations. Forty percent only of the applications are accepted. Only the best are approved. Each proposal is for 5 years. After 2 years a major audit of the program is done. If it is not ef-fective funding is cut off. Both the House and the Senate sup- ported its creation unanimously. It is transparent. The Global Funds Web site contains downloads of every single country's proposal that is approved. Fifty million people in the last 25 years have died of malaria, tuber-culosis and AIDS, 50 million people. The Global Fund will help history's worst epidemic. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my good friend, the gen-tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. O LVER ), a distinguished member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1298 is the best bill the full House has ever considered on the international HIV/AIDS crisis. This bill provides $1.7 billion in fiscal 2004 to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Our support for the Global Fund demonstrates VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3586 May 1, 2003 American commitment to the inter- national fight against HIV/AIDS and is vital for gaining funds from other donor countries. In his State of the Union address President Bush announced his 5-year plan to fight HIV/AIDS but he only al-lotted $200 million each year to the Global Fund. This bill greatly in-creases the U.S. commitment to the Global Fund. As HIV/AIDS ravages Africa, the Car- ibbean and now explodes in Asia and the former Soviet Union, clearly no single nation has the ability to prevent the spread of AIDS or to adequately treat its victims. This international disease must be stopped with inter-national and multi-lateral action. Mr. Speaker, we must support this bill and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria. It is the least we can do. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this is a historic mo- ment in dealing with global humani-tarian legislation. What we were doing today on a bipartisan basis will save the lives of tens of millions of innocent people across the globe. We are doing it on a bipartisan basis with the typical generosity and humanitarian instincts of the American people. This is legislation we must all be proud of. It should pass with an over-whelming majority. We are supportive of the legislation. We are grateful for the President's support and we fully anticipate that lives around the globe will be improved as a result of our ef-forts. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of our time. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of our time to the distin-guished gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. H ARRIS ). (Ms. HARRIS asked and was given permission to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, as our Nation con- fronts the threats of terrorism, tyr-anny, and weapons of mass destruction, we must not forget the ethical and practical imperative to fight nature's weapons of mass destruction which manifests themselves in the form of global epidemics, such as AIDS. President Bush and this Congress have demonstrated extraordinary cour-age and moral leadership in focussing our Nation's attention on this critical matter of national security. H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act, implements the President's vision-ary proposal to combat AIDS and other infectious diseases in Africa as well as on a global scale. This legislation mod-els programs that have experienced tre-mendous success throughout the world, most notably a program that has prov-en effective in Uganda. Such programs work with within ex- isting cultural dynamics to combat the existing humanitarian crisis, while promoting the essential long-term so-cietal changes that will stop the spread of these dreadful diseases. As a freshmen Member of Congress, I am heartened to note the bipartisan support and the healthy debate that has accompanied our consideration of this vital legislation. The speed and ef-fectiveness with which we have joined the fight against the global scourge of AIDS tuberculosis, and malaria shows the American people that we can in-deed work together to make the world freer, safer, healthier and more just. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) for his extraordinary vision and leadership in this momentous bill. I urge the passage of the legislation. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. While much of our focus over the past two years has been on the eradication of terrorist threats from radical fringe groups and evil dictators, we must not forget the threat posed by a non-human terrorist: HIV/AIDS. More than 42 mil-lion people in the world are living with HIV/AIDS. Nearly 30 million of those people live on the continent of Africa and that includes 3 mil-lion children under the age of fifteen. As many of us in Congress have worked hard over the years to strengthen HIV/AIDS programs, I was particularly pleased to hear the President ac-knowledge this threat during his State of the Union address in January. Today Congress has a chance to address this global pandemic. Specifically, this bill would authorize $15 bil- lion over five years to fight the HIV/AIDS pan-demic, including up to $1 billion for the Global Fund to Combat HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in Fiscal Year 2004. It would also cre-ate a five-year comprehensive, integrated, global strategy to strength the U.S. capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Addition-ally, an HIV/AIDS Response Coordinator with-in the Department of State would be created to oversee this plan. I am particularly pleased by the bipartisan support that this legislation has garnered. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) for introducing this bill and working with both sides of the aisle to bring to the floor today a bill that can be widely supported. Our goal should not be to impose our values on another culture, but to exhibit our values by showing care and compassion for our global neighbors. By supporting programs like the successful Ugandan ABC campaign (which says Abstain; if you can't abstain, Be Faithful; if you can't be faithful, use a Condom) we can effectively ad-dress this crisis. Again, I support this legislation and encour- age my colleagues to join me. We have the opportunity today to make a commitment to improve the lives of millions of people and ease the suffering of an entire continent. How-ever, the fight against HIV/AIDS is far from over and we must live up to the commitment we make today by fully funding these pro-grams in the future. Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Chairman, I support the at- tempt in this bill to provide basic medical as-sistance to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. To un-derstand the importance of this assistance, we must get a firm grasp on the enormity of this problem. AIDS is truly a global killer. The virus respects no national boundaries, no religious affiliation, no race, no gender, and no age. In Sub-Sahara Africa, the region of the world most severely affected by HIV and AIDS, there are an estimated 25.3 million persons in-fected with the virus. In 7 African countries, 20 percent of the population is affected. In Bot-swana, it is estimated that 36 percent of the adult population is infected with HIV. Other regions of the world have equally alarming statistics. In Asia, the world's most populous continent, 3.5 million people are in-fected with HIV. Eastern Europe has the most rapid rate of growth in HIV infections. In 20 short months, the number of infected persons in the Russian Federation rose from 10,000 to 70,000. In Latin America, an estimated 1.9 million people are infected with HIV. In the Caribbean, HIV has impacted about 400,000 people. HIV and AIDS is the leading cause of death in Africa and the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. In the countries most affected in Africa, life expectancy has declined by 10 years and the infant death rates have doubled. This disease has ravaged families. In the developing world, the loss of one parent can lead to a loss of income, the end of edu-cational opportunities for children and an in-crease in child labor. The loss of both parents can be devastating. It has been estimated that by 2010 there will be 40 million children in Af-rica who have been orphaned because of the AIDS virus. That is equivalent to every child living east of the Mississippi River in this country. I know this is a grim picture, but to paint a rosy scenario would be inappropriate. Com-passion and concern are not enough. We must take concrete action, here and now. This epidemic can be stabilized and reversed. We must work effectively with leaders of the world to achieve these outcomes. Africa's tragedy can be reversed and a similar cataclysm can be avoided in other countries. This legislation is a good step forward in addressing this issue. But we must be prepared to take the next step and assist countries impacted by these diseases. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this important legislation that will enable us to effectively combat the global scourges of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. I am grateful for the bipartisan leadership of my col-leagues who authored and were original co-sponsors of this bill especially Chairman H YDE, Ranking Member L ANTOS , Mr. W ELDON , Ms. L EE, and Mr. L EACH . This legislation enables the United States to take strong leadership role to ameliorate, and, we hope, ultimately to eradicate one of the most devastating diseases that man has ever encountered. We count the victims of HIV/AIDS in the tens and hundreds of millions, worldwide. It is a disease that affects men and women, adults and children. Its impact is most devastating on the poorest, those with the least capacity to deal with the ravages of this disease or to act effectively to prevent its spread. By affecting so many millions across societal cross-sections, this disease presents a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented mag-nitude. Furthermore, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is a potentially destabilizing force that presents a grave threat to international security. The African nations have been especially hard hit by the epidemic of HIV/AIDS and VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 2003 other diseases. Together, HIV/AIDS, tuber- culosis, malaria, and related diseases are un-dermining agriculture production throughout Africa\u2014aggravating disease with hunger. This bill will address these global problems by authorizing $15 billion to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, through a com-prehensive five-year integrated strategy. This legislation will use these funds effectively by promoting inter-agency coordination, sup-porting the expansions of public/private part-nerships, and using targeted programs that will especially benefit children and families af-fected by HIV/AIDS. Of course we must continue to work aggres- sively to combat the spread of this disease here in the United States and to continue our efforts to research a cure and to aid our own countrymen afflicted with this terrible illness. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this vital legislation to attack one of the most significant threats to global health. I am pleased with the bill that the International Relations Committee passed, and I urge my colleagues to support his bill. Mr. PAUL. Mr. Chairman, as a physician I am particularly concerned about terrible dis-eases like AIDS. I have great sympathy for those\u2014in increasing numbers\u2014who suffer and die around the world. The question is not whether each and every one of us is con-cerned or would like to do something about this terrible problem. The question is whether yet another massive government foreign aid program will actually do anything at all to solve the problem. The United States has been sending billions and billions of dollars overseas for decades to do fine-sounding things like ''build democracy'' and ''fight drugs'' and ''end poverty.'' Yet decades later we are told that in every category these things have actually gotten worse rather than better. Our money has disappeared into bank accounts of dictators and salaries for extremely well-paid consultants and U.S. Government employees. Yet we refuse to learn from these mistakes; we are about to make another multi-billion dol-lar mistake with this bill. Though I have not been in favor of Federal Government funding of healthcare, if this money is going to be spent why shouldn't it be spent in this country, on American citizens? One legitimate function of government is to protect its citizens and taxpayers. Yet thou-sands of Americans who have contracted this terrible disease find themselves without any healthcare at all. Thousands of these Ameri-cans, as they become ill, are no longer able to work and therefore lose their insurance cov-erage. Drugs to treat the disease become im-possible to afford; those with disease end up along and in misery. I seriously wonder wheth-er negative perceptions of those at risk in this country do not drive this push to send billions abroad rather than address the disease here at home. I believe that if this money is to be spend it should be spent on Americans, re-gardless of what some may think about those high-risk groups. Bills like the one we are considering today also force Americans to fund programs and or-ganizations that many find morally objection-able, such as those that distribute condoms and perform abortion. While some amend-ments we are voting on today admirably seek to address some of these concerns, the fact remains that this bill even if amended uncon-stitutionally sends U.S. taxpayer money over-seas and inappropriately engages in social en- gineering abroad. None of the amendments address the immorality of forcing Americans to fund organizations engaged in family planning, performing abortions, and distributing condoms. As Thomas Jefferson famously said, ''To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas be disbelieves and ab-hors is sinful and tyrannical.'' That is why I have introduced H.R. 1548, a bill to prohibit any Federal official from expending any Fed- eral funds for any population control or popu-lation planning program or any family planning activity. What we are seeing today on the floor just underscores the need to pass H.R. 1548\u2014to end this tyrannical and sinful prac-tice of forcing Americans to pay for programs they believe to be immoral and evil. Mr. Chairman, at a time when the govern- ment is running record deficits, is engaged in an enormously expensive war in Iraq and Af-ghanistan and elsewhere, and is even cutting veterans benefits, I find it extremely irrespon-sible that we are discussing sending additional billions overseas in yet another dubious pro-gram. Additionally, I am greatly concerned that the billions we are contributing to the ''Global Fund'' will be going to organizations that sup-port and perform abortions, prostitution, infan-ticide and other horrors. There is nothing in this bill to prevent this, only faith that the Co-ordinator will exercise good judgment in these matters. That is simply not sufficient. I strongly oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to do likewise. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in support of H.R. 1298, the ''United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.'' I also rise to applaud the efforts of Mr. H YDE, Mr. LANTOS , Mr. W ELDON , Ms. L EE, and Mr. L EACH to get this bill on the floor so that the mem-bers of the House of Representatives can do our part to fight the spread of infectious dis-eases. I support H.R. 1298, because HIV/AIDS, tu- berculosis, and malaria are killing men, women, and children in countries across the globe. And the United States, a country blessed with expert physicians, scientists, cor-porations, and governmental agencies should take the lead in worldwide efforts to combat the effects of these infectious diseases. H.R. 1298 contains many provisions that help in the battle to contain the spread of these diseases and to provide assistance to those suffering from HIV/AIDS, TB, and ma-laria. Among other provisions, H.R. five-year global strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. It also supports voluntary contributions to the international vac-cine funds, establishes pilot programs to place health care professionals in overseas areas and provide assistance for children and fami-lies affected by HIV/AIDS. I, along with several other members of the House of Representatives, have also pro-posed amendments to supplement the provi-sions already written into the bill. These provi-sions will also help combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. As the Chair of the Children's Caucus, I am particularly troubled by the pandemic of HIV/AIDS and the devastating impact this disease has had on children in Africa and worldwide. It has been over 20 years since AIDS was first diagnosed. Since then over 57 million people have been infected, 25 million people have perished, 4 million of which were children. According to a study by UNAIDS, if the AIDS epidemic in Africa is not controlled, AIDS related deaths will make 40 million chil-dren orphans by the year 2010. Presently, there are more children orphaned in Africa due to parental AIDS deaths than there are children in America's public school system. In Botswana, there are more deaths annually from AIDS than there are childbirths. I have had the opportunity to see for myself the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria on the citizens of African countries. I was a member of one of the first presidential missions to Africa. I have visited Zambia, Uganda, and South Africa and seen the phys-ical and emotional damage caused by infec-tious diseases. I have supported programs to change personal behaviors like the ABC Pro-gram which encourages youths to practice Ab-stinence, Be faithful, and use Condoms. Congressional trips to Africa and support of initiatives are positive steps in the fight against aids. However, we can do much more to pro-vide funding, actively participate in developing programs, conduct studies, and disburse medicines to the victims of HIV/AIDS, tuber-culosis, and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. I reiterate my unwavering support for H.R. 1298. I encourage every member of the House of Representatives to also support H.R. 1298, as well as give serious consideration to the various amendments that have been of-fered to the bill. We must take swift and deci-sive action to prevent the further spread of in-fectious diseases. Each day that we delay the passage of H.R. 1298, thousands of people worldwide will die or be infected with HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. I commend Mr. H YDE, Mr. L ANTOS , Mr. W ELDON , Ms. L EE, and Mr. LEACH 's efforts to prevent further infectious disease deaths. I support H.R. 1298, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge for the passage of H.R. 1298, and I want to commend my colleagues B AR- BARA LEEand T OMLANTOS , as well as Chair- man H YDE and the entire CBC for getting us to where we are today. The White House has also come a long way. And so I am pleased to support this bill, which now provides $1 billion for the global Fund where it can be leveraged to greater lev-els of funding through contributions from other sources. Hopefully as we see its success, the U.S. will increase its contribution to the global Fund where I am convinced we can do the most good. This bill wisely builds on the program in Uganda, where the three pronged approach of abstinence, being faithful to one partner, and condom use has seen much success. This is a major victory, not for those of us who have urged this approach but for the peo-ple whose lives will be saved. Lastly, I am very pleased that the Caribbean is included, specifically Haiti and Guyana, but here too, I hope that we can see this funding expanded to other countries in the region, which also bear a heavy burden of HIV and AIDS. We have come a long way in these two years, and even since the announcement of the $15 billion in the President's State of the Union Address this year. Although we can still improve upon this ef- fort, passage of H.R. 1298 will mark a great VerDate Jan 31 2003 H3588 May 1, 2003 step forward in responding to this strong moral imperative. We look forward to working with our colleagues and the White House to con-tinue to match what will surely be growing need, and to do the same for the HIV and AIDS epidemic right here at home. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1298. This is an excellent bill that will save millions of lives throughout the world. It's an outstanding example of the kind of leadership the United States should be showing on public health issues, and I hope it's just the beginning of our work in this area. I'm particularly pleased that President Bush has stood up to the extremists in his party who wished to hijack this bill to push their ide-ological agenda. The radical right wing forces who oppose even the discussion as well as distribution of condoms as part of a balanced approach play a dangerous game with peo-ple's lives. Instead of allowing proven strate-gies to work, there are some who would rather watch a whole continent die than see condoms used. An abstinence-only approach is a death sentence for millions of people. As I said, however, I applaud President Bush for standing up to these extremists and supporting this balanced bill. When the Tradi-tional Values Coalition and the Family Re-search Council are opposed to legislation, we must be doing something right. Mr. Chairman, for too long this nation has stood by and paid closer attention to our wal-let than to the millions of people dying of AIDS throughout the world. Up until now, we've been unwilling to spend the money necessary to combat this terrible disease. But today, we are hopefully reversing this trend and begin-ning a new era of American leadership on this issue. We've seen incredible devastation through- out the world as a result of AIDS. Millions of children will grow up orphans and entire na-tions have been unable sustain a healthy workforce, driving them even deeper into pov-erty. These are tragedies that we can help stop, but it takes money and political will. With this bill today, we take an important step in that direction. I urge my colleagues to support this legisla- tion and to oppose any amendments that weaken it. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) During the last 20 years, HIV/AIDS has as- sumed pandemic proportions, spreading from the most severely affected regions, sub-Saharan Af-rica and the Caribbean, to all corners of the world, and leaving an unprecedented path of death and devastation. (2) According to the Joint United Nations Pro- gramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 65,000,000 individuals worldwide have been in-fected with HIV since the epidemic began, more than 25,000,000 of these individuals have lost their lives to the disease, and more than 14,000,000 children have been orphaned by the disease. HIV/AIDS is the fourth-highest cause of death in the world. (3)(A) At the end of 2002, an estimated 42,000,000 individuals were infected with HIV or living with AIDS, of which more than 75 percent live in Africa or the Caribbean. Of these individ-uals, more than 3,200,000 were children under the age of fifteen and more than 19,200,000 were women. (B) Women are four times more vulnerable to infection than are men and are becoming in-fected at increasingly high rates, in part be-cause many societies do not provide poor women and young girls with the social, legal, and cul-tural protections against high risk activities that expose them to HIV/AIDS. (C) Women and children who are refugees or are internally displaced persons are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and violence, thereby increasing the possibility of HIV infec-tion. (4) As the leading cause of death in sub-Saha- ran Africa, AIDS has killed more than 19,400,000 individuals (more than 3 times the number of AIDS deaths in the rest of the world) and will claim the lives of one-quarter of the population, mostly adults, in the next decade. (5) An estimated 2,000,000 individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean and another 7,100,000 individuals in Asia and the Pacific re-gion are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. Infection rates are rising alarmingly in Eastern Europe (especially in the Russian Federation), Central Asia, and China. (6) HIV/AIDS threatens personal security by affecting the health, lifespan, and productive capacity of the individual and the social cohe-sion and economic well-being of the family. (7) HIV/AIDS undermines the economic secu- rity of a country and individual businesses in that country by weakening the productivity and longevity of the labor force across a broad array of economic sectors and by reducing the poten-tial for economic growth over the long term. (8) HIV/AIDS destabilizes communities by striking at the most mobile and educated mem-bers of society, many of whom are responsible for security at the local level and governance at the national and subnational levels as well as many teachers, health care personnel, and other community workers vital to community develop-ment and the effort to combat HIV/AIDS. In some countries the overwhelming challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are accelerating the out-ward migration of critically important health care professionals. (9) HIV/AIDS weakens the defenses of coun- tries severely affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis through high infection rates among members of their military forces and voluntary peace-keeping personnel. According to UNAIDS, in sub-Saharan Africa, many military forces have infection rates as much as five times that of the civilian population. (10) HIV/AIDS poses a serious security issue for the international community by\u2014 (A) increasing the potential for political insta- bility and economic devastation, particularly in those countries and regions most severely af-fected by the disease; (B) decreasing the capacity to resolve conflicts through the introduction of peacekeeping forces because the environments into which these forces are introduced pose a high risk for the spread of HIV/AIDS; and (C) increasing the vulnerability of local popu- lations to HIV/AIDS in conflict zones from peacekeeping troops with HIV infection rates significantly higher than civilian populations. (11) The devastation wrought by the HIV/ AIDS pandemic is compounded by the preva-lence of tuberculosis and malaria, particularly in developing countries where the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, including women, children, and those individuals living with HIV/AIDS, become infected. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria accounted for more than 5,700,000 deaths in 2001 and caused debilitating illnesses in millions more. (12) Together, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, ma- laria and related diseases are undermining agri-cultural production throughout Africa. Accord-ing to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, 7,000,000 agricultural workers throughout 25 African countries have died from AIDS since 1985. Countries with poorly devel-oped agricultural systems, which already face chronic food shortages, are the hardest hit, par-ticularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where high HIV prevalence rates are compounding the risk of starvation for an estimated 14,400,000 people. (13) Tuberculosis is the cause of death for one out of every three people with AIDS worldwide and is a highly communicable disease. HIV in-fection is the leading threat to tuberculosis con-trol. Because HIV infection so severely weakens the immune system, individuals with HIV and latent tuberculosis infection have a 100 times greater risk of developing active tuberculosis diseases thereby increasing the risk of spreading VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3589 May 1, 2003 tuberculosis to others. Tuberculosis, in turn, ac- celerates the onset of AIDS in individuals in-fected with HIV. (14) Malaria, the most deadly of all tropical parasitic diseases, has been undergoing a dra-matic resurgence in recent years due to increas-ing resistance of the malaria parasite to inex-pensive and effective drugs. At the same time, increasing resistance of mosquitoes to standard insecticides makes control of transmission dif-ficult to achieve. The World Health Organiza-tion estimates that between 300,000,000 and 500,000,000 new cases of malaria occur each year, and annual deaths from the disease num-ber between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000. Persons in-fected with HIV are particularly vulnerable to the malaria parasite. The spread of HIV infec-tion contributes to the difficulties of controlling resurgence of the drug resistant malaria para-site. (15) HIV/AIDS is first and foremost a health problem. Successful strategies to stem the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic will require clinical medical interventions, the strengthening of health care delivery systems and infrastructure, and determined national leadership and in-creased budgetary allocations for the health sec-tor in countries affected by the epidemic as well as measures to address the social and behavioral causes of the problem and its impact on families, communities, and societal sectors. (16) Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections and to bring care and treatment to people living with AIDS, such as voluntary counseling and testing and mother-to-child transmission programs, are achieving meaning-ful results and are cost-effective. The challenge is to expand these interventions from a pilot program basis to a national basis in a coherent and sustainable manner. (17) Appropriate treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS can prolong the lives of such individ-uals, preserve their families, prevent children from becoming orphans, and increase produc-tivity of such individuals by allowing them to lead active lives and reduce the need for costly hospitalization for treatment of opportunistic infections caused by HIV. (18) Nongovernmental organizations, includ- ing faith-based organizations, with experience in health care and HIV/AIDS counseling, have proven effective in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic and can be a resource in assisting in-digenous organizations in severely affected countries in their efforts to provide treatment and care for individuals infected with HIV/AIDS. (19) Faith-based organizations are making an important contribution to HIV prevention and AIDS treatment programs around the world. Successful HIV prevention programs in Uganda, Jamaica, and elsewhere have included local churches and faith-based groups in efforts to promote behavior changes to prevent HIV, to re-duce stigma associated with HIV infection, to treat those afflicted with the disease, and to care for orphans. The Catholic Church alone currently cares for one in four people being treated for AIDS worldwide. Faith-based orga-nizations possess infrastructure, experience, and knowledge that will be needed to carry out these programs in the future and should be an inte-gral part of United States efforts. (20)(A) Uganda has experienced the most sig- nificant decline in HIV rates of any country in Africa, including a decrease among pregnant women from 20.6 percent in 1991 to 7.9 percent in 2000. (B) Uganda made this remarkable turnaround because President Yoweri Museveni spoke out early, breaking long-standing cultural taboos, and changed widespread perceptions about the disease. His leadership stands as a model for ways political leaders in Africa and other devel-oping countries can mobilize their nations, in-cluding civic organizations, professional asso-ciations, religious institutions, business and labor to combat HIV/AIDS. (C) Uganda's successful AIDS treatment and prevention program is referred to as the ABC model: ''Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms'', in order of priority. Jamaica, Zambia, Ethiopia and Senegal have also successfully used the ABC model. Beginning in 1986, Uganda brought about a fundamental change in sexual behavior by developing a low-cost program with the mes-sage: ''Stop having multiple partners. Be faith-ful. Teenagers, wait until you are married be-fore you begin sex.''. (D) By 1995, 95 percent of Ugandans were re- porting either one or zero sexual partners in the past year, and the proportion of sexually active youth declined significantly from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The greatest percentage decline in HIV infections and the greatest degree of be-havioral change occurred in those 15 to 19 years old. Uganda's success shows that behavior change, through the use of the ABC model, is a very successful way to prevent the spread of HIV. (21) The magnitude and scope of the HIV/ AIDS crisis demands a comprehensive, long-term, international response focused upon ad-dressing the causes, reducing the spread, and ameliorating the consequences of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including\u2014 (A) prevention and education, care and treat- ment, basic and applied research, and training of health care workers, particularly at the com-munity and provincial levels, and other commu-nity workers and leaders needed to cope with the range of consequences of the HIV/AIDS cri-sis; (B) development of health care infrastructure and delivery systems through cooperative and coordinated public efforts and public and pri-vate partnerships; (C) development and implementation of na- tional and community-based multisector strate-gies that address the impact of HIV/AIDS on the individual, family, community, and nation and increase the participation of at-risk populations in programs designed to encourage behavioral and social change and reduce the stigma associ-ated with HIV/AIDS; and (D) coordination of efforts between inter- national organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO), national governments, and private sec-tor organizations, including faith-based organi-zations. (22) The United States has the capacity to lead and enhance the effectiveness of the inter-national community's response by\u2014 (A) providing substantial financial resources, technical expertise, and training, particularly of health care personnel and community workers and leaders; (B) promoting vaccine and microbicide re- search and the development of new treatment protocols in the public and commercial pharma-ceutical research sectors; (C) making available pharmaceuticals and diagnostics for HIV/AIDS therapy; (D) encouraging governments and faith-based and community-based organizations to adopt policies that treat HIV/AIDS as a multisectoral public health problem affecting not only health but other areas such as agriculture, education, the economy, the family and society, and assist-ing them to develop and implement programs corresponding to these needs; (E) promoting healthy lifestyles, including ab- stinence, delaying sexual debut, monogamy, marriage, faithfulness, use of condoms, and avoiding substance abuse; and (F) encouraging active involvement of the pri- vate sector, including businesses, pharma-ceutical and biotechnology companies, the med-ical and scientific communities, charitable foun-dations, private and voluntary organizations and nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations, community-based organi-zations, and other nonprofit entities. (23) Prostitution and other sexual victimiza- tion are degrading to women and children and it should be the policy of the United States to eradicate such practices. The sex industry, the trafficking of individuals into such industry, and sexual violence are additional causes of and factors in the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One in nine South Africans is living with AIDS, and sexual assault is rampant, at a victimiza-tion rate of one in three women. Meanwhile in Cambodia, as many as 40 percent of prostitutes are infected with HIV and the country has the highest rate of increase of HIV infection in all of Southeast Asia. Victims of coercive sexual en-counters do not get to make choices about their sexual activities. (24) Strong coordination must exist among the various agencies of the United States to ensure effective and efficient use of financial and tech-nical resources within the United States Govern-ment with respect to the provision of inter-national HIV/AIDS assistance. (25) In his address to Congress on January 28, 2003, the President announced the Administra-tion's intention to embark on a five-year emer-gency plan for AIDS relief, to confront HIV/AIDS with the goals of preventing 7,000,000 new HIV/AIDS infections, treating at least 2,000,000 people with life-extending drugs, and providing humane care for millions of people suffering from HIV/AIDS, and for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. (26) In this address to Congress, the President stated the following: ''Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30,000,000 people have the AIDS virus\u2014including 3,000,000 children under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Afri-ca where more than one-third of the adult popu-lation carries the infection. More than 4,000,000 require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims\u2014only 50,000\u2014are receiving the medicine they need.''. (27) Furthermore, the President focused on care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in his address to Congress, stating the following: ''Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, 'We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you've got AIDS, we can't help you. Go home and die.' In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years ... Ladies and gentlemen, sel-dom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.''. (28) Finally, the President stated that ''[w]e have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country'', proposing now that the United States should lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of na-ture, and asking Congress ''to commit $15,000,000,000 over the next five years, includ-ing nearly $10,000,000,000 in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted na-tions of Africa and the Caribbean''.

TITLE II\u2014SUPPORT FOR MULTILATERAL FUNDS, PROGRAMS, AND PUBLIC-PRI-VATE PARTNERSHIPS SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PUBLIC-PRI- VATE PARTNERSHIPS. (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress makes the following findings: (1) Innovative partnerships between govern- ments and organizations in the private sector (including foundations, universities, corpora-tions, faith-based and community-based organi-zations, and other nongovernmental organiza-tions) have proliferated in recent years, particu-larly in the area of health. (2) Public-private sector partnerships multiply local and international capacities to strengthen the delivery of health services in developing countries and to accelerate research for vaccines and other pharmaceutical products that are es-sential to combat infectious diseases decimating the populations of these countries. (3) These partnerships maximize the unique capabilities of each sector while combining fi-nancial and other resources, scientific knowl-edge, and expertise toward common goals which neither the public nor the private sector can achieve alone. (4) Sustaining existing public-private partner- ships and building new ones are critical to the success of the international community's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious dis-eases around the globe. (b) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .\u2014It is the sense of Congress that\u2014 (1) the sustainment and promotion of public- private partnerships should be a priority ele-ment of the strategy pursued by the United States to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other global health crises; and (2) the United States should systematically track the evolution of these partnerships and work with others in the public and private sec-tor to profile and build upon those models that are most effective.

Subtitle B\u2014Assistance for Children and Families SEC. 311. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Approximately 2,000 children around the world are infected each day with HIV through mother-to-child transmission. Transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor, and delivery or through breast feeding. Over ninety percent of these cases are in developing nations with little or no access to public health facilities. (2) Mother-to-child transmission is largely preventable with the proper application of phar-maceuticals, therapies, and other public health interventions. (3) The drug nevirapine reduces mother-to- child transmission by nearly 50 percent. Uni-versal availability of this drug could prevent up to 400,000 infections per year and dramatically reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths. (4) At the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June 2001, the United States com-mitted to the specific goals with respect to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, in-cluding the goals of reducing the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20 percent by the year 2005 and by 50 percent by the year 2010, as specified in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the United Nations Gen-eral Assembly at the Special Session. (5) Several United States Government agencies including the United States Agency for Inter-national Development and the Centers for Dis-ease Control are already supporting programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission in re-source-poor nations and have the capacity to expand these programs rapidly by working closely with foreign governments and non-governmental organizations. (6) Efforts to prevent mother-to-child trans- mission can provide the basis for a broader re-sponse that includes care and treatment of mothers, fathers, and other family members who are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. (7) HIV/AIDS has devastated the lives of countless children and families across the globe. Since the epidemic began, an estimated 13,200,000 children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by AIDS, that is they have lost their mother or both parents to the disease. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that this number will dou-ble by the year 2010. (8) HIV/AIDS also targets young people be- tween the ages of 15 to 24, particularly young women, many of whom carry the burden of car-ing for family members living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 10,300,000 young people are now living with HIV/AIDS. One-half of all new in-fections are occurring among this age group. SEC. 312. POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS. (a) P OLICY .\u2014The United States Government's response to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic should place high priority on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the care and treatment of family members and caregivers, and the care of children orphaned by AIDS. To the maximum extent possible, the United States Gov-ernment should seek to leverage its funds by seeking matching contributions from the private sector, other national governments, and inter-national organizations. (b) R EQUIREMENTS .\u2014The 5-year United States Government strategy required by section 101 of this Act shall\u2014 (1) provide for meeting or exceeding the goal to reduce the rate of mother-to-child trans-mission of HIV by 20 percent by 2005 and by 50 percent by 2010; (2) include programs to make available testing and treatment to HIV-positive women and their family members, including drug treatment and therapies to prevent mother-to-child trans-mission; and (3) expand programs designed to care for chil- dren orphaned by AIDS.

(a) I NCREASE IN HIV/AIDS A NTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT .\u2014It is a sense of the Congress that an urgent priority of United States assistance programs to fight HIV/AIDS should be the rapid increase in distribution of antiretroviral treat-ment so that\u2014 (1) by the end of fiscal year 2004, at least 500,000 individuals with HIV/AIDS are receiving antiretroviral treatment through United States assistance programs; (2) by the end of fiscal year 2005, at least 1,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment; and (3) by the end of fiscal year 2006, at least 2,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment. (b) E FFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF HIV/AIDS FUNDS.\u2014It is the sense of Congress that, of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the author-ization of appropriations under section 401 for HIV/AIDS assistance, an effective distribution of such amounts would be\u2014 (1) 55 percent of such amounts for treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS; (2) 15 percent of such amounts for palliative care of individuals with HIV/AIDS; (3) 20 percent of such amounts for HIV/AIDS prevention consistent with section 104A(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by sec-tion 301 of this Act); and (4) 10 percent of such amounts for orphans and vulnerable children. SEC. 403. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. For fiscal years 2006 through 2008, not less than 55 percent of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 401 for HIV/AIDS assistance for each such fiscal year shall be expended for therapeutic medical care of individuals infected with HIV, of which such amount at least 75 per-cent should be expended for the purchase and distribution of antiretroviral pharmaceuticals and at least 25 percent should be expended for related care.

Pursuant to House Resolution 210 the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AUZIN ) and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes. Does the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) claim the time in opposi- tion? Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog- nizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AUZIN ). Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge all Members of the House to support the passage of the Tauzin-Brown amend-ment to H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuber-culosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. I want to commend my colleague from the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ) for his assistance and support and ad-vocacy of this amendment. First, the Tauzin-Brown amendment strengthens H.R. 1298 by adding addi-tional accountability measures to en-sure that our fight against HIV/AIDS and TB and malaria has a greater chance of success. That is what we all want. Our amendment establishes priorities to be followed by the global AIDS coor-dinator for the distribution of re-sources based on factors such as size and demographics of specific nations to ensure that the countries who need as-sistance the most receive it first. Next, our amendment utilizes an independent third party to examine the success of strategies implemented by the global AIDS coordinator. The Insti-tutes of Medicine, the IOM, will be re-sponsible for examining the achieve-ments of the programs funded by the global AIDS coordinator and then com-paring the success rates of various methods that have been used by the co-ordinator. Second, the Tauzin-Brown amend- ment also strengthens the existing au-thority and the accountability meas-ures in H.R. 1298. Our amendment spe-cifically states that if at any point ad-ministrative expenses within the Glob-al Fund exceed 10 percent of total ex-penditures of the fund for any 2-year period, then the U.S. will withhold an equal amount from its contribution the following year. This is to ensure that this fund does not get gobbled up in bu-reaucrats and administrative expenses. We believe this is fair and, at the same time, will ensure that the Global Fund remains fiscally responsible to its pur-pose. That is, getting dollars in to ac-tually combat AIDS, malaria, and tu-berculosis in the world. These two accountability measures represent provisions ensure our ap-proach to this problem is not only mor-ally responsible, it is fiscally respon-sible as well. Finally, the amendment requires that the HIV/AIDS coordinator make available to Congress basic informa-tion on the Global Fund. Specifically, the coordinator is required to submit to Congress a detailed report outlining all financial and accounting state-ments, copies of the reports provided to the Global Fund by organizations con-tracted to audit recipients, and project proposals submitted by applicants and grantees. In the past we have had great difficulty getting this information from the Global Fund. We are confident the coordinator will do a wonderful job in delivering this information to Con-gress. I urge my colleagues to support the Tauzin-Brown amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend from Louisiana (Mr. T AU- ZIN) and my good friend from Ohio (Mr. BROWN ) for their thoughtful contribu- tion to our legislation. Their amend-ment includes a number of complex ini-tiatives, many of which reflect im-provements to the bill. For example, I believe that the amendment's efforts to explicitly prioritize U.S. programs au-thorized by this Act to countries based on the size and demographics of the HIV/AIDS populations and the needs of those populations is a wise measure. I am concerned about several other provisions in the amendment. For ex-ample, the limitation on administra-tive expenditures of the Global Fund is well meaning, but when the fund may be going through a massive expansion of operations, there may be a need for some significant investments to make sure that the Global Fund can properly administer its programs. I was pleased that the sponsors added a waiver, and I believe that the Presi-dent should consider the actual oper-ations of the fund as he applies this provision. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I remain con- cerned regarding the provision requir-ing numerous reports to be provided to Congress within 30 days of the request. I am uncertain whether any Member could make this request or whether it must be a relevant committee or by resolution. Moreover, my experience with international organizations is that some of the documents may be considered confidential, such as un-funded proposals, and it may not be possible to get these documents within the time frame provided in the amend-ments. Nevertheless, Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I look forward to working with the sponsors to clarify and further refine these provisions. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con- sent to yield the balance of my time to my friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ) for the purposes of con- trolling time. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May H3598 May 1, 2003 There was no objection. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Tauzin-Brown amendment. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AU- ZIN) for his good faith and bipartisan work in drafting this amendment, espe-cially his staff, Patrick Ronan, for his hard work and others on his staff. The Committee on Energy and Com- merce has jurisdiction over agencies that play a pivotal role in successful efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria in our country and worldwide. Some of the world's most promising research and best treatment on these diseases are carried out by agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. CDC provides technical and scientific sup-port for international agencies like USAID as well as national infectious disease programs in developing coun-tries, in addition to the work that NIH and other agencies do. Secretary Thompson is the newly ap- pointed chairman of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria, the best tool this world has to fight three diseases that kill 6 million people every year. The success of this bipar-tisan Global AIDS Initiative depends on collaboration of the world's most important and best resources. One of the reasons why the Global Fund is such a critical component of the U.S. Global AIDS Initiative and a crucial part of the bill we are considering today, is it recognizes the need to fight tuberculosis, a lesser known infectious disease that has been around longer and kills 2 million people a year, in-cluding 1,100 people every day in the country of India. b1215 TB infects one-third of the world's population. Two million people carry the TB bacteria, and it is the leading killer of young women and people with HIV worldwide. HIV and TB form a lethal combina- tion, each speeding the other's progress. HIV promotes rapid progres-sion of primary TB infection to active disease. It is the most powerful known risk factor for reactivation of latent TB infection to active disease. Most HIV patients, in fact, will actually die of TB before they succumb to AIDS. The intersection of AIDS and TB is like the perfect storm. The Global Fund is a public-private partnership which draws contributions from governments, from private cor-porations, from faith-based organiza-tions and foundations. The Global Fund has shown signs that it works. Government entities, in coordination with nongovernment organizations, submit 5-year plans. Each plan is unique to each country, not a one-size-fits-all that comes from Washington or Geneva or any other country. The Global Fund recognizes cultural dif-ferences. What works in Christian Uru-guay may not work the same in Mus-lim Bangladesh. No overriding, international political agenda is attached to the Global Fund's assistance. No litmus test, only a judgment by the Global Fund, in col- laboration with local citizens and health workers of what works best for each country. The Global Fund de-mands results, quantifiable results. The money supports activities, includ-ing access to health care services, pur-chasing of drugs, training of personnel, and training of community workers. If a country fails or an NGO fails to show results within 2 years, the money is cut off. About 60 percent of the Global Fund's money goes to HIV/AIDS, about 20 to TB, about 20 to malaria. Fighting these diseases together, which the Global Fund does, is a cost-effective approach. For example, the infrastructure cre-ated in the treatment of TB, having health workers in place who sit with patients every day for about 6 months, has been proven, that infrastructure, to help in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, of malaria and other public health issues. If we can fully commit to the Global Fund, and fully commit means at least $1 billion every year, 2 million patients will be treated for TB, a half million AIDS orphans will receive support, and 16 million new malaria nets will be dis-tributed over the next few years. Access to these lifesaving treatments means children will not be pulled out of school to work or to care for a sick parent. It means an HIV-positive father in the developing world has a few more years of life to provide for his family. It means children with TB, otherwise facing a virtual death sentence, will live. What AIDS and TB experts know, but policymakers consistently underesti-mate, is that preventing and treating HIV/AIDS without preventing and treating TB is a virtual death sentence for the developing world. If HIV does not kill you, TB might or malaria might. The Global Fund is the best tool in the world to address all three of these infectious diseases together. Our investment in the Global Fund, rather than a unilateral or bilateral U.S.-waged effort, will help leverage support from other countries. Fun-neling U.S. dollars through U.S. pro-grams alone will do nothing to promote a united global front against these kill-ers. If we put in money to the Global Fund, so will other nations and so will major philanthropists. In a short time, the Global Fund has shown it is capable of tremendous progress. In just two rounds of grants, the fund has approved 160 proposals in 94 low- income countries. With signifi-cant U.S. funding the fund will con-tinue to support countries committed to addressing the epidemic killing their people. Without U.S. leadership, it will be a fund in name only. AIDS, TB, and malaria would remain a vir-tual death sentence in the developing world. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, I am honored to yield 1 minute to the distin-guished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), the chairman of the Committee on International Relations. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to say we are very pleased with this amendment. We are happy to ac-cept it. It adds to the bill, and so I will not repeat what the other people have already said in outlining its terms. But it is a good amendment, and we hope everyone accepts it. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 12minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ) for yielding me this time and for his lead-ership. Also I want to thank the gen-tleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AUZIN ) for this amendment, and with the cau-tions which our ranking member laid out, I rise in support of this amend-ment. I would like to just briefly mention the history and our debate here in Con-gress with regard to the background of this Global Fund. The idea for the Global Fund really started back some-where around 1998 and 1999, when my friend and former colleague, Congress-man Ron Dellums, had the vision and the foresight for an AIDS Marshall Plan in Africa. Refined under the lead-ership of our good friend, the gen-tleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ), who was then Chair of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, we in-troduced the World Bank AIDS Trust Fund, and this fund became the basis for the Global Fund. This fund was signed into law in, I believe it was Au-gust of 2000, under the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000, signed by President Bill Clinton. I cite this history because I think it is important for us to remember how important this fund is and that we fully debated this fund, and on a bipar-tisan basis voted it out and it was signed into law. So I think this amend-ment really strengthens the fund and its accountability. The United Nations, in I believe it was June 2001, picked up the idea of the fund, and Secretary General Kofi Annan made an impassioned plea for the creation of a Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria, which again moved forward the World Bank AIDS Trust Fund, in terms of the foundation, the parameters and the guidelines. So this fund was established in 2002 and really has made significant strides in over just a year of operation. Not only has it created a novel approach to grant-making and approval-processing, but it has also made really a very de-termined commitment to maintain as lean an operation as possible in order to focus its activities on getting money out to those in need. The current system that the fund has set up provides several layers of ac-countability. On a country level, the VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3599 May 1, 2003 proposals are gathered and voted upon by an advisory body that represent government, civil society, the private sector, faith-based groups, and non-governmental organizations. Proposals that are submitted to the Global Fund then undergo a technical review from an independent body composed of lead-ing global health experts. And now our own Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson is leading this effort. So I believe this amendment will help further strengthen the Global Fund system of accountability, and I encourage Members to vote for its in-clusion. And also, with regard to the comments of the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), I hope we can move forward, as he has so eloquently outlined, and fix what he thinks needs to be fixed in it. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. U PTON ), the distinguished chairman of the Sub-committee on Telecommunications and the Internet. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise for many reasons in support of this amend-ment. One of the main reasons that I rise in support of this amendment is because of language that I was able to get inserted as part of it, and I thank my chairman, the gentleman from Lou-isiana (Mr. T AUZIN ), and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ) for accepting this language so we did not need a sep-arate amendment but make this as part of a comprehensive amendment. Part of this amendment reads, the language I was able to insert, says this: ''In carrying out immunization pro-grams and other programs in devel-oping countries for the prevention, treatment, and control of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, the director of the CDC and Prevention, in coordination with the coordinator of the U.S. Government to combat AIDS globally, the National In-stitutes of Health, national and local government, and other organizations such as the World Health Organization, and the United Nations Children's Fund, shall development and imple-ment effective strategies to improve injection safety, including eliminating unnecessary injections.'' Now, why is this important? A couple of years ago I participated in a bipar-tisan lunch here in the Capitol, and they talked about many villages in Af-rica that are really led by children be-cause there are no more adults there. It became quite clear that for many of these injections they used syringes that were used over and over and over again. As a consequence, if one person had HIV/AIDS in that community, they all got it. They all died. They all got this terrible disease. In fact, we know from data provided by the Safe Injection Global Network, an organization affiliated with the WHO, that unsafe injection practices in developing countries cause 8 to 16 mil-lion hepatitis B infections, 2 to almost 5 million Hepatitis C infections, and the original 1976 Ebola epidemic in Zaire was traced to the reuse of three syringes. This language that was included will prevent that. I look forward to its adoption, and I again compliment the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AU- ZIN) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BROWN ) for including the language. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U PTON ) for his comments, and I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. G UT- KNECHT ). The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. G UTKNECHT ) is recognized for 30 seconds. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Chairman, with 30 seconds, I will be very brief. Mr. Chairman, there is a term ''ille- gal diversion'' used twice in section 307. I just want to make clear that the authors have the intent to keep us from reimporting drugs that are being donated for AIDS in central Africa; that this will not be used to block what we may do in the future in terms of al-lowing Americans to have access to drugs from other countries. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GUTKNECHT. I yield to the gen- tleman from Louisiana. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, the in- tent of the language is to study the question of the illegal diversion of drugs for improper purposes, that is, for resale and that sort of thing. We de-scribe the purposes within that amend-ment. So the gentleman is accurate in his statement. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I simply wanted to thank the gen- tleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ) and the members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce who worked on this amendment, as I said, to help coordi-nate the fine work done by the chair-man and the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ) on this underlying bill. This is an excellent piece of legis-lation. I hope we have improved it. I will commit to the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) that we will continue to work with him to clarify the concerns he has. We do not want to create those problems. We are simply trying to add more accountability, not less; and more clarity, less confusion. Finally, let me point out to the gen- tleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ) that it has obviously come to our committee's attention that a great deal of work is going on domestically by a number of pharmaceutical companies in testing, et cetera, in attempts to find some sort of vaccine to combat HIV/AIDS and some of these other diseases, particu-larly HIV/AIDS. And when and if that discovery is made, as we all hope it is, we will be back on the floor with legis-lation to establish some sort of na-tional framework for us to utilize that scientific breakthrough, when and if it does occur, in a way that humanely ad-ministers that kind of a hope and ex- pectation of cure and prevention to all Americans without regard to the Americans' capabilities or financial ca-pabilities to take advantage of it. We will have to think that through, how do we make sure everybody gets to take advantage of those scientific breakthroughs when they occur. We have done some preliminary work on it; and I invite my colleague from Ohio, and others, to stay in touch with us as we move forward. As we see these breakthroughs coming, we will want to talk with the gentleman and others on the committee to see if we cannot ad-vance legislation to make sure that every American has the advantage of those breakthroughs when they occur. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. TAUZIN. I yield to the gen- tleman from Ohio. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the efforts of the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AUZIN ) and appre- ciate his offer. And I think the work we are doing with the gentleman from Illi-nois (Mr. H YDE), the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AUZIN ), the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), the gen- tlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ) today is outstanding, especially because with the Global Fund and with all of these efforts we can address all of these diseases, encourage philan-thropists and other governments to contribute and make a difference in people's lives. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G REEN ). (Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member on our subcommittee, and I rise in support of the legislation. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. The global devastation caused by these three diseases cannot be understood. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has killed more than 25 million of the 65 million individuals affected by this disease worldwide. More than 14 million children have been or- phaned because of this awaful disease. Tuberculosis, the leading killer of individuals with HIV/AIDS, is an equally serious threat. An estimated 2 billion persons\u2014one third of the world's population\u2014are infected with the bac-teria that cause TB, and approximately 2 mil-lion persons die each year from TB. This isn't just a problem overseas\u2014after years of decline in the United States, the num-ber of reported TB cases increased 20 percent during 1985-1992. It is particularly problematic in my home State of Texas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we rank 5th in the country in TB case rates. With approximately 264 million persons crossing the United States-Mexico border northbound annually, and 23 percent of all VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, 1, 2003 U.S. foreign-born tuberculosis, TB, patients in the United States originating from Mexico, the implications are clear\u2014we have to act on a global level if we are going to win the battle against this killer. That is why I am pleased to support H.R. 1298, important legislation which will provide $3 billion annually for global AIDS, TB and malaria in 2004-2008. The legislation provides up to $1 billion spe- cifically for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria in 2004\u2014a key multilateral mech-anism for expanding prevention and treatment. This bill also allows the U.S. share of total contributions to the Global Fund of up to 33 percent, which solidifies our commitment to eradicating these diseases worldwide. This legislation is carefully crafted, bipar- tisan, and will be truly effective in our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Ma-laria. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and oppose any efforts to weaken or amend it. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and let me again offer my sincere thanks to the chairman and to the gen-tleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) for accepting this legislation and urge adoption of it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. All time on this amendment has expired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. T AU- ZIN). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . CROWLEY Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 2 offered by Mr. C ROWLEY : Page 22, after line 22, insert the following (and redesignate subsequent paragraphs ac-cordingly): (F) a description of the specific strategies developed to encourage men to be respon-sible in their sexual behavior, child rearing and to respect women including the reduc-tion of sexual violence and coercion; (G) a description of the specific strategies developed to increase women's access to em-ployment opportunities, income, productive resources, and microfinance programs; Page 43, line 10, after ''sexual partnering,'' insert ''reducing sexual violence and coer-cion, including child marriage, widow inher-itance, and polygamy,''. Page 43, after line 21, insert the following (and redesignate subsequent paragraphs ac-cordingly): (C) assistance for the purpose of encour- aging men to be responsible in their sexual behavior, child rearing, and to respect women; Page 44, line 7, strike ''and'' at the end. Page 44, line 10, strike the period at the end and insert ''and''. Page 44, after line 10, insert the following: (G) assistance for the purpose of increasing women's access to employment opportuni-ties, income, productive resources, and microfinance programs, where appropriate. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 210, the gentleman from New York (Mr. C ROWLEY ) and a Mem- ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. C ROWLEY ). Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment on preventing women's vulnerability. The social empowerment of women and girls is critical to reduc-ing the spread of HIV worldwide. Today, heterosexual sex is the primary factor in HIV transmission worldwide. b1230 Women and girls now make up more than 50 percent of those infected with HIV worldwide and more than 58 per-cent of those in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and girls often are not able to control when and with whom they have sex, or to influence the behavior of their partners. In fact, each year mil-lions of monogamous married women are infected by their husbands or their partners. Irrefutable evidence now links a range of discriminatory practices that violate the fundamental human rights of women and girls and lead to high rates of HIV infection. These include, but are not limited to, sexual violence and coercion, child marriage, widow in-heritance in which male relatives of the deceased gain sexual access to the widow, polygamy, and the practice in which men engage in sex with virgins as a ''cure'' for HIV-AIDS. During a visit to Malawi, I personally saw some of the horrific realities con-fronting women and girls today. I know many of us have heard the awful sto-ries of babies raped in South Africa to cure themselves of AIDS. U.S. pro-grams must work at every level to change the beliefs that support these life-threatening traditions and behav-iors. My amendment would begin to ad- dress this appalling problem and re-quire a curriculum of gender equity in HIV/AIDS training, so that adolescent boys and men learn to respect women and not just view them as sex partners. While men and boys learn about HIV/ AIDS prevention, including abstinence, being faithful and using condoms, ABC as it is called, they also learn what we call the big R, respect, respect for girls and women as their co-equals. This is a great bill. My amendment can make it better by adding this cur-riculum to HIV/AIDS prevention edu-cation programs under the Global Fund. I urge passage of the Crowley amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. CROWLEY. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment in-troduced by the gentleman from New York (Mr. C ROWLEY ). There is no question that the HIV/ AIDS pandemic is disproportionately affecting women and compounding the egregious inequalities poor women live with all over the world. It is absolutely necessary that we deal with both gen-ders if we are to reduce the impact of this disease on women's life and offer them opportunities to live with respect and dignity, free from sexual violence and coercion. The Crowley amendment requires that we include in the 5-year strategy a plan to make sure that men take re-sponsibility for their sexual behavior and that they do respect women. It will also increase opportunities for women seeking access to employment. I urge Members to support this amendment. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition; however, I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. S WEENEY ). Without objection, the gen- tleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) is rec- ognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. This is a good amendment, a thoughtful amendment. It adds to the bill, so we are pleased to accept this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 12minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. L OWEY ). Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Crowley amend-ment, and I commend my colleague for his leadership on this important issue. The amendment addresses one of the core issues driving HIV/AIDS infection rates in the hardest hit countries: The disproportionate vulnerability of women to contracting HIV. The facts speak for themselves, women and adolescent girls make up more than 50 percent of those infected with HIV worldwide, more than 58 per-cent of those infected in sub-Saharan Africa. The reasons for this are clear, gender violence and sexual coercion make it difficult, and even impossible, for women to say no to sex with an in-fected person. Widespread poverty has turned many younger women to having sex with older men in return for the food and shelter their families cannot provide. Poverty, as well, is a factor in the prevalence of early marriage, sub-jecting adolescent girls to marriages with unfaithful partners who often bring HIV home. The Crowley amendment would pro- vide a solution requiring U.S. programs to prevent HIV/AIDS to work toward empowering women to negotiate their sexual activity, and working with men to understand and respect women's rights. I urge adoption of this amend-ment. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. C ROW- LEY) for yielding me this time, and VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, May 1, 2003 thank the gentleman for this amend- ment. It is very important to this bill. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) for accepting the amendment. The empowerment of women is crit- ical in developing an AIDS strategy that is effective. In many parts of the developing world, women are still treated as second-class citizens. They lack basic protections of civil rights laws in their own country, and often-times are left at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing resources, owning land and in their general relationships to men. The Crowley amendment would fix this by encouraging men to develop a healthy relationship that treats women with respect. That is so important as we address this pandemic. In addition, it supports the development of specific strategies to increase women's access to employment, land and financial re-sources like microfinance programs that, in many instances, have encour-aged women to set up their own small businesses and avoid having to turn to a life of prostitution in order to make ends meet. I urge Members to thank the gen- tleman from New York (Mr. C ROWLEY ) for his wisdom in moving forward with this amendment. I thank the gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) for ac- cepting this very important amend-ment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. C ROWLEY ). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MRS . BIGGERT Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 3 offered by Mrs. B IGGERT : Page 33, after line 20, insert the following:(a) F INDINGS .\u2014The Congress finds as fol- lows: (1) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the gen-eral principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by the Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-264). (2) Section 2, Article 5 of the bylaws of the Global Fund provides for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to serve as the initial collection trustee for the Global Fund. (3) The trustee agreement signed between the Global Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development nar-rows the range of duties to include receiving and investing funds from donors, disbursing the funds upon the instruction of the Global Fund, reporting on trust fund resources to donors and the Global Fund, and providing an annual external audit report to the Glob-al Fund. Page 33, line 20, strike ''(a)'' and insert ''(b)''. Page 34, line 5, strike ''(b)'' and insert ''(c)''.Page 34, line 14, strike ''(c)'' and insert ''(d)''. Page 37, line 18, strike ''(d)'' and insert ''(e)''. Page 38, line 25, strike ''(e)'' and insert ''(f)''. Page 39, after line 9, insert the following:(g) S ENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING EN- COURAGEMENT OF PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GLOBAL FUND.\u2014It is the sense of the Congress that the President should\u2014 (1) conduct an outreach campaign that is designed to\u2014 (A) inform the public of the existence of\u2014(i) the Global Fund; and (ii) any entity that will accept private con- tributions intended for use by the Global Fund; and (B) encourage private contributions to the Global Fund; and (2) encourage private contributions in- tended for use by the Global Fund by\u2014 (A) establishing and operating an Internet website, and publishing information about the website; and (B) making public service announcements on radio and television. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. B IGGERT ) and a Member opposed each will con-trol 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from Illinois (Mrs. B IGGERT ). Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) for all of his work on this nec- essary initiative. I also applaud the bi-partisan manner in which he and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), have com- pleted this difficult task. In addition, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) should be com- mended for the groundwork that they laid with their previous efforts in cre-ating a World Bank/AIDS Trust Fund. This amendment does two things: First, it states that the World Bank, or the IBID, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is the trustee for contributions made by sovereign nations. This makes the un-derlying bill consistent with both the charter of the Global Fund and with legislation previously passed and signed into law concerning the global fight against HIV/AIDS. This amend-ment in no way restricts the movement of the trustee role to any other finan-cial institution if the board of the Global Fund deems it necessary some time down the road. Second, it expresses the sense of Con- gress that we wish to encourage indi-viduals and private entities to make contributions to the Global Fund. The President, in his State of the Union ad-dress, specifically requested that $1 bil-lion of emergency relief for AIDS go towards the Global AIDS Fund over a 5-year period. The Hyde bill has au-thorized $1 billion in the first year alone and more money to be authorized in subsequent years, if necessary. While we all agree that government contributions on a multilateral level should be the main source of funding for the Global Fund, we also must agree that individual and private enti-ty donations should not be discounted, discouraged, or dismissed. They should be encouraged. Governments alone can-not concur this enemy. There is so much more that individual citizens and charitable foundations can and will do if we give them the avenue, the infor-mation and the opportunity. To illustrate my point, we are all aware of the $100 million contribution made by two very well known and gen-erous Americans from the Bill and Me-lissa Gates Foundation. This single contribution from an American-based foundation is roughly half the amount that was pledged by the governments of Italy and Japan combined to this Global Fund. The amendment seeks to encourage and enable other foundations and gen-erous individuals, even those who might be thinking more in the neigh-borhood of a $10 or $100 contribution to contribute to the Global AIDS Fund to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. These funds promote expansion of public-pri-vate partnerships. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. BIGGERT. I yield to the gen- tleman from Illinois. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, we cer- tainly accept the amendment. It is an excellent addition to the bill, and con-gratulate the gentlewoman from Illi-nois (Mrs. B IGGERT ). Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. BIGGERT. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, we are in complete agreement with the gentle-woman on the value of the Global Fund and on the importance of private con-tributions to the fund. Contributions from the Gates Foundation and others significantly enhance the functioning of the fund, and we agree that the President should do even more to en-courage private donations here. I am not aware of any objections to the gentlewoman's amendment on this side of the aisle. We would be pleased to accept it. I commend the gentle-woman from Illinois (Mrs. B IGGERT ) for her important initiative. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, will the gen- tlewoman yield? Mrs. BIGGERT. I yield to the gentle- woman from California. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. B IGGERT ) for this amendment. I think it strengthens the bill. It strengthens the fund. One point I would like to make about the Global Fund which has been men-tioned is the leveraging ability of the fund. $1 billion could leverage up to $4 to $5 billion. It has been estimated that $9 to $10 billion is needed just to begin to scratch the surface on this pan-demic. The importance of the fund can-not be overstated, and I thank the gen-tlewoman for this amendment. Now VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3602 May 1, 2003 that Secretary Tommy Thompson is chair of the executive board, both sides should feel confident that he will move forward. And once we insist that our side put $1 billion in, at least we know that should lead to $4 to $5 billion im-mediately. I offer my support of the amendment. Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L EE) and thank the chair- man and the ranking member for their support of this amendment. I urge its passage. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. B IGGERT ). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . STEARNS Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. S TEARNS : Page 36, after line 13, insert the following: (iii) If, at any time during any of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the President deter-mines that the salary of any individual em-ployed by the Global Fund exceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States (as determined under section 104 of title 3, United States Code) for that fiscal year, then the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which the salary of each such individual ex-ceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States. Page 36, line 14, strike ''(B)'' and insert ''(B)(i)''. Page 36, beginning on each of lines 15 and 17, strike ''subparagraph (A)'' and insert ''subparagraph (A)(i)''. Page 36, after line 19, insert the following: (ii) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) is au-thorized to be made available to carry out section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by section 301 of this Act). Amounts made available under the preceding sentence are in addition to amounts appro-priated pursuant to the authorization of ap-propriations under section 401 of this Act for HIV/AIDS assistance. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. S TEARNS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. S TEARNS ). Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the op- portunity to offer this simple amend-ment. It will ensure that the money that the United States spends, which is taxpayers' money, to address the AIDS crisis will be spent treating patients rather than spent in bureaucratic, ad-ministrative costs. It requires that at the Global Fund, individual salaries may not exceed the salary of the Vice President of the United States. The criteria that I came up with, being the Vice President's sal-ary, is because in the Homeland Secu-rity Act, we specified that no Federal employee may earn a salary in excess of the vice presidential salary. So that is the criteria I used. I think it is pret-ty simple, and back in our districts, $192,000 is a lot of money. Given that the Global Fund's mission is to help people dying from AIDS and prevent others from getting and even-tually dying from AIDS, it would seem reasonable that administrative costs should be held to a minimum so that every dollar that taxpayers spend over-seas will move to the patients and to the people who need it. As long as the U.S. Government is the largest single contributor to the fund, it is appro-priate that we place this modest re-striction on the salaries. We do it for our Federal employees here in the United States, why not do it in the Global Fund. With hundreds of millions of dollars at risk, it is the responsi-bility of all of us to ensure that dollars are spent wisely. Mr. Chairman, I think the amendment is pretty simple. I could point out a lot more. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STEARNS. I yield to the gen- tleman from Illinois. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, we are pre- pared to accept the amendment. Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STEARNS. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, we ex- pect the Global Fund to recruit and hire the most competent and competi-tive international experts to manage this very complex organization. b1245 I feel strongly that exorbitant execu- tive salaries would only go to under-mine the credibility of the organiza-tion. There are lots of skeptics who op-pose the Global Fund and wish it to fail. These naysayers are looking for any means to discredit the work of the Global Fund. It is very important that the Global Fund salaries should be re-alistic and competitive and attract the most competent professionals in the world, but they should not be set at levels that would undermine the credi-bility of the good work that we hope to accomplish. I urge my colleagues to support my friend's amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just will conclude by saying we all want this bill to save lives. That is why we are here. But I think we must have some kind of strict accountability with this organization sanctioned by the world to meet this dire need, and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), distinguished chairman and ranking member. I ap-preciate their support. We must have confidence that these organizations are using American taxpayers' dollars wisely. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. S WEENEY ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. S TEARNS ). The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I de- mand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. S TEARNS ) will be postponed. It is now in order to consider amend- ment No. 5 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . BALLANCE Mr. BALLANCE. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. BALLANCE : Page 55, after line 10, insert the following:(g) S ENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS.\u2014 (1) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress finds the following: (A) The United States provides more than 60 percent of all food assistance worldwide. (B) According to the United Nations World Food Program and other United Nations agencies, food insecurity of individuals in-fected or living with HIV/AIDS is a major problem in countries with large populations of such individuals, particularly in African countries. (C) Although the United States is willing to provide food assistance to these countries in need, a few of the countries object to part or all of the assistance because of fears of be-nign genetic modifications to the foods. (D) Healthy and nutritious foods for indi- viduals infected or living with HIV/AIDS are an important complement to HIV/AIDS medicines for such individuals. (E) Individuals infected with HIV have higher nutritional requirements than indi-viduals who are not infected with HIV, par-ticularly with respect to the need for pro-tein. Also, there is evidence to suggest that the full benefit of therapy to treat HIV/AIDS may not be achieved in individuals who are malnourished, particularly in pregnant and lactating women. (2) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .\u2014It is therefore the sense of Congress that United States food as-sistance should be accepted by countries with large populations of individuals in-fected or living with HIV/AIDS, particularly African countries, in order to help feed such individuals. Page 69, line 19, strike ''The drug nevirapine reduces'' and insert ''Certain antiretroviral drugs reduce''. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tleman from North Carolina (Mr. B ALLANCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3603 May 1, 2003 The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. B ALLANCE ). Mr. BALLANCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I am thankful for this opportunity to offer this amendment to the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. I would like to commend the efforts of my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the gentleman from Cali- fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), ranking member, for their leadership; but I also want to take a moment to point my finger at the honorable gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L EE), our good friend and long-time leader in this effort who has stood tall on this issue for so many years, and I would like to take the op-portunity to commend our President for getting involved in this issue. I have been in this Congress now for about 4 months, and there have not been many issues that have touched me. This one has. So I have come today to add my voice on behalf of a growing problem compounding the HIV/AIDS crisis in many African nations. Amer-ica stands ready to help provide food assistance to our brothers and sisters in Africa suffering from this dev-astating disease, HIV/AIDS. We already provide more than 60 percent of all food aid around the world, and yet some parts of the world question the quality of our foods on the basis of unscientific concerns. Thus it is that some nations object to our food aid; and one I would point out, Zambia, has completely re-jected our help. Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that America may not be doing enough to educate foreign countries about geneti-cally modified foods. Many poor na-tions lack infrastructure to determine if food is safe. With images on tele-vision of epidemics like Mad Cow Dis-ease, many African leaders are very hesitant to go on the findings of food safety inspections and research serv-ices of another nation. With many countries in Africa deal- ing with HIV/AIDS, their leaders are hesitant to introduce any item into the food supply that they suspect might further complicate health problems. Without adequate information, it is no wonder many of these countries have come to different conclusions about food products they allow into their country. Mr. Chairman, if we asked most HIV/ AIDS victims in Africa what they need most, I would venture to say that they will tell us that they need food. More than any medication, providing proper nutrition to regions without adequate food can prolong lives. The most at risk in this debilitating crisis are women and children. The links between malnutrition and AIDS deaths is unde-niable. Malnutrition accelerates the progression from HIV to AIDS and leaves those with HIV/AIDS vulnerable to opportunistic infections that often are fatal. The devastation that this disease causes in Africa, the hundreds of thou-sands of orphans, the decimated com-munities and the economic damage can be alleviated with a combined program of medical aid and good nutrition. Food is much less expensive than antiretroviral drugs, and good nutri-tion can prolong the lives of AIDS vic-tims for many years and sometimes decades. According to the recently pub-lished Demographic Health Survey and the 2000 Census of Population and Housing by the United Nations, chil-dren born between 1970 and 1975 in Zambia could expect to live 47.2 years. That same study now has shown that their life expectancy has decreased to 40.5 years. Unfounded fears should not hold up food aid. This amendment I believe will go a long way to alleviate those con-cerns, and I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. BALLANCE. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the amendment intro-duced by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. B ALLANCE ), and I want to commend him for his initiative. We think this is a significant improvement to the underlying bill. We have no ob-jections, and we strongly support it. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. BALLANCE. I yield to the gen- tleman from Illinois. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to associate myself with the re-marks of the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ). This is an excellent amendment, and I urge all our colleagues to support it. Mr. BALLANCE. Mr. Chairman, re- claiming my time, one other thing I wanted to say which was not in my pre-pared remarks was we grow a lot of corn in North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. B ALLANCE ). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 108-80. It is now in order to consider amend- ment No. 7 printed in House report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . LANTOS Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment as the designee of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. M ILLENDER -MCDONALD ). The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 7 offered by Mr. L ANTOS : Page 74, after line 10, insert the following (and redesignate subsequent paragraphs ac-cordingly): (4) ensure the importance of inheritance rights of women, particularly women in Afri-can countries, due to the exponential growth in the number of young widows, orphaned girls, and grandmothers becoming heads of households as a result of the HIV/AIDS pan-demic; Page 75, line 4, add at the end the following new sentence: ''Such report should include a description of activities undertaken to carry out subsection (b)(4).''. Page 75, line 11, add at the end the fol- lowing new sentence: ''A significant percent-age of the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under the preceding sentence for a fiscal year should be made available to carry out sub-section (b)(4).''. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen- tleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) and a Member opposed each will con-trol 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ). Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the amendment of- fered by the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. M ILLENDER -MCDONALD ), my good friend and colleague, deals with a very important issue. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a frightening impact on women, particularly in Africa where 55 percent of all HIV/AIDS victims are women. Unequal inheritance rights all over the world, but particularly in Af-rica, favor men over women. Poor women are abandoned because of their HIV/AIDS status, widowed by the pre-mature death of a husband, or left as orphans by the death of parents. Left with nothing but their desperation, these women and girls are exploited by sex traffickers, pimps, and abusive em-ployers. Mr. Chairman, it is crucial that pro- grams funded by this emergency pro-gram include the promotion and pro-tection of women's inheritance rights, but we should not stop there. Women's equal rights across the board are abso-lutely essential to overcoming the pov-erty that underpins the seeming hope-lessness of this disease. Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my col- leagues to support this amendment. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LANTOS. I yield to the gen- tleman from Illinois. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am pleased to say that the majority ac-cepts the amendment. It is an excellent addition to what I think is an excellent bill. So we are pleased to accept it. Ms. MILLENDER-M CDONALD. Mr. Chair- man, I want to take this time to thank Chair-man H YDE and Ranking Member L ANTOS for being the driving force behind such an impor-tant bill, H.R. 1298, United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. This bill embodies true leadership on the part of the United States, dramatically increasing the U.S. participation in addressing the pandemic that is ravaging whole regions and millions upon millions of people. This un-precedented bill acknowledges our moral re-sponsibility to address the pandemic that has already resulted in the deaths of millions. I am so proud to be a part of this legislation, this distinguished body and this country. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3604 May 1, 2003 The bill as reported out of the International Relations Committee contains a provision of mine included in the Committee markup which my good friend, Congresswoman N APOLITANO , offered for me as a member of that Com-mittee. While much attention is being paid to preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS, we must turn to ad-dressing the needs and rights of that child to grow up with parents, so that millions more are not orphaned before he or she can even walk. My language gives priority preference for federal funds to groups that are currently ad-ministering a program with non-federal funds to: prevent mother-to-child transmission; and provide life-long care and treatment in family-centered programs so that children do not grow up as orphans. This would benefit programs such as the MTCT-Plus Initiative, which is supported by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and the First Ladies of Africa, and which has $50 million in funding from several private phil-anthropic foundations including the Bill and Melinda Gates, the William and Flora Hewlett, the Robert Wood Johnson and other founda-tions. Such family-survival programs are crit-ical to address the issues of millions of chil-dren orphaned by HIV/AIDS on a scale unrivaled in history. In sub-Saharan Africa, family and societal structures are breaking down because of the deaths of a generation of parents. The number of children in the devel-oping world who have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic will nearly double from 13.4 million to 25.4 million by the end of this dec-ade. Today, 5.5 million children in Africa have lost both parents and in most cases, at least one of them to AIDS, and that number will rise to 7.9 million by 2010. Older women are also profoundly affected since the responsibility for caring for and supporting grandchildren or-phaned by AIDS infected parents often falls on the shoulders of the elderly. Thank you again, Chairman H YDE and Ranking Member L ANTOS , for agreeing to in- clude my amendment in the bill as reported, and to Congresswoman N APOLITANO for agreeing to offer my amendment during the Committee markup. Mr. Chairman, my amendment today con- cerns Section 314 which calls for a pilot pro-gram of assistance for children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. My amendment re-quires that pilot program to ensure the impor-tance of inheritance rights of women, particu-larly women in African countries are included in this program. The relationship of the denial of inheritance rights for women, increased HIV/AIDS infection in women and the resulting exponential growth in the numbers of young widows, orphaned girls, and grandmothers be-coming heads of households needs to be fur-ther studied and documented. My amendment does just that. My amendment is necessary because a ma- jority of those infected by HIV/AIDS in Africa are women of all classes, ethnic groups, and levels of education. Women with AIDS are condemned to an early death when their homes, lands, and other property are taken. They not only lose assets they could use for medical care, but also the shelter they need to endure this disease. The failure to ensure equal property and in- heritance rights upon separation or divorce discourages women from leaving violent mar-riages. HIV risk is especially high for women in situations of domestic violence, which often involves coercive sex, diminished ability to ne-gotiate with partners for safer sex, and impede women from seeking health information and treatment. In some places, widows are forced to under- go sexual practices such as ''wife inheritance'' or ritual ''cleansing'' in order to keep their property. ''Wife inheritance'' occurs when a male relative of the dead husband takes over the widow as a wife, often in a polygamous environment. ''Cleansing'' usually involves sex with a social outcast who is paid by the dead husband's family, supposedly to cleanse the women of her dead husband's evil spirits. In both of these rituals, safe sex is seldom prac-ticed and often forced. Such women are at in-creased risk of contracting and spreading HIV. For example, there are areas in Kenya where the wife inheritance and cleansing prac-tices have created an alarmingly high rate of HIV/AIDS infection. Fully 22 percent of the population between ages 15 and 49 in the Nyanza province are infected, and 35 percent of ante-natal women in one district within that province are infected. Girls and young women in the Nyanza province are infected at six times the rate of their male counterparts. The underlying bill calls for the President to report on this pilot program, as described under Section 314(c). My amendment calls for that report to include in it a description of ac-tivities undertaken to ensure that the inherit-ance rights of women as just described are part of this program. Finally, in the last Congress, Rep. Eva Clay- ton and I introduced H. Con. Res. 421, recog-nizing the importance of inheritance rights of women in Africa, and its relationship to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. I have also chaired two briefings on this issue. Our resolution was very strongly supported by this body. It had 90 original cosponsors with bipartisan support. My amendment today to the underlying bill in-cludes the crux of H. Con. Res. 421. Thank you so much and I hope you support my amendment to H.R. 1298. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, we have no further requests for time, and we yield back the balance of our time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ). The amendment was agreed to. b1300 The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. SWEENEY ). It is now in order to con- sider Amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 108-80, as modified by the order of the House of earlier today. AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MS . MCCOLLUM Ms. M CCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 8 offered by Ms. M CCOL- LUM: Page 83, line 14, strike ''For'' and insert ''(a) T HERAPEUTIC MEDICAL CARE.\u2014For''. Page 83, after line 22, add the following new subsection: (b) O RPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN .\u2014 For fiscal years 2006 through 2008, not less than 10 percent of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropria-tions under section 401 for HIV/AIDS assist- ance for each such fiscal year shall be ex-pended for assistance for orphans and vulner-able children affected by HIV/AIDS, of which such amount at least 50 percent shall be pro-vided through non-profit, nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based organi-zations, that implement programs on the community level. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. M CCOL- LUM) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from Minnesota (Ms. M CCOL- LUM). Ms. M CCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself of such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking once again the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), for their hard work on this critical legislation. Presi-dent Bush should also be congratulated for his leadership on this important legislation. This bill is a huge step for-ward in our global leadership to re-spond to the AIDS pandemic. The gentleman from Illinois (Chair- man H YDE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) have recog- nized AIDS orphans and vulnerable children and have included them in this historic bill expressing the sense of Congress that they receive a portion of funding. Nonetheless, I believe we can and we must do more to ensure that some of our planet's most vulner-able children are protected. The amendment I am offering today would ensure that 10 percent of the ap-propriated funds in this bill be ex-pended for HIV\u2014AIDS assistance for millions of orphans and vulnerable children affected by AIDS. As we prepare to authorize this groundbreaking legislation, I urge my colleagues to join me in committing this funding for children who are being left behind to survive on their own as a result of the AIDS pandemic. This funding will go far in providing the most basic health, education and economic needs to millions of children throughout the work of community and faith-based groups, as well as NGOs and host country governments. Today there are more than 12 million children, 12 million children in Africa, that have lost one or both parents to HIV\u2014AIDS. By the year 2005, there will be more than 20 million AIDS orphans around the world. Children in Africa are suffering the loss of parents, extended family mem-bers, teachers, health care providers and peers. Every community affected by AIDS is being robbed of a genera-tion of adults in their most productive years, leaving behind children to be raised by relatives, left on their own in households headed by other children, or, even worse, to be totally left alone to forage in rural villages and on the streets of cities across the continent of Africa. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3605 May 1, 2003 The scope and complexity of the challenges facing children affected by AIDS cannot be overstated. Children become responsible for their own sur-vival while providing care for dying parents. They are forced to abandon school and face the stigma and isola-tion far too frequently associated with AIDS. Tragically, orphan children who are the most vulnerable are often forced into labor, sexual exploitation, and the hopelessness of a life of mere survival. This amendment can help transform the future of communities filled with AIDS orphans by committing to rein-vest into communities that have faith-based organizations and other groups that are committed to working with orphans. We are ensuring by doing this that an entire generation of children in Africa will not be lost. We have the responsibility today to make a firm commitment to ensure that the resources in this bill go to provide the most basic needs of every child; food, shelter, safety, medicine, education, and, most importantly of all, hope for the future. I urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting the millions of children orphaned by AIDS. I respect-fully ask my colleagues to support this amendment and to make a strong com-mitment to the millions of AIDS or-phans and vulnerable children who des-perately need our help today. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. M CCOLLUM. I yield to the gen- tleman from Illinois. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, the chil- dren and orphans who are affected by this scourge could have no better champion than the gentlewoman from Minnesota, and we are very pleased to accept her excellent amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. M CCOLLUM. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate and commend my friend from Minnesota for offering this most important amendment, which dramatically improves the underlying bill. On this side we are proud and pleased to accept her amendment. Ms. M CCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, re- claiming my time, I am very honored to have this amendment accepted, and I thank both my mentors for their help in preparing this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. M CCOLLUM ). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. G REEN of Wisconsin) having assumed the chair, Mr. S WEENEY , Chairman pro tempore of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, re- ported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1298) to provide assistance to foreign countries to combat HIV/AIDS, tuber-culosis, and malaria, and for other pur-poses, had come to no resolution there-on. f MAKING IN ORDER CONSIDER- ATION OF AMENDMENT NO. 6 OUT OF SEQUENCE DURING FUR-THER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1298, UNITED STATES LEADER-SHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBER-CULOSIS, AND MALARIA ACT OF 2003 Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Speak- er, I ask unanimous consent that Amendment No. 6 in House Report 108-80 be considered out of sequence in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. f UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBER-CULOSIS, AND MALARIA ACT OF 2003 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 1298. b1306 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 1298) to provide assistance to foreign countries to combat HIV/AIDS, tuber-culosis, and malaria, and for other pur-poses, with Mr. S WEENEY (Chairman pro tempore) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. When the Committee of the Whole rose ear-lier today, Amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 108-80 offered by the gen-tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. M CCOL- LUM) had been disposed of. Under the recent order of the House, it is now in order to consider Amend-ment No. 6 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . SMITH OF MICHIGAN Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 6 offered by Mr. S MITH of Michigan: Page 81, beginning on line 22, strike ''$30,000,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008'' and insert ''$2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, $2,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, $3,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $4,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2008''. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH). Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, this amendment brings back the level of funding for the first year to the level recommended by the President, the amount of $2 billion, which is the amount that is also in our budget resolution. The third reason is I would like to document and persuade to my col-leagues, expert witnesses from Africa that are suggesting that it is going to be much more effective to start gradu-ally and then increase the spending over the year. My amendment does not decrease the total 5 year commitment of $15 billion, but, rather, is consistent with what the President has requested, starting at $2 billion and then growing each year. I would like to read a letter from a former United States ambassador to several of those African countries. ''As the son of a medical missionary to Africa, a career State Department diplomat with over 28 years of service, mainly in Africa, and as the former United States Ambassador to Rwanda and Mali, I am well aware of the prob-lems making foreign aid genuinely ben-efit the populations it was intended to impact. Throughout my career, I have been involved in rural health initia-tives in Africa, and while there is great need to meet the challenge of AIDS in Africa, front-loading a program might well do more harm than good. There is great risk in squandering precious funds when expenditures are made without adequate controls or account-ability. We also risk forcing our big-ticket solutions on Africans who may need more modest help in finding local solutions and building up their own ca-pacity to deal with the challenge in the early year. ''Accordingly, I support the original emergency plan for AIDS relief pro-posed by the President that would launch this new initiative to $2 billion in '04 and steadily escalate spending over 5 years.'' Again, because we can maximize this money over the 5-year period, because it would be consistent with the Presi-dent and the budget resolution, I hope Members support the amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amend-ment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished friend the gentleman from California (Mr. H YDE). Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Cali-fornia for yielding me time. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3606 May 1, 2003 Mr. Chairman, it is with extreme re- gret that I must oppose the amend-ment offered by my good friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH). He never offers an amendment, but what it is not well thought out, and this is a well thought-out amendment. But, unfortunately, it disturbs the bal-ance that we have carefully, and as I have said, painstakingly negotiated with the many different elements of our body who have particular points of view. The $2 billion limitation which the gentleman from Michigan would im-pose is indeed what the President said in his budget, but I hasten to point out that the President supports our bill, and our bill authorizes, and I stress the word ''authorizes,'' $3 billion for 5 years. The gentleman from Michigan's for- mula does not, in any way, deduct this money, the total is still $15 million over 5 years, but it is a question of how much for the first year and how much for the succeeding years. I respectfully request that this amendment be defeated, because it would unbalance what has been very carefully put together. I suggest that the President does support our bill and has issued a statement this morning doing so. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his contribution. We considered the gentleman's amendment in committee and it was defeated, and, with great re-spect and admiration, I hope this is de-feated too. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, our distinguished chairman, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), expressed my views. In order to save time, I merely concur with his comments. I also oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. As our chairman indicated, we did de-feat this amendment in committee. Several days ago at the White House, the President illustrated quite well the cost of delaying these funds to those who are so desperately in need. As President Bush said, time is not on our side. Since the State of the Union ad-dress, he said that an estimated 760,000 people have died from AIDS, 1.2 million people have become infected and more than 175,000 babies have been born with the virus. Imagine how many more will die and become infected if we accept this amendment and deny the $1 billion in funding this year to those who des-perately need this help? Clearly we cannot wait. There are programs out there that can use our funding imme-diately. Even the executive director of UNAIDS, Dr. Piot, has said Africa could absorb $6.57 billion in AIDS fund-ing without any improvements toward infrastructure. Therefore, I urge all my colleagues to vote against this bill and to maintain the compromise that we worked so hard to negotiate with the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE). Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-woman from North Carolina (Mrs. M YRICK ). Mrs. MYRICK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment of-fered by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH), and, in deference to my chairman, for whom I have great respect, I am still speaking. I think that this would ensure that we stay within the President's plan originally and within the budget. He did say on the 29th of April that, with the approval of Congress, this plan will direct $15 billion to fight AIDS abroad over the next 5 years, but beginning with $2 billion in 2004. b1315 The reason I think it is important to stay within our budget is because due to the war and the economic downturn we, unfortunately, are running the largest budget deficits in American history this year and next. We cannot continue to just overspend every year, piling debt on our children and grand-children. It does not mean this pro-gram is not important. I support it. But there are many important pro-grams, and there is a limited amount of money. So passing the President's proposal, with this amendment, is still a huge in-crease in our commitment to this prob-lem. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. S WEENEY ). The Chair would inform Members that the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) has 2 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH) has 2 minutes re- maining. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted to yield 1 minute to my good friend, the gentleman from Con-necticut (Mr. S HAYS ). Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I under-stand the good heart of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH) and where he is coming from. But, Mr. Chairman, this is money that is needed now. The President has stated, ''Seldom has history offered a greater oppor-tunity to do so much for so many.'' This year, the President made an un-precedented commitment to fight HIV/AIDS on a global scale, and we must not thwart that momentum by cutting this year's authorization by a third. The President has stated that his HIV/AIDS initiative is intended to pre-vent 7 million new infections, treat 2 million HIV-infected people, and care for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and AIDS orphans. There is no reason I can think of to limit the immediate flow of money. There are children in Africa going to school without teachers and then going to a home without par-ents, and we have to deal with that. Mr. Chairman, I commend President Bush for taking such a bold step in committing these funds and the gen-tleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the ranking member, the gen-tleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), for moving it through this Chamber. I think we need to maintain the full $3 billion authorization as it is. Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, I would just say that this is ex-actly what the President rec-ommended. My amendment is what the President recommended. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. F LAKE ). Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I too rise in reluctance to support this amendment in that the chairman does not support it. But I respect the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH), and I believe that we need to take into account that this is the first bill of the year, I believe, that actually goes over budget. We are 50 percent over budget. What the President asked for was $2 billion in the first year. We are going for $3 billion. I think it sets a bad precedent for the rest of the year if we are starting out this way. As the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH) also pointed out, the U.N. Glob- al Fund and others that will absorb this money may have a hard time ab-sorbing it that quickly anyway, and I believe that is why the President only asked for $2 billion in the first place. We should note that the Global Fund has been criticized by its head, who is currently Secretary Tommy Thomp-son, who said that it has some ineffi-ciencies. One thing that has been noted is that the Office of the Secretariat spent $11 million on salaries last year for 65 staff members. That is an aver-age of $170,000 per employee. I would challenge those who say that we need to put this money in that quickly. We ought to go with the origi-nal request from the President, and I would urge support of the amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the remaining 1 minute of our time to my good friend, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE). (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my great appreciation for the leadership of the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS), and the Members of the Com- mittee on International Relations. Might I remind this body that the Global Fund was implemented in 2000, signed by President Clinton, and worked on very hard by Members of this body, Democrats, and certainly we were joined by members of the Repub-lican Conference. Mr. Chairman, 40 million children will be orphaned in sub-Saharan Africa on the basis of losing their parents to VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, May 1, 2003 HIV/AIDS. This is a time when we can- not wait. It is imperative that the funding be as it is designated in the legislation to begin fighting this crisis now. I join with the chairman and the ranking member to say we are fighting an epidemic, a pandemic, a crisis; lives are being lost. Absolutely we cannot stop one moment to defer funding to this Global Fund and the necessity of moving on this as fast as we can. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment. Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself the remaining time. Let me conclude by simply saying that this is what the President sug-gested, starting at $2 billion. It is con-sistent with our budget resolution that we passed just 2 weeks ago. It still maintains the $15 billion over 5 years. So there is no disagreement; there is no reduction in total funding. Again, I quote from Ambassador Rawson who says, ''While there is great need to meet the challenge of AIDS in Africa, front-loading a program might well do more harm than good,'' and he recommends that we support the Smith amendment, which is the President's suggestion, to launch this new initia-tive at $2 billion in 2004 and steadily es-calating that spending. Mr. Chairman, I also am reluctant to go against my chairman on this amendment, but I thought sure that the gentleman from Illinois would sup-port this amendment with all of the good, rational, logical reasons that I have. I yield my remaining time to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE). Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, it is al- ways a pleasure to engage with the gentleman from Michigan in debates, but the gentleman keeps citing the President. That has been overtaken by a statement of position from the White House supporting our version and in opposition to yours. The fact is, under the Smith amendment, there is no net saving. There is a reshuffling of money within the 5-year framework, but it still adds up to $15 billion. With re-spect, I hope the gentleman loses the amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH) has expired. Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, I ask unanimous consent for 5 ad-ditional seconds. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. That request may not be entertained. All time has expired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. S MITH).

Mr. Chairman, on May 1, 2003, on rollcall vote No. 156, an amendment by Mr. N ICKSMITH of Michigan to H.R. 1298, I voted ''yea'' in error mistaking this amendment which I opposed for one by Mr. S MITH of New Jer- sey, which I support. I meant to vote ''no''. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 9 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON - LEE OF TEXAS Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 9 offered by Ms. J ACKSON - LEEof Texas: At the end of the bill, add the following (and conform the table of contents accord-ingly): SEC. 404. ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNITED STATES PRIVATE SECTOR TO PREVENT AND REDUCE HIV/AIDS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. It is the sense of Congress that United States businesses should be encouraged to provide assistance to sub-Saharan African countries to prevent and reduce the inci-dence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. In providing such assistance, United States businesses should be encouraged to consider the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund in order to provide for coordination among such businesses in the collection and distribution of the assistance to sub-Saharan African countries. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON - LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE). Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, to the ranking member and VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3609 May 1, 2003 the chairman, I am not sure how mo- mentous a day or how historic a day this will eventually be, whether or not it translates to the American psyche or the international psyche. This is probably a day long in com- ing. And that is this bipartisan but very responsible response to a dev-astating deadly disease permeating the entire world, if you will. I think it is appropriate to thank the ranking mem-ber and chairman of this committee and all of the negotiators, including my good friend, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) for where we are today. All I would like to do with this amendment, Mr. Chairman, is to be helpful, to be able to move the process along. And what I think is so innova-tive and so particularly unique about this particular initiative, H.R. 1298, is that we are dealing with HIV, tuber-culosis and malaria. One of the challenges that many of us who have dealt with this issue for a long period of time was the conflicting themes that may have been throughout to have been coming from sub-Saharan Africa. I recall a period of time in our history when the head of state of South Africa, the present president, made a very, very startling point, and that is how nutrition impacts on the condition of individuals. I recall the debate about nutrition. Here we have come full cir-cle to understand that there are many variables that impact the devastation of HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis. This legislation goes right to the heart and understands the interrelated-ness of the crisis in sub-Saharan Afri-ca. It applauds nations that have been able to move forward such as the Ugan-dan effort, the ABC. It recognizes that we must do this collaboratively. And it also acknowledges, as I said on the floor of the House just a few minutes earlier, 40 million sub-Saharan chil-dren will be orphaned by this disease; but more importantly, Mr. Chairman, businesses, industries, are being dev-astated because young and vibrant workers are being cut down by AIDS. This is sub-Saharan Africa, Mr. Chairman. I have been to India. It is growing there. China, it is growing there. So this amendment is based upon my experience in history that there are many who want to contribute to the finality of this disease, and that is by encouraging the business commu-nity to be able to contribute to the U.N. Global Fund, in particular, and to contribute to a resource pool that will shuttle those monies to the U.N. Glob-al Fund, as I indicated, a fund estab-lished just a few years ago in 2000 by many of us who worked on this with the leadership of this Committee on International Relations, President Clinton and many Members of Con-gress. This amendment that will en-gage the business community in a very real way. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. We are very pleased to accept this amendment which adds to the quality of bill. I thank the gentlewoman and we are pleased to accept it. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend my friend, the gentle-woman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE) for her excellent amendment. We are delighted to accept it on this side. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Re- claiming my time, I thank both the chairman and the ranking member. I close by simply saying that this language squarely places a very firm hand of encouragement on our business community and a firm hand toward the U.N. Global Fund and a firm hand to fi-nally or maybe moving towards stamp-ing out this terrible devastation of HIV/AIDS, along with tuberculosis and malaria. I ask my colleagues to sup-port it. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment to the ''United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and malaria Act of 2003'' to en-courage American businesses to help sub-Sa-haran African governments and communities fight the spread of HIV/AIDS in their countries. Many U.S. corporations operate in sub-Sa- haran Africa. From my home State of Texas, the oil industry conducts business operations in Africa. Businesses such as pharmaceutical companies, computer companies, food compa-nies, and businesses from practically every economic segment of the country operate in Africa. These companies earn substantial profits from their operations in Africa. Accordingly, they should be encouraged to provide financial assistance to sub-Saharan communities and participate in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS. I fully support and applaud the efforts of the Global Fund. My amendment, which estab-lishes a Response Fund, will neither conflict with the activities and mission of the Global Fund, nor create unnecessary bureaucracy. The Global Fund was established by the United Nations Secretary General in April of 2001. The stated purpose is to, ''attract, man-age and disburse additional resources through a new public-private partnership that will make a sustainable and significant contribution to the reduction of infections, illness and death, thereby mitigating the impact caused by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in countries in need.'' The Response Fund that I propose in my amendment will work in conjunction with the Global Fund not in opposition to it. My Re-sponse Fund will create more flexibility for cor-porations to contribute to the fight against HIV/AIDS, and give corporations more options. My Response Fund will be a vehicle to getting funds to sub-Saharan communities, medical facilities and patients with utmost speed. The Response Fund and the Global Fund will share the same goal, and they would cer-tainly have opportunities to collaborate and work together in the fight against infectious diseases. I want to be clear that the Response Fund will not create an extra step in getting funds to sub-Saharan Africans suffering from HIV/AIDS. I encourage U.S. businesses to contribute to both the Response Fund established in my amendment and also to the United Nations Global Fund. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment be- cause the fight against HIV/AIDS should be waged by the Congress, the sub-Saharan Afri-can community, and the American business community as well. I encourage the American business community to contribute needed funds to both the Response Fund in my amendment and The United Nations Global Fund. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MR . SMITH OF NEW JERSEY Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 10 offered by Mr. S MITH of New Jersey: Page 54, line 21, insert before the period the following: '', or to endorse, utilize, or participate in a prevention method or treat-ment program to which the organization has a religious or moral objection''. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH) and a Member opposed each will con-trol 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH). Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all, let me begin by thanking the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), our chairman, for the extraor- dinary job he as done in this legisla-tion. This has been a work in progress as we all know for several months, over last year and into this year. This legis-lation, in the end, is something that will save millions of lives and some-thing we can be proud of. I have an amendment that is co-spon- sored by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), the gentleman from Michi- gan (Mr. S TUPAK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. R ENZI) that I think is a critical clarification needed to make sure that the many successful and compassionate organizations are not inadvertently disqualified from participating in our international HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment efforts. The amendment is a one-phrase all- important clarification of the existing language in the bill. It will ensure that a qualified grantee that does not want to participate in all aspects of a treat-ment or prevention strategy is not dis-qualified from participating in our HIV/AIDS efforts. For example, if a Muslim or Catholic organization is ex-cellent in abstinence education or VerDate Jan 31 2003 03:19 May 02, H3610 May 1, 2003 AIDS testing, they should not be dis- qualified from U.S. funding because they have a moral objection to condoms. The bill already says, I would point out, that organizations shall not be re-quired as a condition of receiving the assistance to endorse or utilize a multi-sectorial approach to combat-ting HIV/AIDS. While this language is intended to protect organizations that are qualified in one phase of prevention or treatment from being disqualified if they have a moral or religious objec-tion, the concern is that the language might be too vague. The word ''multi-sectorial'' has many meanings and might not protect organizations. That ambiguity\u2014that infirmity\u2014in the un-derlying bill is remedial by our amend-ment. Thus the amendment which we are offering today would clarify, according to the original intent of the bill, that organizations should not be disquali-fied if they have moral or religious ob-jections to one part of a treatment or prevention strategy. The one phrase that would be added is this: ''To en-dorse, utilize or participate in a pre-vention method or treatment program to which the organization has a reli-gious or moral objection.'' b1400 It could not be more clear. It could not be more transparent. Some of my colleagues may say faith-based organizations do not need this protection, but I assure them that the problem is real. In one case, a Catholic doctor who worked in sub-Sa-haran Africa for 31 years, caring for thousands of young people suffering from AIDS, was approached by USAID in Uganda and asked to draw up a pro-gram to prevent HIV/AIDS. Her group presented a project proposal which in-volved AIDS awareness and behavior change programs. In the project pro-posal, the emphasis was on abstinence and faithfulness as a way of preventing the spread of HIV and was for people of all faiths. USAID, however, responded by asking them to put in a component of promoting and distributing condoms. When this organization said they were not prepared to do so be-cause of a religious objection, they were denied funding. This is one of many stories. And the ones who are harmed when this kind of action takes place are those who are suffering the most and are at greatest risk and need services. This provision would not require, I would say to my colleagues, a change in the overall strategy to fight HIV/AIDS. The over-all strategy would stay the same even if certain groups only worked on parts of that strategy where they are quali-fied and successful. Let me say, finally, the Catholic Church, today, cares for one out of every four AIDS patients. One out of every four. If the bill remains unclear, this could potentially prohibit, could proscribe the funding of many of the initiatives of the Church, and I said earlier Muslim groups or Catholic Re-lief Services, which today cares for about 2 million people who are at risk or perhaps have been affected by AIDS, mostly in Africa but around the world as well. Two million by one Catholic agency alone We want inclusion. We want more people involved. I ask that this amend-ment be approved. This conscience pro-tection is real and it would be impos-sible for anyone, at anytime to mis-construe Congressional intent. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. S WEENEY ). The gentleman from Cali- fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ) is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to the Smith amendment. First, I would like to thank the gen- tleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH) for his long-standing leadership on human rights' matters and for his sup-port for this critically important legis-lation. His vote in committee in favor of H.R. 1298 was greatly appreciated. I would also like to note that the amendment being offered today is dif-ferent from the one that was offered in committee. The amendment offered in committee during markup was deeply offensive in that consciences were only granted to faith-based organizations. The amendment before us today builds upon language already in H.R. 1298. The bill currently states that an organization receiving funds under this act shall not be required to endorse or utilize a multisectoral approach to combating HIV/AIDS. In other words, a group does not need to endorse condom use or hand out condoms or endorse ab-stinence and promote abstinence edu-cation to receive money under this act. The Smith amendment adds a new clause to the current language. It states that groups shall not be required to endorse, utilize, or participate in a prevention method or treatment pro-gram to which the organization has a religious or moral objection. I cer-tainly agree, Mr. Chairman, that no or-ganization should be required to have anything to do with a program to which it has religious or moral objec-tions. However, I remain concerned that some organizations will use this clause to implement programs designed to undermine other HIV/AIDS preven-tion strategies, including effective condom use. I am also concerned that groups uti- lizing one approach to HIV/AIDS pre-vention and treatment will refuse to refer someone to another organization which offers a different method of HIV/AIDS prevention. Mr. Chairman, it is critically impor- tant that organizations which receive HIV/AIDS funds from the United States work closely and collaboratively sup-porting each other's work. Abstinence- only groups should not use United States' funds to tell men and women in Uganda that condoms do not work and are morally wrong and condoms-only groups should not use U.S. funds to denigrate abstinence. Mr. Chairman, I greatly respect the work of faith-based organizations around the world, which are playing a critical role in battling HIV/AIDS; but until we clarify these questions, I can-not support the amendment in its cur-rent form. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH), whether he would be willing to add the following words at the end of his amendment by unani-mous consent: ''Except that such orga-nization may not undermine interven-tions that it does not endorse, utilize or participate in.'' Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LANTOS. I yield to the gen- tleman from New Jersey. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I thank my friend, and with all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ), I would have to respectfully decline. Earlier we had spoken, and the gen- tleman had indicated he wanted to do a colloquy on identical language. The problem is the word ''undermine.'' If a group opposes a certain type of preven-tion such as condom use that could be construed in the eyes of someone who is making a grant or letting a grant, that organization should not get fund-ed. The proposed Lantos language nul-lifies any conscience clause so I must reject it. Our hope with our amendment is that we empower the maximum army of vol-unteers and professional people to care and assist people who are at risk of HIV/AIDS as well as people who have already contracted this horrific dis-ease. We should not limit our response to this crisis; we need to have a more flexible response. Be reminded, we are talking about grant money. So it is still up to the grantor\u2014the United States Government\u2014to decide whether or not the grant request that we are in receipt of meets the criteria in terms of what the project is all about, wheth-er it be dealing with actual treatment of AIDS patients or hospice care or some prevention strategy or mother to child transmission initiatives. So with all due respect, I would have to decline. Mr. LANTOS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend from New Jersey for his very clear answer. Mr. Chairman, the sponsor's unwill- ingness to make this clarification makes me even more concerned about the amendment as it is drafted. I be-lieve that this amendment could be used by some organizations to under-mine and denigrate the effective use of condoms and other HIV prevention strategies overseas. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3611 May 1, 2003 Mr. Chairman, use of condoms is an effective way to prevent HIV/AIDS. If we allow this clause, conceivably sci-entific misinformation could be dis-seminated and it would undermine a proven prevention strategy, which means people would die. I must, there-fore, reluctantly oppose the passage of the Smith amendment and ask all of my colleagues to join me in voting ''no.'' Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. R ENZI), one of the sponsors of the amendment. Mr. RENZI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding me this time, and I am grate-ful for his leadership on this important amendment. It is said to those that have been given much, much will be expected. It is with this sense of duty and obliga-tion that the President has turned the Nation's attention, America's atten-tion, to the realization that our Nation can use a portion of its wealth to help eradicate the devastating effects of AIDS in some of the most impoverished portions and regions of our world. Yet without passage of the Smith amendment, certain worthy organiza-tions, who have proven themselves suc-cessful in taking on this fight, organi-zations who have been there from day one on the front lines, would not qual-ify, possibly would be disqualified if they have moral or religious objections to just one part of a three-part strat-egy. This amendment makes necessary distinctions which ensure that faith-based organizations can continue to educate and change people's hearts, minds, and souls towards a more moral way of life. While it has been said they under- mine, the fact is, again, reiterating, these faith-based organizations, par-ticularly the Catholic-based organiza-tions, care for one out of every four AIDS sufferers in the world. I urge sup-port of the amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentle-woman from California (Ms. L EE), and I ask unanimous consent that she be al-lowed to control that time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. D UNCAN ). Without objection, the gen- tlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) is recognized for the balance of the time. There was no objection. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment offered by my col-league, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH). Early on in the drafting of this bill, we decided really not to let ideology drive the process and drive the contents of this bill. I believe, as our ranking member said, that the lan-guage we worked on and negotiated in committee addresses the issues and concerns raised in this amendment, and it addresses it quite well. Now, it seems to me, quite frankly, that social conservatives are looking at a way to carve out a specific exemp-tion. All of us support faith-based orga-nizations, but it looks like one group of individuals in this country wants to carve out for religious organizations a specific exemption. The amendment looks tame on its face, but I really think there is another motive behind this amendment. I do not believe that we should sub- ject this very important piece of legis-lation to the ideological whims of ei-ther side. The compromise that we ne-gotiated in the bill was specifically in-tended to avoid this. Both sides made some major concessions with an under-standing that the needs of those who are living and dying with AIDS would trump our political differences. It ap-pears now that this amendment would give an organization the ability to af-firmatively tell those suffering and dying of AIDS not to use one method over another. This could be deadly. Now, there were several amendments that I would have offered to shape the bill more to my liking, more to many of my colleagues' liking on our side; but we refrained from doing this be-cause we felt quite strongly that the delicate balance established in the bill should not be upset. So I would encour-age Members to oppose this amend-ment. The language in the bill is very clear with regard to faith-based organi-zations, and I ask the gentleman to withdraw his amendment. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH). Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, first of all, I just want to make it very clear, and I wish the gentlewoman had not gone the route of saying there is another motive here. The motive\u2014my motive\u2014is to say that there are a vast array of other people who are very competent in mitigating this crisis called AIDS, and maybe even ending it some day who are on the ground pro-viding essential services as we speak. Others\u2014if the wherewithal exists\u2014will soon join them. I mentioned Catholic Relief Services earlier in the debate. Catholic Relief Services, today, provides HIV/AIDS services to 2 million people. They do it without a brass band or self promoting press releases and are very much underheralded. These saints who care for the afflicted are on the ground, vil-lage after village, heavily embedded in Africa, helping people with this hor-rible scourge and helping the people who are trying to cope with it and pre-vent it. Catholic Relief Services is made up of the most caring and com-passionate people on earth. Let's hope they apply for more funding. I mentioned earlier the one case of a diocese, five dioceses in Uganda in the 1990s that had hoped to develop an AIDS plan with some funding aug-mented by the United States Govern-ment. And because the organization said they did not want to embrace the condom part, they were precluded from U.S. funding. So there is a real world tragedy and dark consequence as a di-rect result of not having an air-tight conscience clause. Again, we can fund condoms till the cows come home in this bill; but we are saying there are providers among the best an earth\u2014the CRS\u2014who are deep-ly respected in the community, with access to the at risk populations, yet who would not get funding without real conscience clause protection. Catholic and Muslim groups are the ones we are mostly talking about, and it seems to me that it is counterproductive in the extreme to everything we are trying to do here\u2014to prevent their full participa-tion. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self the balance of my time, and I thank the gentleman for his comments, but let me just say that the language that was negotiated that is in the base bill, in the bill before us today, takes care of all of the issues that we care about in terms of allowing for a multi-faceted, multisectoral approach to ad-dressing this pandemic. What we do not want to do, and what I believe will happen with the gentle-man's amendment, is that organiza-tions now will be allowed to say ''do not use one method versus the other.'' We crafted the language in a way that would allow organizations, if for what-ever reasons decided that they were not going to promote abstinence, to be faithful, or condom use, that they would not necessarily have to promote it. b1415 But what I believe the gentleman's amendment will do will be to allow or-ganizations to tell individuals that one approach is not going to work, or there is danger in an approach that allows for the distribution of condoms. I think that is downright wrong. The ABC ap-proach is the approach that works. Or-ganizations can choose whichever ap-proach they want to address. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. P ENCE ). Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Smith amend-ment. Mr. Chairman, in Congress we talk. It is what we do. But in Africa at this very hour, as the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH) just said with pas- sion, there are Catholic Relief workers and Christian missionaries in medical missions elbow deep in a crisis that has struck 42 million souls and rising, the VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3612 May 1, 2003 AIDS pandemic. Only by passing the Smith amendment will we make cer-tain that not only those who would be willing to come to the aid of people, but the overwhelming majority of those who are thanklessly, and without the klieg lights of publicity or public support, are coming to their aid at this very hour. Only by creating a conscience excep- tion for faith-based organizations to say that they can accept some of this $15 billion that will avalanche from Washington, D.C. into Africa without violating their own moral conscience, will we ensure that those who do the work continue. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ). Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, I am on the floor here today to support an amendment that will simply clarify ex-isting language in this bill. Our amend-ment is short and simple. It says that otherwise qualified organizations shall not be required as a condition of re-ceiving assistance to endorse, utilize or participate in a prevention method or treatment program to which the orga-nization has a religious or moral objec-tion. We should all be working together, Muslims and Catholics, to fight AIDS. In fact, Catholic organizations alone are caring for one in every four AIDS victims in the world. It makes no sense to disqualify them. Our language will give organizations of all faith an opportunity to join in this monumental effort to fight the pandemic. This provision will make sure that we do not arbitrarily dis-qualify organizations that have proven their ability to provide excellent care to those afflicted with this dreaded dis-ease. I congratulate my colleagues for joining together to address this trag-edy that can no longer be ignored. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS). Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this conscience protection amendment. Faith-based organizations are often the most effective in pre-venting the spread of HIV; and despite their effectiveness in caring for mil-lions with the disease and working to prevent the spread of it, many relief or-ganizations continue to disregard the right of faith-based organizations to object to condom distribution. In the hearing we had, we cited the quotations from the U.N. representa-tives in this regard. This amendment will provide protection for faith-based groups, like the Catholic Church, who apply for Federal funds but who object to distributing condoms as a form of HIV prevention. It is meant to make sure that we do not arbitrarily dis-qualify any organization from one part of our strategy because they do not participate in another. We should have the best organiza- tions working within our overall plan on parts of the plan that they do best. We should not discriminate against or- ganizations that are saving lives. I urge Members to support the amend-ment. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair- man, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) to close debate on the bill. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN ). The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, this is an effort to make the army in opposition, the army that is fighting AIDS as in-clusive as possible. Just think for a moment, put biases aside. Here is an organization that takes care of 1 in 4 people afflicted with AIDS, the Catho-lic Relief Services. Without this amendment, they stand very much in jeopardy of being excluded from this program. Why should we hobble our-selves as we are attacking the deadly scourge of AIDS? There are religious people who do not believe in condoms who can teach, who can go from village to village admin-istering medicines. There are so many things that need to be done on the human level, and why should we ex-clude them because they have moral scruples against condoms. This is a 3-part attack: Abstinence, as well as being faithful and using condoms. We can certainly do some good teaching abstinence, teaching fidelity in the family, and many other creature com-forts that can be administered by Mus-lim groups that do not support condoms. Why exclude people from this force that is going to attack AIDS? I think it is irrational. The purpose of the bill is to get as many forces to-gether to attack AIDS. If we exclude people because they do not believe in condoms, we are tying our hands and it is a big mistake. I hope this amend-ment passes. It in no way at this di-minishes the efficacy of this bill. It simply says there are people who do not subscribe to the ''C'' of the ABC, but they do to the ''A'' and ''B,'' and we need all of the people we can muster in this struggle. I hope the Smith amendment passes. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time has expired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 108-80. AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MR . PITTS Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 11 offered by Mr. P ITTS: Page 83, line 10, insert before the semicolon the following: '', of which such amount at least 33 percent should be expended for absti-nence-until-marriage programs''. Page 83, line 22, add at the end the fol- lowing new sentence: ''For fiscal years 2006 through 2008, not less than 33 percent of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the au-thorization of appropriations under section 401 for HIV/AIDS prevention consistent with section 104A(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by section 301 of this Act) for each such fiscal year shall be expended for abstinence-until-marriage programs.''. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 210, the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS) and a Member opposed each will con-trol 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS). Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1298 endorses Uganda's ABC model that focuses on abstinence, but it does not ensure that money is actually directed to absti-nence programs. Abstinence works. In Uganda, which has been cited as the ABC model, ''A'' for abstinence first; ''B'' for being faithful to one partner; and ''C,'' condom use, and this focus on absti-nence first lowered HIV infection rates from 21 percent in 1991 to 6 percent in 2000. The ABC model saves lives, and this amendment will ensure that these funds save more lives by moving tax-payer dollars to life-saving strategies that have been proven to work. It mandates a percentage: 33 percent of the prevention funds disbursed under the bill for abstinence. Now that is not all of the bill, that is just prevention funds, and one-third of those. Other countries have begun imple- mentation of the ABC model and are already showing great success, as they did dramatically in Uganda. But coun-tries like Kenya, which have stuck mainly to the social marketing of condoms, are experiencing huge in-creases in HIV prevalence rates, and this amendment takes that fact seri-ously. It makes sense to guarantee that this money will fund what works. This amendment makes sure that there is sufficient flexibility for the AIDS coor-dinator. It only mandates 33 percent of the prevention funds to go to absti-nence. It leaves the remaining 67 per-cent of prevention money to be dis-bursed as the coordinator sees fit. Opponents claim that abstinence just is not possible. Dr. Edward Green, a re-searcher at Harvard University was an opponent of the ABC model, in par-ticular abstinence, until he saw what happened in Uganda. He testified before the Committee on Energy and Com-merce, and he said, ''Many of us in the AIDS and public health communities did not believe that abstinence, or delay, and faithfulness, were realistic goals. It now seems we were wrong.'' In Uganda the proportion of young males age 15 to 24 reporting premarital sex decreased from 60 percent in 1989 to 23 percent in 1995. For females, the de-cline was 53 percent to 16 percent. The program actually changed the behavior in women and men, a fact I hope my colleagues take seriously. This amendment will make sure that funds get to what works. It maintains VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3613 May 1, 2003 flexibility, makes the bill better. It will save lives. I urge Members to sup-port this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS) is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I had the honor on Tuesday to join Senators L UGAR and BIDEN and the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) at the White House as the President called for Congress to quickly approve comprehensive HIV/AIDS legislation. The President has since announced his strong support for our bill. When the President spoke to us, he asked that Congress make the ABC strategy used in Uganda and else-where as the model for our prevention efforts. I could not agree more with the President. To quote him, ''The ABC strategy is effective by emphasizing abstinence, marital fidelity as well as condoms to prevent HIV trans-mission.'' Mr. Chairman, I quote President Bush on the ABC strategy because there is some confusion in Washington as to what it means. Some Members of Congress attribute the dramatic suc-cess of Uganda's HIV/AIDS prevention program solely to abstinence and mar-ital fidelity programs. While these components of the ABC strategy have been effective, Ugandans also use an average of 80 million condoms per year, and that figure is increasing. While I certainly respect the fact that some religions may have moral objections to the use of condoms, many other faiths actively promote their use as a medically proven way to stop the transmission of HIV. The legislation before us explicitly authorizes the use of funds to promote programs which promote abstinence and faithfulness. However, the Pitts amendment would require that one-third of the HIV/AIDS prevention funds be set aside for the exclusive use of abstinence before mar-riage programs. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the Presi- dent of the United States. The ABC ap-proach does work, but the Pitts amend-ment undermines the ABC approach by earmarking funds solely for the absti-nence program. The Pitts amendment also raises a whole series of very dis-turbing questions to which we have been given no answers. b1430 Does the Pitts amendment seek to replicate certain abstinence-only pro-grams under which educators are ex-plicitly prohibited from giving full and complete information about condoms to high-risk populations? Under these abstinence set-aside programs, will people who are already sexually active be given any information about condoms? Will any information pro-vided about condoms be medically ac-curate and complete? Will faith-based groups such as the Anglican Church of Uganda be eligible to receive these ab-stinence funds if their priests discuss condom use in the context of absti-nence education? Do abstinence pro-grams that are part of a multisectoral approach count towards this set-aside? And questions along these lines too nu-merous to mention. Mr. Chairman, all of these questions remain unanswered. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to support the ABC approach to HIV/AIDS prevention and to oppose the Pitts amendment. I also want to call my colleagues' attention to the fact that today in an editorial, the Washington Times, no liberal pub-lication, says, ''The revision expected to be offered by Representative Joe Pitts, Pennsylvania Republican, which would set aside up to one third of the money specifically for abstinence and monogamy programs, seems less wise since such decisions should be made by the experts in the field.'' I fully agree on this issue with the Washington Times, the President of the United States, and the experts working in the field; and I urge all of my colleagues to reject the Pitts amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, the Ugan- da model was developed by Ugandans themselves. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. W ELDON ). Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in strong support of the Pitts amendment. According to the World Health Organization data, absti-nence education programs work to re-duce the premarital sex rate for Ugan-dan males, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania earlier said, in 1989 60 percent to 23 percent. For females the decline was 53 percent to 16 percent. The proportion of males reporting three or more sexual partners fell from 15 percent to 3 percent. With each suc-cessive sexual partner one has, their probability of contracting HIV goes up proportionally and by reducing the in-come of sexual partners, increasing the age of sexual debut, by increasing the incidence of abstinence before mar-riage, faithfulness in marriage, the rate in Uganda declined by half. I think this is a very modest amend- ment. I actually think we should be putting substantially more money than he is proposing into abstinence edu-cation because it has been shown sci-entifically to be the most effective way and cost-effective way to prevent the spread of this disease. I strongly urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Pitts amend-ment, a very well-thought-out amend-ment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L EE), who has led this fight on our side. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS) for yielding me this time. I rise in strong and very vigorous op- position to this amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE). Again, we see attempts to unravel the delicate compromise estab-lished by our negotiations on this bill. We have already dealt with this issue in another forum in the Committee on International Relations when the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS) pushed for the prioritization of absti-nence over condom use in the ABC model of prevention. Abstinence, fidel-ity, and the use of condoms should all be placed on equal footing; and that is what we agreed to in committee. So I hope that we similarly defeat this amendment. Even the Washington Times, as the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. L ANTOS ) points out, agrees that a balanced approach should be im-plemented and should be part of this bill. The Uganda model is based upon the ABC approach, which is prevention, ab-stinence, and condoms. In fact, the former director of the largest organiza-tion in Uganda dealing with HIV and AIDS treatment says that that is what has worked and that it is wrong for those who want only one approach to pull out one element of a bigger pic-ture. And she said this is a very small percentage of the whole picture. What works is what worked in Uganda, and that is abstinence, be faithful, condoms; and that is the only strategy that makes sense. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Colo-rado (Mrs. M USGRAVE ). Mrs. MUSGRAVE. Mr. Chairman, as we look at a disaster such as this, it is hard to comprehend the misery and the suffering. We look at women and the children and the men that are dying such horrible deaths, and it is hard to take it all in. But what we look for in Africa is a ray of hope, a ray of hope for these people; and we see this ray of hope in Uganda. And we see a ray of hope with abstinence education. Absti-nence is not just a moral issue. It is an issue of whether or not we will teach people what the healthy life-style is. If we are compassionate about the people in Africa, if our hearts go out to the people that are dying, that are in in-credible suffering and misery, we want to do something that works. We want to have something that will give these people hope, that will give them life; and I am in strong support of this amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs. C HRISTENSEN ). Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. My colleagues and the chairman have worked very hard to en-sure a proven approach to HIV and AIDS funding which is based on the successful Ugandan model. The Presi-dent himself has seen the wisdom of this approach and supports it. We agree that abstinence is a great approach, VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3614 May 1, 2003 but it cannot be used alone, and it can- not be dictated where it absolutely cannot work. And where it works best is in a comprehensive educational pro-gram. Our own CDC experience attests to this; and as a family physician who has worked in family planning and HIV and AIDS, I know this is the best ap-proach. It is the one that delays sexual activity, reduces partners, and more importantly saves lives. I strongly urge all of my colleagues, no matter what their personal or reli-gious convictions might be, not to im-pose them on others but to allow these funds that are so very important to the lives of millions of people to be used how and where they can be most effec-tive. And this needs to be done globally as well as in our domestic programs. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and do a great thing here today by passing H.R. 1298 with the good amendments that have already been passed. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. P ENCE ). (Mr. P ENCE asked and was given per- mission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Pitts amend-ment, and along with the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), ranking member, whom I have labored with on other issues and will labor still, I was there in the East Room of the White House when the President of the United States described a compelling and compassionate vision for address-ing this pandemic AIDS crisis in Afri-ca. The President insisted that we not just send billions of dollars to Africa, but we send values that work; and he encouraged us in this Congress to put a priority on the values of abstinence and monogamy before condom distribu-tion in that room. In fact, in a state-ment of administration policy, Mr. Chairman, the administration said they, quote, ''support additional provi-sions that would prioritize the absti-nence component of the ABC approach which has been successfully imple-mented in Uganda.'' The administration supports the Pitts amendment; and those who would embrace this vision of abstinence and endorsement of faithfulness in mar-riage and then condom distribution must, and by all means should, support the Pitts amendment to this bill. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. L OWEY ). (Mrs. LOWEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment. Ab-stinence or monogamy or condom use, it just does not work. What worked in Uganda was abstinence and be faithful and condom use. It is essential to pur-sue all approaches to prevention. Pro-mote and value abstinence, encourage monogamy in both men and women, and teach that lifesaving use of condoms works. Using all three op-tions, men and women can be ap-proached differently according to the cultural values of a village or religion or a region. United States policy re-flects that by funding faith-based orga-nizations as well as secular organiza-tions that may focus on one area or health concern. Abstinence, be faithful and condom use worked in Uganda. Each approach is different, and may be suit- able at different stages in life. But each ap-proach can and does work together. Many of us believe that abstinence is most realistic in the years before sexual activity be-gins\u2014because it can delay sexual activity, and that's important. But abstinence may not be an appropriate message for a girl who has no say in the extent of her sexual activity. Once sexual activity begins\u2014keeping in mind that the sexual activity may not be con-sensual\u2014it's critical that accurate information about condoms and other prevention methods be available, to limit exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. It is essential to pursue all approaches to prevention. Promote and value abstinence, en-courage monogamy in both men and women and teach the life saving use of condoms. And, if married, monogamy is both a social and a public health value, and it should be strongly promoted for both men and women. Using all three options, men and women can be approached differently, according to the cultural values of a village, a religion, or a region. U.S. policy reflects that, by funding faith-based organizations as well as secular organizations that may focus on one area or health concern. Many Members have spoken about Uganda, a country in east central Africa. But I want to focus on another part of Africa\u2014the West Afri-can region, and the countries of Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. About 10 percent of the population in each of these countries is in-fected with HIV. In both countries, the health care infrastruc- ture is poor and strained\u201418 months ago, Cote d'Ivoire was in better shape than Burkina Faso, but the civil war has had a devastating impact on its health care sector. In Burkina Faso, a HIV diagnosis has been akin to a death certificate, because there has been no access to treatment at all. In these countries, it's not uncommon to ar- rive in a village and see that the local busi-ness is coffinmaking. In these countries, it's not unusual to see children who are raising each other because there are no parents. In West Africa, many villages are politically, culturally, and economically dominated by men. Women are married as young as 12 or 13, and begin bearing children immediately. The cultural values of these villages enforce monogamy for women, but positively encour-age men to have multiple partners. Men make all the decisions, and the community rein-forces that tradition. Economic realities also impact behavior. Men often travel to find employment\u2014even work in another country, hitchhiking up and down major roadways, looking for work in trade centers where prostitutes gather. He might be away for months, or seasons, at a time. Whether single or married, these men often have sexual encounters while on the road, and subsequently bring HIV into their home villages. In fact, HIV can be tracked from cities, to major highways, and into completely rural, iso-lated villages, simply by following the travels of the men who call those villages home. Many women in Africa infected with HIV were abstinent before marriage, and monogamous in it, and yet still they are wast-ing away from AIDS. That's today's reality. And to combat that re- ality, we believe it's essential to pursue all ap-proached to prevention\u2014promote and value abstinence, encourage monogamy in both men and women, and teach about the life-sav-ing use of condoms. Each of those approaches involves edu- cation. People must learn that it's possible to refuse sexual activity. And if refusing isn't real-istic, they can learn to negotiate with their partner to wear a condom. In West Africa, health workers put on plays for villages and at trading centers, to show an audience gathered by music and comedy how a wife might per-suade her husband to wear a condom, or how a migrant worker can use condoms to protect himself\u2014and his wife\u2014from devastating dis-ease. Villagers of all ages, men and women, attend. Local cafes offer condoms, alongside information about monogamy and abstinence. This kind of education is respectful of local tradition, but it's also appropriate to the public health emergency that is AIDS in Africa. It will take years of sustained effort to make it easier for women to negotiate more equally with men, because it's an issue that goes well be-yond sexual relationships. It will take years of effort to end prostitution as a means of sup-porting a family, because in some places, it's all there is. While these societies work to change be- havior, and the world unites to help them\u2014young women bear 5, 6, 7 children in rapid succession by a husband who may have in-fected her with HIV. Again, she's married, she's faithful . . . she's dying. We can have it all\u2014we can have monog- amy and condoms, we can have abstinence before marriage and access to condoms too. It's just a matter of deciding that saving lives matters more than how it's done. Because abstinence works. Monogamy works. Condom use works. Together. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. R YUN). Mr. RYUN of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, the global HIV epidemic issue cannot and must not be ignored. People are dying from this disease, and we know how to help them. Our duty is to pro-mote good public policy that saves lives, and we have an opportunity today to do that. As we look for the method of reducing HIV/AIDS infection rate, we have to look no further than to Uganda to find a very successful pro-gram. Uganda has led the way in dras-tically reducing its infection rate of HIV/AIDS from 21 percent in 1991 to 5 percent in 2001. This has been accom-plished through the ABC program, a model of behavior that we need to fol-low. First of all, abstinence; second, be faithful; and, third, using a condom. The stunning drop in HIV proves that VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3615 May 1, 2003 the behavior can change and save lives, and I encourage my colleagues to sup-port this Pitts amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. G REEN - WOOD ). (Mr. GREENWOOD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GREENWOOD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I agree with my colleague from Penn- sylvania on the value of abstinence. I would be opposed to a penny of this money going to any program that did not preach and teach abstinence. It is absolutely necessary. My concern with the amendment is it would allow money to go to programs that do absti-nence only. The problem with that, and I have friends from Africa who are with us today who have just explained to us, if we take a woman whose husband has contracted HIV and she needs a condom and the only program in her community is a program that simply does abstinence and nothing else, then we have done nothing for her and it will cost her her life, and it will cost the lives of the children that she bears. If every program provided abstinence, I would be for the Pitts amendment com-pletely. But the Pitts amendment, by allowing a third of the money to go to programs that provide abstinence, will allow programs that provide abstinence only and that certainly is insufficient, as everyone has agreed. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Mis-souri (Mr. A KIN). Mr. AKIN. Mr. Chairman, I think we all serve here with the same purpose. Each of us in our own hearts would like somehow to make the world a better place and we have before us an amend-ment, and the technology of this amendment is very straightforward. It is very simple. Abstinence is the only tool we have that works 100 percent. So it is not a matter of whether we like the morality of abstinence or not. The fact is that technology-wise it works. It is the only thing that is 100 percent effective. We are only talking about one third of the money. So we could pass a law here to repeal the law of gravity, but it would not do us much good. The scientific fact is a flat fact that abstinence works, and that is why we have to use the very best tool with at least a portion of this money to deal with this serious crisis. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. C UMMINGS ), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Pitts amend-ment which detracts from this con-sensus bill. This bill endorses the successful ABC Ugandan model of abstinence, be faith-ful, and condom. This system works, and it should be the only prevention program that receives funding. The Pitts amendments would devote 33 per-cent of precious prevention resources to disproportionately fund an absti-nence-until-marriage model that has not proven to be effective. Mr. Chairman, we do not have time to play Russian Roulette with millions of lives while testing politically charged prevention methods. In fact, a 2001 report issued by the National In-stitutes of Health concluded that be-yond mutual lifelong monogamy among uninfected couples, condom use is the only method for reducing the risk of HIV infection and STDs avail-able to sexually active individuals. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Lou-isiana (Mr. T AUZIN ), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Pitts amend-ment. The Federal program on abstinence is not a mandated program on the States. In fact, States have to put up dollars to get into the abstinence program. And States readily do. Do my colleagues know why? Because it works. We have heard story after story after story be-fore the Committee on Energy and Commerce that abstinence works. Not only does it help prevent the kinds of disease we are talking about, but it lit-erally is the best way to make sure that other venereal diseases are not spread and other cases of awful calam-ity are avoided for young women as they are growing up. b1445 We learned, for example, that condoms do not stop the spread of many new venereal diseases that are viral in nature, and nevertheless ruin a woman's chance of reproduction as they grow up and try to become young married women and have a family. We learned a great deal in the Com- mittee on Energy and Commerce. The most important thing we learned is that abstinence works. It works in our States, it works in this country, and it can work in this program. The second thing to keep in mind is that every time we have promoted ab-stinence programs in this country, the argument on the other side is absti-nence-only should not be the deal. This is not abstinence-only, this is absti-nence as one-third of the program. I urge Members to support the Pitts amendment. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I am de- lighted and honored to yield the bal-ance of my time to my good friend and neighbor, the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. P ELOSI ), the distinguished Democratic Leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Pitts amend-ment. First I want to commend the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. L AN- TOS), for the strong, and effective bi- partisan bill they produced in the Com-mittee on International Relations. I also want to acknowledge the tire- less efforts of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE), who has fought for years to strengthen our efforts in the fight against the AIDS pandemic, both domestically and internationally. We know the statistics. They are staggering, and they should move us to action. Every day, over 16,000 people become infected with HIV, primarily in the developing world. This crisis is too severe and our response is too impor-tant to let our efforts be undermined by politics. We must support what works. We are talking about saving lives. If we do, ex-perts say that a strong global response could prevent nearly two-thirds of the 45 million new infections that are pro-jected by 2020, saving tens of millions of lives. The successes are there for us to rep- licate. We can look to Uganda as a model and for inspiration. We can learn a lot from their experience. Over the past decade, Uganda's infection rates have dropped from 30 percent to 5 per-cent. It can be done. This success was achieved using the model of prevention that is a key component of the Hyde-Lantos bill, a model that gives equal weight to the full range of options and relies on the best scientific informa-tion. H.R. 1298 is not anti-abstinence. It supports a balanced approach to HIV-AIDS prevention. This is a debate about whether or not we use the model that has been effective in Uganda and that gives flexibility to those fighting this disease on the ground. In July 2001, NIH confirmed the effec- tiveness of condoms in preventing HIV transmission. The Pitts amendment asks us to abandon what we know and has been proven to work. H.R. 1298 is a bipartisan bill that we can all proudly support. It is a bill that President Bush supports. Why sacrifice that broad support in the name of poli-tics, especially when so many lives are at stake? Keeping information from people does not keep them safe. And when that information is about AIDS, it can be a death sentence. I strongly urge my colleagues to op- pose the Pitts amendment and to sup-port the original Hyde-Lantos bill, and again commend the gentleman from Il-linois (Mr. H YDE), the distinguished chairman, the very distinguished chair-man, the about-to-have-his-picture-un-veiled chairman, and the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ), for their very important contribution to saving lives. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. D UNCAN ). All time of the gentleman from California (Mr. L ANTOS ) has ex- pired. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. D ELAY), the distinguished majority leader. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, May 1, 2003 Mr. D ELAY. Mr. Chairman, I have heard a lot of speeches on this floor supporting the President's program and supporting ABC and the program of Uganda, yet being opposed to the Pitts amendment. The Pitts amend-ment is the Uganda program. It is the President's program. So we should sup-port the Pitts amendment because it is what the President is asking us to do. Every day, 2,000 more children are in- fected with the HIV/AIDS virus. Entire generations of communities in Sub-Sa-haran Africa are being obliterated by a preventible disease. AIDS in Africa is not just an epi- demic, it is an emergency. But there is something we can do about it. Presi-dent Bush, I wish Members on the other side of the aisle would listen, has called upon us to marshal the virtue and resources of the American people to help save a continent in crisis. This is his initiative, and, as such, our legis-lation should reflect his ideals for it. Mr. Chairman, abstinence-based pre- vention programs work, and the Presi-dent supports the Pitts amendment. After years of trial and error and re-search, the facts, and the striking suc-cess of Uganda's abstinence program, are very clear. No other method has produced the success rates or saved as many lives as Uganda's ABC approach. Because of this, the discovery of a new and effective weapon in the war against AIDS, the President has en-dorsed the Uganda model. So have ex-perts in the field, who were once skep-tical of abstinence as a solution. Despite the evidence, some still sus- pect proponents of abstinence-based prevention of simply being on a moral crusade. I would say in response that this entire bill is a moral crusade. Not to impose our values on anyone, but to save a continent of the Great Plague of our age. This debate is not about supporting one political agenda over another. It is about supporting proven methods of AIDS prevention over the failed poli-cies that have tragically contributed to the infection of 30 million Africans. The disease is running rampant across Sub-Saharan Africa, and the only places returning encouraging news are those nations committed to absti-nence-based prevention programs. It works, and we cannot let the fog of pol-itics obscure that fact. In Uganda, 10 years of the absti- nence-based approach have slowed the march of the disease, and in Zambia re-cent results are showing similar suc-cess. To meet the moral responsibility of this crisis, we must promote policies that work, not ones that have been proven failures. So, Mr. Chairman, I believe this amendment is a test of our seriousness about this issue. People are dying and politics will not save them. The United States has a real chance to do good in the world with this bill, but only if we do the job right. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE), the co- sponsor of this amendment, to close. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time of the gentleman from Pennsyl-vania has expired. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), the distin- guished chairman of the Committee on International Relations, be granted such time as he may consume to make a concluding statement. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. By unanimous consent, the Chair will pro-vide an equal amount of time on both sides. The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Needless to say, I am very moved by the generosity of my friend from Cali-fornia. Mr. Chairman, I have just a couple of simple thoughts in closing on the Pitts amendment. First of all, please note what the amendment actually does. It simply says 33 percent of the funds to be expended for prevention under this total program shall go to support ab-stinence. That is all it says. It does not downgrade or denigrate condoms or family fidelity, marital fidelity. It sim-ply says as we move forward in this war, do not forget abstinence, which is the one sure preventative for AIDS. One need not be a microbiologist to know that if abstinence were practiced, you would have far less of a serious problem. So, this amendment does not distort the balance of ABC. This amendment reinforces the balance by saying absti-nence, family fidelity and condoms, but to not forget abstinence. That is all it says. I hope those of you who are con- vinced with me that this is a bill that has to pass, that this is a statement that has to be made, will understand that this amendment does not distort the spirit nor the principle nor the thrust of our bill in chief. It actually reinforces the balance. I hope Members will support this so we can pass this bill this afternoon and say we did a great day's work. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE) has expired. All time of the gentleman from Penn- sylvania (Mr. P ITTS) has expired. The gentleman from California (Mr. LANTOS ) is recognized for 2 minutes under the unanimous consent request. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to my friend, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE). (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, with great respect for the chairman of this committee, I humbly oppose this amendment, because I do believe in abstinence and I believe in options, and I believe in options to save lives. We need to pass this legislation with the ABC in place and the flexi-bility in place in order to save lives. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. P ITTS and Mr. HYDE to H.R. 1298, the ''United States Lead- ership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.'' I oppose this amend-ment because it severely diminishes the flexi-bility and choices available to those suffering from infectious diseases by allocating funds to organizations that only promote abstinence until marriage programs. I am a strong proponent of the ABC Model used in Uganda. The elements of the ABC Model are: Abstinence, Being Faithful, and Condom use. The ABC Model recognizes that in communities worldwide, whether in sub-Sa-haran Africa, India, China, or the United States, there are different approaches and dif-ferent preferences for fighting HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. When the patient and the health care administrator cannot agree on the method of prevention, yet an-other life may be lost to HIV/AIDS. The amendment offered by Mr. P ITTS and Mr. H YDE will limit the prevention methods available to those suffering with infectious dis-eases. Organizations that only promote absti-nence and refuse to promote condom use deny those at risk with a reliable prevention tool. I agree with the sponsors of this amend-ment that abstinence is the only 100 percent effective means of preventing the transmission of infectious diseases, and should be fully en-dorsed by the House of Representatives as a prevention tool. However, for many in sub-Saharan Africa and around the world, abstinence is not a rea-sonable option. In the cases of those individ-uals, health care advocates should present several prevention methods as options. The ABC Model provides those options, the amendment sponsored by Mr. P ITTS and Mr. HYDEdoes not. I am a proponent of HIV/AIDS prevention. I am a proponent of abstinence, and I am a proponent of options, flexibility, and choice. The amendment offered by Mr. P ITTS and Mr. HYDE will allocate one-third of the funds allo- cated under H.R. 1298 to programs that do not promote condom use. By doing so, the amendment limits the infectious disease pre-vention options available to millions of people at risk to contract HIV/AIDS. I do not support limiting life-saving prevention methods to any-one at risk. For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment offered by Mr. P ITTS and Mr. HYDE, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues on all sides. Particularly I want to thank my friend, the gen-tleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE), I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. L EACH ) on the other side, and I want to pay tribute to the gentle-woman from California (Ms. L EE), who has done an outstanding job. We are on the verge of passing one of the most significant pieces of legisla-tion in this session. I am deeply grate-ful for the contribution of all of my VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3617 May 1, 2003 friends on the Republican and the Democratic side. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my opposition to the Pitts/Hyde amendment to H.R. 1298, the Global AIDS bill. The President's commitment to sup-porting Global AIDS outreach is commend-able, and this bill, without amendments, has the approval of the Bush Administration. It is widely supported by Republicans and Demo-crats. However, some of my colleagues want to ''improve'' this bill with a controversial amend-ment that further wages war against family planning and reproductive health. At the heart of my concern with the ''abstinence-only'' cur-ricula is its insistence that a ''mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity.'' This program emphasizes that sex outside of marriage is physically and psy-chologically harmful and should be avoided for these reasons. Abstinence-only education is simply not ef- fective. Many of the women who are infected with HIV/AIDS are in monogamous marital re-lationships. Abstinence education that elevates the marital relationship as the only place where sex is appropriate would still leave these women vulnerable to infection. Absti-nence education would also ignore the needs of women involved in the sex trade. Prostitu-tion is a reality in all parts of the world, and it is one of the most vicious vehicles for spreading diseases. The Pitts amendment would do nothing for these women and for the children they will bear. Abstinence-only education has been proven to be ineffective time and time again, while only truly comprehensive sex education really prevents unwanted pregnancies and deadly diseases. There is no scientific evidence that abstinence-only education is effective. Con-gress should not tie the hands of health care professionals as they attempt to stop the spread of AIDS. This discussion is about more than pro- moting ''proper'' sexual behavior. This is a matter of life and death. We should not be willing to gamble with the lives of millions of men, women, and children across the globe. It is pure common sense that if you are try- ing to prevent a disease, you apply the rem-edy that has been shown to work, rather than fueling millions of dollars into an idea that has been proven not to work. If what we care about is AIDS prevention, then we should put our money into programs, like the Ugandan ABC program, where it might actually be ef-fective. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time has expired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. P ITTS). The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. RECORDED VOTE Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I de- mand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered.

Mr. LINDER. The Committee on Rules may meet the week of May 5 to grant a rule which could limit the amendment process for floor consider-ation of H.R. 1261, the Workforce Rein-vestment and Adult Education Act of 2003. The Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered the bill reported on March 27, 2003, and filed the report with the House today, May 1, 2003. Any Member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies of the amendment and one copy of a brief explanation of the amendment to the Committee on Rules in room H-312 of the Capitol by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, May 6th. Members should draft their amend-ments to the text of the bill as re-ported by the Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is available for their review on the Web sites of both the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on Rules today. Members should use the Office of Legislative Counsel to ensure that their amendments are drafted in the most appropriate format. Members are also advised to check with the Office of the Parliamentarian to be certain their VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3619 May 1, 2003 amendments comply with the rules of the House. f REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1119 Mr. PETRI.

There was no objection. f LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. LEWIS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to inquire about the schedule for next week. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. I yield to the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the gentleman that the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 for morning hour and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday we may consider addi- tional bills under suspension of the rules, as well as H.R. 766, the Nanotechnology Research and Develop-ment Act. On Thursday and the bal-ance of the week, we plan to consider H.R. 1261, the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act and the Presi-dent's economic growth and jobs pack-age that the Committee on Ways and Means will mark up early next week. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for the in-formation, but I would like to have ad-ditional information, and I will con-tinue to yield for that information. Our side would be interested in know- ing will the tax bill come up next week? The gentleman is calling the economic growth proposal the tax bill, right? Mr. BLUNT. The President's eco- nomic growth bill, which will do things that stimulate the economy and create jobs by reducing people's tax burden, will come up next Friday. My under-standing is that the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means have reached an un-derstanding and will be marking that bill up on Tuesday, file the report on Thursday, and we will have floor action on that bill on Friday. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, could the gentleman tell us whether the minority side will be allowed to offer a substitute on the floor? Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I appre- ciate my friend's request. I think I should leave that up to the Committee on Rules, but tradition would certainly indicated that that would be normally the case. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. If we deal with the tax bill on Friday, does the gentleman think our work will be com-pleted 2 p.m. on Friday? Mr. BLUNT. We would hope to be done by 2 p.m. I hope as the week pro-gresses we may get agreement to start Friday an hour earlier, at 9, but that will be something we will work out with our friends on the other side dur-ing the week. And if that is the case, I do not see any reason to believe that we would not be done by 2 o'clock or so on Friday. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. On the Work- force Investment Act, will you allow a substitute on this bill on the floor? Mr. BLUNT. Again, I think that will be left up to the Committee on Rules. I think an announcement was just made about that Act by a member of Committee on Rules, and that will be a decision that they will make pursuant to the announcement that was just made.

Under the Speaker's an- nounced policy of January 7, 2003, and under a previous order of the House, the following Members will be recog-nized for 5 minutes each. f The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen- tleman from New Jersey (Mr. P ALLONE ) is recognized for 5 minutes. (Mr. PALLONE. addressed the House. His remarks will appear hereafter in the Extensions of Remarks.) f The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Indiana (Mr. B URTON ) is recognized for 5 minutes. (Mr. BURTON of Indiana. addressed the House. His remarks will appear hereafter in the Extensions of Re-marks.) f THE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER 2003 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from North Carolina (Mr. J ONES ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the National Day of Prayer. On the first Thursday of each May, people across our Nation gather together to pray to the God who is the very foundation of this great country. Without any court challenge or liberal protestors to avoid, praying Americans meet on courthouse steps, town squares, and in local parks to praise God for his blessing and ask God to continue to bless America. This year I can assure my colleagues that millions of prayers will be offered in appreciation for our men and women in uniform who have paid the highest price for our freedom. Yet even as we stand today in prayer for our heroes, there are those who stand against the freedom that we enjoy. Even though the Founding Fathers spoke of ''Nature's God'' and of the ''Creator'' in the Declaration of Inde-pendence, the Federal courts are in-creasingly trying to drive every vestige of faith from public life. Yesterday, April 30, was the most recent example, coming from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. And I will read from the Boston Globe, which said, ''Judges bar prayer at public colleges. In a prece-dent-setting ruling against prayer at a State college, a Federal appeals court has barred the Virginia Military Insti-tute from writing and reciting a prayer before cadets eat their evening meals.'' VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May May 1, 2003 In addition, Mr. Speaker, the Citadel, down in South Carolina, is reviewing its policy since that Federal court rul-ing. And also, Mr. Speaker, I hate to even mention this, but the academy in Annapolis is also reviewing its policy. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland is calling on the academy to review its practices of leading the stu-dents in prayer. Mr. Speaker, let me also share with my colleagues that it was just a few months ago that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to have ''under God'' taken from our Pledge of Alle-giance. How much longer will we stand by and allow others to ignore the very God upon whom our Nation was found-ed? Our Constitution demands the free-dom to worship freely; and our future leaders, our men and women in the military academies across the country, are now being denied the very freedom that many have died to ensure for all of us. Mr. Speaker, it is not just sad; it is completely detestable. And on this Na-tional Day of Prayer, let us honor our heroes, those who have returned home and those who sacrificed their lives, by standing against those liberals who would seek to challenge their God-given right to pray for a living Lord. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I believe this quote says it best, and it comes from the days of Jefferson and Adams. And the quote is this, Mr. Speaker: ''Reli-gion can survive in the absence of free-dom. But freedom without religion is dangerous and unstable.'' Mr. Speaker, I have three military bases in my district, Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point, and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. I want to close by ask-ing God to please bless our men and women in uniform and their families, and the families of those who have lost loved ones defending freedom in this country. I close by asking three times, ''God, please, God, please, God, please continue to bless America. f COMING HOME: WELCOMING OUR TROOPS WITH CUTS IN VET-ERANS PROGRAMS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from California (Mr. F ILNER ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my concern for the men and women of our armed services who will be returning and are returning from Iraq. My colleagues are aware that our troops were funded during the period of fighting last month at the rate of about $1 billion, $1 billion, every 2 or 3 days. Now, we did not want our troops to go without having everything that they needed for success, but if we have the money to send our troops to war, we must, Mr. Speaker, have the money for them when they return. To abandon them upon their return shows dis-respect for those who have willingly risked all when their Nation called them to serve. In the next few months, Congress will be voting on the veterans budget. The House Republican budget that came through this House was outrageous. It cut veterans benefits by $25 billion over the next 10 years, and they took that vote right after a resolution expressing support for our troops. Now, the final budget resolution we passed corrected some of the most glaring problems in that budget, but it is still $1 billion less for the health care for our veterans in the coming year. One billion dollars. That would fund approximately 5,000 doctors, 10,000 nurses, or three million additional outpatient visits. Over the next 10 years, the budget falls far short of what will be needed to keep up with inflation and with the growing number of veterans who were using the veterans health care system. We must fight during the appropriation process for a budget that is worthy of our returning veterans. We cannot ig-nore their rights and their needs. Vet-erans health care is one of the most important issues that we fund. We hope and pray that we do not have veterans from the current conflict who become ill with Gulf War illness, but we must prepare for that possi-bility. And we must not forget the war-riors of the first Gulf War who are sick, tens of thousands of them, and are still waiting to learn the cause and the cure for their illnesses. Of course, Mr. Speaker, we need to change the whole process of funding our veterans health care. Right now, each year in Congress, as we are doing this year, we have to fight for a health care budget. In the last session, there was legislation to change VA health care funding so that the amount of funding would automatically, auto-matically rise each year to accommo-date inflation and new enrollees, that is, for example, to accommodate the returning veterans from Iraq. I will again, and I urge all my colleagues, to cosponsor this bill when it is reintro-duced this session. And we must work hard for its passage. Right now, Mr. Speaker, 200,000 vet- erans are waiting more than 6 months for their first health care appointment. In fact, veterans will die while waiting for that first appointment. We must re-solve to change this immoral situation. When our active-duty soldiers from the war in Iraq leave service, many are qualified for educational benefits under the Montgomery GI bill. This is an earned benefit that allows them to re-enter civilian life as educated and pro-ductive members. But the current GI bill benefits are woefully inadequate to do the job. Back in 1944, this bill paid for the full cost of college tuition. But now it barely pays for two-thirds of the average cost of attending a 4-year pub-lic college. We must work to provide funding for the full cost of tuition fees, books, and supplies for those who do serve 4 years of active duty in the mili-tary service. I could go on and on, Mr. Speaker, because there are so many other areas that need more funding than is cur-rently budgeted. We will soon be com-memorating Memorial Day. We will be hearing words of support for our vet-erans from all Members of Congress as they speak to Memorial Day crowds. But words can be cheap. What is impor-tant is how we vote. We have the money. We have the re- sources. It is a question of priorities. It is a question of will. Let us make our veterans, who are returning from war, proud of us. There is one final thing I want to say. A substantive way we can assist our veterans is to guarantee them jobs with companies that are awarded gov-ernment contracts to rebuild Iraq, and I have introduced a bill to do just that. It is called the Let U.S. Veterans Re-build Iraq Act, which will treat our veterans with the respect they deserve and provide a tangible way to better their lives. They fought for freedom in Iraq, who better to get involved in se-curing the future for Iraq? f H.R. 361, THE SPORTS AGENT RE- SPONSIBILITY AND TRUST ACT (SPARTA) The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Nebraska (Mr. O SBORNE ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. OSBORNE. Mr. Speaker, last weekend, the National Football League draft was conducted. Over 200 players were selected in the draft. Each player eventually will be represented by an agent. The difficult thing is that many of these people who call themselves agents have no special qualifications. We find that many of them have no legal training, no expertise in writing contracts, some misrepresent them-selves, some offer illegal inducements, particularly to undergraduates, such as cars, cash, clothes, and sometimes even drugs, to get young people to commit to a contract while they still have eli-gibility, which makes them ineligible, of course. A few even have criminal records. Most of them will tell a player that they will get them drafted higher. The NFL committee will say, well, you are going to be a fourth-round pick; and these agents say, well, if you come with me, I will get you a trainer and a nutritionist, and we will make you a first-round pick, which obviously does not happen. And then some even get the power of attorney, which some-times bankrupts these individuals. The National Football League Play- ers Association currently says that roughly one-half of the players leaving the National Football League have no money. The minimum salary is several hundred thousand dollars. Some guys make millions of dollars; some sign for $10 million or $11 million. Yet at the end of their career, nearly one-half have no money left. A lot of that is due simply to the issue of the way they are treated by their agents. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:13 May 02, H3621 May 1, 2003 Every coach and athletic director that I know says this is a huge problem and that we need some type of uniform standards and regulations to govern sports agents. One of the biggest prob-lems that we have is these people come on the campus and nobody knows they are there. They see the players in the dorms; they harass them and call them on the phone. Some of the better play-ers end up having to get unlisted phone numbers because of all the harassment. Currently, Mr. Speaker, there are only 15 States that have tough laws regulating actions by sports agents. There are 17 States, including my home State of Nebraska, that have no laws at all regulating sports agents, and then there are 18 States remaining that have some laws. It is kind of a hodge-podge, a patchwork; and there is no consistency and no teeth in the regula-tions. So the majority of young people coming out of college really are not protected by any laws that would gov-ern sports agents. With this problem in mind, the gen- tleman from Tennessee (Mr. G ORDON ) and I have introduced H.R. 361, the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act, which is also known as SPARTA. SPARTA protects student athletes by making it illegal for sports agents to entice student athletes with false or misleading information, promises, or representations in order to lure them into a contract. SPARTA would pro-tect student athletes when they travel to other States. Some student athletes are in States with some laws, but once they go home for the summer in another State or go to a bowl game, sometimes they are preyed upon by sports agents in those areas. So this provides a uniform Fed-eral backstop. It does not supplant State laws, and we feel it is a very sound piece of legislation. As of April 2002, the National Foot- ball League Players Association re-ported 1,200 certified football agents. Eight hundred of those represent no clients. Now, those are the guys that are really not very well qualified, and they are particularly dangerous be-cause they are desperate to represent somebody. So they will make almost any kind of a deal, any kind of a prom-ise to get someone committed. We think, of course, that this is obvi- ously a huge problem. But let me just cite two cases from my own experience. One: we were getting on the bus to go to the Orange Bowl, and I could not find my quarterback two hours before kickoff. I finally located him in one corner of the lobby cornered by two agents that he had never seen before, I had never heard of before, and were ob-viously unscrupulous; and they are hammering this guy to try to get him to sign a contract right before a kick-off. Well, of course, this did not do the quarterback any good, and it did not do me any good either. In one other case we had a young man who was contacted at his home during the summer and he signed a contract. He did not really understand what he signed, but buried in the fine print was a 13 percent commission for the agent. So the agent got several hundred thousand dollars from this young man. Fortunately, the agent was from a State that did have some laws governing agents, and this agent had not registered. So we were able to re-cover $300,000 of this young man's money because of some sports agent legislation. So what we are saying is we need this kind of protection for all athletes in all States. It is a Federal backstop. We think this is sound legislation, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 361, the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act. f The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from the District of Columbia (Ms. N ORTON ) is recognized for 5 min- utes. (Ms. NORTON. addressed the House. Her remarks will appear hereafter in the Extensions of Remarks.) f PEACE RETURNS TO VIEQUES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. A CEVEDO -VILA\u00b4) is recognized for 5 min- utes. Mr. ACEVEDO-VILA \u00b4. Mr. Speaker, a couple of years ago, I met a young girl from Vieques by the name of Marakiani Olivencia. She came up to me with a small container of sand in her hand and shared with me her desire to return that sand to Vieques with me after the Navy bombing practices ended. With passion and sincerity this girl represented what so many had felt for so long. I told her that sooner or later such a day would come, and we would return that sand to Vieques together. b1600 Indeed, such a day is upon us. As of today, Vieques is no longer a Navy bombing range, and has become the newest addition to the National Wild-life Refuge System. I have with me a copy of the letter and memorandum of agreement signed between the Navy and the Fish and Wildlife Service mak-ing official that land transfer and ask that it be made part of the R ECORD . For the first time in over 60 years, Viequeses awoke this morning, their is-land not having been bombed last night, the island not to be bombed today, and knowing for certain that the island shall never be bombed again. Now the shore of Vieques will be domi-nated only by the sound of the surf, the birds, and the wind. The thousands of Puerto Ricans living in Vieques achieved their long-sought peace. Today ''Pas para Vieques'' is a reality. For generations, the Viequeses have not known life without bombing. Thou-sands of families have lived their whole life with the concussion of bombs and shells upon their island at night, dur-ing the day, in the coastal waters. Vieques became a bombing and train- ing range for the Navy in the 1940s dur-ing World War II. Without a doubt, much has been changed since then. While the bombing has continued, awareness about the island of Vieques has grown. Viequeses and Puerto Ricans reached out, and shared with people what was happening to their is- land. Well, over a hundred Members of Congress actively supported bringing an end to the bombing. I must note a few of them, particularly the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and my colleagues, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. G UTIERREZ ), the gentle- woman from New York (Ms. V ELA\u00b4ZQUEZ ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. S ERRANO ). I must also thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. S KELTON ), ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services, the Congressional Black Caucus, activists, and many common citizens of the United States and elsewhere who be-came involved in the effort to return peace and to end bombing of the island of Vieques. Puerto Ricans also enjoyed strong leadership on this issue by President Bill Clinton and President Bush, who both realized that this was an issue of human rights and the citizens of Puer-to Rico have suffered for too long. Hav-ing worked with the White House and both Commanders-in-Chief on this issue, I know that our national secu-rity and the well-being of thousands of citizens in Vieques were taken into consideration when making this deter-mination. On behalf of Puerto Rico, I thank President Clinton and President Bush for ending the bombing of Vieques. Puerto Rico will never forget your res-olute commitment. Today is a day of discovery, wonderment and joy. Unfortunately, last night a small group of people rushed the fence of the range and recklessly overturned vehi-cles, set fires and destroyed govern-ment property. It is unfortunate that some have undermined the peaceful protest of the past. Prayers of thanks, fireworks, parades and excitement will accompany the joy of today. I strongly condemn those few who have shown disrespect to the United States, Puerto Rico and Vieques. All must know that the overwhelming majority of Puerto Ricans are proud of their bond with the United States, and our support for the common defense is resolute. While we celebrate the end of the bombing, much work remains. Over 60 years of explosions, bombings, waste disposal and burning have left much of the Vieques range littered with a dead-ly combination of unexploded ordnance and toxic chemicals. I am confident that in cooperation with EPA, Fish and Wildlife, the Pentagon, the Puerto Rican government and Vieques, we will be able to reclaim this land. So to Markiani, the young girl who brought me the sand from Vieques, I VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May H3622 May 1, 2003 say our day is upon us and we may re- turn to the free shores of Vieques and take with us the sand to fulfill the dream you shared with me. But Markiani, you cannot yet play safely on all of the beaches until the cleanup is completed. Your ultimate dream is that the lands be returned finally to the people of Vieques. One day all of Vieques will be reclaimed, safe for the people to fully enjoy without fears of bombing or the residue of Naval train-ing. As one era ends and another be-gins, we celebrate the long-awaited peace for Vieques. The aforementioned letter is as fol- lows: DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY , Washington, DC, April 30, 2003. Hon.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. G UTKNECHT ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud lifetime Member of the National Auctioneers Association. We want to recognize today National Auctioneers Day, which takes place an-nually on the third Saturday of April. This year it fell on April 19. And I sup-pose some of my colleagues are won-dering can he really do that? Yes, I do a lot of auctions even today: ''And now 35, I'll give you 40, now 5. Anybody bid 45? I'll give you 50.'' I have had the privilege of auctioneering events to raise money for the American Cancer Society, the Boys and Girls Club, Safari Club, Ducks Unlimited, the list goes on and on. As a matter of fact, since I was elected to Congress, I have raised al-most $2 million for charity. Every year billions of dollars are poured into our economy from auctions of estates, of vehicles, thoroughbred horses, antiques and other goods. And auctions of homes and other real estate are in-creasingly more important as more and more realtors and homeowners see the advantages of selling by auction as their first choice. On Auctioneer's Day this year, auc- tioneers across the country held a spe-cial fund-raiser for the Saint Jude Chil-dren's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, the chosen charity of the National Auctioneers Association. Auctioneers are generous and patriotic Americans, and I rise to salute their contributions to our great country. f HONORING STATE SENATOR CLARENCE W. BLOUNT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. C UMMINGS ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Maryland Sen-ator Clarence W. Blount, a man whose life exemplified the greatness that lives within all of us. I am saddened to inform this body that in the afternoon of April 12, 2003, State Senator Clarence Blount passed away from complications related to a stroke at the age of 81. He is survived by his wife Gordine, and his two sons, Michael and Mark, and many more friends and family in Maryland who mourn the loss of this great statesman. Mr. Speaker, W.E.B. DuBois once wrote that ''the roots of the tree, rath-er than its leaves, are the source of its life.'' Today I honor a man who devoted his life to that principle. When Clarence Blount died, he was best known as the former majority leader of the Maryland Senate where he served the people of Maryland for over 31 years, after stepping aside last year to let in some ''new blood,'' and as a champion of public education. How-ever, I recall this wonderful human being as my teacher, my mentor and friend. Clarence Blount, by his own self-description, was an ordinary man called to an extraordinary mission of uplifting the lives of others. He re-mained steadfast in pursuit of that calling. In the process, he became ex-traordinary himself. When Clarence Blount was born to Lottie and Charles Johnson Blount, Sr., in South Creek, North Carolina on April 20, 1921, I doubt whether anyone outside of his own family could have anticipated just how far his determination and talent would carry him in life. His father worked on a tobacco farm. His mother would die when he was just 5 years old. The Blount family was so poor they could not afford to buy their children shoes. It was only after the family moved to Baltimore that Clar-ence Blount was able to begin school at the age of 10. At that time he was un-able to read or count on his fingers, but through determination and with the help of dedicated teachers, he grad-uated from Frederick Douglass High School at the age of 21. He became one of the greatest cham- pions of American public education ever known. One month after Clarence Blount entered Morgan State Univer-sity, he was drafted into the then-seg-regated United States Army to fight in World War II. He served with distinc-tion in Italy as a member of the all-black Buffalo Division of the 92nd In-fantry. The courage and dedication to duty that he demonstrated while removing mines from a river passage earned him a battlefield commission. After fight-ing for his country against both the enemy and the barriers of Jim Crow, Mr. Blount returned to Morgan State in 1946 and graduated in 1950. He be-came a teacher, earned a master's de-gree in education from Johns Hopkins University, and eventually advanced to become the principal of Baltimore's Dunbar High School. Mr. Speaker, the education of chil- dren became Clarence Blount's passion and mission in life. He used his own prior hardships and life experiences as a passport to help other people improve their lives. As a teacher, principal, and later chairman of the Social Services Department of the Community College of Baltimore, Clarence Blount opened the doors to educational opportunities for thousands of young people in our community. That same calling and that same de- termination, to address the inadequate funding of our public schools, led Mr. Blount into public life. He sought and won election to the Maryland Senate in 1971. He became the first African Amer-ican to chair a Senate committee in 1987, and he became Maryland's first African American majority leader in 1983, a post that he held until his re-tirement last year. It was during that period of public service that Clarence Blount directly influenced the course of my life. When I was a young legislator serving my second year in the Maryland House of Delegates, Senator Blount, then chair of the Maryland Legislative Black Cau-cus, encouraged me to run for and win VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 02, H3623 May 1, 2003 that position. He had seen something in me that I had not seen in myself. Our personal relationship became even closer when we traveled together to Israel in the 1980s. He became like a second father to me. He later encouraged me to run for the second highest position in the State of Maryland House of Delegates, Speaker pro tempore. He was the first person to encourage me to run for Con-gress in 1996. I recount these personal influences because Clarence Blount's impact upon my life was not unique. He touched everybody he could. He never ceased being a teacher who found his greatest reward in the accomplish-ments of his students. About a year and a half ago, Clarence Blount and I were both asked to speak at a neighborhood housing event in the Ashburton section of Baltimore. I thanked him for being such a magnifi-cent and significant part of my life, for seeing qualities in me that I had not realized in myself. I also thanked him for fighting for our neighborhoods in Baltimore and for giving our commu-nities a voice in Annapolis. So, Mr. Speaker, I stand today to sa- lute a great American who came up through difficult times, an ordinary man called to an extraordinary mis-sion. f The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Kansas (Mr. T IAHRT ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. TIAHRT. addressed the House. His remarks will appear hereafter in the Extensions of Remarks.) f EXPANSION OF MANDATE OF DE- PARTMENT OF DEFENSE-VET-ERANS AFFAIRS JOINT EXECU-TIVE COMMITTEE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Arkansas (Mr. B OOZMAN ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill that would greatly expand the mandate of the De-partment of Defense-Veterans Affairs Joint Executive Committee. This com-mittee would be tasked to oversee the realm of collaborative efforts of not just health, but also benefits and other areas to promote increased resource sharing between the two departments. While statutory authority to allow resource sharing has existed for more than 20 years, the latest figures tell us that the level of sharing between the VA and DOD remains relatively low. The Federal Government can and must do more to increase resource sharing whenever and wherever feasible. This bill would allow the Joint Exec- utive Committee to identify changes in policies, to improve services, effi-ciencies and opportunities for collabo-ration in order to deliver benefits and services to beneficiaries of both depart-ments. Inefficiencies and duplication not only waste taxpayer dollars, they shortchange military personnel, retir-ees and veterans seeking the services offered by VA and DOD. I believe the expansion of this Joint Executive Committee would facilitate necessary discussions and decisions that will ultimately lead to greater ef-ficiencies within and between the two departments. I would like to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH) of the Veterans Affairs Com- mittee for his cooperation in devel-oping this very important piece of leg-islation. It is time that these depart-ments seize the opportunity and take full advantage of the benefits that come from sharing their extensive re-sources. f EXTENDING THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from California (Ms. W OOLSEY ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the many hard-working families in our country that cannot make ends meet as this economy slows and the job market con-tinues to weaken. b1615 These families are the main reason we must absolutely extend the tem-porary emergency unemployment com-pensation program, TEUC; and they are the reason we must do it now. With the current high unemployment rate of 5.8 percent, unemployment benefits are the same as when the TEUC program was first established in March of 2002, over a year ago, and reextended in Jan-uary, 2003. Just last week the Depart-ment of Labor reported that new appli-cations for unemployment insurance hit the high number of 455,000 appli-cants for the week ending April 19. This is the highest level in more than a year. And it does not count families who have exhausted their benefits and still are not working. Mr. Speaker, in March of this year, millions of workers had exhausted their regular unemployment benefits which continues the pattern of the past 24 months, where the numbers of unem-ployed workers receiving aid is abso-lutely and actually increasing. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that there is a real need for unemployed worker relief in this Nation, but we do not need numbers and we do not need statistics to alert us to this growing problem. Just listen to the words from letters I have received from my con-stituents in the Sixth Congressional District of California. And when the Members hear their words, they will know that there is immediacy for addi-tional unemployment insurance bene-fits, and they will know that it is im-portant that people in districts like mine, Marin and Sonoma Counties, where the unemployment is not as dire as some other areas in the country, still have needs as well as the rest of the Nation. One constituent writes: ''I have a master's degree and have not been able to find work. I also deal with a chronic illness. I find myself applying for food stamps and soon will be unable to pay any bills. I'm not sure I will have a roof over my head before long. A lot of people are having a very difficult time. Please try to make unemployment ben-efits a top priority.'' Another writes: ''I have been actively seeking work since the end of March, 2002, without success. I am a 55-year-old man who has never had a problem staying fully employed until this year. I have never before been affected by the reluctance of employers to hire older people. That, coupled with the stagnant economy, has made my abil-ity to earn a living terrifyingly dif-ficult. Unemployment compensation has kept food on my table for my fam-ily, but I worry what will happen next month.'' These letters show how desperately workers need help. They need help just to keep their heads above water so their families can have the food and shelter they need to be healthy and safe, so their families can eat while their parents continue to search for work. It is important that this Congress take action to make sure no family goes without basic needs like food or money for bills. That is why I support the gentleman from New York's (Con-gressman R ANGEL ) bill, H.R. 1652, the Unemployment Benefits Extension Act. This would provide 26 weeks of ex-tended benefits through November, 2003. The consideration of this bill is critical as many unemployed workers once again find themselves reaching the end of unemployment benefits. If these benefits are not extended, in most States workers exhausting their regular benefits after May 31 of this year will receive no further assistance. Extending these benefits would also give the economy a boost, Mr. Speaker, because unemployed workers would have money for purchases. Otherwise, without these benefits, these workers, unemployed workers, will have to cur-tail their spending, which would weak-en the economy and continue the dom- ino effect, causing even more job loss. Economy.com analysis found that ex- tension of the Federal unemployment insurance benefits would be the single most effective action that Congress could take now to boost the economy and protect jobs. f TERRORISM The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FEENEY ). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New York (Mr. E NGEL ) is recognized for 5 min- utes. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to take this opportunity to comment on some recent developments in the Middle East. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 02, H3624 May 1, 2003 Yesterday President Bush, the United States, and others in the so-called ''quartet'' presented a roadmap for Middle East peace. There has been a lot of talk about the roadmap, a lot of euphoria about a new Palestinian lead-ership with Abu Mazen; but I wanted to take some time just to backstep a lit-tle bit and, in this rush to euphoria, talk about some very, very serious things. Everyone wants peace in the Middle East, and everyone knows that ulti-mately the key to peace is having two states side by side, Israel as a Jewish state and a Palestinian state side by side with security. The question is how do we get there? Oslo, which many of us supported, ultimately was a failure; and in my opinion it was a failure be-cause Yasser Arafat's feet were never held to the fire. There were promises. There was empty rhetoric. There was saying one thing in English that sound-ed good and quite another thing in Ara-bic to the Palestinians that did not talk about peace; and we looked the other way because we so much wanted peace between Israelis and Palestinians that we never made Arafat's actions live up to his speech. We should not make the same mis- take again. Yes, there is a new Pales-tinian prime minister named Abu Mazen; and, yes, there is a modicum of hope that Abu Mazen will be a mod-erate. But the fact of the matter is as long as there is terrorism in the Middle East, as long as there is no Palestinian crackdown on suicide bombers or on terrorism, as long as terrorism is still attempted to be used as a negotiating tool by the Palestinian side, there can never really be peace. At the end of the Oslo process, there was a proposal put forth. The proposal was two states side by side and the Pal-estinians were offered 100 percent of Gaza, 97 percent of the West Bank, a state of their own, billions of dollars of international aid; and Yasser Arafat turned down the deal. Not only did he turn it down and not offer a counter-proposal, but he unleashed the Intifada and thought he could use terrorism as a negotiating tool. If that happens again, the roadmap will go the way of Oslo, which is nowhere. So what needs to happen here is there needs to be a crackdown on ter-ror. There needs to be a real visible, sustained antiterrorism effort on the part of Abu Mazen and the Palestin-ians. It is no coincidence that three hours after the roadmap was an-nounced there was another suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed three innocent people and injured 40-some-odd other innocents. This cannot be left to stand. We have to judge Abu Mazen by seeing if he really cracks down on terrorism. That has to be first. I believe that the roadmap should be performance based, not time based. A Palestinian state projection is in 2004 and then in 2005 the final status. That should happen only if the Palestinians live up to their agreements, which they had not done previously under Oslo. Once terrorism is stopped, then the Israelis can make the concessions that are also necessary in order to have a just and viable peace. But let me make it clear, there cannot be negotiations or Israeli concessions while terrorism is still being used as a negotiating tool. Let me also talk a little bit about Syria. I am the author of the Syria Ac-countability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, and we call to the Syrians to stop their support for international terror. Hezbollah, which is in Lebanon's south/Israel's northern border, is used as a proxy by Syria to continue its support of terrorism. Hezbollah is the group which bombed U.S. Marines in 1983 and killed more than 200 of our Marines in Beirut. Syria must stop its support for inter-national terrorism. Syria is on the list of countries of our State Department which supports international ter-rorism. Syria has been on that State Department list since the inception of the list in 1979, and yet it is the only country with which we have normal diplomatic relations on that list. That makes no sense. So the Syria Account-ability and Lebanese Sovereignty Res-toration Act of 2003 calls on Syria to stop its support for terrorism, to end its occupation of Lebanon, and to end the continuation of its production of weapons of mass destruction. We also know that Syria is harboring some of the Saddam Hussein crowd which has fled Iraq and is in Syria, and we also know that during the war in Iraq the Syrians allowed all kinds of armaments and weapons and night gog-gles and other things to pass through Syria into Iraq to be used against U.S. forces. President Bush has gotten tough with Syria. Colin Powell is visiting Syria. We hope he tells the Syrians to stop their support of terrorism. f WALL STREET ROBBER BARONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from Ohio (Ms. K APTUR ) is rec- ognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I have never met New York's Attorney Gen-eral Eliot Spitzer, but on behalf of the citizens of Ohio, I want to thank him. The people of New York should be very proud of their Attorney General, Mr. Spitzer, for he is bringing to justice the robber barons of Wall Street who stole the money in our 401(k)s, who lied to our shareholders about the worth of various investments, who issued fraud-ulent reports about the value of stocks, and frankly destroyed a great deal of the confidence of our people in our so-called free markets. In fact, some might say they have been a free-for-all market. Some might say what these Wall Street fellows have done is a big heist, a big heist right out of people's pocketbooks and a big heist right out of people's dividends. Because of work that he did, and our Securities and Ex-change Commission following behind, the regulators found fault with every single investment banking firm on Wall Street. I want to include in the R ECORD much of what they said: ''Analysts wittingly duped investors to curry favor with certain corporate clients. Investment houses received secret pay-ments from companies they gave strong recommendations to buy. And for top executives whose companies were clients, stock underwriters of-fered special access to hot initial pub-lic offerings.'' It really is staggering, when we think about the recession that we are in, about the malfunctioning of our own stock markets which lie at the heart of this free enterprise system that has been hijacked time and again. b1630 It started with Enron. Then we saw WorldCom. Then it was Tyco. Now it is every single money manager on Wall Street that has your money. So far, they have been fined as fol- lows: $400 million is to be paid by Citigroup; $200 million each by Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch, which in-cluded an earlier Merrill settlement of $100 million in fines; $100 million in fines by Goldman Sachs; $80 million in fines by Bear Stearns; $80 million by JP Morgan; and fines of the same amount to Lehman and to UBS War-burg; $32.5 million in fines by Piper Jaffray. These are names we see adver-tised in our newspapers. They have got enough money to buy ads all over the country, yet they take your hard-earned money and they gamble it away. I have to ask myself as a Member of Congress, I am not going to trust those folks with the Social Security funds of this country. Do not tell me to put our people's hard-earned dollars in that stock market that you cannot trust from one day to the next, and do not ask this Member of Congress to vote for a Bush administration tax scheme that rewards some of the same fellows that just ran away with our money in our own equity market. Why was not anybody watching? Why did it take so long? Now, they tell you anything to get your money. That is what Mr. Spitzer found. And they did tell you anything to get your money. The news articles really say everything. What jumps off the page in the documents is the Wall Street firms' utter, utter disregard for the individual investor in pursuit of their own personal benefit. These are institutions that are supposed to be working for us, and they all, not one, not two, all, the major firms on Wall Street failed the American people. One investor told a colleague he was trying to make the company look good with his questions. A few moments later he said, ''We got paid for it, and I am going to Cancun tomorrow be-cause of what I did.'' That is someone that took your money. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 02, May 1, 2003 Here is somebody, Sanford Weill, Citigroup's chairman. He persuaded an analyst to change a rating. This is not some guy in the back closet. This is the head of the largest investment banking firm in this country. What are they doing up there? What is the matter with them? You know how many people in my district have lost their retirement savings in the 401(k) plans alone? These are the high-est paid people in our country that the Bush administration is about to open up the Treasury for. They do not de-serve a dime. They ought to pay more of it back to us for what they have done. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Attorney General Elliott Spitzer of New York. He is a hero in my book. Mr. Speaker, I include the three newspaper articles for the R ECORD . [From the New York Times, Apr. 29, 2003] TENWALLST. FIRMS SETTLE WITHU.S. IN ANALYST INQUIRY : AGREE TO PAY$1.4 B ILLION (By Stephen Labaton) WASHINGTON , A PR. 28.\u2014Prosecutors an- nounced a settlement today with the na-tion's biggest investment firms that bars the heads of the largest bank from talking to his analysts, details a far greater range of con-flicts of interest than previously disclosed, and leaves the industry exposed both to fur-ther regulation and costly litigation. The $1.4 billion settlement by 10 firms and 2 well-known stock analysts reached ten-tatively last December but completed in the last few days, resolved accusations that the firms lured millions of investors to buy bil-lions of dollars worth of shares in companies they knew were troubled and which ulti-mately either collapsed or sharply declined. The Securities and Exchange Commission, state prosecutors and market regulators ac-cused three firms in particular\u2014Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and Credit Suisse First Boston\u2014of fraud. But the thousands of pages of internal e-mail mes-sages and other evidence that regulators made public today painted a picture up and down Wall Street of an industry rife with conflicts of interest during the height of the Internet and telecommunications bubble that burst three years ago. At firm after firm, according to prosecu- tors, analysts wittingly duped investors to curry favor who corporate clients. Invest-ment houses received secret payments from companies they gave strong recommenda-tions to buy. And for top executives whose companies were clients, stock underwriters offered special access to hot initial public of-ferings. ''These cases reflect a sad chapter in the history of American business\u2014a chapter in which those who reaped enormous benefits based on the trust of investors profoundly betrayed that trust,'' said William H. Don-aldson, the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''The cases also represent an important new chapter in our ongoing efforts to restore investors' faith and confidence in the fairness and integrity of our markets.'' In a reflection of regulators' concerns about the prospect for conflicts of interest at Citigroup, Wall Street's biggest bank, the settlement bars its chairman and chief exec-utive, Sanford I. Weill, from communicating with his firm's stock analysts about the companies they cover, unless a lawyer is present. But the regulators found fault with every major bank on Wall Street. In addition to the three firms accused of fraud, five others\u2014Bear Stearns, Goldman, Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Piper Jaffray and UBS Warburg\u2014were accused of making un-warranted or exaggerated claims about the companies they analyzed. UBS Warburg and Piper Jaffray, were accused of receiving pay-ments for research without disclosing such payments. And Salomon Smith Barney and First Bos- ton were accused of currying favor with their corporate clients by selling hot stock offer-ings to senior executives, who then could turn around and sell the shares for virtually guaranteed profits. The two banks agreed to end that practice, known as spinning. In settling the cases, the firms neither ad- mitted nor denied the allegations, following the standard practice in resolving such dis-putes with the commission. In monetary terms, the $1.4 billion in fines, restitution and other payments equals near-ly 7 percent of the industry's profits last year, which was Wall Street's worst year since 1995. Of that sum, $387.5 million will go to repaying investors who file claims with the government. But armed with the regu-lators' findings, lawyers are sure to seek many times that total in private litigation. The firms also agreed to abide by what of- ficials said were significant new ethics rules and to build barriers between investment bankers and stock analysts in hopes of re-lieving analysts from the business pressures that many succumbed to during the 1990's. For example, the compensation of analysts is to be based on the quality of their research, not their contribution to the firm's invest-ment banking business. As part of the agreement, two analysts whose fortunes rose with the markets, Jack B. Grubman of Salomon Smith Barney and Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, agreed to lifetime bans from the industry, along with significant fines. The singling out of Mr. Weill stemmed in part from his efforts to try to influence Mr. Grubman to change his view of AT&T\u2014a Citigroup client that had Mr. Weill on its board\u2014to positive from negative. He and Citigroup's other senior officers\u2014whose con-tacts with the banks' research analysts are also restricted under the settlement\u2014were the only Wall Street executives to agree spe-cifically to such a prohibition. Any top Wall Street executive directly involved in invest-ment banking, however, would be barred from discussions with his company's ana-lysts under the terms of the agreements. For all the anticipation of today's an- nouncement, the voluminous record of com-plaints and damaging evidence left many un-resolved questions for both investors and the securities industry. Foremost among those was what long-term impact the settlement will have on the cul-ture of Wall Street, the integrity of stock analysis and the confidence of investors. Concerned that the settlement might not be far reaching enough\u2014and might also have unintended consequences\u2014officials at the S.E.C. are considering the adoption of a new set of regulations governing stock analysts. ''It's critically important that we now step back and thoroughly examine the issues,'' said Harvey Goldschmid, one of the commis-sioners. Wondering whether the settlement might discourage research for smaller mar-kets, he added, ''No research is certainly bet-ter than skewed research, but honest re-search would be even better.'' Critics who fear that the settlement falls short of protecting investors said that they welcomed further efforts by regulators. ''What they have imposed is a solution where they will try to regulate behavior, ethics and business practices,'' said Scott Cleland, the chief executive of Precursor Group and a member of a coalition of small research firms without ties to investment banks that have been seeking broader changes. ''What they didn't do is address the conflict at its source\u2014the commingling of trading, research and banking commissions.'' ''The analogy is that if this were an oper- ating room, they disinfected everything but the scalpel,'' Mr. said. ''The scalpel left dirty.'' While providing $375.5 million in restitu- tion that can be sought by investors, the cases leave unresolved how much investors might ultimately recoup after relying on the analysts to make what turned out to have been calamitous investments. Federal and state officials said today that one aim of the settlement was to shake out enough strong evidence to assist shareholders in private lawsuits and arbitration efforts. ''This is very much the beginning,'' said New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, whose early inquiry into conflicts on Wall Street prompted federal and market regu-lators to begin focusing on the issue\u2014and who supporters say might try to ride his suc-cess in the case to the governor's office in Albany. ''One of our objectives was to put in-formation into the marketplace to permit investors on their own to seek relief.'' Wall Street executives acknowledged that the findings of the regulators would probably draw more lawsuits against their firms. ''It's sort of like throwing a party and in- viting a lot of people in, isn't it?'' E. Stanley O'Neal, Merrill's chief executive, said at the firm's annual shareholders meeting in Plainsboro, N.J. Government officials also emphasized today that the settlements did not preclude them from further investigation\u2014pointedly noting, for example, that they were exam-ining whether any top executives at the in-vestment firms had failed to adequately su-pervise the analysts. ''Just wait,'' said Stephen M. Cutler, the head of enforcement at the commission and a leading architect of the agreement. In addition to the restitution, the firms also agreed to pay $487.5 million in penalties, $432.5 million to fund independent research, and $80 million for investor education. Mr. Blodget agreed to pay $4 million and Mr. Grubman $15 million to settle the charges against them. The fines, restitution and other penalties were divided as follows: $400 million will be paid by Citigroup; $200 million each by Cred-it Suisse and Merrill Lynch (which includes an earlier Merrill settlement of $100 million); $125 million by Morgan Stanley; $110 million by Goldman Sachs; $80 million each by Bear Stearns, J.P. Morgan, Lehman and UBS War-burg; and $32.5 million by Piper Jaffray. One of the final issues that had been nego- tiated involved which companies would bear the brunt of the penalties and how much might be covered by insurance policies and deductible from the firms' taxes. Under tax law, none of the $487.5 million in penalties is deductible, and the firms agreed not to seek reimbursement under their in-surance policies. Prosecutors also inserted a clause in the settlement that might make it harder for the firms to try to deduct any of the $512.5 million in independent research and investor education. [From the New York Times, Apr. 29, 2003] INAWALLST. HIERARCHY , SHORT SHIFT TO LITTLE GUY (By Gretchen Morgenson) Documents disclosed as part of yesterday's settlement show how Wall Street firms, in pursuit of investment banking fees, put the VerDate Jan 31 2003 03:19 May 02, H3626 May 1, 2003 interests of their individual clients dead last. As an analyst at Lehman Brothers told an institutional investor in an e-mail message, ''well, ratings and price targets are fairly meaningless anyway,'' later adding, ''but, yes, the 'little guy' who isn't smart about the nuances may get misled, such is the na-ture of my business.'' In a newly disclosed tactic, Morgan Stan- ley and four other brokerage firms paid ri-vals that had agreed to publish positive re-ports on companies whose shares Morgan and others issued to the public. This practice made it appear that a throng of believers were recommending these companies' shares. From 1999 through 2001, for example, Mor- gan Stanley paid about $2.7 million to ap-proximately 25 other investment banks for these so-called research guarantees, regu-lators said. Nevertheless, the firm boasted in its annual report to shareholders that it had come through investigations of analyst con-flicts of interest with its ''reputation for in-tegrity'' maintained. Among the firms receiving payments for their bullish research on companies whose offerings they did not manage were UBS Warburg and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. UBS received $213,000 and Piper Jaffray, more than $1.8 million. What jumps off the page in these docu- ments is the Wall Street firms' disregard for the individual investor in pursuit of personal benefit. One comment made by a Bear, Stearns an- alyst is telling. While participating in a con-ference call by SonicWall, an Internet com-pany whose shares Bear, Stearns had sold to the public, the analyst told a colleague that he was trying to make the company look good with his questions. A few moments later, he said, ''we got paid for this,'' adding, ''and I am going to Cancun tomorrow b/c of them.'' But because greed is a part of human na- ture and human nature seldom seems to change, Alan Bromberg, professor of securi-ties law at Southern Methodist University, remains skeptical that the terms of the set-tlement will bring substantive change to Wall Street. ''I don't see this as a great reformation,'' Mr. Bromberg said. ''I don't see this as a new world we are moving into. The pressures are still going to be there. Brokerage firms don't make money other than by selling securities so they're going to inevitably be encouraging people to buy and will always have pressures to hype what they think is good or what they're otherwise involved in.'' The heaviest penalties in the settlement went to Salomon Smith Barney, Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch. Reg-ulators contended that analysts at these firms committed securities fraud by recom-mending stocks to the public they had ex-pressed misgivings about privately. But securities regulators also found that all the firms failed to supervise adequately the research analysts and investment bank-ing professionals they employed. They failed, therefore, to protect clients who were basing investment decisions on research that had been written to attract or maintain invest-ment banking clients. While the symbiotic relationship between Wall Street research analysts and invest-ment bankers harmed investors, it was bene-ficial to the firms. Lehman Brothers and Goldman, Sachs, according to regulators, en-couraged analysts to work closely with in-vestment bankers to generate deals. Goldman, Sachs aligned its research, equi- ties and investment banking divisions to work collaboratively and fully leverage its limited research resources. In 2000, Goldman noted happily that ''research analysts, on 429 different occasions, solicited 328 transactions in the first 5 months'' and that ''research was involved in 82 percent of all won busi-ness solicitations.'' Crucial to the firms' failure to supervise themselves was the tendency by their ana-lysts to publish research that was not based on sound analysis or principles of fair deal-ing or good faith, the regulators said. Eight of the 10 firms that settled\u2014Bear, Stearns; Credit Suisse First Boston; Goldman, Sachs; Lehman Brothers; Lynch; Piper Jaffray; Salomon Barney; and UBS Warburg\u2014issued such reports. The firms' re-search also contained exaggerated or unwar-ranted assertions about companies, or opin-ions for which there were no reasonable bases. For example, at Credit Suisse, regulators contend that its analyst covering Winstar, a small telecommunications concern that never turned a profit and that filed for bank-ruptcy two years ago, failed to disclose the risks inherent in the company. The firm had initiated equity research coverage of Winstar in May 2000, with a ''strong buy'' rating and a 12-month target price of $79. Credit Suisse retained the $79 target from Jan. 5 to April 3, 2001, even as the stock plummeted to 31 cents a share from approxi-mately $17 and the company's market cap-italization fell to $30 million from $1.6 bil-lion. Some of the most entertaining reading in the masses of evidence that regulators have made public for use by aggrieved investors in their own lawsuits is the commentary by Salomon Smith Barney brokers about Jack B. Grubman's performance as the firm's top telecommunications analyst. As far back as 2000, brokers were express- ing outrage and betrayal over Mr. Grubman's woeful stock picking, which many noted was related to his dual roles as investment bank-er and analyst. Yet even as the brokers howled about Mr. Grubman's tendency to keep recommending stocks as they collapsed in price, the analyst retained his job at Salomon until last August. Here are some outtakes from Salomon bro- kers late in 2000. Mr. Grubman ''should be publicly flogged,'' one said. ''Under the cat-egory, Bonus for Creating Tax Loss Carry Forwards for Retail Clients, Grubman should be recognized accordingly as our best ana-lyst.'' Many said the analyst should be fired, while another broker said, ''If Jack Grubman is a top 'research analyst' then I have a bridge to sell.'' Another remarked: ''Boo Hiss. Banking showed its ugly head.'' During the year these comments were made, Mr. Grubman was paid $14.2 million in salary and bonus. As a result, Salmon's brokers emerge as yet another group victimized by Mr. Grubman's conflicted status. As one broker, or financial consultant, put it: ''Grubman has zero credibility with me or my clients. He is collecting from two masters'' at finan-cial consultant expense. Then referring to investment banking functions, he continued: ''He brings IB busi-ness to the firm and loses his objectivity. I am sure that nothing will come of my com-ments. The spin-masters will say that every-one else does it. Is there an honest person left?'' FINDING FRAUD ON WALLST. MAYBEASTEP TOHIGHER POST (By Raymond Hernandez) WASHINGTON , APR. 28.\u2014The question was about tax loopholes and whether the 10 secu-rities firms that agreed to pay $1.4 billion to resolve charges of wrongdoing by their re-search analysts would be able to squirm out of their plight by writing off their fines. It put the men behind the lectern at the Secu-rities and Exchange Commission's head-quarters on the spot. But not Eliot Spitzer. ''Maybe I can be a little less discreet,'' Mr. Spitzer, the attor-ney general from New York, chimed in. ''I al-ways try to be.'' With that, he shifted the focus to Congress, urging lawmakers to act to close the loop-holes, and insisting his office and the S.E.C. had done their jobs. ''Spoken like a man whose Hill is in Al- bany and not in Washington,'' said William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the S.E.C., to laughter. Mr. Spitzer's hill, some say, is just about anywhere he wants it to be these days, hav-ing been indiscreet enough to take on the biggest names on Wall Street during a re-lentless investigation of securities fraud. For more than a year, he has plunged forward, making cases and headlines along the way, and some say paving his future with stepping stones bearing the names of Henry Blodget, Jack B. Grubman and the like. At the news conference here today an- nouncing the settlement of the case against the 10 firms, Mr. Spitzer was just one player of many. Nonetheless, it was a defining mo-ment for Mr. Spitzer, who just five years ago took a gamble and used his family's vast wealth to oust Dennis C. Vacco, the Repub-lican attorney general at the time. As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer revived the long-dormant Martin Act, a 1921 state law giving the attorney general of New York, jurisdiction over securities trading. Mr. Spitzer uncovered, among other things, damaging e-mail messages among stock analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's biggest brokerage firm and a main-stay of New York's financial commu-nity. He accused the analysts of urging cus-tomers to buy stocks that the analysts be-lieved where losing bets just so that Merrill could curry favor with companies it wanted as clients. In doing the job, Mr. Spitzer, 43, has fol- lowed in the tradition of activist and con-sumer-oriented attorneys general, like Louis J. Lefkowitz, who set the standard, and Rob-ert Abrams. But in his prepared remarks, he likened the pursuit of Wall Street evildoers to an-other crusader, Theodore Roosevelt, the pop-ulist Republican president who dubbed him-self a Trust Buster and crusaded against un-checked corporate wealth and power. ''We are at a rare moment,'' he said. ''It is akin to the moment we were at 100 years ago.'' Before he was president, Mr. Roosevelt was New York's governor, and many say that is the real goal of Mr. Spitzer. Indeed, many of those who make their liv- ing from Wall Street are seething over Mr. Spitzer, blaming him for pursuing scandal at the expense of their livelihoods and New York's economy. Many complain, quietly, of course, that Mr. Spitzer has relentlessly un-dermined the public's trust in the stock mar-ket while boosting his own political for-tunes. Many of Mr. Spitzer's fellow Democrats, however, feel otherwise. ''New York Democrats need someone who can galvanize them,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant in New York who was one of Mr. Spitzer's campaign advisers in 1988. ''Eliot Spitzer appears to be that person right now.'' ''This is not without its perils,'' Mr. Sheinkopf added. ''The danger is that he has angered a large portion of New York's tradi-tional fund-raising base, Wall Street.'' VerDate Jan 31 May 1, 2003 Mr. Spitzer, in an interview after the news conference, acknowledged the potential dif-ficulties. ''This case has left me without some friends I had before,'' he said. But, he said, it might have made him friends elsewhere. ''I've got a job to do and I'm going to do it,'' he said. ''I hate to sound overly moralistic, but it's the only way to do this job.'' Mr. Spitzer also said it was premature for him to talk about a possible campaign for governor, though people in both parties say he is the man to beat should be choose to run for governor in 2006. ''All I can tell you is that I have made no decision about that,'' he said. f ILLEGAL NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 7, 2003, the gentleman from Indi-ana (Mr. S OUDER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the major-ity leader. Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, tonight I would like to focus on the illegal nar-cotics problem in the United States, as well as a little bit around the world. We have several legislative initia- tives that are about to come in front of this Congress, including one moving through my subcommittee, the Sub-committee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources of the Committee on Government Reform, which is the Office of National Drug Control Policy reauthorization bill. The ONDC Director, commonly known as the Drug Czar of the United States, is John Walters. This bill will reau-thorize for 5 years the entire oversight of the narcotics programs of the United States. In addition, in our emergency ter- rorism bill, we had money for Colom-bia. We will have in a number of appro-priations bills in front of us money for the Andean region and other inter-national narcotics control programs. So I thought tonight would be a good time to start with my colleagues and staff and others who are watching this discussion, laying out a little bit of the big picture on what we are tackling, mostly focusing tonight on the inter-national drug problem, some on our do-mestic and some oversight, and then as we move into the markup in the next few weeks in subcommittee and full committee on this House floor, we will be spending a lot more time discussing the millions, and, in fact, billions of dollars that we spend fighting illegal narcotics. First, it is very important to under- stand that while tonight we are going to be talking about a lot of inter-national concerns, this is directly a concern that hits every Congressional district. In every city and town, no matter how small or large, drug and al-cohol problems in America account for, depending on the judge or prosecutor, 70 to 85 percent of all crime in Amer-ica. Not just drug crime, this counts robberies, this counts rapes. This even counts child support payment prob-lems, because often the people not making their child support payments, the people declaring bankruptcy, are having problems with drug and alcohol addiction. The use of illegal narcotics have gone up and down in our country. We will never eliminate them. It is a false goal to say we will eliminate the use of ille-gal drugs in the United States. There will always be, every day, new kids ex-posed in junior high, elementary school and high school. Somebody will lose a job. Somebody will have a problem in their marriage, and they will look for a way out. Rather than confronting their problem directly, they will look for a way out. So every day hundreds of thousands of people are exposed for the first time to the temptations of illegal narcotics. Furthermore, where there is a mar- ket, there will be a demand meeting that market, and we will never com-pletely stop this. We have some people in this body and others who say well, if we cannot eliminate it, why are we spending all this money on it? I would ask the same question about child abuse. I would ask the same ques-tion about spouse abuse. I would ask the same question about rape. I would ask the same question about breast cancer and about other types of dis-ease, heart disease and others. We do it because we need to keep tackling it. We need to make as much progress as we can. Particularly for those things that are controllable by individuals, such as rape, spouse abuse, child abuse, narcotics abuse and other things, we need to stay on top of it so the problems do not get bigger. It may be that that all we can do is hold it even, and sometimes we will make progress. There has been a lot of misinformation in the United States that we have not made progress on drug abuse. In fact, drug abuse in the United States is way down compared to at the peak point when former Presi-dent Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan said ''just say no.'' We constantly hear ''just say no'' being mocked, but ''just say no'' was the cen-terpiece of an aggressive program in interdiction, enforcement, treatment and prevention, that in the 1980s had a dramatic reduction. After the late sixties, where I went to college and early seventies, where you saw an overwhelming majority of kids on the college campuses using mari-juana, at least, and Ecstasy and LSD and all these psychedelic drugs, by Timothy Leary and all the romancing of it in the '70s. In the '80s we made tremendous progress. In the '90s we were making some progress, and it started to level off. From 1992 to 1994 we saw a surge in drug use in the United States that would now, in those 2 years, require us to have a 50 percent reduction to get back to where we were when the former President took office. Now, that was still a lower point than when the Reagans took over in 1980 and made 10 years of steady progress. The bottom line is it is wrong to say we have not made progress, it is wrong to say that you cannot make progress, and there are points in our American history where relaxed gov-ernment policies, of joking about in-haling, cutting back drug interdiction, you see it soar, and we have to recover again. But the trend line over a long period has actually been down, and you would never guess that from all the people who say that there is no hope in this battle. There is hope, but we will never completely win. Right now, we have a goal annually, according to President Bush, to reduce this by 5 percent a year. To do that, we have to stay aggressive in all fronts and be vigilant in all parts of the war on narcotics, because even that said, we have tens of thousands of people killed every year by the abuse of drug and alcohol. To give an example of proportion, the World Trade Center disaster, which was absolutely terrible, was around 3,000. In illegal narcotics, it is somewhere be-tween 20,000 and 30,000 a year, depend-ing on how you want to count it. In my hometown, we see it on a weekly basis practically of a murder, or an accident, or some type of drug-re-lated death, either through murder or through somebody in the highways. Often they get attributed to alcohol. It is usually poly-drug use, marijuana, LSD. Most police departments do not test for Ecstasy or LSD after an acci-dent, and often the people involved have done that. We have had cases of young kids high on multiple different drugs hitting a car. One killed a senior, rolled through the interstate, killed another person. The person high on drugs actually lived through it. We have had a really visible case in my hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana, where the conflict got so great that one of the kids, one of the little gang groups, basically took another young person to a field in a rural area and burned them, in effect, at the stake. As one of the other kids at school threat-ened to bring that up, they took her up and burned her as well. One defended themselves by saying they had a gun at their head and they had to light the match. This is what people who are whacked out on narcotics will start to do to each other. We see this corruption in every community in America, big or small, and we have to stay vigilant and aggressive. Now, let me lay out a little bit of the challenge we are facing. The number one entry level, if you are an underage person, it is a combination usually of tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. You start hanging around with kids who abuse those drugs. They are all illegal, and you get in an illegal cluster, and sooner or later somebody is going to expose you to marijuana. The gateway to all other narcotics is marijuana. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 1, 2003 Furthermore, we have a terrible mis- nomer in the United States that mari-juana would be forms of what we called historically in Indiana ''ditch weed.'' Some areas might compare it to hemp, where you are looking at THC contents of about 8 percent. The new marijuana that is on the streets today is not what your ''parents smoked,'' if they did. It is THC con-tents from 15 to 28 percent. In my hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana, BC Bud, one of these high form things coming in from Canada, marijuana, and other high grade marijuana, as well as in New York and Boston, sells for the same as cocaine, because its kick and danger to the body, this marijuana, is the same as cocaine and heroin. It is ridiculous for those who would downplay marijuana. There are wide ranges of marijuana. At the least harmful form, it still causes harm and long-term damage to the body worst than alcohol or tobacco, if you use it regularly. But in the high grades it is more like cocaine and heroin. It is not a harmless substance. That is our num-ber one problem. Number two is co-caine, number three is heroin. We hear most about meth, because it is the newest, and it is out in the rural areas in particular. So there are many Members of this body involved in the Meth Caucus because it is the newest challenge to those communities. But the fact is that methamphetamines are not as much of a national threat at this point as co-caine, heroin and marijuana. It is just our fastest growth category, and in my district, as well as elsewhere, we are really going after methamphetamine. Ecstasy is another synthetic drug that has been at the rave clubs. It kind of goes up and down in fads as do other psychedelic drugs, and it will probably come and go, depending on the aware-ness of people about it, but there will be replacements in these dance clubs and other places where kids are ex-posed to the dangers of those. Now, for cocaine and heroin in par- ticular, there are two major source areas, and for marijuana as well. The two major source areas are the Andean nations, which would be Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, edges of Ven-ezuela and Brazil, and Mexico. There are other primary source countries, but those are the biggest areas, the Andean region and Mexico. The other areas would include South- east Asia for heroin, Afghanistan where it was the predominant way that al Qaeda was funded, and the so-called Golden Triangle, a triangle area around Burma, Thailand and China, less so there, and most of those nar-cotics are moving to Europe, only about 25 percent to the United States, to our West Coast. But it is a direct threat. Afghanistan is one we have kind of turned the other way on, and, unfortu- nately, they are replanting the poppy, and because we do not at this point di-rectly going to al Qaeda, we have not been aggressive enough. Quite frankly, we need to be aggres- sive with the Northern Alliance and our allies in the Afghan War, not just on those who fought us through the terrorists. It may not anymore be di-rectly funding the terrorists, we are still watching that closely, the Afghan heroin, clearly other times of narcotics are, but we still have to get control of that heroin production in Afghanistan or it is going to flow through the entire world. We also have Canada that is a major supplier of this high grade marijuana, and also almost all of the precursor chemicals coming in seem to be coming in through Canada right now. Now, in all fairness to Canada, we are their big exporter. Often this BC Bud, Quebec Gold, meth precursors are com-ing into the United States in return for cocaine and heroin flowing through the United States. So we are also a drug exporter, and we are the biggest to Canada. So that border is more or less a swap border. Sometimes they trade marijuana for guns. The Netherlands has become the world center of transporting meth pre-cursors, as well as Ecstasy, and it is a major drug center for synthetic drugs. We also grow a lot of marijuana and manufacture meth domestically, so we are also a primary source country as well as a primary user, although we do not ship, other than to Canada, in most cases, drugs out. There are many other transit coun- tries. The Bahama islands are a major way that the drugs come up through the Andean region or even Mexico, but mostly through the Andean region. Some of what comes from South Amer-ica bounces over to Spain, to Madrid, and then bounces back into its United States. We see it come also through Vietnam and places in Southeast Asia that are transit areas. b1645 But let me look at now some more particulars. This map is a map of Co-lombia. To orient, the United States is further north, central America comes down, Panama connects to Colombia. Panama years ago was part of Colom-bia. It was separated by Teddy Roo-sevelt so we could build a canal there. It is in the northwest corner of South America. It is a beautiful country. It is the oldest democracy in South Amer-ica. It is mountainous for most of its region, and the Andes start to move up to 20,000 feet down in this region. Coca grows in the Andean region be- cause you are near the Amazon, the center of the equator; the equator runs somewhere about right in here. So you have damp areas, warm areas that you can grow year-round, and yet you have some mountainous zones where you can get a little bit, not completely wet, but still have plenty of water. In addi-tion, you can have access to the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, in this area, heroin poppy grows best at about 12,000 feet, between 8,000 and 12,000 feet, which is why you see it over in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan and why you see it in the Andean region, because these are the places that have been best in the world to grow high-grade coca and her-oin poppy. Colombia is the oldest democracy, and has produced many products that we in the United States use. They are our biggest supplier of flowers. Ap-proximately 70 percent of all U.S. flow-ers that you buy come from Colombia. Historically, coffee is what you think of. You think of Colombian emeralds. They were our eighth largest supplier or sixth largest supplier of oil until the pipeline came under attack by the nar-cotics and terrorist groups in Colom-bia. Now they are net even, but they were one of our primary suppliers of oil. They also export many other prod-ucts to us. Textiles, all sorts of other types of things. Their democracy has been steadily undermined by American drug use and, to a lesser degree, European drug use. They have had 30,000 police officers killed in Colombia. They have had con-stant terrorist attacks. The current President of Colombia who was here yesterday and today and we met with him this afternoon, his father was as-sassinated by the narcoterrorists years ago. They have made multiple at-tempts on his life, including when I was at his inauguration, the FARC launched from a Howitzer shells at the building where we were, blew off the corner of the presidential palace during the inauguration. For those of my col-leagues who may have read Tom Clancy's book ''Clear and Present Dan-ger'' or seen the movie, I asked former Ambassador Busby whether the movie was fairly accurate; and he said, most-ly, although I did not die like in the movie. The fact is that they shot and mur- dered a big percentage of their supreme court. They kill mayors, they kidnap, and they are doing it because of our drug abuse. This was not because they were using the narcotics. It is because we were using the narcotics, providing billions of dollars with which to arm the FARC, in particular, as well as other groups that are providing protec-tion. Now, in Colombia, President Uribe has made fairly dramatic changes and gone aggressively after the coca and heroin production. I would like a few of these things to be put in the R ECORD , because we had a fairly close vote in this House on assistance to Colombia because President Uribe is heavily under attack, he is trying to be aggres-sive, and lots of misinformation was distributed here about the ineffective-ness of what was happening. Now, here are a couple of key statis- tics. Terrorist attacks have increased in Colombia if you flatten the line, but they have in fact gone up and down. And basically they go up when you squeeze the coca and the heroin. So when we read in our newspapers, as there was yesterday and a few weeks VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 02, H3629 May 1, 2003 ago, as we had a few Americans kid- napped a month or so, 2 months ago, that when we read that, we need to un-derstand that those incidents are in-creasing when we are successfully pressing on the coca and the heroin. But, even with that, this govern- ment, President Uribe's government in Colombia has increased, almost dou-bled, the efforts to go after the illegal self-defense groups and so-called paramilitaries; they have gone aggres-sively after the subversive groups, in-creasing, in both of those cases, almost doubling the efforts of going after these terrorist groups. They have been so aggressive that while it seems like in the United States that we are read-ing more about Colombia because we have put money down there, the plain truth of the matter is that since Presi-dent Uribe started these attacks, though some of them are now getting more publicity because they are in Bo-gota or they are trying to go after Americans to try to get us to be squeamish, just like they initially tried to do with the attacks in Iraq, by trying not to win a war, but trying to back up the American people so we give up rather than going on through, these attacks have actually been dra-matically reduced under President Uribe. Whether it be kidnapping of mayors, they are down; whether it is kidnappings of people are down, the number of attacks on bridges are down, the number of attacks on schools are down, because they have a President who is being more aggressive and suc-cessful. But because of where they are doing some of them, because our atten-tion is up, it seems like it is not work-ing in Colombia when in fact it is working in Colombia. Let me give an example. One of the business groups from Colombia that was in my office when they were there and they had, a few years ago, under former President Pastrana when we had a so-called temporary peace agree-ment, they were there and the phone rang and one of them took it and at the school where many of their kids were, a pregnant mom and her daughter had just been trapped on a bridge and kid-napped; and they were each trying to check to see whether it was their fam-ily. This happens all the time. Gabriel Garcia Marques' book, ''Diary of a Kidnapper,'' talks about this particular phenomenon that has just gone rampant in Colombia. But the fact is that as we have a president there and a government committed to going after this, they have actually re-duced the number of incidents. The question is, will we in the United States Congress have the courage to continue this pressure, or can they, through public relations and high-pro-file attacks, convince the American people that we are actually losing in Colombia when we are actually win-ning the battle in Colombia? Furthermore, we have had the most dramatic reduction in coca that we have ever seen in Colombia. I have been down to Colombia seven times or nine times, I lose track. I got elected in 1994; I have been there at least once a year ever since then and sometimes twice, particularly the last few years as chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources. What we see in Colombia is a case like happened in Bolivia and Peru where often we will eradicate one time the coca crop, but we will not stay fo-cused, and because they can grow year around, they come back in with it. What President Uribe has done is he has basically hit these areas three times. Now, you can imagine if you are a farmer, think of it in terms like in the Midwest and Indiana and else-where, I am from Indiana, we have soy-beans and corn. And if we hit that three times, obviously, the corn grow-ers and the soybean growers would not be happy. They are used to being hit maybe once and going back to a very profitable crop. Just like kids on our street corners can make $400 as a lookout, but only, say, $6 at McDonald's, so they would rather be a lookout if there is not a punishment. But if you arrest them, if they are afraid they are going to get shot, if there is a penalty for being the $400 lookout, then maybe the $6 at McDonald's is not such a bad deal. You can work your way up and maybe someday get $20. You are never going to get $400 an hour most likely, but you are also not going to kill people with the illegal narcotics. Well, if there was not any pressure on the people growing it on a steady basis, like they sometimes grew palm heart or pineapples, and then you would see underneath it the coca hiding in the fields. Well, President Uribe has gone aggressively after it. His own wife and two sons at the inauguration after-wards, after they attacked the palace, they were panicked. They know that there is a good chance that their hus-band is going to be killed, or that they are going to be killed. They talked about coming to the United States and he said, no, we are going to stay here. We are going to go after these illegal drugs. The problem is the United States' problem, but we are going to go after them, because it is wrecking our country too. When somebody shows that courage, we need to show the courage in this Congress to stand behind them. There are some Members in this body who have gone to towns in Colombia and seen the terror. It is unbelievable. First one group comes through that is the leftist narcogroup, and they kill anybody who is not willing to help them. Then, groups that are often con-tracted initially to try to stop that group will come through and kill any-body who takes the other side. Pretty soon the group that was supposed to be providing the protection gets into narcotrafficking too, then they fight over who gets to have the little village. Several of my colleagues have visited those villages even this year, and there are several that are still overrun. But here are the facts. Since Presi- dent Uribe has taken over in Colombia, they have reestablished control over most of the country. The glass is not full; the glass is half full. It is not emptying out, however; it is filling up, and we are making progress. Now is not the time to turn and run. Now is the time to back up the bold people in Colombia and our advisors down there and say, we are going to go after the il-legal narcotics that are killing 30,000 Americans a year, and the biggest pres-sure point is Colombia. It used to be in the region. In the region, Colombia used to be only 30 percent. But as Bo-livia went after it and as Peru went after it, it moved to Colombia. Now, if we can take out Colombia, there is going to be some seepage back. Earlier this morning I met with a number of members of the Peruvian Parliament, as well as their military navy and army and talked about their worry about spillover. If we are suc-cessful in Colombia, will the coca and heroin production move to Peru? Pos-sibly. Possibly to Ecuador. Possibly back to Bolivia where the Cocaleros are fighting really hard and desta-bilizing the government of Bolivia. But it looks like a lot of it is moving to Venezuela on the north border, because President Chavez has been a weak President. He has been flirting most of the time with Castro, does not have the same commitment to help the United States and to go after terrorists in that nation. They are the biggest trading partner with Colombia. It is right up here on the north border. We have a huge stake in this. This area right here is the biggest oil provider to the United States or was until Chavez could not keep it flowing. If you go to a Citgo station in the United States, not that long ago, Ven-ezuela was running ads in all of our pa-pers saying we own the Citgo stations. So it was at that point about 12 percent of the U.S. market. To give you an idea, Alaska may be 3, Kuwait may be 2 or 3. Venezuela, in this area of Colom-bia, has one of the richest oil fields in the world. We cannot let that area be controlled by narcotrafficking. Plus straight to the north you move towards Florida and the Caribbean Sea as far as the transit area into the United States. We have to maintain control in Ven-ezuela and Suriname. And then, in the western side of Brazil where the Ama-zon basin is, you have mostly jungle, and it is very difficult. So if we squeeze in Colombia, some of it is going to move in that direction, and some is going to move in that di-rection, and some is going to move in that direction. So that is why we have an Andean strategy. But the primary focus is Colombia because they are peo-ple who have the labs that process it. And it is easiest and the cocaine comes into the United States cheapest and purest if it comes out of Colombia. If VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 02, H3630 May 1, 2003 we scatter them, at least we will get the prices up and the purity down. I next want to move to the Caribbean Sea. As it comes out of the Andean re-gion, it can move several ways. About a third moves through the Caribbean Sea, about two-thirds through Mexico. And when it comes into the Caribbean out of Colombia down here, it moves up; and the biggest vulnerability we have are all of these Bahamian islands. There are a thousand islands. They can pick which island they want to come in on. By the way, everything I say today about narcotics and narcotics terror-ists are also true about Islamic or any kind of terrorists; IRA, anybody who wants to hit us. Because if we cannot find a drug person coming in, we also cannot find an al Qaeda person coming in. If we cannot find an illegal immi-grant coming across the Mexican bor-der, we also cannot find an al Qaeda person coming across the Mexican bor-der. It is one and the same. So when we are talking about illegal narcotics and we are talking about ter-rorism, we are not only talking about the primary way terrorists are funded, we are talking about how they get into our country. And while we do not talk about specific incidents, let us just say we have been intercepting them com-ing in the south and the Mexican bor-der as well as the primary method which would be the Canadian border or our airports. But as they come through, you have major points. Do-minican Republic. They have huge net-works of Dominicans in the United States where they can hide among. Most Dominicans would not be in-volved in drug trafficking; but where there are big communities, a few peo-ple can get involved with that. Similar with Jamaican communities, and simi-lar with Puerto Rican communities. b1700 So in certain areas, for example Ja- maica is the primary transit to Eng-land. In this sea of islands, some are very small. Some are Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese. Most of those countries are part of the European Common Market. What Libya, for example, has figured out is that if they move people into these islands, in a period of years they become citizens of those islands. When we look at their visas to try to see if they are part of a terrorist-supporting nation, such as Libya, they do not show up as Libyan; they show up as Eu-ropean. For example, Curacao is Dutch. If they can get citizenship on a Dutch is-land and get European citizenship, we do not flag them in our system as Liby-an; they are going to look like they are Dutch. It is a vulnerability on the south that we are going to have to fig-ure out in terrorism as well as in nar-cotics. But the Caribbean Sea is one of our vulnerabilities. Another, and the biggest transit point for most of the United States, is Mexico. Under President Vincente Fox, there has been a dramatic improve- ment in Mexico. It is still, bottom line, a mess; but a dramatic improvement. Their police forces are paid virtually nothing. Compared to the couple hun-dred thousand dollars they can be of-fered to let a semi load of narcotics go through, their salary is nothing. It is a fraction of the U.S. salary. Even U.S. salaries can be overwhelmed with the dollars that are being offered, so we have had an incredible corruption prob-lem along the border. The President of Mexico, under- standing that this was a tremendous pressure, has located additional forces there. He is aggressively trying to clean up the forces, but this is a huge challenge. Let me talk a little bit in particular about that fact that we have had a se-ries of hearings on the north and south border looking at homeland security issues. I also now serve on the new Se-lect Committee on Homeland Security. We will be holding a hearing in the Buffalo-Niagara area in conjunction with my Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Re-sources, which also has oversight over the Justice Department and other agencies, and the new Subcommittee on Infrastructure and Border Security chaired by my colleague, the gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. C AMP). We will be holding a hearing up on the north border. We have just held a hearing over here on Tohono O'odham Indian Nation lands in southwest Arizona, and then just during the last break we were down at El Paso where we had a hear-ing and spent about 4 days on the Texas border. Let me describe some of our chal- lenges on this border. Starting with California, San Isidro by San Diego is the biggest human cross point. More people cross at San Isidro than anywhere else. It is easy to hide to some degree just because of the sheer volume of people. But because we have a fence there now, we have changed some of the dynamic. Years ago, I believe in my second or first term when I was down in the area east of San Diego, I saw, at about 2 in the morning, approximately somewhere be-tween 800 and 1,200 people massed, ready to make a dash for the U.S. bor-der. Their penalty if we catch them is that they are detained to see if they have any other violations, and then they are sent back. I learned they had packages for $1,500 or $2,000 where you can get guaranteed that in 7 days you would make it through to the United States or you got your money back. That sounds ridiculous, but why would you not start to offer those packages? Why would capitalists not start to offer that if there is no penalty for con-stantly crossing, other than if you have another crime? Now, the fact is that what I saw that night was people playing frizbees, eat-ing their picnic lunches. For that pack-age they get a place to sleep, two meals, and they are guaranteed to make it in 7 days. Like I say, that was about 6 years ago. Over in Texas, we ran into the same thing. I think it is now $2,000 guaran-teeing the crossing in Texas. It does not always work, by the way. We are starting to crack down on those kinds of things. In particular, we are going after the people who are doing the packages. The fact is that those types of market things will develop. Unfortunately, some of the people now, because we have tightened the fence here and we do not see that mass-ing, they used to mass to about 1,200 and make a run at the five Border Pa-trol agents they would see, and most would not even get stopped. But as we put the fence up, as we passed more Border Patrol agents, we have moved it to the open lands, so at the Tohono O'odham Nation, west of Nogales and east of Yuma, in Arizona, in that area, west of Nogales and east of Yuma, we have basically sand. We have an Indian nation, and we have the Organ Pipe National Monument, where a ranger was killed in a shootout, one of the first of the rangers killed, a na-tional park ranger. We have a fish and wildlife area, and we have a little bit of the Barry Goldwater Air Force range where they do bombing runs. Now, what happens, because we have done a better job of sealing off Nogales, a better job of sealing off California, we are starting to make some progress over in the eastern side of Arizona in Douglas. What we see are these people who sell these packages and others try-ing to make a run through the desert. As we drove along this border a little over a month ago, we could see the peo-ple huddled getting ready to make their late afternoon run. We could see the fences cut. There was one area where it was just hard for me to conceive of this hap-pening. Unless Members see it with their own eyes, they may not believe it either. This is how bold some of the people on the border are. We have a barbed wire fence along the border. At one place, the farmer on the other side was having trouble keeping his cattle in, so he took the fence from our bor-der, put it across the road that runs across and over on his land in Mexico. We have not moved the fence back to the U.S. side because in fact it is serv- ing a good purpose. At least it is not getting cut this way. They go around the Mexican farmer, they go on the road, they have a clear way in, but it has detained more people on the Mexi-can side than it did on our side. But think of the boldness to actually steal the fence, move it, and claim it as their own property when it is a United States Federal Government protection border. It is snipped. We can see where they will make the runs in along the wash. One of the most popular hiking trails in Arizona is basically sealed off right now because so many illegals are mov-ing through, and it is so violent and so VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 02, H3631 May 1, 2003 many drugs are moving through that area it is not safe to backpack there right now. You can see discarded milk cartons, the larger plastic containers. If they are clear, it meant they were water; if they were black, it meant they were narcotics for a pick-up. We see trash all along the border as they discard it and move. Also, the poor illegals who are com- ing across are often misinformed. They have been dumped here on the border or have been told it is just a couple hours' walk to Phoenix. It is a couple days' walk to Phoenix across desert with no water or food, and we are hav-ing tremendous human casualties in this area because of the misinforma-tion of the people who want to take ad-vantage of the people who are coming across. When we were having the hearing in the little town of Sells, Arizona, when Members hear about narcotics busts in their hometown, think about this. We are having a hearing. We have the room filled with people from Phoenix and Tucson. We have, in effect, gath-ered the Customs and Border Patrol, the DEA, the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife, the local police, the State police in the town of Sells, which is a town of 5,000 people, or maybe 10,000 at maximum. And I may have doubled their population at 5,000. It is a relatively some small town, capital of the Tohono O'odham that used to be the Papago. This Tohono O'odham cap-ital had been complaining that as we squeezed other areas, drug runners were running through and destroying their Native American culture. While we were having the hearing, showing the stupidity of drug runners, if nothing else, they had one bust of 300 pounds, one bust of 500 pounds, one bust of 400 pounds; and at 100 they don't even bother with them. Later that night, a run of seven SUVs as we were leaving were coming across the border. They had two Blackhawks on them and another helicopter chasing them. They got most of them. One shot his way out. They got, I think, another 500 pounds. To put it in perspective, think of 500 pounds, and then take that in one day what they managed to catch was close to, I think, 1,400. The previous rest of the year had been 1,500. The previous year had been approximately 1,500. In other words, it has gone so exponen-tially to that open area. We do not really know how much is coming across these borders. Further-more, remember, in addition to funding the killing in narcotics, they are also funding primary sources for any ter-rorist networks. As we seize the assets of things like the Holy Land Founda-tion and other fronts, they move to il-legal monies, child trafficking and drug trafficking being the two primary. Secondly, wherever you can move narcotics, you can move weapons of mass destruction or anything else. In other words, if we cannot stop one, what makes us think we can stop the other? That is why we need to be more aggressive. That is why the President created the Department of Homeland Security. That is why he put Border Patrol, Customs, and Coast Guard agencies in the Department of Home-land Security, which is really the De-partment of Border Security. It does not have FBI, CIA. It is predominantly to focus on the border. We have to get control of this border. The Mexican border with Texas is a huge problem, as well. Long-term, we are going to have to have some real-istic discussions about immigration strategies in the United States, be-cause every State has been benefiting from having many of these low-income workers come in and take jobs that Americans do not want to take. We have duck and chicken processing plants in my district; and there is very little English spoken there, and not very many people who speak English will apply there. If we go to a gas sta-tion or motel almost anywhere in the United States, there are not a lot of people willing to take those jobs, just like our ancestors as they came in as immigrants took those jobs. We have to figure out how we are going to ac-commodate in a reasonable way those who want to come here to work and make a living here, most of whom send as much as 50 percent of their income back not only to Mexico, but Guate-mala, Honduras, Ecuador and other countries; and those who are coming in for illegal purposes to sell narcotics or to terrorize our Nation. If we cannot make that distinction between those who want to be law-abiding but are violating the immigra-tion laws and have some kind of bal-ance here, what we are going to have is just huge holes in our system that will move around, and we will never have enough money to seal this big a border. Now, this is, to be blunt, nothing compared to the problem on the ter-rorism side, the northern border, where we do not even have sand to serve as a deterrent, or the Rio Grande River. From Glacier National Park in Mon-tana to Lake of the Woods in Min-nesota, we have thousands of miles of basically flat, open land. The good news is if a terrorist walks across in northwest North Dakota we can probably see him from about 500 miles away. The bad news is that that is about how far it is to the next po-liceman. It is a huge challenge in these big open spaces of the Northwest as we look how to control, and as the narcotraffickers and other terrorists probe to see where our vulnerabilities are. We are constantly changing. We have a lot of methods they do not see, but we have to be aggressive. We have intercepted, on the terrorist side, probably 125-or-so attempts at us since 9-11. It is because we have done a better job of sealing our borders. With the PATRIOT Act, we have done a bet-ter job of getting people who are sus-pects who then talk about other people and breaking up the networks. Let me give the most famous exam- ple on the Canadian border, the Millenium Bomber. Had he succeeded at LAX Airport, more people would have died than at the World Trade Cen-ter. But he was intercepted, but it showed us how these networks worked. He was in Montreal and back and forth from the United States appar-ently multiple times. We do not know how many. He is the person who identi-fied some of the al Qaeda cells later, because after we captured him, he de-cided to sing; and it was not the na-tional anthem. He fingered the net-works of other places and other people. He had rented a car in Montreal, drove across all of Canada over to the West to Vancouver, then took a ferry from Vancouver to Victoria, then took another ferry in the late afternoon to Port Angeles, a small city in northwest Washington State right outside of Olympic Park. There Deanna Dean and the other Customs agents detained him. They thought he seemed nervous so they asked him a few questions. When they sealed his car, he decided to make a run for it. They intercepted him. They brought him back. They opened his trunk, and they thought they had a meth lab. It had lots of white powder substances, a cou-ple of big gallon jugs of some kind of materials. They carried it to their local station. It turned out it was two huge jugs of nitroglycerine, with maps of LAX Airport. He told of his plans, how he was to meet somebody else. Now, think of the challenges when somebody is willing to rent a car and move clear across the country, take two ferries, come late in the afternoon to a town of 14,000, and drive all the way from Seattle to Los Angeles to meet up with somebody else to do the attack; but we got him. The good news is that we were successful. The bad news is it is going to be hard to get all of them. What is true for narcotics, what is true for illegal immigration, is also true for terrorism. We have to be vigi-lant on the north border as well as the south border. Detroit and Buffalo are the two big- gest places where we have trans-shipments of goods. In Fort Wayne, In-diana, in my hometown, the GM plant, according to a former GM official, there are 100 crossings from Canada to the U.S. involved in the making of every pick-up, the largest pick-up plant in the United States. We cannot squeeze trade; we are too interconnected. We have to figure out how to do personal clearance systems, how to make sure they are monitored, how to have more VACA systems so we can see inside the trucks; so we have more drug dogs, bomb dogs, more methods to detect radiation devices. We have to make sure that our borders are secure from multiple threats to the United States, and the Canadian border is one of those critical things. VerDate Jan 31 2003 02:16 May 02, H3632 May 1, 2003 We have had multiple meetings, and this hearing in Buffalo will include sev-eral Canada parliamentarians, as did the one in Seattle and British Colum-bia, and the one in Quebec-New York and the Vermont border. We have huge problems on the north border that are actually growing. On the South border it has been open for a long time, and we are actually making that a little more secure. I am pleased that the Canadians are working with us, as well as, better than in the past, the Mexican authorities, although that is still problematic. Let me talk a little bit about a few other issues. I have spent most of the time on our borders and on the transit countries, but I want to conclude here with a few minutes looking at the ONDCP reauthorization, the Office of Narcotics Drug Control Policy. b1715 We have to be aggressive on the do- mestic side as well as the interdiction side. And as we look at this reauthor-ization, in addition to the Colombia money we will see, in addition to the Office of Drug Control Policy and the State Department, in addition to the multiple problems in the Justice De-partment, drug czar John Walters over-sees a broad range of programs. Several are specific inside ONDCP. One is the HIDTAs, the High Intensity Drug Traf-ficking Areas. To some degree this pro-gram has been diluted. While they are meritorious programs, these were sup-posed to provide our primary protec-tion. And unless Members of Congress and the American people understand some of what we laid out tonight, they will not understand what the purpose of a HIDTA is. Every area has a drug problem. Every area drug tracks. If you are in the southwest border, they will come across. If you are in Dallas, they will come through. If you are in the Mid-west they are transiting through. Fur-thermore, if you are in a city like Chi-cago, you become a supplier not only to Chicago but the Midwest. If you are in a city like Fort Wayne, you become a supplier not only to Fort Wayne, but the mid-sized cities around it like Muncie, Anderson, and Warsaw. If you are in Muncie you become a supplier to the mall. So every area is a drug traf-ficking area. But what was the point of this pro- gram? It was for the high intensity drug trafficking areas so we could, be-fore it gets to the Midwest, seize the stuff at the major ports and major ports of entry. But this has become a pork program where everybody wants a HIDTA. Therefore, once everybody has it, it is not that it is not doing good work, but we are losing the point of the program which was to seize it at the highest intense area before it got to those areas. We are going to be looking at some of those hard issues and lots of Congress-men are going to receive local pressure to say, oh, we have a drug problem. We know that. That is why we have com- munity drug initiatives. That is why we have all kinds of prevention pro-grams. That is why we have drug free workplace bills. That is why we have drug free school bills. We have local law enforcement, State police. This was a program intended particularly for the southwest border and the major drug trafficking areas so that it did not overwhelm us at the local level. Next, the National Ad Campaign. The National Ad Campaign has served a valuable function to make Americans more aware of the problems of drug use. We are inundated, with all due re-spect, by rock music, by much of what we see in the movies. I saw an article, I think it was yesterday, saying that we thought that the heroin look was out, but they are praising this new group that is coming in that has this emaciated death look that once again promotes intense drug use in the United States by promoting a look and an action that you get from basically destroying your body. To combat that we have to have an organized effort such as the anti-ter-rorism campaign which was very suc-cessful in making that link, the cur-rent anti-marijuana campaign which is one of the least understood issues in America, the dangers of this particular hydrochloride impact marijuana has on America. We need to make sure that ad campaign is functioning and targeted. We also have a very important tech-nology transfer program to make sure that local law enforcement gets the equipment that they need to be able to battle in these HIDTA areas and also at the local area. I have many small towns ranging from a couple thousand people up to 15,000 people that have been particu-larly pleased with the technology transfer program because they would not, in their small budgets, have been able to afford the type of equipment that they need to match up with these drug trafficking organizations that have billions of dollars behind them. So I want to conclude tonight by say- ing that this problem is complex. Over the next few weeks, we will be talking about this more and more on the floor as these pieces of legislation move. But what I do hope that my colleagues will not repeat on this floor is that we have failed because we have not. We have made steady progress, if you take a line with ups and downs in it for nearly 20 years. We have made steady progress in Colombia and the Andean region. But the more we squeeze the narco-traffickers, the more we squeeze the drug traffickers, the more violence there will be because we are actually hurting business. They cannot just write it off as a bad loss which they kind of do now because they abandon loads. But the more we squeeze them, they will not be able to abandon loads. The more we squeeze them the higher the prices are in the streets. The more we squeeze, the more the purity goes down, the less harmed our kids and families and people are, the more kids will have a dad or mom home that night who is not whacked out on drugs, the safer you will be as you drive down the highway. This is a very important effort that we were undertaking in Congress. Often it gets lost in all the others. But I hope the Members of Congress will focus on this because every dime we spend is likely to save another life in America. f LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of ab- sence was granted to: Mr. G REEN of Texas (at the request of Ms. P ELOSI ) for today after 3:00 p.m. on account of family business.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To- day's prayer will be offered by our guest Chaplain, the Rev. Canon Martyn Minns of Fairfax, VA. PRAYER The guest Chaplain offered the fol- lowing prayer: Almighty God, we thank You for blessing us as a nation. We pray that we would always be a generous people, eager to share the gifts of freedom, re-spect for human dignity, and commit-ment to service, with all the peoples of the world. We pray for all who suffer and are af- flicted in body or mind, especially those who face the devastation of HIV/ AIDS and the unfolding terror of SARS. Grant them healing and com-fort, and stir up in us the will and pa-tience to minister to their needs. We commend to Your gracious care all the men and women of our Armed Forces. Defend them day-by-day with Your heavenly grace, and give them a sense of Your abiding presence wher-ever they may be. We thank You for the men and women of this Senate, and for all who serve in this place. Grant them the spirit of wisdom, charity and justice; that with steadfast purpose they may faithfully carry out the work set before them. All this we pray because of the love first shown us in the call of Abraham and Sarah and now revealed to us in the life and witness of Jesus the Christ. Amen. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Honorable T EDSTEVENS led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUNUNU ). Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. f RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah is recognized. f SCHEDULE Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this morn-ing the Senate will resume consider-ation of the Owen nomination. Under the order, at 10:15 the Senate will pro-ceed to a rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a circuit judge for the Fifth Circuit. If cloture is not in-voked, the Senate will begin consider-ation of the nomination of Edward Prado to be circuit judge. It is hoped we will reach a short time agreement with a vote on that nomination to occur by early afternoon. In addition to the Owen and Prado nominations, the Senate may also con-sider the Cook nomination. As the ma-jority leader stated last night, we have attempted to work out a unanimous consent agreement to process these ju-dicial nominations. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach an understanding last night. There continues to be hope that as these nominations are consid-ered we would be able to reach reason-able time limitations for their consid-eration. In addition, the leader is still work- ing toward agreements for considering and completing a number of other leg-islative matters, including the FISA legislation, the State Department au-thorization bill, the Bioshield legisla-tion, or additional judicial nomina-tions during today's session. Therefore, Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day. MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\u2014S. 14 AND H.J. RES. 51 Mr. HATCH. I understand there is a bill and a joint resolution at the desk which are due for a second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent it be in order to read the titles of the measures en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will read the titles of the bills en bloc. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 14) to enhance the energy secu- rity of the United States, and for other pur-poses, A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 51), increasing the statutory limit on the debt. Mr. HATCH. I ask that the Senate proceed en bloc to the measures, and I object to further proceeding en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob- jection having been heard, the bills will be placed on the calendar. Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question? Just on the matter of timing. Mr. HATCH. I will be delighted. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a markup at 9:30. I wanted to make a 5- minute statement on the judicial nom-ination. If we can do that and I will give Senator H ATCH that 5 minutes back on his time, would that be accept-able? Mr. HATCH. I think the 5 minutes will be taken from the minority side. Mrs. BOXER. Yes, that is what I sug- gested. Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield so the Senator can make her statement. Mrs. BOXER. That is very kind. I ap- preciate it. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5620 May 1, 2003 EXECUTIVE SESSION NOMINATION OF PRISCILLA OWEN TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session. The clerk will report the pending business. The legislative clerk read the nomi- nation of Priscilla Richmond Owen, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 hour of debate divided in the usual form, prior to the vote on the nomina-tion of Priscilla Owen to be circuit court judge for the Fifth Circuit. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I again thank my colleague for allowing me to move forward on this because of a com-mitment to a markup in the Commerce Committee. I rise to express my deep concerns re- garding the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have noted there is a lot of politics around this particular nomina-tion, as there is around the Miguel Estrada nomination. I read the Repub-lican Party is planning to run ads against those of us who vote against these nominees, saying we do not want to see diversity on the bench. Let me say that is extraordinary be- cause as someone who worked so hard to support qualified minorities and women, I have been praised by many in my State for doing just that. But I have to tell you, if you place on the bench a minority or a woman who has animosity toward the goals of minori-ties and women, you are dealing a great setback to both minorities and women. I will make that point when I have to. But as for today, I point out I voted for well over 90 percent of the Presi-dent's appointees up to this point in time, but I cannot support this nomi-nation. This is why. President Bush pledged to govern from the center. Those were his words. Yet this nominee is so far from the center that she is almost off, to the right. She is barely on that line at all. That differs from the mainstream val-ues of my constituents and I believe of the majority of Americans. In such important areas as reproduc- tive rights, civil rights, consumer rights, and environmental protection, this nominee has legislated from the bench. She inserted her personal beliefs into the judicial process. I have to say even members of her own party, and even Mr. Gonzales, who is White House counsel, has criticized her for that. What is particularly troubling to me is that I believe in the advice and con-sent role of Senators in the nomination and the confirmation of judicial nomi-nees of any President, be that Presi-dent a Democrat or a Republican. As we have heard many times from histo- rians, the selection of judges and the confirmation of judges is a shared re-sponsibility. So it is not a question of whether they are Clinton judges or Carter judges or Bush judges; they are America's judges. As such, there has to be a role for the Senate and for the ex-ecutive. This President knew very well that this particular nominee was well off the center. He knew very well there was deep objection to her. She was voted down once before. Yet he comes right back with this nomination. I have made it a priority of mine in this Senate to stand up for the main-stream values of people of my State. So I cannot possibly support this nomina-tion. I wish to outline a case that illus-trates Priscilla Owen's callous attitude toward individuals who are fighting against large corporate interests and their well-paid legal defense teams. A young man in Texas was paralyzed in a car accident. His injuries were made much worse because of a mal-functioning seatbelt, and his family took the automaker to court. The case made its way to the Texas Supreme Court on appeal. Judge Owen waited 16 months before issuing a decision in that case, in that Ford Motor case. When she did, she es-sentially sent the case back and cre-ated a substantial roadblock for this paralyzed teenager to receive funds to pay for his medical care. There were 2 years of delay on a procedure issue that was never raised in the case but was raised by her, and this young man died. This young man died. His family couldn't afford around-the-clock moni-toring of his ventilator. This is a truly tragic example of delayed justice. I could go into detail about the fun- damental right to choose in which Jus-tice Owen set up a barrier to a young woman who was seeking to end her pregnancy. When she issued her opin-ion, it dealt with having to seek reli-gious counseling, which was not part of the law. In that case, Judge Gonzales, who as you know is White House coun-sel to this President, said: To create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism. That is a quote from Mr. Gonzales re- garding Judge Priscilla Owen, criti-cizing her for judicial activism. I know the issues of judges are very touchy. Senator H ATCH , when Presi- dent Clinton was President, told me\u2014 he said it with a twinkle in his eye: Senator, don't send me judges that are outside the mainstream. You know, I didn't. Senator H ATCH helped me. He helped me get these won-derful people confirmed. Now we have a circumstance where we are not getting our judges from the mainstream. We are getting some. I have supported 90 percent of these judges. But in this case\u2014\u2014 Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mrs. BOXER. I certainly will. I just want to finish my thought. In this particular case, I think this is a nominee who is outside the main-stream and who was criticized for that by the President's White House coun-sel. I am happy to yield to my friend. Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that there is an ample record that even Judge Gonzales admits he was not criticizing her as an activist, he was criticizing the court. She didn't write the opinion. That has been more than established. Yet we keep hearing Sen-ators on the floor of the Senate and elsewhere saying Judge Gonzales di-rectly criticized her. He didn't. I think the record is pretty clear on that. Mrs. BOXER. I will have printed in the R ECORD my understanding of what actually happened here. In the case of the 2-year delay, I find that was unconscionable. The point is this: I will support can- didates who are from the mainstream. I want to do that. The chair of the Ju-diciary Committee has changed his at-titude about who is going to get through this Senate. During the Clin-ton years, you had to have someone from the mainstream. During the Bush years, you can have people from the far right of the spectrum. My constituents do not think that is fair. We had a situ-ation during the Clinton years that two Senators had to sign off on a judge before there would even be a hearing. Oh, no, now the committee has changed its mind. Suddenly, because they have a Republican in the White House, two Senators don't have to sign off and they are pushing forward with hearings. It is wrong. It is not right. I would say regarding this particular nominee, you have very moderate Members of this Senate saying she is a judicial ac-tivist and any words to the contrary can be disproven by her record. I think this is someone who does not come from the center, does not come from the mainstream. I think this is a Presi-dent who, in this case, has not sought the advice and consent, really, of the Senate. He is essentially saying we don't care that you Democrats\u2014none of you\u2014vote for her. I should not say none\u2014maybe one. Certainly none on the committee. We are going to go right back and bring her back here. This is a lifetime appointee. I think when we make these types of appoint-ments, we have to make sure the per-son who is being nominated is not going to be an activist, make sure the person has demonstrated the types of qualities we want on the bench. I don't think it is a quality you want on the bench when a woman waits 2 years before she renders a decision in a case of a paralyzed teenager whose par-ents didn't have the money to keep their teenager on a ventilator. And the record shows otherwise? I know what the record is. We have people combing that record. That is why you are going to see very many women in this Senate take this floor. I will repeat, when you put a woman on the bench who has a VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5621 May 1, 2003 record of not really helping women\u2014I have seen it in this case, and I have seen it with other nominees who will be coming before us. I will take a sec- ond seat to no one in the advancement of women. Every time I have sought the support of bipartisan women's groups, I have gotten it because of that. Anyone who says Democratic women coming here speaking up against this nominee are not for women ought to study that record as well. I think the Federal courts deserve better than this nominee. I think the American people deserve better than this nominee. I could go on and on about the record. Let me briefly outline a case that il- lustrates Priscilla Owen's callous atti-tude towards individuals who are fac-ing large corporate interests and their well-paid legal defense teams. A young man in Texas was paralyzed in a car accident. His injuries were made much worse because of a mal-functioning seatbelt. His family took the automaker to court. The case made its way to the Texas Supreme Court on appeal. Justice Owen's unexplained 16- month delay in writing the court's opinion in the Ford Motor Company v. Miles case created a substantial road-block for this paralyzed teenager to re-ceive funds to pay for his medical care. Priscilla Owen was responsible for two of the five years of delay and finally issued a decision that was based on a procedural issue never raised in the case. All of her colleagues on the court believed she had improperly delayed the case. The young man died approximately seven years after his accident because his family could no longer afford round-the-clock monitoring of his ven-tilator. To date, his family has not re-ceived any funds. This is truly a tragic example of delayed justice. This is an unprecedented attempt to manipulate the Senate's role in the confirmation process. The Judiciary Committee re-jected this nominee last year. The committee performed its con- stitutional rule and voted against Jus-tice Owen. However, the White House renominated her to the same position. How could they not have gotten the message the first time? This process makes a mockery out of the Senate's constitutional ''advice and consent'' role. The blatant dis-regard of the Senate's constitutional role is leading us into uncharted terri-tory. Let me say this again that Jus-tice Owen was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee\u201410-9 on Sep-tember 5, 2002. The long list of concerns about her record that caused the ma-jority of committee members to vote against her last year still exist. I have made it a priority in my ca- reer to stand up for consumers and those who find themselves up against huge corporate interests. The people of California know all too well how dif-ficult it is to take on powerful compa-nies. The playing field is far from bal-anced. In other areas, Justice Owen has con- sistently attempted to chip away at women's fundamental reproductive rights. In the case of Doe I\u20142000\u2014Justice Owen argued that a minor must meet a restrictive standard to establish that she is sufficiently well informed about her choice to have an abortion. Among other things, she would have to show that she had received counseling about the religious arguments surrounding abortion, despite the fact that the law in no way involves religious consider-ations. The Texas statute states that a minor need not inform her parents be-fore seeking an abortion if the court finds one of three things. No. 1, that the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to make a decision; or No. 2, that parental notifications would not be in her best interest; or No. 3, that notification may lead to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. That is all it says. I have to go to a markup. But we can try to rewrite the facts all we want. We can rewrite and put another spin on it. We can say, oh, the criticism wasn't to-ward her, when in essence my belief is that was her point of view that was being espoused. But that is fine. I un- derstand this is a fight. I am willing to take this fight. I was very proud to say that the people in my State want me to stand up in these situations because it goes to the heart of the role of the Sen-ate and it goes to the heart of what kind of country we will have. It goes to the heart of what kind of judges we will have. Will they be compassionate? Will they be fair? Will they stand up for the rights of women? Will they stand up for the little guy against the big corporation? You have to look at this particular record. You are not going to find someone who doesn't. I thank my colleague, Senator H ATCH . I know he strongly disagrees with me. I think that is fine. But he is very kind to allow me to go first so I can go to my hearing for the reauthor-ization of the FAA. Thank you very much. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the Democratic time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished colleague. I have to say that if there has been any attempt to rewrite the facts, it is by those who have spoken as my friend from California has. First of all, they seem to think on that side that they advance women when they only advance women who agree with their particular position. They don't even realize that Priscilla Owen agrees with many of their posi-tions as she does with other well- thought-out positions. They think the advancement of women depends only on if you have women who are going to be pro-abortion. I might add that I don't know where Priscilla Owen is with regard to abor-tion because she has not told me. She has not told the committee that, but she has said what has to be the hall-mark of what judgeship nominees should say\u2014that she will uphold Roe v. Wade as a court judge, which is all you can ask of anybody. Regardless of what her personal views are, she is going to uphold it. Yet we hear this argument that they are advancing women be-cause they are keeping a woman who is unanimously well qualified by their gold standard\u2014the American Bar Asso-ciation, which is not a conservative or-ganization by any stretch of the imagi-nation\u2014they are keeping her from serving this country. They continue to misquote Judge Gonzales as though he was directly attacking Priscilla Owen when he himself admits he was not\u2014 and other judges from that Supreme Court of the State of Texas say he was not. Senator C ORNYN , who served with her and was sitting beside her, said those criticisms weren't directed directly at her. That is distortion. It is unworthy of this body. But it is going on all the time. On the tort case\u2014I know the distin- guished Senator from Texas is here, and I will yield to her as soon as she is ready\u2014they bring up again the distor-tion that she held a case up until this young boy died. Let me make some im-portant observations about the major-ity opinion Justice Owen wrote in Ford Motor Company v. Miles because I think there has been some serious con-fusion about the case and it is very ap-parent that the distinguished Senator from California is confused. This is the case involving a car accident victim named Willie Searcy who, tragically, passed away years after his accident but before the litigation was resolved. I have addressed this issue over and over. But it looks as if I must go through it again. The accusation was once made that the victim passed away before the Texas Supreme Court ruled on his ap-peal. Justice Owen more than set the record straight last July. The victim passed away 3 years after the opinion was issued. Yet we hear this again on the floor. When are the Democrats going to quit distorting President Bush's nomi-nee's record? I have to admit that I used to think this was\u2014well, just interesting. But it has gone on and on. And after you show them the facts, they still distort it. I would have thought that issue moot because the opinion was issued 3 years before he died. But some interest groups continue to make this allega-tion in spite of the facts. I suspect that the New York Times just copies the letters in the editorials of People for the American Way. It is unbelievable. The allegation was made that Justice Owen's opinion was improper based on the issue of venue; in other words, the question of whether plaintiff's lawyers filed the case in the county that didn't have jurisdiction over the dispute. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5622 May 1, 2003 Some allege that this issue had not been raised by the parties in the lower courts. Again, Justice Owen set the record straight in no uncertain terms. The venue issue was properly consid-ered in the Texas Supreme Court. The entire court agreed that it was appro-priate for the court to resolve the venue issue. Again, they are wrong, and they are distorting this case. I don't think there is any reason for that type of distortion. We have ex-plained it over and over. Justice Owen was more than clear. Yet they are smearing this judge who has the high-est rating of the American Bar Asso-ciation\u2014unanimously well qualified. That doesn't happen very often. It must also be emphasized that under Texas law the court was required to address the issue of venue. The court found that the case was filed in the wrong venue. It was required to reverse the verdict. It had no other option. The Texas statute governing this issue read: On appeal from the trial on the merits, if venue was improper, it shall in no event be harmless error and shall be reversible error. In other words, the court must re- verse if improper venue is found. In all honesty, to ensure there is no confusion about the problem with venue, let me say there was no ques-tion but that Dallas County was the proper place to bring the suit because the plaintiffs lived there, bought their truck there, and that is where the acci-dent took place. Inexplicably, the law-yers filed in another county, Russ County\u2014having absolutely no connec-tion whatsoever to the plaintiffs or the accident. It looked like forum shop-ping\u2014something that should not be permitted by the courts, under any cir-cumstances, no matter how badly a person might have been injured. If we read between the lines, we can see that the lawyers were forum shop-ping\u2014looking for a favorable jury\u2014 something that should not be allowed by any court in this land, especially when it is clear cut that the venue was in Dallas County. It must also be noted that the court's decision did not prevent the case from being filed in Dallas County or refiled. I am a little tired of the smearing of these nominees. I am not saying inten-tional smearing, although it is reach-ing that point when you have to say over and over, when the justice ex-plained herself and made it so abun-dantly clear, and we have made it over and over ourselves, and the record is so doggone clear. Why would we have, time after time, people coming out here saying they are advancing the cause of women by smearing this woman justice and keeping her from serving her country on the circuit court of appeals? One last thing: The Senator also complained because she has objected to another nominee when we have the blue slip back from the other Senator from the State. There has never been a rule, since Senator K ENNEDY was the chairman of the committee and was the one who established the rule that I followed, that says a single Senator can stop a circuit court of appeals nominee of the President of the United States. Senator K ENNEDY 's ruling, even with regard to district courts, was that the opinions of the Senators with regard to blue slips will have great weight, but they will not be dispositive, especially where there is no reason for the with-holding of a blue slip. And in this case, there is basically no reasoning, and in this other case of Carolyn Kuhl. So I want to set the record straight there. No President would agree to, and this Senate should not agree to, one solitary Senator, for political reasons, refusing to return a blue slip on a cir-cuit court of appeals court nominee where that circuit court of appeals nominee, once on the court, will be rep-resenting the whole country, but, of course, all the States in that particular circuit. I notice the distinguished Senator from Texas is in the Chamber, so I will yield\u2014\u2014 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Up to 10 minutes. Mr. HATCH. Up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas. I will continue my remarks afterwards. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Texas. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the chairman for yielding time to me to talk about someone I know well, someone I have observed over the years, and who is one of the most outstanding people I have ever seen nominated for a Federal bench. She is a legal scholar. She has the temperament for a judge. And I think nothing shows her temperament better than her demeanor during the ordeal through which she has been put. She has been held up since May 9, 2001. She has had two hearings\u2014not one\u2014in which she was grilled by mem-bers of the Judiciary Committee, and she came out spotlessly clean. And even Members who today are going to vote against her have said she is one of the most qualified legal scholars they have seen before their committee. In fact, I have to say, I think there are a number of Democrats who really think she should be confirmed, but they are being held back by the special interest groups and the pressures not to con-firm this qualified woman. Justice Priscilla Owen is an 8-year veteran of the Texas Supreme Court. She graduated cum laude from Baylor Law School. She earned the highest score on the Texas bar exam that year. She was a practicing lawyer before she was nominated for the supreme court. And she has been elected since her nomination and won over 80 percent of the vote of Texans and was endorsed by every newspaper in Texas. She enjoys broad support. The Amer- ican Bar Association, as the distin-guished chairman mentioned, has voted her unanimously well qualified. The Dallas Morning News called her record one of accomplishment and integrity. The Houston Chronicle wrote: She has the proper balance of judicial expe-rience, solid legal scholarship, and real world knowhow. This is exactly what we want in judges, people who have been in the real world, who have prac-ticed law, who know what it is to be in a courtroom and see two sides of the issue. She also has the academic quali-fications that you would want in a judge. I cannot think of any better quali- fication. She has been supported across the board by people with whom she has served, both Democrat and Republican. Let me read the words of former Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice John Hill, who also served our State as attorney general. He is a Democrat. He denounced the false accusations about Priscilla Owen's record by special in-terest groups. He said: Their attacks on Justice Owen in par- ticular are breathtakingly dishonest, ignor-ing her long held commitment to reform, and grossly distorting her rulings. Tellingly, the groups made no effort to assess whether her decisions are le-gally sound. He said: I know Texas politics and can clearly say that these assaults on Justice Owen's record are false, misleading, and deliberate distor-tions. In addition, another judge with whom she served on the Texas Supreme Court, Raul Gonzales, gave her a ster-ling endorsement. Two former State bar presidents who are women\u2014there have not been but three or four women State bar presi-dents, one of whom is Harriet Miers, who supports Justice Owen; she is now counsel to President Bush\u2014yesterday Colleen McHugh, a Republican, a former State bar president, and Lynne Liberato, a Democrat, a former State bar president, ringingly endorsed Jus-tice Owen. These are the people who have seen her in action, who have seen her opin-ions, who have worked before her court on both sides. They have won, they have lost, and they have given her the ringing endorsement. I think there are two areas where the other side has distorted the facts. It has continually been quoted, Judge Gonzales' opinion dissenting from the opinion of Justice Owen\u2014hers was the dissent; his was the majority\u2014in which he said he thought she was being judi-cially active. But Judge Gonzales is the very person who recommended her to the President for the Fifth Circuit slot because he looked at the totality of her record, and he felt that she was the best qualified person for this nomina-tion. He held her in such high regard that he singled her out and took her from the supreme court to suggest that she should be on the Fifth Circuit because he knows that she follows the law as she sees it and does not allow her per-sonal opinions to interfere, which is why I think she has been attacked by VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5623 May 1, 2003 the pro-abortion groups who misunder- stand her opinions. Texas has a parental notification statute on abortion. The law was passed in the year 2000. This is not pa-rental consent; it is parental notifica-tion. So in the years since the law was passed, the supreme court has been called upon to look at the lower court opinions. Justice Owen has voted with the majority 11 times out of 14. And, in fact, out of those 14 cases that have come before the court, only 3 have re-versed the lower court opinions. I think the reason Justice Owen has so adhered to the lower court fact find-ing is for the very reason we want her on the bench; that is, that she believes the trier of fact is the court that should make the decisions on fact; and unless there is a reason to believe that lower court has misconstrued the in-tent of the legislature under the law, that court should not be reversed. Even if she believes that maybe the court made a mistake on the facts, she does not put herself in the place of the fact finders since she is not the one who heard the facts in person. She is not a judicial activist. She is the opposite. In fact, her record shows that she has gone far beyond what most judges do not to put her personal opinions in place. I do not know what her views on abortion are. She has never told anyone what her views on abortion are because she does not ever intend to let her personal views skew an opinion on this very sensitive issue. She also said, in defending her record on these issues, that she took the Su-preme Court of the United States inter-pretation of the words that would de-fine when a young woman under the age of consent would be able to make the decision on her own without noti-fying her parents. She took the U.S. Supreme Court, which is exactly what a judge should do. So I think Justice Owen has been put into the political meat grinder in Washington, DC. Anyone in Texas you would ask\u2014now, I am not saying that everyone in Texas would say she is their choice; I am not saying that be-cause I have not talked to everyone in Texas about her in particular, but the vast majority of people who know her best, who have practiced before her court, who know the supreme court and what it takes to be a good judge, they have come up here, Democrats and Republicans\u2014not just Democrats and Republicans, leading Democrats and Republicans, the former Demo-cratic attorney general, the former Democratic supreme court chief jus-tice, and another former Democratic justice on the supreme court\u2014they have come forward to say she should be confirmed, that they support her, that she is the right kind of person for a judgeship. I hope we will be able to meet the 60- vote standard the Democrats are now setting for many judges. That 60-vote standard is wrong. It is against the Constitution. She deserves a vote. She should have the 51-vote standard as the Constitution intended. I hope the Democrats will give her that chance. She is the most qualified person for this position we could ever put for-ward. I know her personally. I know her integrity. I know what a wonderful human being she is. I have seen her de-meanor as she has gone through this meat grinder. I hope the Senate will give her the dignity she deserves and confirm her today. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, how much time do I have? The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. M UR- KOWSKI ). The Senator from Utah has 11 minutes remaining. Mr. HATCH. Let me continue then. This body is in danger of blowing up. I just read a letter Senator S CHUMER sent to the President yesterday sug-gesting that we should take this au-thority from the President to nominate the judges and set up judicial nomi-nating commissions in every State. There is no President in his right mind who would consider doing that. There is no reason a President should. To make a long story short, the Senate is broken. The process is broken. Senator S CHUMER admits it. He writes: DEARMR. PRESIDENT : Six months ago you described the judicial nomination confirma-tion process as ''broken'' and declared we have a ''duty to repair it.'' I could not agree with you more. The other side of this body under- stands this process is broken because they are filibustering now two of the President's nominees for the first time in history. Both of these nominees, Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen, have unanimously well qualified ratings from the American Bar Association, which during the Clinton years the Democrats were saying was the gold standard. Once they have a qualified rating, which is a passable rating, they should be confirmed. These two not only have qualified, they have well qualified, and unanimously. Only a se-lect few have achieved that rating. It is outrageous that we hear again and again, without a single pause, that a nominee rated unanimously well quali-fied for Federal judicial service is ''out of the mainstream.'' Those who have served with her on the Texas Supreme Court know that charge is false. Former Texas Supreme Court Justices John Hill, Jack High-tower, Raul Gonzalez, all Democrats, call Justice Owen unbiased and re-strained in her decisionmaking, and they praise her impeccable integrity, character, and scholarship. Senator C ORNYN , whom we all re- spect, who served with Justice Owen on the Texas Supreme Court, has made it clear that the charge is false. Alberto Gonzales, who also served with Justice Owen, said the charge is false. Senator C ORNYN and Judge Gonzales believe Justice Owen is a terrific judge. The two individuals who are repeatedly drafted as prosecution witnesses to dis-credit Justice Owen as an activist judge, Judge Alberto Gonzales and Sen-ator C ORNYN , are actually two of her biggest supporters. All you can con-clude is that they are smearing this very fine, unanimously well qualified woman in their comments and also through this filibuster. Nothing can change the fact that the two they use to criticize her are her biggest sup-porters. I fit in that category, too, as one of her biggest supporters. No matter how hard they try, they cannot distort that. The unqualified endorsement of 15 past presidents of the Texas State Bar, Democrats and Republicans alike, also shows that the charge is false. Justice Owen is a well qualified, mainstream jurist. And to say that the bar association is wrong, all these Democrats down in Texas are wrong, shows the paucity of the argu-ment. Some criticize a few rulings made by Justice Owen in some parental notifi-cation cases which involve a minor girl seeking an abortion. This is really the basis of it because my colleagues on the other side are getting so enamored with abortion that that becomes the single litmus test on every judge. And they are so afraid that this woman judge might be pro-life, even though I don't know what she is and she didn't say what she believes, but she did say she would follow Roe v. Wade as settled law. I don't know what more you can have. And because she is unanimously well qualified for honor, integrity, im-peccability, and so forth, we can take her word for it. Texas happens to have a statute re- quiring that a minor notify one parent before she has an abortion. The statute allows the minor girl's parents to be involved in this very important deci-sion. Our colleagues on the other side apparently don't think that is a good idea. It upholds the right of parents in the upbringing and care of their chil-dren, and the American people support the principle. According to a January 2003 CNN/ USA Today/Gallup poll, 73 percent of Americans favor requiring minor girls to obtain parental consent before ob-taining an abortion. The Texas statute doesn't even go that far; it requires only notice. This broad support is also found in the individual States. Cur-rently, 32 States across the country en-force laws requiring parental involve-ment in a minor girl's decision to ob-tain an abortion. Fully 18 States en-force parental consent laws, including Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, North Dakota\u2014where both parents must consent\u2014Rhode Is-land, and Wisconsin. These are States represented in the Senate by both Re-publican and Democratic Senators, pro-life and pro-choice Senators. These are States inhabited by people of a va-riety of beliefs and positions. Simply being pro-life or pro-choice does not make a person out of the mainstream. That is the only argu-ment they have. How can you call VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5624 May 1, 2003 somebody who has a unanimously well qualified rating from the American Bar Association out of the mainstream? That is the height of absurdity, and it shows the ridiculousness of the argu-ment being used against her. Another 14 States have less stringent parental involvement laws requiring parental notification before a minor has an abortion, including the States of Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Texas, and West Virginia. New Hampshire, which is known as a pro-choice State because of widespread support for abortion rights among State citizens, is close to pass-ing a parental notification law. Nota-bly, the bill's main sponsor in New Hampshire openly supports abortion rights. Even in States with no laws requir- ing parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision, popular support for such legislation runs high. In the State of Vermont, more than 70 percent of State citizens support requiring a minor to notify her parents before hav-ing an abortion. You would think any-body with a brain would want to do that. These are kids. The parents ought to be involved. But by comparison, parental consent and notification laws are consistently opposed by the same abortion rights in-terest groups. These organizations are the ones that do not reflect the think-ing of mainstream America on parental rights. Mainstream America supports the fundamental rights of parents in the rearing of their children, including the right to be involved in their minor daughter's reproductive choices. The abortion rights interest groups, as they do over and over, predict doom and gloom if Justice Owen is allowed to take a seat on the Federal bench. They trot out the excited rhetoric about the nominee's hostility and extreme insen-sitivity to abortion rights. Occasion-ally they even top themselves. Accord-ing to one group, Justice Owen must be opposed because ''at this time of global turmoil, we don't need extremists in the courts willing to make a Dred Scott decision in the area of women's fundamental rights.'' Give me a break. I would be ashamed to make those arguments, yet that is what they are doing. They are smear-ing this woman with these kinds of ar-guments that fly in the face of the vast majority of people who believe parents do have some role with regard to their children, especially in something as important as whether or not their daughter should have an abortion. By now we know these outside groups' track record leaves much to be desired when it comes to predicting how judicial nominees will vote. These groups have cried wolf far too many times to be taken seriously any longer. We know they missed on Justice David Souter, Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Lewis Powell, when they pre-dicted at their hearings they would ig-nore the Constitution and put an end to freedom in America. No matter how much some would prefer to argue the point, these cases were not about the right to an abortion. The opposition to Justice Owen may show that the abortion litmus test is alive and well, but there was never any question about the girls' right to an abortion in these cases. Indeed, Justice Owen argued in one such case that, based on Supreme Court precedent, a statute requiring a girl to notify both parents would also be questionable under the Constitu-tion. She even went that far toward their position. Justice Owen recognizes a woman's right to obtain an abortion. She said so explicitly. Yet, they treat her like she is going to throw out Roe V. Wade all by herself and ignore prece-dent. Justice Owen has been well within the mainstream of her court in the 14 decided notification cases, joining the majority judgment in 11 of those cases. And out of the close to 800 bypass cases since the Texas statute was passed, a mere 12 girls out of 800 have appealed all the way to the Texas Supreme Court. These are usually the toughest cases. The Democrats take the position that they ought to all be decided against the parents and in favor of the girl or of abortion rights. My gosh. By this time, two courts\u2014the trial and the appeals courts\u2014have already consid-ered the bypass petition and turned it down. In other words, the right of a court to give a girl a bypass to avoid having to tell her parents. In these cases, they turned them down. Given the deference appellate courts must pay to the findings of the trial court, the decision is likely to affirm the lower court rulings denying a bypass. That should be no great surprise. Certainly, Justice Owen and her col- leagues on the Texas Supreme Court disagreed in some cases\u2014that is no sur-prise either; that happens on State su-preme courts\u2014but in all cases there was a genuine effort to apply applica-ble precedent. These parental consent cases show Justice Owen takes Su-preme Court precedent seriously. She looks to precedent for guidance, she cites it, and she makes a good faith ef-fort to apply it to the case at hand. She is a judge who defers to the legisla-ture's considered judgment in their policy choices and earnestly seeks to ascertain legislative intent in her rul-ing. None of her opinions, to quote the Washington Post, ''seem[s] to us [to be] beyond the range of reasonable judicial disagreement.'' What is beyond the range of reason- able disagreement is the charge that Justice Owen is not qualified to sit on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. A native of Texas, Justice Owen at- tended Baylor University and Baylor University School of Law. She grad-uated cum laude from both institu-tions. She finished third in her law school class. Justice Owen earned the highest score on the Texas bar exam and there-after worked for the next 17 years as a commercial litigator specializing in oil and gas matters. Justice Owen is known for her serv- ices for the poor and for her work on gender and family law issues. Justice Owen has taken a genuine interest in improving access to justice for the poor. She successfully fought with oth-ers for more funding for legal aid serv-ices for the indigent. Justice Owen is committed to cre- ating opportunities for women in the legal profession. She has been a mem-ber of the Texas Supreme Court Gender Neutral Task Force, and she served as one of the editors of the Gender Neu-tral Handbook. Incredibly, this is the same woman the usual interest groups mischaracterize as ''anti-woman.'' Justice Owen's confirmation may not be cheered by the well-funded and par-tisan Texas trial-attorney interest groups, but she is backed by Texas law-yers such as E. Thomas Bishop, presi-dent of the Texas Association of De-fense Counsel, and William B. Emmons, a Texas trial attorney and a Democrat who says that Justice Owen ''will serve [the Fifth Circuit] and the United States exceptionally well.'' Justice Owen has served on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994, winning re-election to another 6-year term in the year 2000 with 84 percent support. This kind of support\u2014running across the board and across party lines\u2014 leaves no doubt that Justice Owen is a fair-minded, mainstream jurist. Mr. President, Justice Priscilla Owen will be a terrific Federal judge. As I said earlier, we have a choice this morning. Will we block another highly qualified nominee for partisan reasons or will we allow each Senator to decide the merits of the nomination for him-self or herself. I know my choice: we should allow a vote. I hope my col-leagues will do the right thing and make the same choice. I will conclude by saying, look, when I hear on the other side that they are standing up for women's rights, while they are rejecting one of the leading woman jurists in the Nation who has said she will uphold their wonderful standard of Roe v. Wade, I have to say that is pure bunk. It is time to quit smearing these judges. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont is recognized. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time is available to the Senator from Vermont? The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 15 seconds remaining. Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distin- guished Presiding Officer. Madam President, I regret we have to be here today, but we are here because the President has picked another fight with the Senate by renominating a di-visive and controversial activist to an-other circuit court. That is regrettable. The Republican leadership in the Sen-ate is forcing this confrontation at this time, and it is neither necessary nor constructive. I am sorry the White VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5625 May 1, 2003 House has chosen to make these mat- ters into partisan political fights, rath-er than working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to fill judicial vacan-cies with qualified consensus nominees. I have been here with six Presidents. Five of them, from both parties, would work with members on both sides of the aisle for consensus nominees. This is the first President who has not. De- spite what is really a historic low level of cooperation from the White House\u2014 and it is the lowest level of cooperation from any White House I have ever had experience with in my 30 years in the Senate\u2014we have already confirmed 120 of President Bush's judicial nominees. We have confirmed 120. We have re-jected 2 out of 120. That is not a bad record. Some of them we voted for, in-cluding some of the most divisive and controversial nominees sent up by any President. So 120 passed, 2 are being held up. I don't know where that shows an obstructionist Senate. This week the Senate debated and voted on the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit. This was a divisive one, and I think the fact that it is so divi-sive is shown by the fact he got the fewest number of favorable votes of any confirmation in almost 20 years\u2014 barely a majority. He got 52. That is the lowest number of votes any judge has had in about 20 years. That reflects the fact we have reached the point in the queue where many of these nomi-nations divide the American people and the Senate far more than they unite us. I urge the President to be a uniter, not a divider. This is the third con-troversial judicial nominee of this President against whom more than 40 negative votes were cast. Our Senate Democratic leadership is working hard to correct some of the problems that arose with some of the earlier hearings and actions of the Ju-diciary Committee this year. Just yes-terday, we were able to hold a hearing on the nomination of John Roberts to the District of Columbia Circuit. He was put in almost as an afterthought. There was a massive day of hearings, and he was not able to get a full hear-ing. This was done by the Republican leadership. I appreciate the fact they recognized that was wrong and they had another hearing yesterday. We are all working hard to complete com-mittee consideration of that nomina-tion at the earliest opportunity. The distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said he will put off that nomination today for a hearing sometime next week, and we will have a vote on him. I am optimistic our leadership will be able to work out a procedure for Sen-ate consideration of the nomination of Deborah Cook to the Sixth Circuit. So a number of controversial nominations are being considered. I point out there are other nominations, such as that of Judge Edward Prado of Texas, a distin-guished Hispanic jurist. Every Demo-cratic Senator said they are willing to go forward with a vote on him. He has been held up on the Republican side. I don't know if we are going to be blamed for holding up this judge or not. We have all agreed we are ready to go forward with a short time agree-ment and a vote. He will be confirmed. He is not being held up on the Demo-cratic side, but by the Republican side, even though he is one of President Bush's nominees. There is also Judge Cecilia Altonaga, on whom we have been seeking consid-eration for some time. I hope the Re-publican leadership will let them go forward. We are making progress. The glass is not full, but it is more full than empty. More has been achieved than some want to acknowledge. There have been 120 lifetime confirmations in less than 2 years. That is better than in any 2- year period from 1995 through the year 2000. Why do I mention that time? Be-cause the Republicans were in charge and President Clinton was the Presi-dent. We have done better in less than 2 years than in any 2-year period when they were in charge. This time, 17 months of that was under Democratic control, where we set a record with the number of Senatorial confirmations of Presidential nominations. We have reduced judicial vacancies to 48, which is the lowest percentage in more than 12 years. During the entire 8-year term of President Clinton, the Republicans never allowed the vacancy rate to get this low. We have made tre-mendous progress. The Republicans continue their drumbeat of political recriminations. We ought to talk about how far we have come with the 110 vacancies Democrats inherited from the Repub-lican majority in the summer of 2001. We have cut those vacancies in half. Under the Republican majority, cir- cuit vacancies more than doubled and overall vacancies increased signifi-cantly. Despite the fact that more than 40 additional vacancies have arisen since the summer of 2001, we have cut those vacancies by more than in half, from 110 to 48. If we had a little bit of cooperation from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and from the other side of the aisle, we could achieve so much more. This is a nomination that should not have been made in the first place and never should have been remade in the second place. It was rejected by the Ju-diciary Committee last year after a fair hearing and extensive and thought-ful substantive consideration. I think the White House would rather play pol-itics with judicial nominations than solve problems. This unprecedented re-nomination of a person voted down by the Senate Judiciary Committee is proof of that. I thank the Democratic leader, the assistant leader, and my Democratic colleagues who have spoken so elo-quently and passionately to these mat-ters. Particularly the statements of Senators M IKULSKI , M URRAY , C ANT- WELL , and S TABENOW yesterday were outstanding. This nomination is extreme. This nominee has shown herself to be a judi-cial activist and extremist even on the very conservative Texas Supreme Court where her conservative col-leagues have criticized her judgements as activist. They have done it not once, not twice but again and again. The nomination process starts with the President. It is high time for the White House to stop the partisanship and campaign rhetoric. Work with us not to divide us but to unite us, and work with us to ensure the independ-ence and impartiality of the Federal judiciary, something that Presidents have cherished for over 200 years, so that all the American people, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, rich, poor, White, Black, plaintiff or defendant, can go into every Federal courtroom across the country and know that they will receive a fair hear-ing and justice under the law; that they will come into the one place that is supposed to be impartial, the one place that is supposed to be non-political, the one place that is supposed to look only at the litigants and the law, and so they will not go instead into a politicized, partisan Federal ju-diciary. That would be a mistake that would hurt us all and that is what we are trying to avoid now. How much time is remaining on this side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes twenty seconds remaining. Mr. LEAHY. I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished sen-ior Senator from New York. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I want to thank our leader on the Judici-ary Committee for his indefatigable ef-forts to keep the bench nonpartisan, or bipartisan, or at least moderate, as much as he has done. History will look back very kindly on the leadership of the Senator from Vermont and say that he made a courageous fight. Many of us are proud to be at his side in that fight. I will speak for a few minutes about the nomination of Judge Owen. The issue is not whether Judge Owen is a conservative; it is whether she will take her own views and subrogate them to the views of what the law is. If we look at her history, time and time again Judge Owen has been unwilling to follow the law and instead impose her own very conservative ideology on the courts. She is clearly not a mod-erate, but it is not even that she is a conservative that bothers many of us. I have voted for over 100 judges that the President has nominated, and the vast majority could clearly be classified as conservative. In fact, what worries us about Judge Owen is that she is what conservatives used to excoriate, an ac-tivist, somebody who will impose her own views because she feels them so strongly and passionately. I respect people who feel things pas- sionately. I do. But when someone is a judge, that is not what they should bring to the bench. It is not really pas-sion, except in rare instances, that VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5626 May 1, 2003 serves the bench well. It is, rather, an ability to understand the law and fol-low it. I do not have many doubts that Judge Owen understands the law. She is a bright person. I have very real doubts whether she will follow it. Conservative members of the Texas bench, none other than Judge Gonzales, now the President's counsel, have pointed out in instance after in-stance where Judge Owen has simply gone far afield and imposed her own views rather than do what the Found-ing Fathers wanted. I speak of the Founding Fathers, and it is a timely coincidence that our leader from West Virginia has come in. He has been the guardian of the Constitution, and he could tell us better than anyone else that the Founding Fathers asked\u2014 judges to interpret the law, not make law. The great irony, as we go through these debates, is that in the 1960s and 1970s the hue and cry of people of Judge Owen's philosophy was that judges are making law from the bench. I had some sympathy for those argu- ments then. I have sympathy now, even though I might be very sympathetic to the laws they were making. But now, all of a sudden we have had nominee after nominee who are not activists from the left but activists from the right. It is quite logical that if one is on either the far left or the far right, they will have much more of a desire\u2014 there are exceptions to every rule but much more of a desire to impose law rather than interpret law, and of all the nominees who have come before us, Judge Owen seems to be the apotheoses of that view because in case after case that is exactly what she has done. Many of us believe, for instance, that Miguel Estrada would do the same thing, but he does not have a record and he refuses to answer questions. But with Judge Owen, the record is crystal clear that in instance after instance she has not subrogated her own per-sonal feelings but, rather, let them dominate her decisionmaking. That is not what a judge ought to be. We will defeat this motion for clo- ture, and I am glad we will. History will look kindly on that as well be-cause never has a President of the United States been more ideological in his selection of judges, never. I have been studying the history and for the first time, this President\u2014 whether because he wants to win polit-ical favor of the hard right or because he believes it himself, I do not know; I have not discussed it with him\u2014this President wishes to change America through the article III section of Gov-ernment, the judiciary. And so nomi-nee after nominee is not just a main-stream conservative but somebody who wears their views on their sleeve and is not at all shy about imposing those views on court decisions. So those of us on this side who are opposing Judge Owen, and some of the other judges, believe that we are fight-ing for the Constitution, we are fight-ing for what the Founding Fathers in- tended judges to be, we are fighting a President who is more ideological in his selection of judges than any, and we will continue this fight. I have seen our caucus. We were hesi- tant when we took the first steps. We are stronger. I think we feel this issue more passionately than before, not at all for political reasons. I can't tell you where the political chips fall out on this one. It is a rather esoteric issue. A few people in America on each side feel strongly about the issue but most do not. We know we are doing the right thing. I am proud of our caucus. I am proud of this moment today. I think it is so important to try to get the President to back off this plan, which is so out of the thinking of the Founding Fathers, to make law from the one nonelected section of the Government, the judici-ary, the article III section. So I will stand proudly today and move that we not go to vote on Judge Owen, not because she has not an-swered questions. To her credit, she was more forthright than Miguel Estrada and, frankly, than John Robert of yesterday but, rather, because she does not represent the kind of judge the Founding Fathers wanted and America should have. I hope we can de-feat her. I yield my remaining time back to our leader from Vermont. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and also in opposition to ending debate on con-sideration of her nomination. I believe that a filibuster of a judicial nominee is an extraordinary measure, a step to be taken only in the most compelling circumstances. The case of Justice Owen is one of those rare situa-tions. In Justice Owen, we are pre-sented with a nominee whose record demonstrates that she is so far outside the mainstream and so clearly prone to substitute her personal preferences for the legally required result as to compel this conclusion. Our debate today is not, of course, the first time the Senate has consid-ered Justice Owen's nomination. She was nominated for a seat on the Fifth Circuit last year, and we held an exten-sive hearing at the Judiciary Com-mittee on her nomination. After meet-ing with her, and thoroughly reviewing her record and her testimony, I op-posed her nomination. Despite her de-feat in the Judiciary Committee last year, the President saw fit to renomi-nate Justice Owen for the Fifth Circuit once again this year. Nothing at her most recent confirmation hearing al-ters my conclusion that she is fun-damentally unfit for a federal appellate judgeship. My opposition to Justice Owen is not because of any doubts regarding her in-tellectual ability\u2014we all recognize her legal talents. And, unlike Miguel Estrada, my primary concern with re-spect to Justice Owen does not center on her unwillingness to answer ques-tions at her confirmation hearing. Quite the contrary: Justice Owen's an-swers to our questions made one thing crystal clear\u2014her consistent record of judicial activism, and her dem-onstrated willingness to substitute her judgment and policy preferences for those of the legislature. As Justice Owen's record became known last year, we grew increasingly concerned about her willingness to bend the law to suit her own strongly held opinions under the guise of ''inter-pretation.'' We should not be concerned that her views are conservative on many issues. However, when those be-liefs interfere with her ability to apply the law, we are forced to oppose her nomination. Merely reviewing the comments of her fellow Texas Supreme Court jus-tices compels us to the unfortunate conclusion she cannot be trusted to ac-curately interpret the law. In a variety of cases, her colleagues have criticized her opinions for not being grounded in the law. She is clearly and consistently outside of the mainstream in many cases. In an environmental case, FM Properties, she was criticized for bas-ing her arguments on ''flawed prem-ises'' and ''inflammatory rhetoric.'' In an age discrimination suit, Quantum Chemical, she was criticized by the ma-jority for not following the plain mean-ing of the statute. In a consumer law-suit, Texas Department of Transpor-tation, the majority criticized her, writing that ''the statute's plain mean-ing'' indicated that she was wrong. And, finally, in Doe I, a choice case in which she dissented, then Justice Alberto Gonzales called her dissent ''an unconscionable act of judicial activ-ism.'' There is a pattern to this criticism that should not be ignored. She repeat-edly alters the law to fit her views in ways that the legislature did not in-tend and that the majority of her own court condemns. We all know that the law is subject to interpretation and manipulation. The manner in which a judge interprets law is particularly important when considering a nominee to an appellate court. On the circuit court, subject only to the infrequent supervision of the U.S. Supreme Court, a judge has considerable leeway to make policy if she chooses with little concern of being overruled. Justice Owen's willingness to bend the law to suit her policy preferences are unacceptable, especially for a nominee to an appellate court judge-ship. Justice Owen's nearly decade long record as a Texas Supreme Court Jus-tice gives us little confidence that she will faithfully discharge her obliga-tions as a federal appellate judge. To proceed with Justice Owen's nomina-tion would mean taking the risk of placing on a Federal court of appeals for life someone who has repeatedly VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, S5627 May 1, 2003 demonstrated little hesitance to dis- regard clear statutory language to re-write the law to suit her personal pref-erences. This is a risk we cannot take. Anyone who reviews my record on ju- dicial nominations knows that I have not reached my decision to support ex-tended debate here\u2014indeed my deci-sion to oppose Justice Owen's con-firmation\u2014lightly. Justice Owen is only one of only seven judicial nomi-nees I have opposed in my entire 14 years in the Senate. But this nominee's extreme record leaves me no choice. I will vote to oppose cloture on her nom-ination. Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain why I will vote against cloture on the nomination of Priscilla R. Owen to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Ms. Owen's record reveals that she is a judicial activist and an ideologue. As newspaper editorials and several of our colleagues have pointed out, she has created a strong record of rewriting the law when it does not match her per-sonal convictions and beliefs. For those reasons, she does not deserve a life- time appointment to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. I cannot in good con-science, exercising my duty under the Constitution, allow her to be appointed to as powerful and influential a body as the Fifth Circuit. Appointees to the Federal bench must be able to set aside their personal philosophies and beliefs. They must be able to administer and enforce the law in a fair and impartial manner. Be-cause the U.S. Supreme Court hears fewer and fewer cases each year, the circuit courts are the court of last re-sort for many ordinary citizens and businesses. The circuit courts often have the last word on important cases dealing with civil rights, environ-mental protection, labor issues, and many others. Circuit court judges must demonstrate a record of integrity, hon-esty, fairness, and a willingness to up-hold the law. Ms. Owen fails this test. For example, Ms. Owen has published opinions and dissents that have drawn criticism from other conservatives and Republicans as inconsistent with the law or facts in front of her. We've heard over and over about her decision in FM Properties v. City of Austin, where the majority on the Texas Su-preme Court\u2014consisting of two current Bush appointees and current White House counsel Alberto Gonzales\u2014called her dissent ''nothing more than inflam-matory rhetoric.'' Additionally, in her dissent to the Texas Supreme Court decision In re Jane Doe 1, Owen proposed to require a minor to show knowledge of religious arguments against abortion. In a sepa-rate concurrence, Mr. Gonzales said that to the interpret the law as Owen did ''would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' The administration has every right to appoint judges who share the Presi-dent's philosophy and beliefs. That is entirely proper. However, that does not give the President the right to appoint judicial activists who have not dem-onstrated a respect for the law, or an ability to set aside their personal be-liefs in order to interpret the law in a fair and impartial manner. Additionally, a President has never resubmitted a previously rejected cir-cuit court nominee for the same va-cancy, as this President has with Ms. Owen. And, the Judiciary Committee for the first time approved a nominee that it had previously rejected. That nominee is Ms. Owen. So not only does her record of judi- cial activism disqualify her for a life- time appointment to the Fifth Circuit, her approval by the Judiciary Com-mittee and consideration by the full Senate is highly unusual and without precedent. For all of the above reasons, I must oppose Ms. Owen's nomination to the Fifth Circuit and vote against cloture on her nomination. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and no on cloture. I'd like to take a moment to explain my decision. There are a number of factors that I believe require us to give this nomina-tion very careful consideration. First, we should consider that judges on our Courts of Appeals have an enormous in-fluence on the law. Whereas decisions of the District Courts are always sub-ject to appellate review, the decisions of the Courts of Appeals are subject only to discretionary review by the Su-preme Court. The decisions of the Courts of Appeals are in almost all cases final, as the Supreme Court agrees to hear only a very small per-centage of the cases on which its views are sought. that means that the scru-tiny that we give to Circuit Court nominees must be greater than that we give to District Court nominees. Another important consideration is the ideological balance of the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit is comprised of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Fifth Circuit contains the highest percentage of minority residents\u2014over 40 percent\u2014of any circuit other than the D.C. Circuit. It is a court that dur-ing the civil rights era issued some of the most significant decisions sup-porting the rights of African American citizens to participate as full members of our society. As someone who be-lieves strongly in freedom, liberty, and equal justice under law, and the impor-tant role of the Federal courts to de-fend these fundamental American prin-ciples, I am especially concerned about the make-up of our circuit courts and their approaches to civil rights issues. Even after 8 years of a Democratic President, the Fifth Circuit had twice as many Republican appointees as Democratic appointees. that is because during the last 6 years of the Clinton administration, the Judiciary Com-mittee did not report out a single judge to the Fifth Circuit. And as we all know, that was not for lack of nomi- nees to consider. President Clinton nominated three well-qualified lawyers to the Fifth Circuit\u2014Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Alson Johnson. None of these nominees even received a hearing before this Committee. When then-Chairman L EAHY held a hearing in July 2001 on the nomination of Judge Clement for a seat on the Fifth Circuit, only a few months after she was nomi-nated, and less than 2 months after Democrats took control of the Senate, it was the first hearing in this com-mittee for a Fifth Circuit nominee since September 1994. Judge Clement, of course, was confirmed later in the year. So, there's a history here, and a spe- cial burden on President Bush to con-sult with our side on nominees for this Circuit. Otherwise, we would simply be rewarding the obstructionism that the President's party engaged in over the last 6 years by allowing him to fill with his choices seats that his party held open for years, even when qualified nominees were advanced by President Clinton. And I say once again, my col-leagues on the Republican side bear some responsibility for this situation, and they can help resolve it by urging the administration to address the in-justices suffered by so many Clinton nominees. One step in the right direc-tion would be for my Republican col-leagues to urge the President to re-nominate some of those Clinton nomi-nees that never received a hearing or vote in this committee. That includes Clinton nominees to the Fifth Circuit. With that background, let me outline the concerns that have caused me to reach the conclusion that Justice Owen should not be confirmed. Justice Owen has had a successful legal career. She graduated at the top of her class from Baylor University Law School, worked as an associate and partner at the law firm of Andrews and Kurth in Houston, and has served on the Texas Supreme Court since Jan-uary 1995. These are great accomplish-ments. But Justice Owen's record as a mem- ber of the Texas Supreme Court leads me to conclude that she is not the right person for a position on the Fifth Circuit. I am not convinced that Jus-tice Owen will put aside her personal views and ensure that all litigants be-fore her on the Fifth Circuit received a fair hearing. Her decisions in cases in-volving consumers' rights, worker's rights, and reproductive rights suggest to me that she would be a judge who would be unable to maintain an open mind and provide all litigants a fair and impartial hearing. Justice Owen has a disturbing record of siding against consumers or victims of personal injury and in favor of busi-ness and insurance companies. When the Texas Supreme Court, which is a very conservative and pro-business court, rules in favor of consumers or victims of personal injury, Justice Owen frequently dissents. According to VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5628 May 1, 2003 Texas Watch, during the period 1999- 2002, Justice Owen dissented almost 40 percent of time in cases in which a con-sumer prevailed. But in cases where the consumer position has not suc-ceeded, Justice Owen never dissented. At her first hearing, Senator K EN- NEDY and Senator E DWARDS asked Jus- tice Owen to cite cases in which she dissented from the majority and sided in favor of consumers. Justice Owen could cite only one case, Saenz v. Fidel- ity Guaranty Ins. Underwriters, 925 S.W. 2d 607, Tex. 1996. But Justice Owen's opinion in this case hardly took a pro- consumer position since it still would have deprived the plaintiff of the entire jury verdict. She did not join Justice Spector's dissent, which would have upheld the jury verdict in favor of Ms. Saenz. Also during that first hearing, Sen- ators F EINSTEIN and D URBIN questioned Justice Owen about Provident American Ins. Co. v. Castaneda, 988 S.W. 2d 189, Tex. 1998. In that case, the plaintiff sought damages against a health in-surer for denying health care benefits, after the insurer had already provided pre-operative approval for the surgery. Justice Owen, writing for the majority, reversed the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiff and rejected the plaintiff's claim that the health insurer violated the Texas Insurance Code and the De-ceptive Trade Practices Act. At the hearing, Justice Owen defended her opinion by saying that she believed that the plaintiff was seeking extra- contractual damages and that the plaintiff had already received full cov-erage under the policy and statutory penalties. But, in the words of her col-league, Justice Raul Gonzalez, who wrote a dissent, Justice Owen's opinion ''may very well eviscerate the bad- faith tort as a viable case of action in Texas.'' Id. at 212, Gonzalez, J., joined by Spector, J., dissenting. The cause of action for bad faith is designed to deter insurers from engaging in bad faith practices like denying coverage in the first place. In addition, with respect to several decisions involving interpretation and application of the Texas parental noti-fication law, I am deeply troubled by Justice Owen's apparently ignoring the plain meaning of the statute and in-jecting her personal beliefs concerning abortion that have no basis in Texas or U.S. Supreme Court law. In 2000, the Texas legislature enacted a parental notification law that allows a minor to obtain an abortion without notifica-tion of her parents if she demonstrates to a court that she has complied with one of three ''judicial bypass'' provi-sions: (1) that she is ''mature and suffi-ciently well informed'' to make the de-cision without notification to either of her parents, (2) that notification would not be in her best interest, or (3) that notification may lead to her physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. During Justice Owen's first confirma- tion hearing, Senator C ANTWELL ques- tioned Justice Owen about her posi-tions in cases interpreting this law, fo- cusing on Justice Owen's insistence in In re Jane Doe, 19 S.W. 3d 249, 264-65, 2000, Owen, J., concurring, Doe 1 (I)), that teenagers be required to consider ''philosophic, social, moral, and reli-gious'' arguments before seeking an abortion. In her opinion, Justice Owen cited the Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 1992, to support her contention that states can require minors to consider reli-gious views in their decision to have an abortion. But, as Senator C ANTWELL noted, Casey in no way authorizes States to require minors to consider re-ligious arguments in their decision on whether to have an abortion. Upon this further questioning, Justice Owen then said that she was referring to another Supreme Court case, H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. 398, 1981, even though her opin-ion only cited Casey for this propo-sition. And even Matheson does not say that minors can be required by state law to consider religious arguments. It is my view that Justice Owen was going beyond not only a plain reading of the Texas statute, but Supreme Court case law, and inappropriately in-jecting her own personal views to make it more difficult for a minor to comply with the statute and obtain an abor-tion. I was also not satisfied with Justice Owen's responses to my questions about bonuses to Texas Supreme Court law clerks. I asked her at the hearing whether she saw any ethical concerns with allowing law clerks to receive bo-nuses from their prospective employers during their clerkships. I also explored the topic further with her in followup written questions. Justice Owen stated repeatedly in her written responses to my questions that she is not aware of law clerks actually receiving bonuses while they were employed by the Court. She reaffirmed that testimony in her second hearing. This seems im-plausible given the great amount of publicity given to an investigation pur-sued by the Travis County Attorney of exactly that practice and the well pub-licized modifications to the Texas Su-preme Court's rules that resulted from that investigation and the accom-panying controversy. Even more disturbing, Justice Owen took the position, both at the first hearing and in her responses to written questions, that because the Texas Su-preme Court Code of Conduct requires law clerks to recuse themselves from matters involving their prospective employers, there really is no ethical concern raised by law clerks accepting bonuses while employed with the Court. I disagree. It is not sufficient for law clerks to recuse themselves from matters involving their prospective employers if they have received thou-sands of dollars in bonuses while they are working for the court. The appear-ance of impropriety and unfairness that such a situation creates is unten-able. As I understand it, the federal courts have long prohibited federal law clerks both from receiving bonuses dur-ing their clerkships and from working on cases involving their prospective employers. I'm pleased that the Texas Supreme Court finally recognized this ethical problem and changed its code of conduct for clerks. Justice Owen, in contrast, seems intent on defending the prior, indefensible, practice. Finally, I want to note the unusual nature of this particular nomination. Unlike so many nominees during the Clinton years, Justice Owen was con-sidered in the Judiciary Committee under Senator L EAHY 's leadership last year. She had a hearing, and she had a vote. Her nomination was rejected. This is the first time in history that a Circuit nominee who was formally re-jected by the Committee, or the full Senate for that matter, has been re-nominated by the same President to the same position. I do not believe that defeated judicial nominations should be reconsidered like legislation that is not enacted. After all, legislation can be revisited after it is enacted. If Con-gress makes a mistake when it passes a law, it can fix that mistake in subse-quent legislation. Judicial appoint-ments are for life. Confirmations can-not be taken back or fixed. A vote to confirm a nominee is final. A vote to reject that nominee should be final as well. For the President to renominate a defeated nominee and the Senate to reconsider her simply because of the change of a few seats in an election cheapens the nomination process and the Senate's constitutional role in that process. I believe Justice Owen is bright and accomplished. But I sincerely believe that based on her judicial record, Jus-tice Owen is not the right choice for this position. I wish her well in her continued work on the Texas Supreme Court, and I hope the President will put forward a nominee for this circuit who the committee can have con-fidence will enforce the law fairly and impartially to all litigants. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to my colleague from Utah, Mr. H ATCH , regarding Priscilla Owen's dissent in the case In re Doe, 19 S.W.3d 346, Texas 2000. Let me emphasize the fact that Jus- tice Owen wrote her own dissenting opinion in this case. Justice O'Neill de-livered the opinion of the court, joined by Justice Enoch, Justice Baker, Jus-tice Hankinson, and Justice Gonzales and by Chief Justice Phillips as to Parts II and III. Justice Enoch filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Baker. Justice Gonzales filed a concur-ring opinion, joined by Justice Enoch. Three Justices dissented in this case, each filing the own separate opinion. The dissenting opinions were written by Justice Hecht, Justice Owen, and Justice Abbott. Justices Gonzales, in his concurring opinion, very clearly voices criticism of the dissenting opinions: The dissenting opinions suggest that the exceptions to the general rule of notification VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5629 May 1, 2003 should be very rare and require a high stand- ard of proof. I respectfully submit that these are policy decisions for the Legislature .... Thus, to construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism. As a judge, I hold the rights of parents to protect and guide the education, safety, health, and development of their children as one of the most important rights in our soci-ety. But I cannot rewrite the statute to make parental rights absolute, or virtually absolute, particularly when, as here, the Legislature has elected not to do so. The chairman of the Judiciary Com- mittee states that Justice Owen did not write the opinion that Justice Gonzales criticized. I fail to see how Senator H ATCH can reach that conclu- sion. Justice Gonzales clearly refers to ''the dissenting opinions''\u2014plural\u2014and Justice Owen wrote one of those dis-senting opinions. I trust that this resolves any dispute regarding this matter.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to offer a tribute to our men and women in uniform. As we all know, President Bush will speak this evening to the Nation and mark the end of a major conflict in Iraq and acknowledge the heroism and sacrifice of our brave men and women in the Armed Forces. I know I speak for the people of my State of Texas and for all Americans when I give thanks that this operation has reached such a swift end, with so few coalition lives lost. Over the April recess, I took the op- portunity to visit most of the military bases in my home State, along with my distinguished colleague Senator H UTCHISON . One in 10 active duty mili- tary personnel call Texas their home. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am dedicated to looking after their interests and the interests of all of our military personnel. We must ensure that the United States military continues to have the training, the equipment, and the facili-ties they need to remain the greatest fighting force the world has ever known, both in war and in peace. The military bases we have in Texas are some of the strongest components of our military readiness in the current war against terror, from Afghanistan to Iraq and across the world. We must use these valuable assets to maintain our status as the world's lone super-power, as we transform our military to face the challenges of the future. Seeing our soldiers face to face re- minds us that they are not just num-bers or statistics. They are real Ameri-cans, true patriots, with real families. When someone leaves their home to fight for American interests abroad, it affects their entire community; it af-fects their friends and, most pro-foundly, it affects their families. We must remember not just the sac- rifices of the brave men and women who fight on the battlefield but the sacrifices of the families they leave be-hind. I remember, most poignantly, as the deployment was occurring from Camp Lejeune, on CNN a young mother with her child was saying goodbye to her husband, the father of that child. I will never forget the comments she made. She said: VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5630 May 1, 2003 I used to think that if he loved us, he would never leave us. But now I know that he is leaving us because he loves us. We must remember the sons who have never seen the faces of their fa-thers, and mothers who are separated from their children. We must remem-ber the families whose loved ones will not be coming back, who paid the ulti-mate price so that others can live free. Our own freedom was not won with- out cost but bought and paid for by the sacrifices of generations that have gone before. We must honor these he-roic dead for their courage and their commitment to the dream that is free-dom. On this same trip with Senator H UTCHISON , visiting our Texas military bases, I had the chance to meet with several of the former prisoners of war who had just returned to their homes. It was especially meaningful to me, be-cause my dad was a POW in World War II. On a bombing mission over Mann-heim, Germany, he was shot down and captured and spent 4 months in a pris-on camp before General Patton and his Army came along and liberated him and others. Knowing the impact of my dad's experience, I have sensed a glim-mer of the pain, the anxiety, and ulti-mately the joy of the families of these former POWs. I know, in time, as both the former captives and their loved ones learn the names of the rescuers, they will want to express their gratitude in person and continue to be thankful to a nation that recognizes the value of each and every human life. It strikes me that the Iraqi people's experience was much the same. No doubt the captivity of their nation was longer, more brutal, and more terrible than what our soldiers experienced. The pain of the Iraqi people was im-measurable. But now, at long last, their country has returned to them. In 1944, Winston Churchill spoke in the Royal Albert Hall to the British troops and reminded them that they served a cause greater than them-selves. He said: We are joined together in this union of ac- tion which has been forced upon us by our common hatred of tyranny. Shedding our blood side by side, struggling for the same ideals, until the triumph of the great causes which we serve shall be made manifest. . . . Then, indeed, there will be a day of thanks-giving, one in which all the world will share. There is a lot of work to be done in Iraq. But the difference our forces have made in such a short time is undeni-able. Just a few short months ago, the idea that the Iraqi people could live free was a concept that some found hard to treat seriously. Now the dream of a free Iraq is in sight. The day of thanksgiving is not here yet, but it is coming. And thanks to the sacrifices of American families and America's war-riors, it is coming soon. We as a grateful nation continue to wish our men and women in uniform godspeed, and we hope and pray for their swift return to the loving arms of their families. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREE- MENT\u2014JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending Prado nomination occur at 2:15 today with the remaining time until then equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member. I further ask consent that following the vote, the President immediately be no-tified of the Senate's action. I also ask consent that on Monday, May 5, at a time determined by the majority lead-er after consultation with the Demo-cratic leader, the Senate proceed to ex-ecutive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 34, the nomination of Deborah Cook to be a U.S. district judge for the Sixth Circuit; provided further there be 4 hours for debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member or their des-ignees. Further, I ask that following the use or yielding of that time the Senate proceed to a vote on the con-firmation of the nomination, again with no intervening action. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada. Mr. REID. I ask that the consent be modified so we have a vote on Prado at 2:15 today. Mr. FRIST. I believe that was the way it was requested. Mr. REID. I am sorry. I missed that. I was visiting with someone else. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent re-quest? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my un- derstanding that the distinguished ma-jority leader wishes to have a vote on Cook at 4:45 on Monday. Is that true? Mr. FRIST. That is correct. The first vote on Monday will be 4:45, and that would be on the Cook nomination. Mr. REID. I ask consent that that be part of what we are doing today. I ask consent that the vote occur at 4:45 and there be a period prior to that of 4 hours for debate on the Cook nomina-tion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. And that 1 hour of that time be reserved for Senator K ENNEDY . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank all of the Senators who have been in-volved in leadership on the Democratic side and the Republican side in work-ing on this agreement. I particularly thank Senator M CCONNELL for his per- severance and counsel over the course of the past several days. Both sides have worked in good faith to come to this conclusion. I now would ask for a further clari- fication with respect to the nomination of John Roberts. That nomination will be reported a week from today. We have been assured by the other side of the aisle that there would be no fili-buster on the nomination of John Rob-erts; also, that the Senate would vote up or down on his confirmation. I know Members will want to speak on that nomination and we will be prepared to provide time on Thursday for that de-bate. I, therefore, expect that prior to com- pleting our business next week we will vote on the nomination. I yield to my colleague with regard to this under-standing. Mr. REID. The statement of the Sen- ator is absolutely correct. There will be no filibuster. I would only ask, as the Senator has already indicated, that there be ample time\u2014it may take as much as 6 hours of debate\u2014prior to a vote on that. The Senator said it would be on Thursday. It may have to spill over until Friday. We may not be able to do all 6 hours on Thursday. I was just saying\u2014I know the Sen- ator was preoccupied\u2014we may take as much as 6 hours, 3 hours on our side; the other side may not need as much time, and so we may not be able to complete all that on Thursday. That is strictly up to the leader, but we have already indicated we would need up to that much time. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to make sure there is adequate time for debate. I would like to try to have the vote by the end of next week, if at all possible. Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator M CCONNELL and I worked as much as we could to get this to a point where we are today. I do not like to acknowl-edge this often, but we were unable to do that. It was only because of the intervention of the two leaders that we were able to arrive at this point. We need not go into all the details of what went into this agreement, but I want to publicly acknowledge the good work of the Democratic leader and the major-ity leader in allowing us to get to this point. This has been done very quickly on the Senate floor, but to arrive at this point has taken literally hours of time. This is a significant breakthrough. I think, with all the difficulty we have been having with judicial nominations, that this is a significant advancement. It is typical of what has to be done when dealing with legislation. A lot of people have to give up what they felt was something they could not give up. I also would say that Senator H ATCH and Senator L EAHY have been involved. I think they have helped the advance-ment of the Senate by their agreeing to things to which a little while ago they VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5631 May 1, 2003 would not have agreed. I wish to pub- licly commend the two leaders, and the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the Judiciary Com-mittee, Senators H ATCH and L EAHY , for some excellent work. This is not any-thing that will ever be written in the history books but in my mind I have some knowledge of what is good for the Senate and I am convinced that what we have done today is some of the best work we have done all year. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his comments and agree wholeheartedly in terms of the efforts that have been made in good faith on both sides of the aisle. It has been difficult in terms of negotiations but everybody has been involved at the leadership level, as well as working with the respective leaders of the com-mittee. We have come to a satisfactory conclusion. By the end of next week we will have accomplished the goals we all have, and that is to keep the process working\u2014it is not always pretty\u2014in a way that will deliver what the Amer-ican people deserve. We will have more to say later today, but we will expect to have two votes on Monday, the first at 4:45 and then a vote later, which we will set up the time agreement probably an hour or so after that vote, with consideration to Miguel Estrada. Again, we will make specific announcements but we will have two votes on Monday. I point out the first one is at 4:45, which we have tried to announce a few days ago to make sure people are back for that par-ticular vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the distinguished Senator from New York, Mrs. C LINTON , and I control the next half hour as if in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f SUNSHINE IN IRAQI RECONSTRUC- TION CONTRACTING ACT Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we rise today to discuss the call of a bipartisan coalition for some badly needed sun-shine in the process of awarding Iraqi reconstruction contracts. I particu-larly commend several of my col-leagues for joining me in the bipartisan legislation, the Sunshine in Iraqi Re-construction Contracting Act intro-duced April 10. First, Senator C LINTON and I are es- pecially grateful to the chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Sen-ator C OLLINS of Maine. Not only is she an excellent chair of the committee that will take up this legislation, she is also an expert on procurement law, a real authority on the very issue we have addressed in our legislation. We are very proud to have her as our lead bipartisan coalition builder on this leg-islation because her leadership quali-ties on the committee and special pro-ficiency on this topic give me great confidence this bill is the right move for America, the right move for the Senate, particularly the right move for our taxpayers, and we are very grateful for Senator C OLLINS ' support and par- ticipation in this effort. Our legislation has a simple aim. It says if a Federal agency awards an Iraqi reconstruction contract without the benefit of open and competitive bidding, that agency must publicly jus-tify their decision to do so. I will tell the Senate and my colleagues the events and news reports of the 21 days since our bill's introduction have only strengthened our bipartisan conviction that Iraqi reconstruction contracts must be awarded in the sunshine and not behind a smokescreen. There are two primary reasons we be- lieve it is so important American tax-payers deserve additional details about this closed and secretive process. First, there is a huge amount of money on the line, a projected $100 billion in tax-payer funds. Second, the General Ac-counting Office has already reported sole-source or limited-source contracts almost always are not the best buy for the taxpayer. In my view, the need for explanation increases a hundredfold if Federal agencies are going to employ a process that may expose taxpayers to addi-tional cost. When we introduced this legislation, we were concerned that the U.S. Agency on International Develop-ment had already awarded four of eight major Iraqi contracts through a closed bid or no-bid process. Even at that time, sole-source and limited-source contracts already seemed to be the rule and not the exception for rebuilding Iraq. USAID announced it would limit competition to companies they felt had the technical ability and accounting ability to handle these matters. But since our legislation was intro- duced, not only have a number of Fed-eral agencies continued to award no- bid or closed-bid contracts, but once the bids have been solicited, they even started to ignore or circumvent their own publicly stated criteria for lim-iting the pool of applicants. More than ever, our bipartisan coalition believes if the Federal Government chooses not to use free market competition to get the most reasonable price from the most qualified contractor, then at a minimum they should tell the Amer-ican people why that is necessary. Sun-shine is the best disinfectant and the news reports of recent days simply beg for a clearing of the air. On April 11, the day after we intro- duced our bill, one firm secured a $2 million Iraq school contract through an invitation-only process. On April 18, USAID awarded the biggest contract yet through an invitation-only bid process. A $680 million contract to re-build Iraq's infrastructure was awarded to Bechtel. On April 19, a $50 million policing contract was awarded through a closed bidding process. On the same day, the Washington Post reported that a renewable $7.9 billion contract for personnel services in Iraqi recon- struction was awarded February 25, nearly a month before the war began, with a single company invited to bid for the job. According to the press re-ports, that invitation came a full 55 days before the start of the hostilities. As each of the contracts was award- ed, Federal agencies justified the no- bid or closed-bid process only by saying that they simply had to move quickly. That is basically one of the only argu-ments the agencies have left. Origi-nally, USAID said the only companies with security clearances could be in-vited to apply. But that argument fell apart just a couple of days ago. USAID's own inspector general re-vealed that USAID waived the security clearance requirement when one bid was awarded. It turned out that the winner of a $4 million ports contract, in fact, did not have the security clear-ance that was supposedly essential when the limited bid process started. In effect, USAID eliminated the very criteria it used to limit bidders on the project. USAID suddenly said the out-break of war in Iraq simply made the security clearance process unneces-sary. The only reason the United States would be awarding contracting to re-build Iraq would be if the United States went to war. So if the requirement for security clearance was needed before the war broke out, it is hard to see what would have changed once the war started. As a Member of the Senate In-telligence Committee, I thought the argument was a bit shaky at the out-set. I was not certain why you would need all of the security clearances to fix the sewer system. Weeks ago, it was clear that most of the Iraqi work would be subcontracted out to companies who did not meet the security requirements in the first place. But the report from the inspector general this week has sig-nificantly increased my concern. It turned the agency's argument about security clearances from suspect to es-sentially ludicrous. This incident makes the case better than any other that agencies should have to clearly and publicly state how they are choosing companies for these invitation-only bids. Perhaps if they know they have to face the public on these issues they will have better ex-planations or a more open process. We want to be clear, in the presence of actual security concerns, our legisla-tion assures the protection of classified information. But at the same time, it does give the Congress oversight over the billions in taxpayer money that Americans are being asked to commit in Iraq and that is desperately needed. Historically, open and competitive bid-ding by Federal agencies has been the tool to get the best value for the tax-payers of our Nation. Again, independent reports from the General Accounting Office show that in the past, the soul-source or limited- source contracts have not been before the buy. According to the General Ac-counting Office, military leaders have VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5632 May 1, 2003 often simply accepted the level of serv- ices given by a contractor without ever asking if it could be done more effi-ciently or at a lower cost. In the case of Iraq, again, with estimates being low-balled at $25 billion and some ex-ceeding $100 billion, taxpayers in our country have a great interest in mak-ing sure this money is spent effi-ciently. I also note in wrapping up that many of these contracts are so-called cost- plus contracts. They pay a company's expenses, plus a guaranteed profit of 1 to 8 percent. There are no limits on total costs, so the more a firm charges in expenses, the more profit it is going to make. If the Federal Government is going to spend the money of the people of Oregon in this fashion without ask-ing for competitive bids, I think the people of Oregon and the people of this country deserve to know why. There simply should not be a place for waste when you are talking about at least $100 billion of taxpayers' cash. I understand the argument that these contracts need to be awarded quickly. I understand in many cases the compa-nies receiving them have a long history of international work. I simply believe if the need for speed can adequately justify these closed-bid processes that may expose the taxpayers to additional expenditures, then those agencies need to make public why they would take these extraordinary measures that could very well waste significant amounts of taxpayer money. I want to yield my time to Senator C LINTON . I thank her. She is on the Senate Armed Services Committee. She and I and Senator C OLLINS have been a bipartisan coalition. I would also like to note a number of other Senators\u2014Senator B YRD in par- ticular, who serves on the Appropria-tions Committee and the Armed Serv-ices Committee\u2014have been very help-ful as well. But I yield to Senator C LIN- TON and particularly express my sup- port to her. With Senator C OLLINS , we have tried to make the focus that there is a bipartisan need for protecting tax-payers, to make sure this money is spent wisely at a time when there is so much economic hurt across the Nation. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New York. Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, will my distinguished colleague yield for a question? Mr. WYDEN. I will. Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, it is a great privilege to be working in this bi-partisan coalition with the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator C OLLINS , and with a long-time champion of taxpayers and consumers like Senator W YDEN . Is it the understanding of the Sen- ator from Oregon that the buck really stops with Congress? It is the Congress's responsibility to ensure the funds we appropriate for reconstruc-tion in Iraq are spent in a fair and open manner? Mr. WYDEN. The Senator from New York has summed it up. This is Congress's call. The buck in fact does stop with the Congress. What we are talking about here is making sure Congress keeps in place vigorous oversight about the process. The process is what has, in our view, put taxpayers' dollars in some peril. People have focused on one company or another. There are inquiries underway. What we are going to do is protect the process that ensures, as the Senator from New York suggests, that the tax-payers are protected and Congress in fact has the last word in making sure this money is spent responsibly. Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, that is an eloquent summation as to why I have joined with my colleagues in in-troducing the Sunshine In Iraqi Recon-struction Contracting Bill. Tonight President Bush will address our Nation and will tell the world that Operation Iraqi Freedom's military ac-tion is over, at least insofar as major military engagements may be required. We know we will have continuing prob-lems, like those we have seen in the last few days. But it is true we are now moving toward the second phase, which is the rebuilding of Iraq. So this col-loquy we are having today is especially timely because of the President's an-nouncement this evening. With respect to our going forward, I think the important points the Senator from Oregon has made need to be un-derscored because, for many of us, we want to see the plans that have been explained in the last several weeks about the rebuilding effort move for-ward as expeditiously and cost-effec-tively as possible. We know, as we just heard from the distinguished Senator, that a number of contracts have already been let. They have been no-bid or closed-bid contracts. As one follows the informa-tion about these contracts in the press, it has become clearer and clearer this has been in the planning for quite some time and it has been largely the prov-ince of a rather small group of insiders. I think it is imperative, not only for the integrity of our procurement proc-ess, for the integrity of the congres-sional appropriation and oversight process, but for the integrity of the en-tire operation that has been under-taken in Iraq, to be transparent and open before the world. If I may ask the Senator from Oregon another question, is it correct the leg-islation we have introduced would re-quire when contracts are awarded with-out a full and open competition, behind closed doors, that the awarding agen-cy\u2014whether it is the Department of Defense or USAID\u2014would have to pub-licly explain why they could not have had an open process? Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is correct. Again, that is what the legislation is about. There is a certain irony in that that information is in fact already available. The bipartisan legislation we have put together with the Chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Sen-ator C OLLINS , says what is already completed work, in terms of the anal- ysis and justification, simply would be made public so as to reinforce the prop-osition that there be the maximum amount of transparency, the maximum amount of accountability, and so the public can see why, if necessary, a spe-cial process that doesn't involve open bids would be necessary. Mrs. CLINTON. You know, our bill also requires as part of that trans-parency, letting the sunshine come in, that the agencies would make public the amount of the contract, the scope of the contract, would provide informa-tion about how contractors were iden-tified, as well as the justification and determination of the documents that led to the decision not to use full and open competition. I find that very reassuring. I do not understand why this would not be leg-islation we could literally pass by unanimous consent this afternoon. I don't think it is in our Government's interest nor is it in America's interest that there be any doubt at all, any shadow cast over this process so people in our own country or elsewhere can say there is something funny going on, this is not being done straight. Would the Senator agree, in addition to fulfilling what we know to be the ap-propriate procurement procedures, the fact that no-bid or closed-bid contracts time and time again lead to overruns, to excessive costs, that we are also, through this legislation, trying to send a warning, in a sense holding out a helping hand to the Government, to say let's do this in the open so nobody can ever go back and question motive or process with respect to what we are attempting to do with the reconstruc-tion of Iraq? Mr. WYDEN. The point of the Sen- ator about the credibility of the Gov-ernment I think is fundamental. I think we all know if people see some-thing taking place behind closed doors, in secret, without the open and full process of competitive bidding, it just engenders suspicion, it just engenders a sense of skepticism and cynicism about government that just does not have to be. It is particularly troubling here be- cause the General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan organization of audi-tors, has already documented there is a problem. So we have a combination of taxpayer skepticism about work done in secret coupled with the long history of the General Accounting Office's skepticism about these reports, and here is an area that just cries out for sunshine. I talked about sunshine being the best disinfectant, but certainly since we introduced this bill with Senator C OLLINS over the last 21 days, the fact we have seen all these contracts\u2014in fact, one of them where the agency just waives their own process, without an explanation\u2014I think highlights the Senator's point that the Government's credibility is at stake. Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I hope we will have an even larger bipartisan VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5633 May 1, 2003 coalition supporting this legislation, working with us, perhaps even con-vincing the Government agencies re-sponsible for letting these contracts to think very hard about the process they are now following. Again, I thank my colleague from Or- egon and my colleague from Maine for providing such leadership. It is a pleas-ure to work with them. But it is also a duty. I think all of us feel a heavy re-sponsibility to make sure the billions and billions of dollars\u2014maybe as much as $100 billion that will be spent on re-constructing Iraq\u2014is spent in the most effective way. Because, while we are looking at the extraordinary costs of this kind of task awaiting us in Iraq, we are also in this body hearing from our constituents, as many of us did over the previous 2 weeks, about what is happening to their schools, what is happening to their hospitals. So we have to be especially conscious that this money can be justified; that we can look our constituents in the eyes when they say, I don't understand, Senator. I thought we were going to get more help for our poor schools. Senator, I don't understand. Our hos-pital has just closed down because we can't get enough reimbursements from the Federal Government. This is not only about all of the good government principles. It is not even only about the integrity and credi-bility of our government. It is about the choices that are being made. These choices are not only important with re-spect to contracting, but they are im-portant with respect to our values. I hope our colleagues will join us in moving this piece of important legisla-tion through so that we can begin to practice what many of us preach about transparency and openness and also making sure we get the very best deal. Our dollars are limited. If there is any excess on justified dollars going to Iraq that could go to my kids and schools in New York City, or to Ron's hospital in Oregon, that is our responsibility. Let me again thank my colleagues. I look forward to being successful with this bipartisan coalition and getting this legislation passed at the earliest possible time. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to wrap up, I would like to reaffirm a point that the distinguished Senator from New York mentioned with respect to the feeling of our citizens at a time when there are so many schools that are underfunded and seniors can't af-ford their medicine and other services. When I was home over the break\u2014per-haps the Senator from New York heard this as well\u2014many constituents came up to me and said: We are really glad that you are pushing this bill at more competitive bidding and reconstruction contracts. But, to tell you the truth, why don't you just have Iraqi oil pay for all of the reconstruction? We don't need the taxpayer money. There already is a sense about the Nation that we have to be careful about how these funds are being used. I think there is a role for the United States to play. I think it is clear that is a part of an important contribution that our country can make with the conflict winding down. But it just reaf-firms in my mind how critical it is to use this money wisely. With the Amer-ican people hurting now with what one might say is the highest unemploy-ment rate of our country, you can't ex-plain to the taxpayers of this Nation frittering away dollars on contracts that are let without competitive bids. We look forward to colleagues of both political parties joining us in this ef-fort. It seems to me a bill such as this should be passed unanimously with all 100 Senators onboard. We look forward to seeing the resolution of this legisla-tion to protect the taxpayers. Again, I want to close by expressing my thanks to the chairman of the com-mittee where this legislation was sent. Senator C OLLINS has been a critical partner in this effort to direct procure-ment law. Senator B YRD, who holds, of course, a longstanding interest in this matter and serves on both the Appro-priations and the Armed Services Com-mittees, has been invaluable to me in particular in providing counsel with re-spect to how to move this legislation forward. Together we look forward to passing this bill and protecting the taxpayers' interests as perhaps $100 bil-lion of taxpayer money is spent in the rebuilding of Iraq. I yield the floor. f EXECUTIVE SESSION NOMINATION OF EDWARD C. PRADO, OF TEXAS, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B UN- NING). Under the previous order, the Senate will now proceed to the consid-eration of Executive Calendar No. 105, which the clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Edward C. Prado, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Ohio is recognized. Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for the next 15 minutes as in morning busi-ness. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. D EWINE are printed in today's R ECORD under ''Morning Business.'') The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Ohio is recognized. Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, on be- half of the majority leader F RIST, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on Executive Calendar No. 105, the nomi-nation of Edward C. Prado, occur at 2:05 p.m. today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased we are going to move to the nomination of Judge Edward Prado. While my friend, the distinguished sen-ior Senator from Ohio, is on the floor, I want to extend early congratulations because it appears that on Monday we are going to approve a judge on which he has worked so hard. Because of his advocacy and a number of others, we have been able to move through this circuit court process a little more quickly. The Senator from Ohio told me how much he thought of Judge Cook, and being the fine lawyer the Senator is, I am certain we are going to get a good addition to the court. His recommendation goes a long way with me. I congratulate the Senator from Ohio for his advocacy on the part of someone he knows and speaks so well of. Mr. President, I am pleased we now are on the nomination of Judge Edward Prado, a well-qualified nominee for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Prado is being considered for the same court as Justice Priscilla Owen, a nominee we on this side find to be a di-visive choice for the circuit court. The swift consideration of Judge Prado's nomination illustrates again how the nomination process can work when the President sends up fairminded and mainstream choices for lifetime seats on our Federal bench. It happens quickly. This came about as a result of our being involved in another judicial nom-ination that was not going anywhere, and on this side we moved to the nomi-nation of Judge Prado. I think that and other reasons moved us along the path very quickly. While some have decried the con- firmation process is broken, certainly the numbers belie that charge. With the two district court judges confirmed before we recessed and Mr. Sutton on Tuesday, the number of confirmations has already risen to 120. This afternoon it will be 121. These numbers dwarf the confirmations achieved by my Repub-lican colleagues under President Clin-ton. Last year alone, in an election year, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 72 judicial nominees, more than in any of the prior 6 years of Republican con-trol. Overall, in the 17 months of Sen-ate Democratic control, we were able to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce judicial vacancies. We were able to do so despite the refusal of the adminis-tration to consult with Democrats on circuit court vacancies and many dis-trict court vacancies. As I have indicated, if we confirm Judge Prado, which I am confident we will do, he will be the 121st judge. He will also be the 11th Latino judge serv-ing in our circuit courts. Judge Prado is supported by the Congressional His-panic Caucus, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, and many others. I ask unanimous consent that a let- ter from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus expressing their unanimous support be printed in the R ECORD . VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 \u2014 SENATE S5634 May 1, 2003 There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: APRIL 29, 2003. Hon. B ILLFRIST, U.S. Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EARMAJORITY LEADER FRIST: On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), we write today regarding Edward Charles Prado's nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Ear-lier this year, the CHC voted unanimously to endorse the nomination of Judge Prado. Sub-sequently, Judge Prado received the unani-mous bipartisan support of the Senate Judi-ciary Committee, and it is our understanding that Senate Democratic leadership has since asked that this non-controversial nomina-tion be immediately called up for a vote. Unfortunately, it is now being reported that Senate Republican leadership is holding up confirmation of Judge Prado as part of a political ploy to characterize Democratic op-position to certain individual judicial nomi-nees as a Democratic assault on women and minorities. If this in fact is the case, then it is reprehensible that the Senate Republican leadership would engage in such offensive and malicious tactics for mere political gain. It is ironic that although Judge Prado has received bipartisan and unanimous support so far, Republican leadership has not yet al-lowed the full Senate a final vote on his nomination. Intentionally delaying a vote on this nomination casts doubt on the sincerity of Republican rhetoric about supporting and confirming qualified Hispanic judges. Furthermore, it would be a travesty for Judge Prado, a qualified and respected His-panic judicial nominee, to fall victim to a disingenuous politically motivated campaign to label Democrats as anti-minority by high-lighting Democratic opposition to a select few while ignoring Democratic support for the vast majority of President Bush's His-panic judicial nominees. President Bush's nominations of Jose Mar- tinez to a District Court in Florida, Jose Linares to a District Court in New Jersey, Christina Armijo to a District Court in New Mexico, James Otero to a District Court in California, as well as Alia Ludlum, Philip Martinez, and Randy Crane to District Courts in Texas all received Democratic sup-port and all were confirmed by the U.S. Sen-ate. In addition to Judge Prado, another pending Hispanic judicial nominee, Cecilia Altonaga of Florida, is also expected to be confirmed by the Senate with Democratic support. Clearly, Senate Democrats have displayed a willingness to support President Bush's Hispanic nominees, and any assertions to the contrary are unnecessary and counter-productive to efforts to increase diversity on our Nation's federal courts. As you know, the judicial nomination process is important to the CHC because we believe that our Nation's courts should re-flect the diversity of thought and action that enrich America. To that extent, we estab-lished the Hispanic Judiciary Initiative to further formalize our involvement in this issue by establishing a set of evaluation cri-teria and an internal process for endorsing nominees. Since its inception the CHC His-panic Judiciary Initiative has worked to im-prove diversity within the federal judiciary. For this effort to be hindered due to political maneuvering, absent concern for the best in-terest of the Hispanic community, is both ir-responsible and neglectful. Once again, we believe that Judge Prado's qualifications and distinguished career in law, as well as his dedication to the Hispanic community make him a judicial nominee de-serving of confirmation. We respectfully urge you to schedule a vote to conform Ed-ward Charles Prado to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit with-out any further delay. Sincerely, C IROD. R ODRIGUEZ , Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus CHARLES A. G ONZALEZ , Chair, CHC Hispanic Judiciary Initiative. Mr. REED. Judge Prado has served 19 years in the United States district court. As some of my colleagues have noted, it is sometimes more chal-lenging to review nominees who come to us from private practice and univer-sities. We have to extrapolate from their record in those different roles as to how they would perform as a judge. With Judge Prado, we certainly do not have that problem. We know how he has performed as a judge. With the nomination of Priscilla Owen, the same applies. We have the Priscilla Owen and Judge Prado judi-cial records we can directly evaluate. In the case of Justice Owen, it is a record many on our side find troubling. If all the Members had been present today, it would have been 47 people voting against cloture. In the case of Judge Prado, it is a record we find evinces an evenhandedness and fairness befitting a circuit court judge. Not that I would decide every case the way Judge Prado has\u2014I would not\u2014but overall he has won the support of all Democratic Sen-ators, as far as I know, on the Judici-ary Committee, and other Democratic Senators, because they found his record one of balance and fairness. Un-like Justice Owen and Mr. Estrada, no colleague or supervisor has questioned his ability to apply the law faithfully. Unlike Justice Owen and Mr. Estrada, no single person or organization has submitted a letter of concern or opposi-tion to Judge Prado's nomination. Judge Prado has generated no con- troversy. He is experienced. While I am sure he is conservative, it does not matter; He is an evenhanded judge. There is something to be said for con- servative judges. If conservatism means the law is followed, stare deci-sis, the precedent set, I think that is good. Judge Prado will be confirmed today because he is a fine person and an ex-cellent judge. As I have noted in the past, eight of the sitting Latino judges were appointed by President Clinton. Several of these judges were denied Senate consideration for years while the Republicans controlled the Senate. Judge Richard Paez, nominee for the Ninth Circuit, waited over 1,500 days. He was well qualified, had the support of his hometown Senators, and 39 Re-publicans voted against his nomina-tion. There is nothing wrong with that. They had different views as to how he would serve as a judge. Judge Sonia Sotomayor, a nominee to the Second Circuit, was similarly stalled. Her confirmation took 433 days. Then there were the Hispanic nominees who were denied hearings or votes by Republicans during the Clin-ton administration: Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, Christine Arguello, Richard Morado, Anabelle Rodriquez. These facts and the expected con- firmation of Judge Prado belie the anti-Hispanic charges some have made in the context of the Estrada debate. The extended debate Democrats have sought to have on just a handful of ju-dicial nominees affects our constitu-tional advice and consent duty. While the number of judges who have been confirmed demonstrates our good faith in working with our colleagues and the President, we will not simply rubberstamp ideologically driven indi-viduals for lifetime seats on our Fed-eral courts. I am pleased that today we are mov- ing forward on this qualified judge, Ed-ward Prado. I believe the way Judge Prado's nomination has been received in the Senate points the way through some of the conflict that has occurred in the Senate over a very small number of judicial nominees. If my math is correct, by today's end there will be 121 versus 2. That is a good record in anyone's book. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I un- derstand it we are on the Prado nomi-nation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering the nomination of Edward C. Prado, who has been nominated by President Bush to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. He has an outstanding record of distinguished public service and will be a great addi-tion to the Fifth Circuit, especially since the seat to which he has been nominated has been designated a judi-cial emergency by the Judicial Con-ference of the United States. Judge Prado currently serves as a United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas, having been unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 1984. His 18 years on the bench, plus prior service as a Texas state court dis-trict judge has given him the experi-ence and background to make an out-standing Fifth Circuit Judge. In addition to his judicial experience, Judge Prado has had a distinguished legal career. After graduating from the University of Texas School of Law in 1972, he began his legal career as an As-sistant District Attorney in the Bexar County, TX, District Attorney's Office. In 1976 he accepted a position with the Federal Public Defender's Office for the VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5635 May 1, 2003 Western District of Texas where he served as an Assistant Federal Public Defender representing indigent crimi-nal defendants in the federal courts. During 1980, he served as a Texas state district judge, filling the unex-pired term of the incumbent. In this position, he presided over several hun-dred cases, including felony criminal trials. In 1981, he was unanimously con-firmed by the Senate and appointed as United States Attorney for the West-ern District of Texas, where he man-aged one of the largest United States Attorney's Offices in the Nation. In 1984, President Reagan nominated and the Senate confirmed Judge Prado as a United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas. In this ca-pacity he has handled thousands of cases and hundreds of trials. Judge Prado is a man of exceptional character, impeccable ethics, and is well qualified to serve as a Circuit Judge. He has received many honors and awards for his work in the law, in-cluding the St. Thomas Moore Award from St. Mary's University School of Law in 2000, the LULAC State Award for Excellence in 1981, the Achievement Award from the U.S. Attorney General in 1980, and recognition as an Out-standing Federal Public Defender in 1978. Judge Prado is a native of San Anto- nio, Texas and has served his commu-nity, state and nation in a variety of ways. Not only has he served in his pro-fessional capacity, but also he believes in community service and has been in-volved in community service organiza-tions such as St. Mark's Catholic Church, Witte Museum Community Ad-visory Committee, the Philosophical Society of Texas, the Rotary Club of San Antonio, and Leadership San An-tonio. Additionally, Judge Prado served in the U.S. Army Reserve as an Infantry Officer from 1972-1987. In addition to his public and commu- nity service, Judge Prado has been ac-tively involved in efforts to improve the legal and judicial process. He has been a leader in numerous bar associa-tions and law-related organizations. For example, he has been a member of the Texas and San Antonio Bar Asso-ciations since 1972, including service as President, and later Director and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, of the San Antonio Bar Foundation. Judge Prado serves on the Texas State Bar Crime Victims Committee, and was appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist to serve as the Chairman of the Crimi-nal Justice Act Review Committee from 1991-1993. As a District Judge, he has made ef- forts to reach out to youth groups to help them learn about the law and the judicial process. He gives motivational speeches and conducts events in his courtroom as an introduction to the law. Judge Prado comes highly rec- ommended by those with whom he serves and by those who appear in his courtroom. Let me read a few state-ments made by Texas attorneys, as re- ported in the Texas Lawyer, February 10, 2003. Laurence R. Macon said of Judge Prado, ''I've known him for 30 years, and he doesn't have any out-rageous positions. He won't be there trying to make law.'' Seagal Wheatley stated, ''If the Judiciary Committee looks at his qualifications, he should be a shoo-in. I'm not aware of any re-cent opinion that will cause him prob-lems.'' A third attorney, Van Hilley, said, ''Judge Prado has a varied back-ground and an open mind about things. The reason his docket ran so smooth is he wasn't viewed as pro-government or pro-defense.'' The legal bar's wide regard for Judge Prado is reflected in his evaluation by the American Bar Association. The ABA evaluates judicial nominees based on their professional qualifications, their integrity, their professional com-petence, and their judicial tempera-ment. The ABA has bestowed upon Judge Prado its highest rating of Unanimously Well Qualified. Furthermore, Judge Prado has been endorsed by his hometown newspaper, The San Antonio Express-News, which declared, ''The Senate should confirm Prado's nomination without undue controversy or delay. . . . His creden-tials are unquestioned.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the com-plete San Antonio Express-News edi-torial be printed in the R ECORD , fol- lowing my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered. (See exhibit No. 1) Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the record is clear that Judge Prado is a man of ability and character. This Sen-ate, on two previous occasions, has found Judge Prado worthy of confirma-tion for positions of high responsibility in the government, and I am confident it will do so again today. I strongly support his confirmation and urge my colleagues to do likewise. EXHIBIT NO. 1 U.S. District Judge Edward C. Prado has compiled an admirable record in his almost two decades on the federal trial bench. Last week, President Bush nominated the San Antonio judge for a well-deserved pro-motion to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-peals. The Senate should confirm Prado's nomi- nation without undue controversy or delay. Prado, a graduate of Edgewood High School, was appointed to his federal district court post by President Reagan in 1984 and has performed consistently as a non-ideolog-ical moderate. His credentials are unquestioned. Prado first became a judge in 1980 when Gov. Bill Clements named him to a state district court bench. In addition, U.S. Sens. K AY BAILEY HUTCHISON and J OHNCORNYN of Texas swiftly recommended a solid replacement for Prado if he is elevated. The lawmakers forwarded the name of former Texas Supreme Court Justice Xavier Rodriguez of San Antonio to the White House to fill Prado's seat. Gov. Rick Perry appointed Rodriguez to the state's high court, but he was defeated in last year's GOP primary. A bright lawyer with solid legal qualifica- tions, Rodriguez was apolitical before being appointed to the Texas Supreme Court, and that is one of many factors that make him a strong candidate for a federal bench. We urge Bush to accept the recommenda- tion of the Texas senators and nominate Rodriguez when Prado's post is officially va-cated. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to be a Circuit Court Judge for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Prado has earned my support and that of my colleagues for his distinguished record in public serv-ice and for the integrity with which he has gone through the Senate confirma-tion process. Judge Prado has been a public serv- ant for his entire professional life. From the assistant district attorney position he took just after receiving his law degree, to his experience as a U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, to the 19 years he has served as a district court judge for the West-ern District of Texas, Judge Prado's commitment to public service is evi-dent. During his tenure as a Federal dis- trict court judge, Judge Prado has heard and decided hundreds of cases. This experience helps make him a well- prepared and well-qualified nominee to the Fifth Circuit. He has developed an extensive record of achievement for the Senate to consider and review in our endeavor to evaluate his nomination. Further, Judge Prado should be com- mended both for his willingness to be honest and forthcoming in the ques-tionnaire he submitted to the com-mittee, and for his comportment at his committee confirmation hearing. Judge Prado directly and fully ad-dressed some of his more controversial rulings in his questionnaire, and pro-vided honest, complete answers to all questions asked of him at his hearing. I do not agree with all of Judge Prado's decisions; in fact, we may hold dif-ferent views on significant issues. Yet I am convinced that he will apply the law in a capable and responsible man-ner. Finally, it should be noted that I sup- port the elevation of Judge Prado to the Court of Appeals for the same rea-sons that make me unable to support the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. Circuit. Where Judge Prado has 19 years of experience on the Fed-eral bench, Mr. Estrada has no experi-ence of any kind as a judge. And, more importantly, Judge Prado has volun-tarily and directly addressed any con-troversial issues in his record, while Mr. Estrada has made a habit of con-cealing such information and refusing to submit documents which would be of substantial assistance to the com-mittee. Mr. Prado is the kind of experienced, well-qualified nominee that the Senate can confirm with speed and ease. I sup-port his nomination. Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield? Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5636 May 1, 2003 Mr. LEAHY. I know we have set a time. I wonder if the Senator from Vermont might have a minute or so to speak about this nomination. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 3 minutes remaining at this time. Mr. HATCH. I will yield to the distin- guished Senator from Vermont, and I yield my remaining 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the democratic leader and assistant leader for going to bat for Judge Edward Prado and working out this arrangement with the Republican leadership so that this consensus nomi-nation can be considered without fur-ther delay. I appreciate that the major-ity leader and Senator M CCONNELL have been willing to work with us to allow this nomination to go forward today. I was disappointed to hear on Tues- day that the Republican position was that this matter should be further de-layed and I did not understand the logic or motivation behind that posi-tion. I cannot recall a time when the Sen- ate or either party leadership insisted on strict adherence to consideration of nominations based on their calendar number. Indeed, during the period 1995 through 2001, quite the opposite was true and Democrats had to work very hard to get the Republican leadership to take up nominations that were stalled on the Senate Executive Cal-endar for weeks, months and some-times years. This year we have contin-ued to make progress on filling judicial vacancies not by holding up all nomi-nations reported after that of Mr. Estrada but, on the contrary, by mov-ing to those on which there is agree-ment and on which we can proceed most efficiently. In fact, all 20 judicial confirmations this year were nominations reported and considered after that of Mr. Estrada and after debate on the Estrada nomination had begun. We still do not know who on the Re- publican side delayed consideration of the consensus nomination of Judge Prado for the last month. I thank the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for its support of this nomination and for working with the Senate to bring this matter forward at this time. I also want to thank the Republican leader-ship for changing position and working with us to move forward. I came to the floor on Monday to make the point that the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was cleared on the Democratic side and that we were prepared to pro-ceed. Senator D ASCHLE and Senator REIDcame before the Senate on Tues- day to urge that the Prado nomination be considered rather than be held cap-tive on the Senate calendar. All Demo-cratic Senators serving on the Judici-ary Committee voted to report this nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators had indicated that they were eager to proceed to this nomination and, after a reasonable period of de-bate, voting on the nomination. I am confident this nomination will be con-firmed by an extraordinary majority\u2014 maybe unanimously. It is most unfortunate that so many partisans in this administration and on the other side of the aisle insist on bog-ging down consensus matters and con-sensus nominees in order to focus ex-clusively on the most divisive and con-troversial of this President's nominees as he continues his efforts to pack the courts. Democratic Senators have worked very hard to cooperate with this administration in order to fill ju-dicial vacancies. What the other side seeks to obscure is that effort, that fairness and the progress we have been able to achieve without much help from the other side or the administra-tion. This week, again, despite Democratic willingness to proceed to a vote on the controversial nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit, the other side then insisted we proceed to the un-precedented renomination of Priscilla Owen. Mr. Sutton was confirmed with the fewest votes in favor of any judicial nominee in the last 20 years and with more than enough negative votes to have sustained a filibuster. Rather than proceed to a consensus nominee and fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Fifth Circuit with an experi-enced and respected Hispanic federal judge, Judge Prado, Republicans in-sisted on pressing forward with another of the President's most controversial and divisive nominations. The fact is that when Democrats be- came the Senate majority in the sum-mer of 2001 we inherited 110 judicial va-cancies. Over the next 17 months, de-spite constant criticism from the ad-ministration, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nomi-nees, including several who were divi-sive and controversial, several who had mixed peer review ratings from the ABA and at least one who had been rated not qualified. Despite the addi-tional 40 vacancies that arose, we re-duced judicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ''full employment'' by Senator H ATCH . Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the fixation of the Republican majority on the Presi-dent's most controversial nominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even further. As of today, the Senate Judiciary Committee website lists the number of judicial vacancies at 48. That is the lowest it has been in 13 years. That is lower than at any time during the en-tire eight years of the Clinton adminis-tration. We have already reduced judi-cial vacancies from 110 to 48, in less than two years. We have reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to 5.6 percent, the lowest it has been in the last two decades. With some coopera-tion from the administration think of the additional progress we could be making. Even after the consideration of Judge Prado, for example, there is another distinguished Hispanic nominee who was reported unanimously by the Judi-ciary Committee last month on which the Senate will not yet have acted: on the Senate executive calendar is the nomination of Cecilia Altonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida. We expedited consideration of this nominee at the request of Senator G RAHAM of Florida. She will be the first Cuban-American woman to be confirmed to the Federal bench when Republicans choose to pro-ceed to that nomination. Indeed, Democrats in the Senate have worked to expedite fair consideration of every Latino nominee this President has made to the Federal trial courts in ad-dition to the nomination of Judge Prado. Another example may be the nomina- tion of Consuelo Callahan to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Unlike the di-visive nomination of Carolyn Kuhl to the same court, both home State Sen-ators returned their blue slips and sup-port a hearing for Judge Consuelo Cal-lahan. I have asked that she receive a hearing in the near future and look for-ward to learning more about her record as an appellate judge for the State of California. Rather than disregarding time-honored rules and Senate prac-tices, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us fill more ju-dicial vacancies more quickly by bring-ing those nominations that have bipar-tisan support to the front of the line for Committee hearings and floor votes. As I have noted throughout the last 2 years, the Senate is able to move expe-ditiously when we have consensus, mainstream nominees to consider. Na-tionally-respected columnist David Broder made this point in an April 16 column that appeared in the Wash-ington Post. I referenced this column earlier this week and inserted it in the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD . In his column, Mr. Broder noted that when he asked Alberto Gonzales if there might be a lesson in Judge Prado's easy approval, Mr. Gonzales missed the point. In Mr. Broder's mind: ''The lesson seems obvi-ous. Conservatives can be confirmed for the courts when they are well known in their communities and a broad range of their constituents have reason to think them fair-minded.'' To date the Senate has proceeded to confirm 120 of President Bush's nomi-nees, 100 in the 17 months in which Democrats made up the Senate major-ity. The lesson that less controversial nominees are considered and confirmed more easily was the lesson of the last two years and that lesson has been lost on this White House. Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise serious con-cerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties on all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the process. I regret the administration's refusal to work VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5637 May 1, 2003 with us to end the impasse it has cre- ated in connection with the Estrada nomination. The partisan politics of division that the administration is practicing with respect to that nomination are not helpful and not respectful of the dam-age done to the Hispanic community by insisting on so divisive a nominee. I invite the President to work with us and to nominate more mainstream individuals like Judge Prado. His prov-en record and bipartisan support makes it easier for us to uphold our constitu-tional duty of advise and consent. I en-courage those on the other side of the aisle to allow us to consider his nomi-nation. I look forward to casting a vote in favor of his confirmation. Judge Prado is an exceptional can- didate for elevation to the appeals court. He has significant experience as a public servant in west Texas. Perhaps the fact that he has bipartisan support is the reason why he is not being brought forward at this time for a floor vote. That does not fit the Republican message but reveals the truth: That Democratic Senators, having already acted on 120 judges nominated by President Bush, are prepared to sup-port even more of his nominations when they are mainstream, consensus nominees. Perhaps the fact that Demo-crats unanimously supported his nomi-nation in committee is seen as a draw-back for Mr. Prado in the Republican world of nomination politics. I hope that is not the case. I also hope the fact that Judge Prado is Hispanic has not been a factor in the Republican delay. Some have suggested that Judge Prado has been delayed be-cause Democratic Senators are likely to vote for him and thereby undercut the Republican's shameless charge that the opposition to Miguel Estrada is based on his ethnicity. Republican par-tisans have made lots of partisan hay attacking Democrats in connection with the Estrada nomination. We all know that the White House could have cooperated with the Senate by pro-ducing his work papers and the Senate could have proceeded to a vote on the Estrada nomination months ago. The request for his work papers was sent last May. Rather than respond as every other administration has over the last 20 years and provide access to those pa-pers, this White House has stonewalled. Rather than follow the policy of open-ness outlined by Attorney General Robert Jackson in the 1940's, this ad-ministration has stonewalled. And Re-publican Senators and other partisans could not wait to claim that the im-passe created by the White House's change in policy and practice with re-spect to nominations was somehow at-tributable to Democrats being anti- Hispanic. The charge would be laugh-able if it were not so calculated to do political damage and to divide the His-panic community. That is what Repub-lican partisans hope is the result. That is wrong. So some have come to the conclusion that Republican delay in connection with the consideration of Judge Prado's nomination may be related to the political strategy of the White House to characterize Democrats un-fairly. Might the record be set straight if Democrats were seen to be sup-porting this Hispanic nominee to the Fifth Circuit? Might the Republicans' own record of opposing President Clin-ton's nominations of Judge Jorge Ran-gel and Enrique Moreno to that same circuit court be contrasted unfavorably with Democrats' support of Judge Prado? Might Judge Prado, a conservative from Texas with a public record of service as a Federal district court judge, become the first Hispanic ap-pointed by President Bush to the cir-cuit courts with widespread support from Senate Democrats? Might this more mainstream, consensus nominee stand in stark contrast to the ideolog-ical choices intended to pack the courts on which the White House and Senate Republicans concentrate al-most exclusively? Judge Prado has 19 years of experi- ence as a U.S. District Court judge, which provides us with a significant ju-dicial career to evaluate. A review of Judge Prado's actions on the bench demonstrates a solid record of fairness and evenhandedness. While I may not agree with each and every one of his rulings or with every action he has taken as a lawyer or judge, my review of his record leads me to conclude that he will be a fair judge. No supervisor or colleague of Judge Prado's has questioned his ability or willingness to interpret the law fairly. Judge Prado enjoys the full support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Not a single per-son or organization has submitted a letter of opposition or raised concerns about Judge Prado. No controversy. No red flags. No basis for concern. No op-position. This explains why his nomi-nation was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous, bipar-tisan vote on an expedited basis. To understand the importance of Judge Prado's nomination, we must put it in the context of prior nomina-tions to the Fifth Circuit Court of Ap-peals. Until Judge Prado's hearing, it had been more than a decade since a Latino nominee to that Court had even been allowed a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, let alone a vote on the floor. I recall President Clin-ton's two Hispanic nominations to the Fifth Circuit and the poor treatment they received from the Republican-led Senate. Judge Jorge Rangel was a former Texas State judge and a dedicated at-torney in private practice in Corpus Christi, TX when President Clinton nominated him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1997. Judge Rangel is a graduate of the University of Houston and the Har-vard Law School and earned a rating of ''Well Qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Yet, under Republican leadership, he never received a hearing on his nomination, let alone a vote by the Committee or by the full Senate. His nomination languished without ac-tion for 15 months. Despite his treat-ment, this outstanding gentleman has recently written us in support of a ju-dicial nominee of President Bush. After Judge Rangel, disappointed with his treatment at the hands of the Republican majority, asked the Presi-dent not to resubmit his nomination, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, a distinguished attorney in private practice in El Paso, TX. Mr. Moreno is a graduate of Harvard Uni-versity and the Harvard Law School. He was given the highest rating of unanimously ''Well Qualified'' by the ABA. Mr. Moreno also waited 15 months, but was never allowed a hear-ing before the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee. President Clinton renominated him at the beginning of 2001, but Presi-dent Bush, squandering an opportunity for bipartisanship, withdrew the nomi-nation and refused to renominate him. In addition, President Clinton nomi- nated H. Alston Johnson to the Fifth Circuit in 1999. This talented Louisianan came to the Senate with the support of both of his home state Senators but he never received a hear-ing on his nomination or a vote by the Committee or the full Senate in 1999, 2000, or the beginning of 2001. His nomi-nation languished without action for 23 months. In contrast, when I served as Chair of the Judiciary Committee last Con-gress, we granted Edith Clement a hearing within months of her nomina-tion. At that time there had been no hearings on Fifth Circuit nominees since 1994 and no confirmations since 1995. We also proceeded to hearings, com- mittee debate and committee votes on the divisive and controversial nomina-tions of Judge Priscilla Owen and Judge Charles Pickering. We granted hearings and votes on all four of this President's nominees to the Fifth Cir-cuit in spite of the treatment Repub-licans accorded President Clinton's qualified nominees to that same cir-cuit. Under Republican leadership, none of President Clinton's nominees to this Court received a hearing during his entire second term of office. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made the outrageous claim that Democratic Senators are anti-Hispanic or anti-Latino. I think it is important to set the record straight. Of the ten Latino appellate judges currently seated in the Federal courts, 8 were appointed by President Clinton. Three other Latino nominees of Presi-dent Clinton to the appellate courts were blocked by Republicans\u2014as well as several others for the district court. In fact, in contrast to the President's selection of only one Latino circuit VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5638 May 1, 2003 court nominee in his first 2 years in of- fice, 3 of President Clinton's first 14 ju-dicial nominees were Latino, and he nominated more than 30 Latino nomi-nees to the Federal courts. During President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 Latino nominees, including Judge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Christine Arguello to the circuit courts, were delayed or blocked from receiving hearings or votes by the Republican leadership. Republicans delayed consideration of Judge Richard Paez for over 1,500 days, and 39 Republicans voted against him. The confirmations of Latina circuit nominees Rosemary Barkett and Sonia Sotomayor were also delayed by Re-publicans. Judge Barkett was targeted for delay and defeat by Republicans based on claims about her judicial phi-losophy, but those efforts were not suc-cessful. After significant delays, 36 Re-publicans voted against the confirma-tion of this nominee who received a ''Well Qualified'' rating by the ABA. Additionally, Judge Sotomayor, who also received a ''Well Qualified'' rating and had been appointed to district court by President George H.W. Bush, was targeted by Republicans for delay or defeat when she was nominated to the Second Circuit. She was confirmed, although 29 Republicans voted against her. The fact is that the Latino nomina- tions that the Senate has received from this administration have been acted upon in a expeditious manner. They have overwhelmingly enjoyed bipar-tisan support. Under the Democrat-ically-led Senate, we swiftly granted hearings for and eventually confirmed Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge Phillip Martinez and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of Florida, U.S. Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Judge Jose Linares of New Jersey to the district courts. This year, we also confirmed Judge James Otero of California, and we would have held his confirmation hear-ing last year if his ABA peer rating had been delivered to us in time for the scheduling of our last hearing. As I have noted, we also have the nomina-tion of Cecilia Altonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida already on the Senate Executive Calendar. I, again, urge those on the other side of the aisle to help us fill more judicial vacancies more quickly by bringing those nominations that have bipartisan support to the front of the line for Committee hearings and floor votes. As I have noted throughout the last 2 years, the Senate is able to move expe-ditiously when we have consensus, mainstream nominees to consider. That is the way to achieve 100 con- firmations in 17 months and 120 in less than 2 years. The lesson that less con-troversial nominees are considered and confirmed more easily was the lesson of the last 2 years and that lesson has been lost on this White House. Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise serious con-cerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties on all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the process. I invite the President to nominate more main-stream individuals like Judge Prado. His proven record and bipartisan sup-port makes it easier for us to uphold our constitutional duty of advise and consent. I encourage those on the other side of the aisle to allow us to consider his nomination. I look forward to cast-ing a vote in favor of his confirmation. I, again, thank the Senate Repub- lican leadership for working with us to proceed to this consensus nomination, to provide adequate time for debate and to proceed to a vote without fur-ther delay. Judge Prado's nomination has been delayed on the Senate execu-tive calendar for several weeks, unnec-essarily in my view. I recall all too viv-idly when anonymous Republican holds delayed Senate action on the nomina-tion of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit for 7 months. Let us work together. I thank all Senators, even those Republicans who have anon-ymously held up consideration of Judge Prado's nomination for the last month, for agreeing to proceed with this nomination at this time. I con-gratulate the nominee and his family on his elevation to the Fifth Circuit and look forward to his continuing ju-dicial service. Again, I thank the Congressional His- panic Caucus for its support of this nomination and for working with the Senate to bring this matter forward at this time. I do thank the Republican leadership for changing its position and working with us to move forward. I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas in the Chamber, and if I have further time, I withhold it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. A LEXANDER ). The Senator from Texas. Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to be notified when I have 1 minute remain-ing so Senator H ATCH can take that last minute of our 3 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator will be notified. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased, of course, the Senate will be voting on Judge Ed Prado to move to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He has been a judge on the district bench for a number of years\u2014actually, since 1984\u2014and he has an outstanding record. He was a great choice by the President, and this is a circuit that needs these vacancies filled. There is no question it is a judicial emergency. We hope to fill this seat with Judge Prado, and then we hope Justice Pris-cilla Owen will also fill the other va-cancy for the Fifth Circuit, that is open, from Texas. Judge Prado has an outstanding record. He graduated from the Univer-sity of Texas and the University of Texas Law School, a great university in our Nation. He also has served as U.S. Attorney for the Western District. He served as judge on the State district court. This is a man who has made pub- lic service his career, and an out-standing one at that. He is so well re-garded in San Antonio and by the peo-ple who have gone before him. They know they will get fair and impartial justice in his court. That is why I am pleased to support his nomination. This nomination has moved very quickly. We are very pleased because of the vacancies on the Fifth Circuit. But the ABA agreed that he had the ''well qualified'' unanimous approval of their committee. There is just no controversy at all with this wonderful judge. It is my pleasure as a Texan to support and urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Judge Ed Prado. The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes equally divided in addition to the 1 minute I have re-maining. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that my Democratic colleagues are willing to join us in confirming Judge Prado to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I regret that there has been any dis- cussion that somehow the Republican leadership has held up this nominee. That is not true. What is particularly troubling is the suggestion that there is some Republican delay in the consid-eration of Judge Prado's nomination related to the Estrada nomination. I would point out that Democrats who support the nomination of Judge Prado to the Fifth Circuit are leading the opposition to Mr. Estrada, nomi-nated to the D.C. Circuit. Those Demo-crats have characterized the D.C. Cir-cuit as ''the second most important court in the land.'' Senator K ENNEDY stated recently that the D.C. Circuit makes decisions with national impact on the lives of all of the American peo-ple. Senator S CHUMER echoed these sen- timents just yesterday. It does seem to me that there is a different standard being applied to Miguel Estrada\u2014a nominee to the second highest court in the land\u2014than to Judge Prado\u2014a nominee to one of twelve other Circuit Courts\u2014although they are important. In any event, neither the confirma- tion of Judge Prado nor the confirma-tion of any judge justifies or excuses the continued obstruction on Miguel Estrada. I repeat that the arguments put forth by opponents of Mr. Estrada just do not hold up under scrutiny. Their repeated accusations that he failed to answer the questions has been refuted again and again. The demand for confidential memoranda he au-thored as a line attorney for the De-partment of Justice is both extraor-dinary and ill-advised, as I and others, including all the living former Solici-tors General, have repeatedly dem-onstrated. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 \u2014 SENATE S5639 May 1, 2003 So my Democratic colleagues have had unlimited opportunities to make their case on Mr. Estrada. Some of them oppose him; others support him. But one thing has remained clear through this debate: There is no good reason to deny Mr. Estrada an up or down vote on his nomination. The time has come to end the debate on Mr. Estrada's nomination and give him and up or down vote, as the Senate will now do on Judge Prado. It is the fair thing to do. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for Judge Prado's nomination at this time. I yield the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. I am glad my friends on the Republican side now allow Judge Prado's nomination to go forward. I in-tend to vote for him. I yield the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Edward C. Prado, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit? Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. M CCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. I NHOFE ) is necessarily absent. Mr. REID.

Mr. President, tomor- row marks a special milestone in the history of the Capitol: The 175th anni-versary of the U.S. Capitol Police De-partment. Those of us who are privileged to work in the Capitol know, perhaps bet-ter than anyone, what a difficult and demanding job it is to protect the Cap-itol, and how extraordinarily well the men and women of the Capitol Police perform that job. We also know how dedicated they are to their duty. After September 11 and the anthrax attack on the Capitol itself, no one showed more courage, no one was showed more determination, and no one was more critical to ensuring that the ''People's House'' remained open to the people, than the members of the Capitol Police force. We, and all Americans, owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. Today, on the eve of the 175th anni- versary of the department, we say ''thank you'' to Chief Gainer and all of the men and women of the Capitol Po-lice. When we look at the highly trained, highly skilled professionals who pro-tect the Capitol today, it is hard to imagine sometimes that the depart-ment is descended from such humble beginnings. The Capitol Police department traces its origins to 1801, when Congress moved from Philadelphia to Wash- ington. At the time, the department had exactly one member, a watchman named John Goldin, who was not armed, had no power of arrest, and was paid an annual salary of $371.75. In 1827, the force was expanded for the first time, to four watchmen; two to work the day shift, one to work the night shift, and one to fill in as needed. One-hundred and seventy-five years ago tomorrow, on May 2, 1828, Congress passed a milestone piece of legislation titled, appropriately, ''the Act of May 2, 1828,'' bringing responsibility for po-licing the Capitol, for the first time, under the direction of the presiding of-ficers of the House and Senate. This same law also empowered the Capitol watchmen with full law en-forcement authority. It transformed a corps of watchmen into a police depart-ment. In 1854, the Capitol Police were armed for the first time with heavy hickory canes. In 1867, responsibility of the Capitol Police was transferred to the Sergeant of Arms in the House and Senate, where it remains today. In 1873, the U.S. Capitol Police Board was formed to oversee the department. At the beginning of the 20th century, the department had grown to 67 mem-bers. In 1909, the department expanded to just over 100 members; a move neces-sitated by the construction of the Rus-sell Senate Office Building and the Cannon House Office building. This also marked the first time the author-ity of the Capitol Police stretched out-side the Capitol building itself. In 1935, the Capitol Police Board, for the first time, set qualification stand-ards for Capitol Police officers. In 1974, the first women officers joined the force. In 1981, the Capitol Police were au- thorized to protect Members and offi-cers of Congress, and their families, anywhere in the United States. Since September 11, all Members of the House and Senate leadership have been required to have Capitol police protection whenever we travel, and throughout the day as we go outside the Capitol building. One happy result of that, for me, is that I have been able to show off my home State to a number of officers. And I am proud to say that a few of them now consider themselves almost honorary South Dakotans. From the beginning, protecting the Capitol has always carried the risk of personal injury, or worse. On 1814, during the War of 1812, the British set fire to the Capitol building. During the Civil War, the Capitol Po- lice kept the ''People's House'' open to the public from sunrise to sunset, de-spite the fact that military troops were stationed around, and at times even in this building. Three times in the last century\u2014in 1915, 1917, and 1983\u2014bombs were ex-ploded in the Capitol by groups seeking to advance political agendas. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5640 May 1, 2003 In 1954, four members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group entered the House gallery and fired more than 16 shots with .38 caliber pistols at the 243 Members who were then on the floor. Five Congress Members were injured. In response to each of these attacks, the Capitol Police Department strengthened its training procedures, and strengthened its ability to prevent and respond to such attacks. The fact that schoolchildren and other visitors can sit in the galleries today and watch their Government in action is a powerful symbol of Amer-ica's commitment to democracy, and a testimony to the skill and courage of the Capitol Police. Given the risks, it seems almost mi- raculous that the department did not lose a single member in the line of duty until 1984, when Sergeant Christopher Eney was killed in a training exercise. And we all remember the terrible Friday afternoon, July 24, 1998, when Officer JJ Chestnut and Detective John Gibson were killed preventing a se-verely mentally ill man with a gun from entering the Capitol and killing others. We still honor and miss them today. Their deaths brought into sharp re- lief how difficult it is to protect ''the People's House'' and keep it open to the people at the same time. It is a complex balancing act that few other police departments in the world even attempt, and none performs better. On September 11 and during the an- thrax attacks, the Capitol Police re-acted with great courage and profes-sionalism under circumstances few people could have imagined even a few years ago. Since then, the department has un- dergone an intensive process to be able to prevent, and respond to, the new threats posed by global terrorism. Capitol Police officers continue to work long days and long weeks in order to respond to the need for increased vigilance. It is not unusual to see an officer guarding a door to the Capitol when we arrive in the morning\u2014and see that same officer, still on duty, when we leave at night. Without them, we could not do our jobs. And this Capitol could not keep its doors open to the more than 1 mil-lion people who visit it each year from across this Nation and the world. Over the years, many fine men and women have served on the Capitol Po-lice Force\u2014including my dear friend, the assistant minority leader, H ARRY REID. As they prepare to celebrate 175 years of proud service to our Nation, we thank them all for their devotion to duty, their great skill and profes-sionalism, and for their unyielding courage and sacrifice. I yield the floor and suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S MITH). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. Presi- dent, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f THE ECONOMY Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. Presi- dent, I rise to speak about the depleted condition of our national economy and what we ought to do. It is timely to point out that next week this Chamber, the U.S. Senate, will consider legislation raising the debt limit; that is, the limit set by law under which the Federal Government can borrow money that is a debt obli-gation of the United States. That debt limit is approximately $6.3 trillion. Next week, we will consider the House bill which has been sent to us to raise that by the largest amount ever in the history of the Union, almost $1 trillion. Specifically, $984 billion will be the vote that we will cast next week to raise the debt limit. The Federal Government has to pay its obligations. So by law we have to raise the debt limit so that the Federal Government can pay its obligations. But it is illustrative of the fact that the national debt is growing larger and larger, and we are adopting fiscal poli-cies that add to that national debt each year by increasing the deficit fi-nancing that we engage in by the budg-ets we adopt and then all of the legisla-tion with which we implement those budgets\u2014the tax cuts, the spending bills, financing the war, all of those necessary expenditures. But a fiscal policy has been advocated by the White House, one of dropping off over the next 10 years tax revenues by some $720 billion. And what is likely to pass the Senate is the commitments that were made several weeks ago that that level will be in the range of $350 billion over 10 years instead of the level passed by or to be passed by the House of Rep-resentatives in the range of about $550 billion over 10 years. Is any elected official not for tax cuts? Of course, we are. But that is not the decision with which we are con-fronted. What we are confronted with is, what do we do to better stabilize a sick economy and to get our economy moving again? Almost unanimously, the economists\u2014I say almost unani-mously because it is probably a ratio of 9 to 1 among the economists, including statements issued yesterday by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan\u2014are basically saying: Watch out. If you deficit finance, long- term interest rates are going to go up. It is going to depress the economy coming out of this near recession. It is going to be difficult for us to get the economy moving again. That is particularly true of the finan- cial condition in which we find our-selves now. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, the Government has had to go out and deficit spend to the tune of $250 billion. Annualized, that means we will deficit finance, if that trend holds up, a half a trillion dollars. What does deficit financing mean? That means we are going to adopt budgetary policies of spending and tax revenues by which we are going to spend a half a trillion dollars, $500 bil-lion, more than we have coming in in tax revenue. And you wonder why the stock market is languishing so much. The stock market is a reflection of the American people's confidence in the fu-ture of the economy and economic ac-tivity. So is it any wonder the stock market just keeps kind of languishing along? Do people have the confidence we are going to come out of these eco-nomic doldrums and get the economy moving again? I think you see how they are voting with their pocketbooks on the stock market. The people do not have that confidence. Why should they if, in this year, we are going to spend a half trillion dollars more than we have coming in in tax revenue? This leads me, then, to next week. Next week, in addition to taking up the debt ceiling bill of raising the debt al-most a trillion dollars more so we can pay our bills, we are also going to take up the tax bill. The tax bill, as pre-sented to this body, is at least going to be $350 billion. There are many in this body who would like that tax bill to be even more over a 10-year period. To me, it is not wise fiscal policy if that causes our deficit financing to go up continually, just like we are seeing in this present fiscal year. If that debt keeps getting added to the national debt, then it won't be too long\u2014an-other couple years\u2014and we will be right back here asking to raise the debt limit from about $7.3 trillion\u2014an-other trillion dollars\u2014up to about $8.5 trillion. That is not sound fiscal policy. That is not going to bring us back on the road to economic recovery. What we can do is balance interests. We can have some tax cuts that will get the economy moving again, that will pro-vide economic growth, that will pro-vide jobs so we get more dollars into the economy and circulating to offset the sickly economy, offset the lack of economic activity, some of which has been brought on by September 11 but some of which has also been brought on by an economic policy that is embrac-ing deficit financing. I will never forget over two decades ago when I was in the House of Rep-resentatives. One of the most prolific writers and great speakers who had ar-ticulated balanced budgets suddenly changed his tune and started speaking the message that we will not worship at the shrine of balanced budgets any-more. Well, in the early 1980s, that kind of worship didn't work. The fiscal policies adopted in the early 1980s were so out of whack with the deficits annu-ally soaring up to as high as $250 bil-lion in 1 year, finally those policies had to be reversed\u2014not once but three times. Now we have a situation that is dou- ble the annual deficits ever experienced VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5641 May 1, 2003 in the 1980s. We best get about the process of getting our economic and fiscal house in order if we want Amer-ica to have the economic prosperity our citizens should enjoy. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S UNUNU ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f THE HIV-AIDS EPIDEMIC Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, a num- ber of us had the honor of attending an event at the White House on Tuesday in which President Bush urged Con-gress to act quickly in passing an emergency plan for global HIV/AIDS relief. I come to the Senate floor this after- noon to applaud the President for his remarks and for his continuing com-mitment to ease the worldwide suf-fering caused by the HIV/AIDS epi-demic around the world. I also want to thank Secretary of State Colin Powell and also my col-leagues in both the House of Represent-atives and in the Senate for their lead-ership in fighting this dread disease. There are so many people to thank. Let me commend Senators L UGAR , BIDEN, FRIST, SANTORUM , DURBIN , and K ERRY for their tireless efforts and their dedi-cation to this fight, as well as Con-gressmen H ENRY HYDEand T OMLANTOS for their great leadership and their great vision. I am encouraged by what they have done with their leadership. I believe we will soon pass a com- prehensive global AIDS relief initia-tive. As the President said, time is not on our side. It is imperative that we in the U.S. Congress move quickly. As President Bush so correctly said on Tuesday: Fighting AIDS on a global scale is a mas- sive and complicated undertaking. Yet, this cause is rooted in the simplest of moral du-ties. When we see this kind of preventable suffering\u2014when we see a plague leaving graves and orphans across a continent\u2014we must act. The President of the United States is absolutely right. This is a moral issue. We as a nation and as a people have an obligation to act. We as a nation and we as a people have the ability to fight this disease. We have the tools. And it is our duty and it is our obligation to help ease this grave and global public health crisis. In February, I made my 12th trip to Haiti and my first visit to Guyana, both nations in our hemisphere that President Bush has cited as countries in dire need of our assistance to fight this HIV/AIDS problem. We traveled there to learn more about the AIDS situation and determine what kind of health infrastructure is in place to fight the disease. What we saw in these visits was devastating, with so many children and adults dying of this hor-rible disease and too few drugs to go around to help treat them and keep them alive. Without question, HIV/AIDS is a human tragedy of grave proportions\u2014 not just in Africa but right here in our own backyard in our own hemisphere. When you travel to the AIDS-infested regions of the world, as my wife Fran and I have, and as so many of my col-leagues here in the Senate have, such as Majority Leader F RIST, Senator INHOFE , Senator D URBIN , Senator N EL- SON of Florida, and Senator C HAFEE , when you see the children with AIDS, when you hold them, when you touch them, when you talk to the people who care for them, when you know that these children will in all likelihood die, it truly does change you forever. Then when you leave those countries, and when you leave those children, you know you cannot just leave; you know you have to try to do something to help. Our trip in February reinforced what we already knew about the devastation of the disease in Haiti, and allowed us to see what efforts are now underway in Guyana. This afternoon, I would like to take a few minutes to tell my colleagues about what we learned on that visit. I was pleased that Senator C HAFEE and his wife Stephanie were able to join Fran and me on that trip. We learned a great deal about what is and what is not being done in both of these impoverished nations. We were fortunate to have Senator D URBIN and Senator N ELSON of Florida and his wife Grace and Congressman K ENDRICK MEEK join us on an earlier trip to Haiti in January, where we saw the tragic effects of the abject poverty and disease that engulfs Haiti today. While there is certainly some mirac- ulous work being done in Haiti to ease the suffering\u2014work done by people such as Father Tom Hagan and his or-ganization Hands Together\u2014there re-mains so much work to be done. When you view the HIV/AIDS rates in Haiti and Guyana in the context of the disease's overall prevalence rate in our hemisphere\u2014Haiti has the highest rate and Guyana, either the second or third highest rate\u2014the moral imperative of helping these two troubled nations be-comes absolutely crystal clear. In Haiti today, a nation of approxi- mately 8 million people, 300,000 cur-rently live with AIDS\u2014300,000 people out of a country of 8 million people. Guyana follows close behind. In Guy- ana, a nation of roughly 800,000 people, 35,000\u201435,000\u2014have been identified as HIV positive or as having AIDS. Of those 35,000 people who have been iden-tified as HIV positive or as having AIDS, only 200\u2014less than 1 percent\u2014 are getting antiretroviral drug treat-ment. Of those 200, only one\u2014only one\u2014is a child. So virtually none of the children in Guyana are getting any kind of drug treatment at all\u2014vir- tually none. Only one child in all of Guyana is getting any drug treatment for AIDS. What a great tragedy. Consequently, the disease is having a devastating impact on these nations, and especially on the children. In Haiti, there are more than 150,000 orphans due to AIDS. This number has been increasing for over a decade and is expected to rise even more. Specifi-cally, the percentage of Haitian AIDS orphans has gone from 7 percent in 1990 to 43 percent in 2001 and is estimated to increase to 49 percent by 2010. That will be a sevenfold increase in 20 years. Rates are equally troubling in Guy- ana. In 1990, there were no children or-phaned due to AIDS, none, but by 2001, 21 percent of the orphans were the re-sult of AIDS, and that number is pro-jected to double to 41 percent by 2010. Not only is AIDS orphaning these children, but many of them are also suffering from the disease. Today, in Haiti, there are hundreds of orphanages spread throughout the country, hundreds actually just in the capital of Port-au-Prince, but there are less than just a handful that are serv-ing or even taking care of children who have AIDS or who are HIV positive. We visited one of these orphanages in February, one of the orphanages that is taking care of children with AIDS. It is a wonderful place. It is a place called Arc en Ciel or ''Rainbow House Orphan-age.'' This is a place that is doing just wonderful work. A Canadian couple\u2014Danielle and Robert Penette\u2014came in and restored the home there, and today it is a won-derful, bright, cheery, clean, and beau-tifully maintained orphanage for about 37 Haitian children. I think about 30 of them actually are HIV positive or al-ready have AIDS. What we saw there was truly inspir- ing: children playing, laughing, and learning in the classroom. They sang songs for us. They were happy and healthy and content. They did not seem like orphans at all really but more like one big happy family\u2014one healthy family. It was hard to imagine that any of these little children were sick at all. But of the HIV-positive children at the Rainbow House Orphanage, about 15 of them are currently in need of antiretroviral drugs. Those 15 children, fortunately, are now receiving these drugs. One of the important lessons we learned about these children and about the Rainbow House is that by providing these drugs, and by providing love and consistent nutrition\u2014this good health care\u2014clean water, the Penettes, this wonderful couple, are making an unbe-lievable impact on the quality of life for these very sick children. What they, in effect, are doing is pro- longing the time it takes before these children actually need to be on AIDS treatment drugs. So half the children are not even on the drugs yet. Half of them are on the drugs. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5642 May 1, 2003 There are other places in Haiti, places where there are good, decent, loving people, such as the Penettes, who are also working miracles. For example, at another orphanage we visited in January, we saw wonder-ful people doing the best they could to care for some very sick, very malnour-ished children. At this particular or-phanage, many children are brought there who are on the verge of death. The parents bring them there to try to save them. The good people who run these or- phanages\u2014saints really\u2014love these children. They care for them. They feed them, give them what little medicine they have access to. These people bring many of these dying children back to life. They save them and they nourish them. But, tragically, for many of these children, they have AIDS. Unfortu-nately, the people who care for them in these orphanages\u2014these other orphan-ages\u2014do not have access to what the Penettes have; that is, the lifesaving drugs, antiretroviral drugs to keep these children with AIDS alive. They can give them love. They can give them food and clean water\u2014and that helps\u2014but they cannot give them the drugs that ultimately will save them. At this orphanage that Fran and I saw, they have an entire floor just for children\u2014these young babies with AIDS. What you see when you go there really does change you forever. It is truly tragic\u2014row after row of steel cribs with babies at various stages of disease, none of whom are receiving any sort of antiretroviral drug treat-ment. I remember seeing a little boy. He was about 4 or 5 years old, a little boy whose name was Francois. He had AIDS. The day we were there, when we saw him, he was very close to death. He was laid out on a makeshift bed on the cold, concrete floor. He had an IV at-tached to him, and he was getting some fluids. The wonderful people who were car- ing for him explained that he was no longer able to keep any food down. They explained to us that he would probably die within a couple days. There were no drugs available to treat him. So the people who were car-ing for him, were loving him, nurturing him, were doing what they could to give him the love they could and to make him as comfortable in the little time this poor little boy had remain-ing. I will not ever forget that little boy. I will not forget him for the rest of my life. I don't think anybody else who was in our group and who saw that little boy will forget him either. Another little boy I won't forget was about 7 years old. He also had AIDS. But he appeared to be, when you looked at him, very healthy. He was lively and content and thriving. But when we talked to the people in the or-phanage, sadly we found out that will not last because this little boy also has AIDS. Very likely, unless something changes, unless drugs are made avail-able to him, this little 7-year-old boy, who I also can't get out of my mind, will also eventually die. His death will be a needless one be- cause these drugs are available. It is just that the folks caring for this little boy do not have access to them. Money is not available. The drugs are not available. That is an injustice. It is wrong. It is a human tragedy. When we see children who are healthy now and who could remain healthy if treated properly, we feel so helpless because we know they are eventually going to die if we don't do something. That is why we must try to do something. I believe we must take action to save these children. This is one of the children my wife Fran and I had the opportunity to see at the orphanage I just described in Haiti. This is one of the little children who does in fact have AIDS. This is one of the little children who does not have access today to the drugs that will save this child. So when the President talks about a moral imperative, as he so elo-quently does, and says we in the United States have a moral obligation to stop the suffering, to reach out and help these children, these are not just sta-tistics. These are children who are in Africa, Asia, Haiti, Guyana. This is just one of the real faces of the chil-dren. This is a picture of one of the many AIDS babies we saw and actually held when we were in Haiti. When you look at that innocent, helpless little child, a child who has acquired AIDS through no fault of her own, you realize we as a Nation have a moral obligation to help. Children like this little girl, who in all likelihood may have already died in the time that has passed since we were in Haiti, will continue to die because they are not getting the drugs they need. These drugs are available, but they are not getting them. It is clear we are not doing enough. It is also clear this Congress must act. We cannot just walk away from nations such as Haiti and Guyana and these children and say this problem is too big for us to fix. We cannot walk away and say these are resource-strapped Third World countries and there is nothing we can do. We cannot walk away and say we should not funnel more re-sources into those nations because it will be too difficult to get compliance with the reforms; in other words, that lack of education and a weak and fee-ble infrastructure will impede any progress. We cannot walk away and simply say these are poor people, illit-erate people, and we cannot teach them how to take the drugs. We cannot walk away and say there is no hope, because the evidence is that is not true. There is hope. The evidence is good doctors have al- ready demonstrated, in countries like Haiti, that no matter how poor, how il-literate, people can take the drugs. They can do it very well and effec-tively, and their lives can be saved. In fact, doctors in Haiti have already demonstrated\u2014Dr. Pape, Dr. Farmer, who I will talk about in a moment\u2014 through the compliance rate, in other words, the rate people taking these drugs and doing it consistently and saving their own lives, that they can do it just as well as you or I can do it in the United States or someone who has AIDS in the United States can do it. The fact is, despite the enormity of the despair, there is an equal if not greater amount of hope. There is hope because we can help. There is hope be-cause a great deal is being done al-ready. In Guyana, there is an energetic President, President Jagdeo, and a dedicated health minister who are committed to fighting this disease and building a health infrastructure in their nation that will in fact save lives. They have a long way to go, but I am encouraged by their current education efforts and by their commitment to getting more drug treatment into their nation. As they work to build this in-frastructure, they can learn a great deal from the success stories in Haiti. I will tell you a couple. First there is Dr. Bill Pape who was with us at the White House just 2 days ago and who the President talked about and cited as a great example. He is director of GESHKIO, a health orga-nization with 27 clinics in the Port-au- Prince area dedicated to the preven-tion and treatment of AIDS. I met with Dr. Pape several times in the past. I am always amazed at what this man has accomplished. Through his work, Dr. Pape is showing that in places as poor as Haiti, a nation with an average yearly per capita income of only $250, a nation where there are very limited health resources and, frankly, a nation with all kinds of problems with the government, HIV treatment and pre-vention can and does work. At the 27 GESHKIO clinics, they see over 11,000 children, of whom 589 are HIV positive. Sadly, of those children, only 29 are currently on antiretroviral drugs, but that is changing. At the same time, GESHKIO is working hard to treat infected mothers to help pre-vent mother-to-child HIV trans-mission. At Dr. Pape's clinics, they have found 30 percent of children were being born with HIV/AIDS if the mother was HIV positive and not receiving treat-ment. But of the HIV-positive mothers receiving treatment, only 8.7 percent of the children born are HIV positive. Clearly, this shows what can be accom-plished, and this is one of the Presi-dent's major initiatives\u2014the mother- to-child transmission. It shows what you can do when you can go from a 30 percent AIDS incidence to at least 8.7, and possibly even lower. Think of all the children whose lives are being saved, who are not getting HIV, who are not HIV positive because of that. Mr. President, the medical science is clear: If we can reach these mothers VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5643 May 1, 2003 early enough before they give birth to that child who will have AIDS because the mom has AIDS, and if we can get medical treatment to the mother and get her the proper drugs, we can save that child. We can save that child at comparatively little economic cost. We should think of the savings not just in dollars and cents, but in lives saved. I was pleased to have the opportunity in February to also meet with Dr. Paul Farmer, who is fighting AIDS in the rural and remote parts of Haiti. He runs an organization called ''Partners in Health'' and operates clinics in Cange. Dr. Farmer is making tremen-dous progress. Since 1999, his organiza-tion has tracked a population of 3,500 HIV/AIDS patients and has been able to treat more than 350 of them with antiretroviral drugs. Of those receiving drugs since 1999, zero percent\u2014no one\u2014 has died. Yet, tragically, of those not receiving drug treatment, 35 percent, so far, have died. Both Dr. Pape and Dr. Farmer have received grants from the Global AIDS Fund to supplement their efforts. And I point out that money is being put into proven organizations that can get the job done. This tells us we are willing to invest efforts that are working and making a difference and saving lives. While Dr. Farmer and Dr. Pape have empirically proven there is success in treatment in a Third World nation, and there is hope, we still must do more. We must act, and we must act now. I am encouraged we have moved for- ward in terms of our AIDS spending level\u2014a level that has gone up signifi-cantly over the last few years. I com-pliment my colleagues on the Appro-priations Committee, and particularly Senator T EDSTEVENS for his efforts and dedication to increasing our funds to fight AIDS. Earlier this year, Senator D URBIN and I were successful in amending the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill to include an additional $100 mil-lion to fight the global AIDS pandemic. That money will go a long way. If that money is used to implement a holistic approach to fighting AIDS, I believe we can make significant advances world-wide. That means focusing funds on education and prevention and treat-ment\u2014treatment in terms of mother- to-child transmission, treatment of mothers who already have children, and treatment of all infected adults. This type of comprehensive approach can and will make a difference. Let me turn my colleagues' attention to two other photographs from our re-cent trip to Guyana. You will see two men who are stricken with AIDS. They are patients of the only public hospital in that nation's capital of Georgetown. When you look at these pictures, you can see the anguish in these poor men's eyes. You can see their suffering and you can certainly see their heartbreak. This shows you the ward in this hos-pital in Georgetown. This poor gen-tleman has AIDS. Though the stag-gering and shocking statistics can be at once overwhelming and seemingly unreal, when you hold babies dying from the disease, or when you see the real faces of these men, the people suf-fering, as in these photographs, it has to move you. It changes you. It cer-tainly makes the statistics real. Mr. President, in a guest column re- cently in the Washington Post, promi-nent AIDS activist Bono quoted some-thing President Harry Truman once said. This is what Truman said: I trust the people because when they know the facts, they do the right thing. That certainly is the case, I believe, when it comes to the global AIDS prob-lem. We have the opportunity to do the right thing. I believe we will do the right thing. The House plans to take final action on its bill today, and I am encouraged by the continued good-faith efforts of my colleagues in the Senate. We are moving forward on a bipartisan basis. The majority leader, Dr. B ILLFRIST, has been a real leader in this. My col-league, Senator L UGAR , on a bipartisan basis, is working with others and mov-ing forward on this as well. I am en-couraged that we will be able to get a bill put together. Mr. President, every 50 seconds a child somewhere in the world dies of an AIDS-related illness, and another be-comes infected with HIV. We have to do something to stop this. The United States has an obligation to lead this fight, and we are leading it and moving forward. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues as we move ahead. It is our duty, it is our moral obligation, and it is the right thing to do. I yield the floor. f IMMIGRANT CHILDREN'S HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACT Mr. DASCHLE, Mr. President, I would like to bring a matter to the at-tention of my colleagues. This is a clear example of misplaced priorities in the President's budget. Last January, a number of Senators wrote to the President requesting that he include a provision in his budget to allow states to provide Medicaid and SCHIP health care coverage for women and children who are legal immigrants. Yesterday, Senator G RAHAM received a letter in response to that request. The letter makes a number of claims that are, at best, disingenuous. Just to remind my colleagues of the history of this issue: the 1996 welfare law banned legal immigrants from re-ceiving Federal benefits under a num-ber of programs, including Medicaid, for 5 years. The argument was made that people shouldn't come to this country if they are going to be a public charge. The reality is that many legal immi- grants and their families, because of language barriers and other issues, agree to take some of the lowest pay-ing jobs in this country. They don't come here to take welfare; they come because they want to make better lives for themselves and for their children. Most of these jobs, as we well know, do not provide health insurance for citizen families or immigrant families. Legal immigrants play an important role in our overall economy. They take low-paying jobs that businesses rely on. They pay taxes. Immigrant chil-dren are also required to register for the Selective Service when they turn 18. According to the American Immi-grant Law Foundation, 60,000 legal im-migrants are on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. But now, as a result of this policy, when a woman becomes pregnant, or a child gets sick, they have no where to turn but to emergency care, which is the most expensive means of providing health care. A number of States have realized that this is not an efficient or accept-able means of addressing the health care needs of these families. Some 20 States now provide health care services to legal immigrants using their own funds. The result of the 1996 policy has not been the one desired by the authors of the language. Instead, it has re-sulted in transferring the burden of caring for these people to States and hospitals. Unfortunately, the severe fiscal crisis is forcing some States to reexamine their coverage. To respond to this situation, Senator G RAHAM introduced S. 845, the Immi- grant Children's Health Improvement Act, or ICHIA. It would allow States to use Federal Medicaid and SCHIP fund-ing to provide coverage for pregnant women and children who are legal im-migrants. This proposal has strong bi-partisan support, not only in the Sen-ate but also in the House. In fact, last year, it was adopted on a bipartisan basis in the Finance Committee during debate on a bill to reauthorize welfare programs. The administration's letter suggests that this proposal would somehow cre-ate a new burden on the States. In fact, the proposal gives States the option to provide this coverage, and allows them to use Federal resources to do so, thus giving them significant fiscal relief. No new burden would be imposed on the States. In addition, the National Gov-ernors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures have made restoring these benefits a pri-ority. The long-term economic and health consequences of inadequate health care services for pregnant women and chil-dren is well-established. The adminis-tration's letter tries to minimize the importance of this issue for immi-grants, by talking about other, less ef-fective health care proposals, such as the Medicaid block grant, and by point-ing out that the fetuses of immigrants are covered by SCHIP. It is important to recognize, how- ever, that more than 5 million children live in poor or ''near-poor'' non-citizen families. That is more than one-quar-ter of the total population of poor or VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, SENATE S5644 May 1, 2003 ''near-poor'' children. Almost half of all low-income immigrant children are uninsured\u2014and they are more than twice as likely to be uninsured as low- income citizen children with native- born parents. Most of these children will eventu- ally become American citizens. By de-nying all but emergency health care, and especially by denying preventive care, we increase the risk that these children will suffer long-term health consequences\u2014consequences that could reduce their ability to learn and de-velop and become productive, contrib-uting citizens; consequences that in-crease the possibility these children will need more expensive health care later on. The administration claims credit for providing coverage for fetuses, presum-ably because when these children are born they will be citizens. But it is worth noting that the Medicaid/SCHIP ban is having an impact on citizen chil-dren living in immigrant families. As many as 85 percent of immigrant fami-lies have at least one child who is a cit-izen. Although many of these children are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP, receipt among eligible citizen children of non-citizen parents is significantly below that for other poor children. Par-ents may be confused about their chil-dren's eligibility, or concerned that somehow claiming these benefits will affect the status of other family mem-bers. Finally, the letter suggests that, at a cost of $2.24 billion over 10 years, pro-viding this coverage is too expensive. It also reminds us that this issue must be considered in the context of competing priorities. That is precisely my point. Making sure that pregnant immigrant women, and their children, have access to health care, including preventive care, is an investment in the future workforce of this Nation. Denying them the care they need on an appro-priate and timely basis could have dire consequences not only for these indi-viduals, but for our businesses that will depend on a healthy population for their future workers. I believe providing health care for all of our citizens, including pregnant women and children who are immi-grants, is vital for our future economic strength. It should be a much higher priority than providing a $1.2 trillion tax cut for the richest people in the country. It is the right thing to do. f LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001 Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator K ENNEDY and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 21, 2001, in Anaheim, CA. A 27 year-old Indian physical therapist was mistaken for a Middle Easterner and assaulted while celebrating his birthday at a karaoke bar. The victim was leaving the bar at about 1 a.m. with a group of his friends and family when several men picked a fight with him. Witnesses heard at least two people yell racial slurs about ''Middle Easterners.'' The man suffered a shattered jaw and was released from the hospital 2 days later after under-going surgery to have his mouth wired shut. I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well. f A RECKLESS GUN INDUSTRY Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a recent report published by the Brady Cam-paign to Prevent Gun Violence cites numerous examples of reckless sales and distribution practices by gun man-ufacturers, distributors and dealers. The report, entitled ''Smoking Guns: Exposing the Gun Industry's Com-plicity in the Illegal Gun Market,'' re-veals a disturbing pattern of negligence by some in the gun industry. In one example, in 1996, according to the report, the owner and six employ-ees of a California gun store were ar-rested for numerous Federal firearms offenses. The violations included sell-ing illegally converted, fully automatic AK-47 assault rifles and having em-ployees encourage customers to obtain false identification in order to skirt legal requirements for gun ownership. Even after the owner of the store was sent to prison, Heckler & Koch and other gun manufacturers, according to the report, continued to supply the store. In a letter explaining their ongo-ing business with the gun store, Heck-ler & Koch wrote that it ''is not our in-tention to turn away business.'' More recently, the sniper shootings that paralyzed the Washington, DC, area last year were committed with a rifle traced to a gun store in Tacoma, WA. According to the report, the Bush-master semi-automatic assault rifle possessed by the sniper suspects was only one of 238 guns missing from the store's inventory. Despite previous ATF audits which revealed dozens of missing weapons and evidence linking a Bushmaster rifle from the store to the sniper killings, according to the re-port, a Bushmaster executive an-nounced that his company still consid-ered the same store a ''good customer'' and would continue to sell to it. These examples of gun industry neg- ligence are by no means isolated. The Brady Campaign report contains nu-merous other examples of careless be-havior on the part of gun manufactur-ers and dealers, many of which sur-faced only after civil liability suits were filed. The Brady report reveals the disregard of some in the gun indus-try for even basic self-regulation. The Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that re-cently passed the House and that has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee would shield the gun indus-try from many legitimate civil law-suits. Certainly, those in the industry who conduct their business negligently or recklessly should not be shielded from the civil consequences of their ac-tions. f THE BROAD-BASED STOCK OPTION PLAN TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2003 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Fi- nancial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, issued a tentative decision last week to mandate the expensing of stock options. As a result of this deci-sion, the FASB will develop a mecha-nism for determining the cost of the options granted to employees and then force firms to deduct that cost from earnings in their financial statements. If finalized and enforced, expensing rules would kill broad-based options programs available to rank-and-file workers and punish companies that treat employees as partners in innova-tion rather than just as simple factors of production. But worst of all, it would misrepresent a firm's earnings because experts have said again and again that stock options cannot be priced accurately in the short term. The FASB received more than 250 comment letters during the period leading up to its current project on ex-pensing stock options. Those letters presented a range of views on whether stock options constitute a cost that should be deducted from earnings. Many respected economists and ac-countants stated clearly that options should not be expensed. But expensing seems to be the only mechanism that the FASB is willing to consider for im-proving investor understanding of a firm's financial condition. The experts I have worked with be- lieve that better, more detailed disclo-sure of stock option programs is the best mechanism for informing inves-tors on those programs. And I do not believe that the FASB has adequately considered greater disclosure as an al-ternative to expensing. Greater disclo-sure would provide investors with the information they need without discour-aging the use of stock option programs at innovative firms. At the very least, greater disclosure should be tried and evaluated prior to imposing a new, dis-ruptive expensing regime. Stock option programs mean oppor- tunity for workers across gender lines and wage scales in my state. In Silicon Valley, the median home price is $530,000. I know of single women work-ing in Silicon Valley who have only been able to own a home because of the stock options their companies offer them. For small businesses in my state, stock options permit cash- VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5645 May 1, 2003 strapped businesses to attract and re- tain employees who want to share in the fruits of a growing company. The Woman's High Tech Coalition wrote to me last year: The education process on stock options needs to be complete in its understanding of what this opportunity has meant to so many women, in particular, in terms of their abil-ity to lift themselves and their children out of a cycle that can affect several genera-tions. Unfortunately, the process at the FASB is not designed to consider the broader economic benefits of stock-op-tion programs in its rule-making proc-ess. In failing to consider these bene-fits, the FASB's actions may end up doing more harm than good. And before we allow unaccountable officials to create new rules that effectively elimi-nate stock option programs, I strongly believe that we should be fully in-formed about the broader impact on workers and productivity. A recently published book, ''In the Company of Owners: The Truth About Stock Op-tions (And Why Every Employee Should Have Them)'' includes exten-sive research showing that broad-based stock option plans, over the past 20 years, enhanced productivity, spurred capital formation, and enhanced share-holder value. We should carefully re-view the implications of any new pol-icy on stock options programs before implementing them and hoping for positive results. As a result of FASB's decision and the refusal to consider alternatives to expensing, I am joining Senator E NSIGN in introducing legislation that calls for the Securities and Exchange Commis-sion to undertake a thorough review of stock option programs and an assess-ment of the value of greater disclosure as an alternative to expensing. The bill sets a 3-year framework for evaluating this alternative to expensing during which the SEC could not enforce any new accounting standard on options that the FASB establishes. If the SEC's studies indicate that greater disclosure is not getting enough information to investors, then we can revisit the issue. But we should not let unelected, unaccountable FASB officials dictate policy through a rushed accounting standard. We must exercise our oversight function and carefully weigh alternatives that would be better for workers, investors, and the economy as a whole. f TAIWAN SUPPORT Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues the importance of U.S. rela-tions with Taiwan. Most Americans have been focused on the two media showpiece events in re-cent weeks\u2014the conflict in Iraq and the SARS pandemic. I would note to the Senate that our relations with Tai-wan\u2014a key strategic ally for the United States and a critical regional trading partner\u2014should not be over-looked. In addition to its strategic role with the U.S., Taiwan has a strong market- based economy and burgeoning multi- party democratic system. It has helped lead the modernization of Southeast Asia by demonstrating the importance of respecting civil liberties and the rule of law. A component of U.S. efforts to ensure regional stability is to maintain strong relations with Taiwan, including assur-ances to protect the island against military attacks. To support this ef-fort, the U.S. has a tradition of pro-viding military assistance to Taiwan for the purpose of its self-defense. In recent years, this assistance has pri-marily been in the form of sales of air-craft and advanced warning radars to the Taiwanese government. Most re-cently, the Bush administration an-nounced it would sell Taiwan a new as-sortment of defense articles, including diesel submarines, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, and Kidd-class destroyers. I support this decision because it recog-nizes the legitimate self-defense re-quirements of Taiwan, but does not de-stabilize the sensitive relations be-tween Taipei and Beijing. The Key to ensuring peace and sta- bility in the region is to promote healthy U.S. relations with Taiwan and support efforts to encourage the Peo-ple's Republic of China and Taiwan to resolve their differences peacefully. We should continue to pursue a means of supporting Taiwan without harming U.S. interests in China. f IN MEMORY OF HENRY BERMAN Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very dear friend and colleague of mine, Henry Berman, who died on Tuesday, April 27. He was just 92 years old. He was a true Renaissance man\u2014a man who loved life and loved people. Indeed, there was not a sweeter, gentler, or more generous person on earth than Henry Berman. Born in 1910, in New Haven, CT, Henry made his way to San Francisco in the early 1930s. During the Great De-pression he worked as laborer, then sold butter and eggs, until he settled down as a consultant for Joseph Sea-grams & Sons, where he worked for 56 years. Long active in San Francisco politics and a dedicated philanthropist, I was lucky enough to have Henry serve as the Chairman of the Fire Commission during my tenure as mayor. I was also fortunate enough to have him serve as my campaign treasurer, in 1992, when I first ran for the United States Senate. I never had a more loyal supporter. He served the city of San Francisco up until the very end of his life, when he was the president of the airport commission. According to his son Ron, Henry was on the phone with airport leaders even during the last days of his illness. That's classic Henry for you: if he could walk, sure enough he would be there. He was truly one of a kind. He was also involved in a wide range of civic and charitable work, including the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith, the American Jewish Com-mittee, Meals on Wheels and ''Mo's Kitchen,'' which provides daily meals at Glide Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco. Henry was also an overseer of UC-San Francisco, a trustee of the McLaren School of Business at the University of San Francisco, and a board member of USF's Fromm Institute of Lifelong Learning. When someone lives as long as Henry did\u201492 long, prosperous, and produc-tive years you can't conceive of the world without them. My heartfelt condolences go out to his wonderful wife Sally, to his sons Ron and Bob, and to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I will miss him greatly, but consider myself so very privileged to have known Henry Berman to be able to call him my loyal colleague and my dear, dear friend. f ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS RALPH KRISKA PERDUE Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I honor a pillar of the Fairbanks business community and a respected Athabaskan Elder, Ralph Kriska Perdue, who passed on early Tuesday morning at the age of 73. I doubt that most folks in Interior Alaska knew his real age. You see, for years Ralph's wife, Dorothy, conducted a 39th birth-day sale, every Christmas, at the fam-ily store, Perdue's Jewelers. Ralph was born on December 16, 1929 in the village of Koyukuk on the Yukon River. He became interested in making jewelry around 1946 and in 1961 opened a jewelry store in downtown Fairbanks. Ralph was a determined in-dividual. He once told a reporter for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, ''To me, there is satisfaction that some-thing is done the way it should be done, whether it's a piece of jewelry or anything that confronts me.'' The Fairbanks economy has experienced booms and busts, but Perdue's Jewelers has grown and prospered. Ralph will be remembered in Interior Alaska for many things. A bridge be-tween the Native community and the broader community, he served for 6 years as president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference and as a member of the Fairbanks North Star Borough Assem-bly and the Fairbanks North Star Bor-ough School Board. He will be dearly remembered as the father of the Fairbanks Native Associa-tion, which he helped found in 1963. Today, the Fairbanks Native Associa-tion has an annual operating budget of about $13 million and a workforce of VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5646 May 1, 2003 300 people. It provides a variety of so- cial services to the people of Fair-banks, including a very successful re-gional alcoholism treatment center, which was appropriately named the ''Ralph Perdue Center.'' Annette Freiburger, executive direc- tor of the Fairbanks Native Associa-tion (FNA), is quoted in the News- Miner as follows, ''Ralph has always served as a guide and inspiration for FNA. We recognized him as our FNA chief, the only chief we have in Fair-banks.'' Ralph was also the devoted father of Karen Perdue Bettisworth, the distin-guished former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Health and So-cial Services, and of Mona Perdue Jones. I extend to Dorothy, to Karen and to Mona, my deepest condolences and I join with the Fairbanks commu-nity in extending my appreciation to the late Chief Ralph Kriska Perdue for a job well done. f RECOGNIZING LORRAINE JOHNSON, 2003 GEORGIA TEACHER OF THE YEAR Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Lorraine John-son, Georgia's 2003 Teacher of the Year and a finalist for National Teacher of the Year. This Coweta County seventh grade teacher was selected as one of four fi-nalists for the National Teacher of the Year award by a panel made up of members from 15 national education organizations. She attended a cere-mony yesterday at the White House where the President recognized this great achievement, and I was honored to be part of the audience. Ms. Johnson has been an outstanding educator for over 18 years and has taught seventh-grade English and lan-guage arts at Arnall Middle School in Newnan, GA, for the past 8 years. This past year, Ms. Johnson has been on a sabbatical to travel across the State of Georgia giving speeches and con-ducting workshops for her peers at other Georgia schools. Ms. Johnson told a reporter recently that she hopes she can inspire other teachers to have pride in their profes-sion, and I think she is achieving that goal. Though her commitment and dedication to teaching she has influ-enced hundreds of students and made Georgia and our entire country a bet-ter place. Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute to Lorraine Johnson of Newnan, GA. Lor-raine Johnson is an outstanding Geor-gia educator. Lorraine Johnson was recently hon- ored and recognized as one of four fi-nalists by President George W. Bush at the White House for the National Teacher of the Year award. Top notch teachers, like Lorraine Johnson, work day and night to make a difference to our Nation's young peo-ple as they prepare for their future. These are our true American heroes in our communities, in our States and in our Nation. As the husband of a retired teacher who spent 35 years in the class-room, I know first hand the deep com-mitment, tough challenges, and endless efforts that go along with being a dedi-cated teacher. There is no doubt about it: Lorraine Johnson is a dedicated ed-ucator. Lorraine Johnson teaches seventh grade language arts at Arnall Middle School in Newnan, GA. In my home State of Georgia, Lorraine's excellence is no secret. She was named Georgia's Teacher of the Year for 2003 for her re-markable efforts. It was a real honor and a privilege to share in a special White House cere-mony praising Lorraine's hard work and dedication. President George W. Bush, U.S. Secretary of Education Rod-ney Paige and many other lawmakers also commended Lorraine Johnson for her accomplishments. Lorraine Johnson of Newnan, GA, is truly an outstanding educator. Not only is she an inspiration to Georgians, but she is an inspiration to all Ameri-cans. f HONORING BOB PROFT Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask that the following two tributes hon-oring the life of the late Bob Proft\u2014a proud Minnesotan, respected author, and brave World War II veteran\u2014be printed in the R ECORD . The tributes follow. [From the Star Tribune, Jan. 1996] A TRIBUTE TO HEROES (By Chuck Haga) Fifty years ago, Congress awarded a Medal of Honor to Jimmy LaBelle, a 19-year-old Marine from Columbia Heights and one of Bob Proft's best friends. Proft, a B-17 radio operator during the war, always wondered what his buddy had done to receive the country's highest mili-tary decoration, but he could find no lists, no compilation of citations. So Proft published a book. Working out of his sign-painter's garage in Columbia Heights, he researched the history of the medal, compiled lists of the recipients and their citations\u2014from the Civil War through Vietnam\u2014and in 1980 assembled an encyclo-pedic document of more than 1,100 pages. With co-publisher Mitch DeMars of Columbia Heights, he brought out an updated edition last year. Now anybody can look up Jimmy LaBelle's name and find out just what he did before he died on March 8, 1945, on Iwo Jima. ''I don't think there's anything else I've ever done that's given me more satisfac-tion,'' Proft said. He is a fit man of 70, earnest in his cause but self-effacing when talking about his own military service. ''I didn't do anything he-roic whatsoever,'' he said. But heroes matter to him. ''It bothers me that you can talk to young people and they don't even know what the Medal of Honor is,'' he said. ''They know John Wayne. They know 'Rambo.' Real he-roes are forgotten.'' LaBelle was a soft-spoken, unassuming teenager, ''Just one of the guys growing up in the Heights,'' Proft said. During high school, he worked at a hamburger joint called Virg's on Central Ave. He boxed in intramurals. About 15 years after the war, Proft was painting a sign near Virg's. As he passed the hamburger joint, he thought about LaBelle and his Medal of Honor. ''It struck me that I didn't know anything about what he had done,'' he said. He went to his local library, then to the Minneapolis Public Library. He wrote to gov-ernment and military sources. A friend helped with the search, but they came up empty-handed. In the late 1960s, the U.S. Government Printing Office compiled lists of recipients with their citations, he said, but that mate-rial was distributed only to federal deposi-tory libraries and couldn't be checked out. Proft thought there should be something that could go in school libraries, something that young hamburger-flippers could stum-ble across. ''You can't sit and read this book like a novel,'' he said. ''The citations would start blending together. But if you pick out a few citations at a time, they can really grip you.'' The honor roll lists 47 Minnesotans, includ- ing Dale Wayrynen of McGregor, who re-ceived the medal posthumously for gallantry in Vietnam. Ten of the Minnesotans were na-tives of other countries: Germany, Austria, Norway, England, Ireland and Canada. Proft's favorite is the citation for Nathanial Gwynne, who was 15 and trying to talk his way into the 13th Ohio Cavalry on July 30, 1864, at Petersburg, Va. When the unit charged a Confederate position, Gwynne rode along. The Yankees were forced to retreat, leav- ing their flag and battle standards. Young Gwynne charged back along, gathered up the colors and\u2014despite having an arm almost shot off\u2014brought them back. ''Somebody said, 'That young man should get the Medal of Honor,''' Proft said. ''Some-body else said, 'Yes, but we'd better get him mustered first.''' Since the medal was first presented in 1863, 3,420 have been awarded. Eighteen people re-ceived two medals. An award requires at least two witnesses, and the action must involve ''gallantry be-yond the call of duty'' and the risk of death. In 1916, a congressional panel reviewed records of medals awarded to that point and rescinded 910, Proft said, because they didn't meet those standards. Proft's book includes the citation for Alvin York, of course, the conscientious objector from Tennessee who became a World War I hero. Gary Cooper portrayed him in the film ''Sgt. York.'' And there are the stories of two living Minnesotans who received the Medal of Honor: Don Rudolph of Bovey, for actions in the Philippines during World II, and Mike Colalillo of Duluth, for actions against Ger-man forces near the end of the war in Eu-rope. Proft's labor was a good thing, said Ru- dolph, 74. ''It gets it into the schools and the city libraries.'' The Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Grand Rapids, Minn., bought 12 of the books for local schools and libraries, he said. Rudolph has had his own copy of the book signed by about 200 recipients of the medal. Today, only 184 recipients are living. ''I've read the citations of everybody in the book,'' he said. His own citation tells of his actions Feb. 5, when his platoon had been pinned down at Munoz, on Luzon: ''While administering first aid on the battlefield, he observed enemy fire issuing from a nearby culvert. Crawling to the culvert with rifle and grenades, he killed VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5647 May 1, 2003 three of the enemy concealed there. He then worked his way across open terrain toward a line of enemy pillboxes. . . .'' He used grenades, a pick and his rifle to put seven pillboxes out of commission. ''Later, when his platoon was attacked by an enemy tank, he advanced under covering fire, climbed to the top of the tank and dropped a white phosphorous grenade through the turret, destroying the crew.'' Rudolph said he made it through all that without a scratch. ''I've said many times that I really don't know why I did it or why I got the medal,'' he said. ''But I knew I had to do it. Other-wise we were going to lose more men.'' It was about a month later that LaBelle died on Iwo Jima. He was a private in the 5th Marine Divi- sion. On the night of March 8, as Japanese forces tried to break through American lines, a grenade landed in the foxhole that LaBelle shared with two other Marines. He shouted a warning, then fell on the gre- nade, absorbing most if its impact with his body. ''His dauntless courage, cool decision and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death reflect the highest credit on Pfc. LaBelle,'' his posthumous citation reads. Medals of Honor awarded in major con- flicts: Civil War 1,520; Indian campaigns (1861-1898) 428; Spanish-American War 109; World War I 124; World War II 433; Korean Conflict 131; Vietnam 239.

[From the Star Tribune, Apr. 13, 2003] REMEMBERING A WRITER (By Lou Gelfand) Often he offered a touch of whimsy or a sweet bow to tradition, rarely a cheap shot or a critical word. Those elements characterized the many hundreds of letters submitted to the Star Tribune editorial page over the years by Bob Proft, a retired Columbia Heights business owner. His short missives filled with expressive words were an antidote to the stream of let-ters to the editor exhorting the citizenry to rise in anger and slay the dragon of the day. That he knew only one letter every 30 days could qualify for publication didn't faze him. His profundity could come in 14 words or less, as when Americans began packing their bags for Iraq: ''Many things change from war to war, but never this: The goodbye kiss.'' His change of pace was delightful: ''The media exclaimed recently that Princess Diana has been dead four years. That means Mother Teresa has too. Ah, priorities.'' That is not to say Proft had no passion. ''We cannot abide a government of the peo- ple, by the lobbyists, for the privileged and remain a bona-fide democracy. If this gov-ernment of We the People is not, in fact and spirit, of us and by us and for us, we are op-erating with half-truths at best. And we are mocked by crafty hypocrites every time we are unctuously assured that we control this carefully designed system. In whatever man-ner and to whatever degree our representa-tion is tainted, that is the manner and de-gree our government is a counterfeit of what our founding fathers created.'' He lost his fettle for sports, but not for col- umnist Patrick Reusse. ''Older now, I seldom read the sports pages. However, thumbing through, I can't pass up Pat Reusse. For all the proper reasons I'm attracted to that face. It just came to me he reminds me of New York's Jimmy Breslin. With that face Reusse had to be a sports-writer or some guy living under the Third Avenue bridge. Now don't get me wrong, I still don't know if I should like this guy. But my, my, how he can write! I'll bet my den-tures Reusse is a closet poet. Robert Brown-ing or Robert Service type, I don't know.'' His love for holiday and tradition, spring and freedom and, above all, for family is ex-pressed in these letters some readers may have saved to savor: ''Contracted Christmas greeting: Ho!'' ''Sure signs autumn cometh: falling leaves, long sleeves.'' ''Our nation is free. For that reason we own everything we have to those we remem-ber this day.'' ''Any force at any time in any country that can keep a loving father from a loving son for one second is a force of evil. A mob at any time in any country may have the power to prevent a loving father from reach-ing his loving son but it will never have the right.'' His Veterans Day letter made him dear to the editor: ''While it is fitting and proper that we enjoy the fruits of our power and plenty, we must not forget those who destiny decreed should pay that price. Today is Veterans Day, set aside to commemorate that unique fraternity. Please, you needn't genuflect. Just give a knowing nod, and maybe a smile.'' Proft enlisted in World War II and was training to fly bombers when peace came. His love for country was funneled into pub- lishing a 1,248-page book listing Medal of Honor Recipients and their official citations. Humility dictated that his initials, not his name, be on the cover. The final letter from Proft, 78, arrived last week. He died at home early Thursday morn-ing after a short illness. f HONORING DR. MARTHA MYERS Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a selfless Amer-ican, Dr. Martha Myers. Many know Dr. Myers as one of the two Southern Baptist missionaries recently mur-dered by extremists in Yemen. She rep-resents the bests in missionary service. She was, by her aid to those in need, a demonstrated friend of the people of Yemen and in the end, she laid down her life for them. Greater love hath no one than this. Her death has touched me deeply as it has touched many worldwide. It has also, unfortunately, heightened our concern for Christian missionaries throughout the world. Dr. Myers was educated in my home State of Alabama where she earned de-grees from both Samford University and University of Alabama Medical School. The daughter of the State of Alabama's long time health officer, Dr. Ira Myers, she was educated and trained as an obstetrician. Instead of seeking monetary gain, like a modern day Nehemiah she dedicated the rest of her life in selfless service to the indi-gent families of Yemen. She spent 24 years as a medical missionary in Yemen ministering by example. Her colleagues have stated that she often slept in her office cubicle to save money to give to poor families in com-munities surrounding the hospital. I find it particularly telling that it was her choice to be buried on the grounds of the hospital in Yemen. I find this important because it shows a total and complete devotion to the dif-ficult and selfless work she felt called to do. It demonstrated her total com-mitment without thought of turning back. Former professors and college friends say that her sense of calling to the field of missions was ''crystal clear.'' They also said it was evident to everyone around her that this clear call to serve others empowered and mo-tivated her even as a college freshman in 1963. Dr. Martha Myers' ability to rise above personal interest in service of others goes far beyond what most peo-ple can conceive. Dr. Mike Howell, her former biology professor, summarized her life and commitment well in saying ''There aren't many people willing to dedicate their life to people. That is the greatest calling of a Christian.'' While the world has lost a selfless servant, We may hope that the life of Martha Myers will serve as an inspira-tion for others. It demonstrates that religious faith can be the basis for a life dedicated to others, even if those served have a different religion. Dr. Myers did not limit her patients to Christians. She served all in need, and she never forced her views on anyone. In these days of terrorism and the prospect of war, our world should think deeply about the well lived life of Dr. Martha Myers. In such loving humility can come the seeds of a more peaceful world. Some may say that this senseless murder proves that radicalism rules the day and that such acts can only be dealt with by war. But, perhaps not. Certainly, some radicalized terrorist, someone with a twisted view of their faith, can end a lifetime of work. Still, such evil acts cannot erase the good she has done. And, maybe, just maybe, the thousands of poor, sick, and dying that she treated and comforted will have a different view of the United States, a different view of the West, and a different view of freedom and faith as a result of her life well lived. In that we can all take comfort. f JARISSE J. SANBORN, B.G. U.S. AIR FORCE Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great Alaskan upon the occasion of her promotion to Brigadier General in the United States Air Force. I am speaking of Jarisse J. Sanborn who, on April 1, 2003, became the first active duty woman ever promoted to Brigadier General in the Judge Advo-cate Corps of any armed service in this country. Upon her promotion, General Sanborn was assigned to U.S. Trans-portation Command and the Air Mobil-ity Command, where she serves as the Staff Judge Advocate to both com-mands. General Sanborn, the daughter of a career Navy officer, began her Air Force career after graduating Magna Cum Laude from Randolph-Macon VerDate Mar 15 2010 SENATE S5648 May 1, 2003 Woman's College in Virginia. After serving as a squadron and wing execu-tive officer, she was selected for the Air Force-funded legal education pro-gram, graduating from Creighton Law School in Omaha, NE, again Magna Cum Laude. She is also a graduate of the National War College. General Sanborn has had a distin- guished legal career, including her most recent assignment as the Staff Judge Advocate for the North Amer-ican Aerospace Defense Command, bet-ter known by its acronym NORAD, and U.S. Northern Command, the newly created unified command responsible for the homeland defense of the United States. General Sanborn also has been the Staff Judge Advocate for U.S. Space Command, Air Force Space Com-mand, and Alaska Command. From her time as head of Alaska Command at Fort Richardson in An-chorage, she remains a resident of Alaska, where she and her husband Al still own a home in Eagle River. They have two sons: Tyler and John. Brigadier General Sanborn is a vet- eran of Operation Desert Storm, where she earned the Bronze Star as the Staff Judge Advocate for the Fourth Fighter Wing deployed to Oman and Saudi Ara-bia. Now, at a time when women are mak- ing such important contributions to our efforts in Iraq, it's very appro-priate that we recognize the success of this fine officer. It is also appropriate that we celebrate this important step for all women in the military. General Sanborn truly makes all Americans proud of the capabilities and accom-plishments of our Armed Forces. f MASSACHUSETTS STATE TROOPER SCOTT M CDONALD Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I pay tribute to one of Massachusetts' finest law enforcement officers\u2014Massachu-setts State Trooper Scott McDonald. Recently, Trooper McDonald was hon-ored by the Massachusetts State Police with a Medal of Lifesaving, awarded to bestow recognition upon troopers who undertake significant actions in the saving of another life. On August 4, 2002, Trooper Scott McDonald was on patrol when he was dispatched to a motor vehicle accident in the town of Deerfield. Upon arrival, he observed a truck overturned on the road. As the driver was without a pulse and not breathing, he immediately began CPR. While a passing motorist stopped, identified herself as a doctor and said she would pronounce the vic-tim dead, Scott continued lifesaving ef-forts. Amazingly, the driver was ulti-mately revived and flown to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield. Trooper McDonald is a fine example of the Commonwealth's outstanding first responder community. I rise to join the Massachusetts State Police, the City of Holyoke, and Scott's family and friends in honoring a great Amer-ican, Massachusetts State Trooper Scott McDonald.

A bill to provide Federal as- sistance to States and local jurisdic-tions to prosecute hate crimes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues in in-troducing this legislation to combat hate crimes. Hate crimes are a viola-tion of all our country stands for. They send the poisonous message that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of who they are. Like acts of terrorism, hate crimes have an impact far greater than the impact on the individual victims. They are crimes against entire communities, against the whole Nation, and against the fun-damental ideals on which America was founded. As Attorney General Ashcroft has said, ''Criminal acts of hate run counter to what is best in America\u2014 our belief in equality and freedom.'' Although there was a significant overall reduction in violent crimes dur-ing the 1990s, the number of hate crimes continued to grow. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9,730 hate crimes were reported in the United States in 2001. That is over 26 hate crimes a day, every day. More than 83,000 hate crimes have been re- ported since 1991. The need for an effective national re- sponse is as compelling as it has ever been. Hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims rose dramatically in the weeks following the September 11 ter-rorist attacks. These hate crimes in-cluded murder, beatings, arson, attacks on mosques, shootings, and other as-saults. In 2001, anti-Islamic incidents were the second highest-reported type of hate crimes based on religion\u2014sec-ond only to anti-Jewish hate crimes. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5653 May 1, 2003 Los Angeles and Chicago reported a massive increase in the number of anti- Arab and anti-Muslim crimes after 9/11. Hate crimes based on sexual orienta- tion continue to be a serious danger, constituting 14 percent of all hate crimes reported. Each person's life is valuable, and even one life lost is too many. It is not the frequency of hate crimes alone that makes these acts of violence so serious. It is the terror and intimidation they inflict on the victims, their families, their communities, and, in some cases, the entire Nation. Congress cannot sit silent while this hatred spreads. It is long past time for us to do more to end hate-motivated violence. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act will strengthen the ability of Federal, State and local gov-ernments to investigate and prosecute these vicious and senseless crimes. Our legislation is supported by over 175 law enforcement, civil rights, civic, and re-ligious organizations. The current Federal law on hate crimes was passed soon after the assas-sination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today, however, it is a generation out of date. It has two significant defi-ciencies. It does not cover hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. And even in cases of hate crimes based on race, religion, or eth-nic background, it contains excessive restrictions requiring proof that the victims were attacked because they were engaged in certain ''federally pro-tected activities.'' Our bill is designed to close these substantial loopholes. It has six prin-cipal provisions: 1. It removes the ''fed-erally protected activity'' barrier. 2. It adds sexual orientation, gender and disability to the existing categories of race, color, religion, and national ori-gin. 3. It protects State interests with a strict certification procedure that re-quires the Federal Government to con-sult with local officials before bringing a Federal case. 4. It offers federal as-sistance to State and local law enforce-ment officials to investigate and pros-ecute heated crimes in any of the fed-eral categories. 5. It offers training grants for local law enforcement. 6. It amends the Federal Hate Crime Statis-tics Act to add gender to the existing categories of race, religion, ethnic background, sexual orientation, and disability. These much needed changes in cur- rent law will help ensure that the De-partment of Justice has what it needs to combat the growing problem of hate-motivated violence more effec-tively. Nothing in the bill prohibits or pun- ishes speech, expression, or association in any way\u2014even ''hate speech.'' It ad-dresses only violent actions that result in death or injury. The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly\u2014and as recently as this year, in the cross-burning deci-sion Virginia v. Black\u2014that a hate crimes statute that considers bias mo-tivation directly connected to a de-fendant's criminal conduct does not violate the First Amendment. No one has a First Amendment right to com-mit a crime. A strong Federal role in prosecuting hate crimes is essential, because crimes have an impact far greater than their impact on individual victims. Nevertheless, our bill fully respects the primary role of state and local law en-forcement in responding to violent crime. The vast majority of hate crimes will continue to be prosecuted at the state and local level. The bill au-thorizes the Justice Department to as-sist State and local authorities in hate crimes cases, but it authorizes Federal prosecutions only when a state does not have jurisdiction, or when it asks the Federal Government to take juris-diction, or when it fails to act against hate-motivated violence. In other words, the bill establishes an appro-priate back-up for State and local law enforcement, to deal with hate crimes in cases where states request assist-ance, or cases that would not otherwise be effectively investigated and pros-ecuted. Working cooperatively, State, local and Federal law enforcement officials have the best chance to bring the per-petrators of hate crimes to justice. Federal resources and expertise in the identification and proof of hate crimes can provide invaluable assistance to state and local authorities without un-dermining the traditional role of states in prosecuting crimes. As Attorney General Ashcroft has said of current law, ''Cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement offi-cers and between Justice Department prosecutors and local prosecutors has been outstanding.'' And it will con-tinue to be so, and be even more effec-tive, when this legislation is enacted into law. Now is the time for Congress to speak with one voice and insist that all Americans will be guaranteed the equal protection of the laws. Now is the time to make combating hate crimes a high national priority. The Local Law En-forcement Enhancement Act is a need-ed response to a serious problem that continues to plague the nation, and I urge the Senate to support it. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 966 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a serious na-tional problem. (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of communities and is deeply divi-sive. (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue to be responsible for pros-ecuting the overwhelming majority of vio-lent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes motivated by bias. These au-thorities can carry out their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal assist-ance. (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this problem. (5) The prominent characteristic of a vio- lent crime motivated by bias is that it dev-astates not just the actual victim and the family and friends of the victim, but fre-quently savages the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be selected. (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce in many ways, includ-ing\u2014 (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape the inci-dence or risk of such violence; and (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining employment, or par-ticipating in other commercial activity. (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to com- mit such violence. (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumental- ities of interstate commerce are used to fa-cilitate the commission of such violence. (9) Such violence is committed using arti- cles that have traveled in interstate com-merce. (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude were de-fined by the race, color, and ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involun-tary servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption of the 13th amend-ment to the Constitution of the United States, through widespread public and pri-vate violence directed at persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, elimi-nating racially motivated violence is an im-portant means of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude. (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States were adopted, and con-tinuing to date, members of certain religious and national origin groups were and are per-ceived to be distinct ''races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of real or perceived religions or national ori-gins, at least to the extent such religions or national origins were regarded as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States. (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain vio- lent crimes motivated by bias enables Fed-eral, State, and local authorities to work to-gether as partners in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes. (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal assistance to States and local jurisdictions. SEC. 3.

By Mr. SESSIONS: S. 968. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide capital gain treatment under section 631(b) of such Code for outright sales of timber by landowners; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will simplify and update a provision of the tax code that affects the sale of timber. It is both a simplification measure and a fairness measure. I call it the Timber Tax Simplification Act. Under current law, landowners that are occasional sellers of timer are often classified by the Internal Rev-enue Service as ''dealers.'' As a result, the small landowner is forced to choose, because of the tax code, be-tween two different methods of selling their timber. The first method, ''lump sum sales provides for good business practice but is subjected to a high in-come tax. The second method ''pay-as- cut'' sales, allows for lower capital gains tax treatment, but often results in an underrealization of the fair value of the contract. Why, one might ask, do these conflicting incentives exist for our Nation's timber growers? Ealier in this century, outright, or ''lump sum,'' sales on a cash in ad-vance, sealed basis, were associated with a ''cut and run'' mentality that did not promote good forest manage-ment. ''Pay-as-cut sales,'' however, in which a timber owner is only paid for timber that is harvested, were associ-ated with ''enlighted'' resource man-agement. Consequently, in 1943, Con-gress, in an effect to provide an incen-tive for improved forest management, passed legislation that allowed capital gains treatment under 631(b) of the IRS Code for pay-as-cut sales, leaving lump-sum sales to pay the much higher rate of income tax. It is said that President Roosevelt opposed the bill and almost vetoed it. Today, however, Section 631(b) like so many provisions in the IRS Code, is outdated. Forest management prac-tices are much different from what they were in 1943 and lump-sum sales are no longer associated with poor for-est management. And while there are occasional special situations where other methods may be more appro-priate, most timber owners prefer this method over the ''pay-as-cut'' method. The reasons are simple: title to the timber is transferred upon the closing of the sale and the buyer assumes the risk of any physical loss of timber to fire, insects, disease, storms, etc. Fur- thermore, the price to be paid for the timber is determined and received at the time of the sale. Unfortunately, in order for timber owners to qualify for the favorable cap-ital gains treatment, they must mar-ket their timber on a ''pay-as-cut'' basis under Section 631(b) which re-quires timber owners to sell their tim-ber with a ''retained economic inter-est.'' This means that the timber owner, not the buyer, must bear the risk of any physical loss during the timber sale contract period and must be paid only for the timber that is ac-tually harvested. As a result, this type of sale can be subject to fraud and abuse by the timber buyer. Since the buyer pays only for the timber that is removed and scaled, there is an incen-tive to waste poor quality timber by breaking the tree during the logging process, underscaling the timber, or re-moving the timber without scaling. But because 631(b) provides for the fa-vorable tax treatment, many timber owners are forced into exposing them-selves to unnecessary risk of loss by having to market their timber in this disadvantageous way instead of the more preferable lump-sum method. Like many of the provisions in the tax code, Section 631(b) is outdated and prevents good forestry business man-agement. Timber farmers, who have usually spent decades producing their timber ''crop,'' should be able to re-ceive equal tax treatment regardless of the method used for marketing their timber. In the past, the Joint Committee on Taxation has studied this legislation to consider what impact it might have on the Treasury and found that it would have no real cost\u2014only a ''negligible change'' according to their analysis. The IRS has no business stepping in and dictating the kind of sales contract a landowner must choose. My legisla-tion will provide greater consistency by removing the exclusive ''retained economic interest'' requirement in the IRC Section 631(b). Reform of 631(b) is important to our Nation's non-indus-trial, private landowners because it will improve the economic viability of their forestry investments and protect the taxpayer from unnecessary expo-sure to risk of loss. This in turn will benefit the entire forest products in-dustry, the U.S. economy and espe-cially small landowners. By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for him- self, Mr. K ENNEDY , Mr. C ORZINE , and Mr. R EED): S. 969. A bill to enhance the security and safety of the Nation by increasing the time allowed to track terrorists during periods of elevated alert, clos- ing loopholes that have allowed terror-ists to acquire firearms, maintaining records of certain handgun transfers during periods of heightened terrorist risk, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a critical piece of leg-islation, the Homeland Security Gun Safety Act. In the aftermath of the tragic events of 9-11, the Federal Government has re-assessed the Nation's vulnerabilities to acts and threats of terrorism. And in response, the United States Congress gave the Department of Jus-tice expanded powers to detain sus-pected terrorists, conduct surveillance and obtain confidential information on American citizens. In addition, we have created the new Department of Home-land Security\u2014the largest reorganiza-tion of the Federal Government since the 1940s. In short, the events of 9-11 required us to reevaluate our safety concerns and the security of the Nation. Echoing this need, President Bush said before the United Nations on No-vember 10, 2001, that ''we have the re-sponsibility to deny weapons to terror-ists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them.'' I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. And I believe the American people want the U.S. Senate to follow through with concrete legislative ac-tion. However, we have failed to address a significant remaining threat: the ac-cessibility to firearms and explosives within our own borders. How can we truly protect this Na- tion, if we do not enact legislation which prevents terrorists and potential terrorists from acquiring guns in the United States? Terrorists have identified the lax gun laws of the United States as a means to advance their evil goal to terrorize and harm the American people. In December 2001, during the war on terror, we attacked a terrorist training facility south of Kabul. Found among the rubble at that facility was a man-ual called: ''How I Can Train Myself for Jihad.'' This manual, contains an entire sec- tion on ''Firearms Training'' and sin-gles out the United States for its easy availability of firearms. It stipulates that terrorists living in the U.S. should ''obtain an assault weapon legally, preferably AK-47 or variations.'' It also advises would-be terrorsts on how they should conduct themselves in order to avoid arousing suspicion as they amass and transport firearms. There are other examples where ter- rorists have sought to take advantage of this nation's lax gun laws. On the eve of the September 11 ter- rorist attack, on September 10, 2001, a Federal jury convicted Ali Boumelhem, a known member of the terrorist group Hezbollah on seven counts of weapons charges and conspiracy to ship weapons and ammunition to Lebanon. And we have seen how firearms can be used to terrorize an entire commu-nity. We are all familiar with the case of John Muhammad and John Malvo, who terrorized the Washington, DC area for more than three weeks as they em-barked on a shooting spree with a snip-er rifle, shooting 13 innocent people be-fore being caught. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5656 May 1, 2003 Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge agrees that there is a dangerous link between guns and terror. During his confirmation hearing before Gov-ernmental Affairs Committee on Janu-ary 17, 2003, in response to a question I asked him about guns and terror, Sec-retary Ridge said: [W]hen anyone uses a firearm, whether it's the kind of terrorism that we are trying to combat with al Qaeda and these non-state terrorists, or as a former district attorney involved in the conviction of an individual who used firearms against innocent citi-zens\u2014regardless of how we define terrorism, that individual and that family felt that they were victims of a terrorist act. Bran-dishing a firearm in front of anybody under any set of circumstances is a terrorist act and needs to be dealt with. Well, the Homeland Security Gun Safety Act deals with it. The Act deals with this threat that leaves America especially vulnerable to future ter-rorist attacks. The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act would enact specific measures that would help prevent terrorists from ac-quiring firearms within our own bor-ders. Under current law, there are cases when law enforcement is blocked from conducting an adequate investigation when a terrorist or criminal tries to buy a gun. Current law says if law enforcement takes over three days to conduct a background check on someone who wants a weapon\u2014just hand over the gun. That is ludicrous\u2014especially when we are in an elevated state of terrorist threat. When we are at Code Yellow, the De- partment of Homeland Security has de-termined that we are at a significant risk of terrorist attack. The bill I am introducing today would suspend these loopholes in our gun safety laws when we are at Code Yellow or above in the interest of homeland security. The three-day limit on law enforce- ment is nothing more than a loophole in our laws put there by the gun lobby. And it's a dangerous loophole\u2014a re- cent study showed that, from Decem-ber 1998 to June 2001, nearly 10,000 peo-ple who should not have been per-mitted to buy guns, did receive guns because the three-day period passed be-fore law enforcement could finish a background check. Our bill will also require that the Federal Government retain records of weapons transactions while we are in an elevated state of alert. There is no reason we should handicap law enforce-ment during such a dangerous time. This bill will also close a number of loopholes that have allowed rogue gun dealers to skirt the law. These are the same few gun dealers that are now the subject of lawsuits across the country. These dangerous loopholes that the gun lobby built into our gun laws now pose a major threat to homeland secu-rity. This bill will help shut down those loopholes. The bill would require gun dealers to: immediately report ''miss- ing'' guns or face suspension of their li-cense; and put appropriate security measures in place to prevent theft of their weapons; and check with the FBI's Stolen Gun Registry to make sure that secondhand weapons they purchase are not stolen. This bill will also step up enforce- ment of gun dealers: law enforcement would not be restricted in its ability to inspect dealers. Currently, law enforce-ment is only allowed one unannounced inspection per year. The bill will also increase the pen- alties for violations of gun dealer laws to a felony. Right now, the maximum penalty is only a misdemeanor. It has no teeth. I know the NRA will cry wolf to gun owners about this bill. But this bill will not affect the vast majority of honest, law abiding Americans who want to purchase guns. This bill fo-cuses on preventing weapons from get-ting into the hands of terrorists and criminals. Over 75 percent of background checks are performed in mere minutes. How-ever, there are those purchasers who raise red flags that require further in-vestigation. Those are red flags we can no longer afford to ignore. When we are at Code Yellow, every- day Americans are prevented from tak-ing a tour of the White House\u2014but a terrorist can buy weapons. It makes no sense. This bill offers Congress a clear choice: protect our homeland or pro-tect the gun lobby. I ask unanimous consent that a sum- mary of my bill, the Homeland Secu-rity Gun Safety Act, be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the sum- mary was ordered to be printed in the RECORD , as follows: THEHOMELAND SECURITY GUNSAFETY ACT OF 2003 In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Federal Government has reassessed the Nation's vulnerabilities to acts and threats of terrorism. However, ac-tions taken thus far have failed to address a major remaining threat: accessibility to fire-arms and explosives within our own borders. The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act of 2003 addresses this threat that leaves Amer-ica especially vulnerable to future terrorist attacks. The Act would enact specific measures that would help prevent terrorists from ac-quiring firearms and explosives in the United States. Specifically, the Act: 1. enacts in-creased homeland security measures regard-ing firearm sales when the terrorist risk level of the Homeland Security Advisory System is raised to ''Elevated''; 2. closes loopholes that have allowed rogue gun deal-ers to abuse existing law and supply weapons to terrorists and criminals; and 3. strength-ens the enforcement of laws federally li-censed gun dealers are required to follow. ''We have the responsibility to deny weap- ons to terrorists and to actively prevent pri-vate citizens from providing them.''\u2014Presi-dent George W. Bush, Address to the United Nations, November 10, 2001. THE PROBLEM : TERRORISM AND GUNS There are a number of cases in which ter- rorists, both domestic and international, have been acquiring firearms in our country and are using them here and abroad for des-picable acts of violence. Firearms are being acquired by prohibited persons due to the weakness and lack of enforceability of exist-ing gun laws. Examples of the link between terrorism and firearms in the U.S. include: In December, 2001, a manual titled ''How I Can Train Myself for Jihad'' was found among the rubble at a training facility for a radical Pakistan-based Islamic terrorist or-ganization in Afghanistan. This manual con-tains an entire section on ''Firearms Train-ing'' and singles out the United States for its easy availability of firearms. It stipulates that terrorists living in the U.S. ''obtain an assault weapon legally, preferably AK-47 or variations.'' It also advises would-be terror-ists on how they should conduct themselves in order to avoid arousing suspicion as they amass and transport firearms. In November 2000, Ali Bourmelhem, was ar- rested for shipping guns and ammunition to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon by hiding the arms in cargo crates. Boumelhem, who was a resident of Detroit and Beirut, was ob-served by authorities traveling to gun shows to buy gun parts and ammunition for ship-ment overseas. He was arrested just before he was scheduled to travel to Lebanon. In September 2000, Conor Claxton, an ad- mitted member of the IRA, bought dozens of handguns, rifles and rounds of high-powered ammunition through illegal multiple sales and at gun shows. Police in Northern Ireland intercepted 23 of the packages which con-tained 122 guns and other weapons origi-nating from the group. Claxton's team en-listed the assistance of a licensed firearms dealer in Florida who sold at least 43 hand-guns to associates of Claxton. The dealer agreed not to report all of the sales on re-quired Federal forms in exchange for an extra $50 per gun. The dealer admitted that he suspected the guns could wind up in the hands of assassins. The dealer later cooper-ated with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to conspiring to export guns illegally. Accord-ing to the FBI Agent interviewing Claxton: ''Claxton stated that it is common knowl-edge that obtaining weapons in the United States is easy,'' and that ''Claxton blamed the United States government for not having tougher gun laws.'' In 1993, the owners of the Al Fajr Trading Company in Atlanta were convicted of ille-gally shipping hundreds of guns to Muslim street gangs and drug dealers in New York, Detroit and Philadelphia. Among the cus-tomers was a gang associated with Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Egyptian cleric who was involved in the 1993 terrorist bomb-ing of the World Trade Center. Al Fajr was a licensed dealer but intentionally failed to maintain firearms transaction records of nearly 1,000 guns that were trafficked to the Northeast. In 1992, an Iranian immigrant in the United States was shot and killed execution style outside her home in Northern New Jer-sey by a suspected Iranian terrorist. The gun was bought at a Virginia gun shop that was preferred by straw purchasers, high-volume buyers, gun traffickers and convicted felons. The Virginia gun shop owners were arrested 2 months prior to the murder and pleaded guilty to charges stemming from straw pur-chases. Cases of the use of firearms for terrorist acts include: In 2002, John Muhammad and John Malvo terrorized the Washington, DC area for more than 3 weeks by embarking on a shooting spree with a sniper rifle. The weapon used to shoot 13 innocent victims was a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle purchased at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, WA. Muhammad VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5657 May 1, 2003 could not have legally purchased it because he is under a domestic violence restraining order and Malvo at age 17 is disqualified as a minor and an illegal immigrant. Two em-ployees of the store admitted that they no-ticed that the .223 caliber Bushmaster was ''missing'' from a display case but the store's owner did not report the loss as required by Federal law. Following the sniper killings, the shop revealed that over 200 guns went ''missing'' in the last several years. Bull's Eye Shooter Supply remains in operation today. In February 1997, Ali Abu Kamal opened fire on a crowd of tourists at the Empire State Building, killing one person and wounding six others. Kamal arrived in New York from Cairo on a tourist visa. After a short stay in New York, he traveled to Mel-bourne, FL where he checked into a motel. He showed the motel receipt as proof of resi-dency to obtain a Florida ID card which he used to buy a 14-shot, semi-automatic Be-retta handgun. Total time from arrival in this country to purchase of the gun was 37 days. The same gun store in Melbourne sold a Ruger Mini 14 rifle to mass-murderer Wil-liam Cruse a month before he went on a shooting spree in Palm Bay, FL. Cruse killed six people and wounded two dozen others. ''[W]hen anyone uses a firearm, whether it's the kind of terrorism that we are trying to combat with al Qaeda and these non-state terrorists, or as a former district attorney involved in the conviction of an individual who used firearms against innocent citi-zens\u2014regardless of how we define terrorism, that individual and that family felt that they were victims of a terrorist act. Bran-dishing a firearm in front of anybody under any set of circumstances is a terrorist act and needs to be dealt with.''\u2014Tom Ridge, January 17, 2003, at his confirmation hearing for Secretary of Homeland Security, before the Senate Government Affairs Committee. CONFRONTING THE THREAT : THE HOMELAND SECURITY GUN SAFETY ACT OF 2003 The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act of 2003 integrates gun safety into our national homeland security strategy. The bill will suspend the current restrictions on law en-forcement's investigative powers during pe-riods of ''Elevated'' terror threat. Currently, law enforcement is severely limited in its ability to conduct background checks on suspicious gun purchasers. While over 70 percent of background checks are completed within seconds, and approxi-mately 95 percent are completed within 2 hours, red flags raised on some people's records require further investigation. Under current law, law enforcement only has 3 days to conduct a background check. Given the complexity of tracing court records, the 3- day period often does not give law enforce-ment enough time to complete a check in some important cases. However, under cur-rent law, after the 3-day period has expired, the firearm is handed over to the purchaser\u2014 even if the person is a convicted felon or part of a terrorist organization. Under the Homeland Security Gun Safety Act, when the Department of Homeland Se-curity determines that the nation is in an ''Elevated'' (yellow) risk of attack or above, the 3-day rule would be suspended and law enforcement would have as much time as needed to complete a background check on an individual seeking a weapon or explosive. Upon reverting to a ''Low,'' green, risk for a period of 180 consecutive days, the 3-day rule would resume. The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act would suspend this record destruction rule, and require that all records of firearms transfers subject to background checks and records of the National Instant Criminal Background Check system be maintained in- definitely when the Department of Homeland Security determines that the nation is at an ''elevated,'' yellow, risk of terrorist attack or above. Upon reverting to a ''Low,'' green, risk for a period of 180 consecutive days, the standard destruction of records rule resumes. This information will be critical to inves-tigators who are tracking potential terror-ists within our borders while we are in a heightened state of alert. Federal Firearms Dealer Responsibilities The Homeland Security Gun Safety Act re- quires more responsibility on the part of Federal Firearms Licensees; FFLs; to pre-vent the flow of illegal firearms. Under the current regime, rules gun dealers are ''re-quired'' to follow are routinely ignored, as the gun laws provide for little enforcement, and even restrict the ability of law enforce-ment to check gun dealer compliance. In ad-dition, the current system allows terrorists and criminals to travel from dealer to dealer to attempt to purchase a gun until they ''score''\u2014without worrying about detection of their failed purchases. The Homeland Se-curity Gun Safety Act would close these loopholes that allow rogue gun dealers to evade the law and sell guns to criminals and terrorists. Specifically, the Act would: Require FFLs to report missing weapons immediately and satisfy record keeping re-quirements, for multiple handgun sales, theft or loss of firearm registration docu-ments, trace requests, out of business and demand records, or face suspension of their licenses. As the ATF's ability to trace crime guns depends on the records kept by FFLs, it is imperative that FFLs fulfill their respon-sibility to timely report missing weapons and relevant records. Requires FFLs not to sell a firearm to an individual when they have reasonable cause to believe that a gun will be used in the com-mission of a crime. If a FFL has reasonable cause to believe that a purchaser is not buying a firearm for his or her own use, but intends to transfer it to another individual who would not qualify for a legal gun purchase, he or she will be prohibited from making the transfer. This is commonly known as a ''straw purchase'' and is a major problem in firearm trafficking in the United States. Require FFLs to abide by security stand- ards for the storage and display of firearms. According to the ATF, in 1998 and 1999, FFLs filed reports on over 27,287 missing or stolen firearms. The Act would authorize suspen-sions and fines of FFLs who fail to abide by security standards for the display and stor-age of firearms. Require FFLs to check all secondhand fire- arm purchases through the FBI's Stolen Gun Registry to confirm that the firearm was not stolen prior to the purchase. Require that FFLs notify NICS imme- diately upon receiving a request from a pro-spective transferee, of any check conducted within the previous 30 days that did not re-sult in the transfer of a handgun. Increase the number of permissible inspec- tions of gun dealers from one unannounced inspection per year, current law, to an un-limited amount of inspections for any viola-tion. If a licensee has a poor compliance record, such as one of the 1.2 percent of fire-arms dealers who account for 57 percent of crime guns, multiple compliance inspections within the 1-year period are necessary for adequate supervision. Increase penalties for FFLs who fail to ac- count for missing weapons, fail to timely record or maintain records, record keeping violations or knowingly make false state-ments in connection with firearms from 1 year to 5 years and assess fines up to $10,000 per violation. The current penalty for this violation is a misdemeanor. Prohibit any licensed firearms dealer from selling two or more handguns to an unli-censed individual during any 30-day period. This prohibition will be inapplicable to an exchange of one handgun for one handgun. Increase the penalties for persons who un- lawfully transfer handguns to juveniles from a misdemeanor to a felony. Suspend a FFL's license if the licensee is charged with a crime. Currently, a gun deal-er can remain in operation if charged with a crime. Require the termination of a FFLs license upon a conviction of a felony. Under current law, a licensee convicted of a felony may continue to conduct business until appeal rights are exhausted. This is a serious loop-hole which jeopardizes public safety by al-lowing convicted felons to continue buying and selling large quantities of firearms in interstate commerce pending the resolution of their appeals. Require criminal background checks of gun industry employees who deal with fire-arms, including gun shops, manufacturers and distributors. Increase the penalty for persons who un- lawfully transfer firearms to a juvenile, from a misdemeanor to a felony. Decrease the amount of black powder ex- plosive one is able to acquire without a per-mit from 50 pounds to 5 pounds. According to the ATF report on Commerce in Firearms in the United States, only 1.2 percent of Federal firearms licensees\u20141,020 of the approximately 83,200 FFL retail deal-ers\u2014account for over half, 57 percent, of the crime guns traced to current FFLs. This is a staggering number that depicts the disregard of existing laws by these rogue gun dealers. The Homeland and Security Gun Safety Act will strengthen current regulatory control and enforcement in order to protect the safe-ty of the public, while allowing law-abiding Americans to purchase firearms for their own use. ''It's our position at the Justice Depart- ment and the position of this Administration that we need to unleash every possible tool in the fight against terrorism and do so promptly.''\u2014Attorney General John Ash- croft, Testimony before Congress, September 24, 2001. It is time we take a common sense ap- proach to the terrorist threats that face our country today. Terrorists are well aware of our lax gun laws, and we must act preemp-tively to prevent future tragedies. It is time for action to prevent terrorism by strength-ening our country's current gun laws. Our citizens demand it and our homeland secu-rity depends on it. It is time we take a common sense approach to the terrorist threats that face our country today.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to preserve jobs and production activities in the United States; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, March marked the 32nd consecutive month, since July 2000), that manufac-turing employment has declined in the United States. This is the longest con-secutive monthly decline in the post VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5658 May 1, 2003 World War II era. Already, more than 2 million manufacturing jobs are gone. In South Carolina, we have seen a steady erosion of our manufacturing job base, and if we don't come up with new concepts to create and maintain domestic manufacturing jobs, America will go out of business. For all of 2002, industrial production fell 0.6 percent following a 3.5 percent decline in 2001. That represented the first back-to-back annual declines in industrial output since 1974-1975. Quite frankly, this is unacceptable. We must act to save our manufac- turing jobs. Earlier this Congress, I in-troduced S. 592, the ''Save American Manufacturing Act of 2003,'' that seeks to eliminate the tax incentives for off- shore production. Today, I introduce complementary legislation to provide tax incentives to produce in the United States. The legislation I'm introducing today would provide tax benefits to domestic producers. These tax incentives would become increasingly beneficial as the percentage of manufacturing done in the United States increases. Con-versely, as the percentage of domestic production decreases the incentives would also decrease. This mechanism will provide a strong incentive for manufacturers to main-tain U.S. production and to return run-away production to the United States. Our communities, our industries and our workers are being harmed by the erosion of our manufacturing base. To-day's legislation is one additional way that we can provide assistance to these vital groups. This legislation is the companion to H.R. 1769 introduced earlier this ses-sion in the House by Representatives R ANGEL and C RANE . I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 970 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. SPECTER , Mr. K ENNEDY , Mr. COCHRAN , Mr. B Ms. L , Mr. C LINTON , and Mr. D AYTON ): S. 971. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide in-dividuals with disabilities and older Americans with equal access to com-munity-based attendant services and supports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today Senator S PECTER and I and others in- troduce the Medicaid Community- Based Attendant Services and Supports Act of 2003, MICASSA. This legislation is needed to truly bring people with disabilities into the mainstream of so-ciety and provide equal opportunity for employment and community activities. In order to work or live in their own homes, Americans with disabilities and older Americans need access to com-munity-based services and supports. Unfortunately, under current Federal Medicaid policy, the deck is stacked in favor of living in an institution. The purpose of our bill is to level the play-ing field and give eligible individuals equal access to community-based serv-ices and supports. The Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act accom-plishes four goals. First, the bill amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide a new Medicaid plan benefit that would give individuals who are currently eli-gible for nursing home services or an intermediate care facility for the men-tally retarded equal access to commu-nity-based attendant services and sup-ports. Second, for a limited time, States would have the opportunity to receive additional funds to support community attendant services and supports and for certain administrative activities. Each State currently gets Federal money for their Medicaid program based on a set percentage. This percentage is the Medicaid match rate. This bill would increase that percentage to provide some additional funding to States to help them reform their long term care systems. Third, the bill provides States with financial assistance to support ''real choice systems change initiatives'' that include specific action steps to in-crease the provision of home and com-munity based services. Finally, the bill establishes a dem- onstration project to evaluate service coordination and cost sharing ap-proaches with respect to the provision of services and supports for individuals with disabilities under the age of 65 who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Some States have already recognized the benefits of home and community based services. Every State offers cer-tain services under home and commu-nity based waiver programs, which serve a capped number of individuals with an array of home and community based services to meet their needs and avoid institutionalization. Some States also are now providing the personal care optional benefit through their Medicaid program. However, despite this market progress, home and community based services are unevenly distributed with-in and across states and only reach a small percentage of eligible individ-uals. Those left behind are often needlessly institutionalize because they cannot access community alternatives. A per-son with a disability's civil right to be integrated into his or her community should not depend on his or her ad-dress. In Olmstead v. LC, the Supreme Court recognized that needless institu-tionalization is a form of discrimina-tion under the Americans With Disabil-ities Act. We in Congress have a re-sponsibility to help States meet their obligations under Olmstead. This MICASSA legislation is de- signed to do just that and make the promise of the ADA a reality. It will help rebalance the current Medicaid long term care system, which spends a disproportionate amount on institu-tional services. For example, in 2000, 49.5 billion dollars were spent on insti-tutional care, compared to 18.2 billion on community based care. In the same year, only 3 States spent 50 percent or more of their long term care funds under the Medicaid program on home and community based care. And that means that individuals do not have equal access to community based care throughout this country. An individual should not be asked to move to another state in order to avoid need-less segregation. They also should not be moved away from family and friends because their only choice is an institu-tion. For example, I know a young man in Iowa, Ken Kendall, who is currently living in a nursing home because he cannot access home and community based care. Ken was injured in a seri-ous accident at the age of 17 and sus-tained a spinal chord injury. With the help of community based services cov-ered by his insurance company, Ken could live in his home in Iowa City. Re-maining independent made a tremen-dous difference in his life. However, several years ago, Ken lost his health insurance and after a time, he went onto Medicaid. As a Medicaid recipient, Ken was only given the op-tion to live in a nursing home in Wa-terloo, almost two hours from his friends and family in Iowa City. In the nursing home, Ken has become iso-lated. He is very far from his family and friends and does not have access to transportation. He has not been to a restaurant or a movie since he moved to the nursing home over two years ago. His life has dramatically changed from when he lived in his own apart-ment and hired his own attendants to care for him. MICASSA would give him that choice again\u2014the choice to con-trol his own life and live a full and meaningful life in his home community surrounded by his friends and family. Federal Medicaid policy should re- flect the consensus reached in the ADA that Americans with Disabilities should have equal opportunity to con-tribute to our communities and par-ticipate in our society as full citizens. That means no one has to sacrifice their full participation in society be-cause they need help getting out of the house in the morning or assistance with personal care or some other basic service. I am very pleased that the adminis- tration has included the Real Choice Systems Change grants in its budget this year at $40 million dollars. Sen-ator Specter and I have supported these grants for several years now. I also applaud the administration's com-mitment to The President's New Free-dom Initiative for People with Disabil-ities and believe that this legislation helps promote the goals of that initia-tive. Community based attendant services and supports allow people with disabil-ities to lead independent lives, have jobs, and participate in the commu-nity. Some will become taxpayers, some will get an education, and some will participate in recreational and civic activities. But all will experience a chance to make their own choices and govern their own lives. This bill will open the door to full participation by people with disabil-ities in our workplaces, our economy, and our American Dream, and I urge all my colleagues to support us on this issue.

TITLE I\u2014ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAID PLAN BENEFIT Sec. 101. Coverage of community-based at- tendant services and supports under the medicaid program. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, SENATE S5661 May 1, 2003 Sec. 102. Enhanced FMAP for ongoing ac- tivities of early coverage States that enhance and promote the use of community-based attend-ant services and supports. Sec. 103.

Sec. 202. Demonstration project to enhance coordination of care under the medicare and medicaid pro-grams for non-elderly dual eli-gible individuals. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress makes the fol- lowing findings: (1) Long-term services and supports pro- vided under the medicaid program estab-lished under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) must meet the ability and life choices of individuals with disabilities and older Americans, including the choice to live in one's own home or with one's own family and to become a productive member of the community. (2) Research on the provision of long-term services and supports under the medicaid program (conducted by and on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services) has revealed a significant funding bias to-ward institutional care. Only about 27 per-cent of long term care funds expended under the medicaid program, and only about 9 per-cent of all funds expended under that pro-gram, pay for services and supports in home and community-based settings. (3) In the case of medicaid beneficiaries who need long term care, the only long-term care service currently guaranteed by Federal law in every State is nursing home care. Only 27 States have adopted the benefit op-tion of providing personal care services under the medicaid program. Although every State has chosen to provide certain services under home and community-based waivers, these services are unevenly available within and across States, and reach a small percent-age of eligible individuals. In fiscal year 2000, only 3 States spent 50 percent or more of their medicaid long term care funds under the medicaid program on home and commu-nity-based care. (4) Despite the funding bias and the uneven distribution of home and community-based services, 2 12times more people are served in home and community-based settings than in institutional settings. (5) The goals of the Nation properly in- clude providing families of children with dis-abilities, working-age adults with disabil-ities, and older Americans with\u2014 (A) a meaningful choice of receiving long- term services and supports in the most inte-grated setting appropriate to their needs; (B) the greatest possible control over the services received and, therefore, their own lives and futures; and (C) quality services that maximize inde- pendence in the home and community, in-cluding in the workplace. (b) P URPOSES .\u2014The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To reform the medicaid program estab- lished under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) to provide equal access to community-based attendant serv-ices and supports. (2) To provide financial assistance to States as they reform their long-term care systems to provide comprehensive statewide long-term services and supports, including community-based attendant services and supports that provide consumer choice and direction, in the most integrated setting ap-propriate.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join Senator T OM HARKIN , my colleague and distin- guished ranking member of the Appro-priations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Edu-cation, which I chair, in introducing the ''Medicaid Attendant Care Services and Supports Act of 2003.'' This cre-ative proposal addresses a glaring gap in Federal health coverage, and assists one of our Nation's most vulnerable populations, persons with disabilities. In an effort to improve the delivery of care and the comfort of those with long-term disabilities, this vital legis-lation would allow for reimbursement for community-based attendant care services, in lieu of institutionalization, for eligible individuals who require such services based on functional need, without regard to the individual's age or the nature of the disability. The most recent data available tell us that 58.5 million individuals receive care for disabilities under the Medicaid pro-gram. The number of disabled who are not currently enrolled in the program who would apply for this improved ben- efit is not easily counted, but would likely be substantial given the pref-erence of home and community-based care over institutional care. Under this proposal, States may apply for grants for assistance in im-plementing ''systems change'' initia-tives, in order to eliminate the institu-tional bias in their current policies and for needs assessment activities. Fur-ther, if a state can show that the ag-gregate amounts of Federal expendi-tures on people living in the commu-nity exceeds what would have been spent on the same people had they been in nursing homes, the state can limit the program. No limiting mechanism is mandated under this bill, And finally, States would be required to maintain expenditures for attendant care serv-ices under other Medicaid community- based programs, thereby preventing the states from shifting patients into the new benefit proposed under this bill. Let me speak briefly about why such a change in Medicaid law is so des-perately needed. In 1999 the Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999), that the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, requires States, under some circumstances, to provide community-based treatment to persons with mental disabilities rather than placing them in institutions. This deci-sion and several lower court decisions have pointed to the need for a struc-tured Medicaid attendant-care services benefit in order to meet obligations under the ADA. Disability advocates strongly support this legislation, argu-ing that the lack of Medicaid commu-nity-based services options is discrimi-natory and unhealthful for disabled in-dividuals. Virtually every major dis-ability advocacy group supports this bill, including ADAPT, the Arc, the National Council on Independent Liv-ing, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the National Spinal Cord Injury Association. Senator H ARKIN and I recognize that such a shift in the Medicaid program is a huge undertaking\u2014but feel that it is a vitally important one. We are intro-ducing this legislation today in an at-tempt to move ahead with the consid-eration of crucial disability legislation and to provide a starting point for de-bate. The time has come for concerted action in this arena. I urge the Congressional leadership, including the appropriate committee chairmen, to move forward in consid-ering this legislation, and take the sig-nificant next step forward in achieving the objective of providing individuals with disabilities the freedom to live in their own communities. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, SENATE S5665 May 1, 2003 By Mr. COLEMAN: S. 972. A bill to clarify the authority of States to establish conditions for in-surers to conduct the business of insur-ance within a State based on the provi-sion of information regarding Holo-caust era insurance policies of the in-surer, to establish a Federal cause of action for claims for payment of such insurance policies, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on the Judici-ary. Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill I in-troduce today to clarify the authority of States to establish conditions for in-surers to conduct the business of insur-ance within a State based on the provi-sion of information regarding Holo-caust era insurance policies of the in-surer, to establish a Federal cause of action for claims of payment of such insurance policies, and for other pur-poses be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 972 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Comprehen- sive Holocaust Accountability in Insurance Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Between 1933 and 1945, the Nazi regime and its collaborators conducted systematic, bureaucratic, and State-sponsored persecu-tion and murder of approximately 6,000,000 Jews\u2014the genocidal act known as the Holo-caust. (2) Before and during World War II, mil- lions of European Jews purchased, in good faith, life insurance policies with certain Eu-ropean insurance companies because these policies were a popular form of savings and investment that provided a means of safe-guarding family assets, assisting in retire-ment planning, providing for a dowry, or sav-ing for the education of children. (3) After the Nazis came to power in Ger- many, they systematically confiscated the insurance assets, including the cash value of life insurance policies, of Jews and other des-ignated enemies of the Nazi regime. (4) After the conclusion of World War II, European insurers often rejected insurance claims of Holocaust victims and heirs who lacked required documentation, such as death certificates. (5) During the 50 years since the end of the war, only a small percentage of Holocaust victims and their families have been success-ful in collecting on their policies. (6) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established by State insurance regu-lators in the United States, European insur-ers, and certain nongovernmental organiza-tions to act as a facilitator between insurers and beneficiaries to help expedite payouts on contested insurance policies. (7) To date ICHEIC has received more than 90,000 claims and has only made 2,281 settle-ment offers, which amounts to a resolution rate of less than a 3 percent. (8) These insurance payments should to be expedited to the victims of the most heinous crime of the 20th Century to ensure that they do not become victims a second time. (9) States should be allowed to collect Hol- ocaust-era insurance information from for-eign-based insurance companies that want to do business in such States. (10) Holocaust victims and their families should be able to recover claims on Holo-caust era insurance policies in Federal court when they consider it necessary to seek re-dress through the judicial system. SEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RE- QUIREMENTS FOR CONDUCTING IN-SURANCE BUSINESS. (a) I NGENERAL .\u2014A State may establish re- quirements on insurers as a condition of doing insurance business in that State, to the extent such requirements are consistent with the due process guarantees of the Con-stitution of the United States, as follows: (1) I NFORMATION REQUIREMENTS .\u2014The State may require that an insurer provide to the State the following information regarding Holocaust era insurance policies: (A) Whether the insurer, or any affiliate or predecessor company, sold any such policies.

(C) The identity of the holder and bene- ficiary of each such policy sold or held and the current status of each such policy. (D) The city of origin, domicile, and ad- dress for each policyholder listed. (E) If an insurer has no such policies to re- port because records are no longer in the possession of the insurer or its affiliates, a statement explaining the reasons for the lack of possession of such records. (F) Any other information regarding such policies as the State considers appropriate.

By Mr. NICKLES (for himself and Mr. B REAUX ): S. 973. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a shorter recovery period for the depre-ciation of certain restaurant buildings; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to pro-vide that restaurant buildings are de-preciated over 15 years instead of the VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, SENATE S5666 May 1, 2003 current-law 39 years. My legislation will ensure that the tax laws more ac-curately reflect the true economic life of restaurant buildings. Under current law, real estate prop- erty and any improvements thereto generally must be depreciated over 39 years. However, restaurant buildings undergo excessive wear and tear, and are renovated on average every 6 to 8 years. Requiring restaurant owners to depreciate these renovations over 39 years leads to a mismatch of income and expenses, thereby increasing the tax consequence of making such im-provements. The long depreciation pe-riod simply makes no economic sense. In recent years, Congress has changed the depreciation schedules for competitors of owner-occupied res-taurants. For example, convenience stores are depreciated over 15 years. In addition, leased properties, including leased restaurant space, can take ad-vantage of the temporary bonus depre-ciation incentives contained in the 2001 economic stimulus bill. I believe that our tax laws should be updated to treat restaurant property in a more rational manner. That is why I am introducing legislation to reduce the depreciable life of restaurant prop-erty from 39 years to 15 years. My leg-islation would ensure that all res-taurants, either leased or owner-occu-pied, are treated equally. It would also ensure a level playing field between restaurants and their competitors. By reducing the time period over which all restaurants are depreciated, my bill will more accurately align a res-taurant's income and expenses. Accord-ing to the National Restaurant Asso-ciation, enacting this legislation would generate an additional $3.7 billion in cash flow for restaurants over the next 10 years. This is money that could be reinvested and, in turn, generate new jobs. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact my legislation that will provide more rational tax-treat-ment of restaurants on a permanent basis. by doing so, we will take an in-cremental step toward modernizing the tax code's outdated depreciation rules. By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. S ANTORUM ): S. 974. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to permit certain youth to perform certain work with wood products; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation designed to permit certain youths, those exempt from attending school, between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in sawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. I introduced identical measures in the past three Congresses. Similar legisla-tion introduced by my distinguished colleague, Representative J OSEPH R. PITTS, has already passed in the House in the 105th and 106th Congresses. I am hopeful the Senate will also enact this important issue. As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Ap-propriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported increased funding for the enforcement of the important child safety protections contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, however, that accommodation must be made for youths who are ex-empt from compulsory school-attend-ance laws after the eighth grade. It is extremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be provided with access to jobs and ap-prenticeships in areas that offer em-ployment where they live. The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish commu-nity. In 1998, I toured an Amish saw-mill in Lancaster County, PA, and had the opportunity to meet with some of my Amish constituency. In December 2000, Representative P ITTS and I held a meeting in Gap, PA with over 20 mem-bers of the Amish community to hear their concerns on this issue. On May 3, 2001, I chaired a hearing of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Edu-cation Appropriations Subcommittee to examine these issues. At the hearing the Amish explained that while they once made their living almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand into other occupations as farmland has dis-appeared in many areas due to pressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to rely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish culture expects youth, upon the completion of their education at the age of 14, to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become productive members of society. In many areas, work in sawmills is one of the major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system limits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfor-tunately, these youths are currently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they reach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and lifestyle of the Amish. Under my legislation, youths would not be allowed to operate power ma-chinery, but would be restricted to per-forming activities such as sweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My legislation requires that the youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris and wear protective equipment, all while under strict adult supervision. The Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to in-sure that they are enforced. The Department of Justice has raised serious concerns under the Establish-ment Clause with the House legisla-tion. The House measure conferred ben-efits only to a youth who is a ''member of a religious sect or division thereof whose established teachings do not per-mit formal education beyond the eighth grade.'' By conferring the ''ben-efit'' of working in a sawmill only to the adherents of certain religions, the Department argues that the bill ap- pears to impermissibly favor religion to ''irreligion.'' In drafting my legisla-tion, I attempted to overcome such an objection by conferring permission to work in sawmills to all youths who ''are exempted from compulsory edu-cation laws after the eighth grade.'' In-deed, I think a broader focus is nec-essary to create a sufficient range of vocational opportunities for all youth who are legally out of school and in need of vocational opportunities. I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in Wis-consin v. Yoder supports my bill. In Yoder, the Court held that Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law re-quiring children to attend school until the age of 16 violated the Free Exercise Clause. The Court found that the Wis-consin law imposed a substantial bur-den on the free exercise of religion by the Amish since attending school be-yond the eighth grade ''contravenes the basic religious tenets and practices of the Amish faith.'' I believe a similar argument can be made with respect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their population grows and their sub-sistence through an agricultural way of life decreases, trades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to the continuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills denies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-reliance that was cen-tral to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish do not need the final two years of public education. I offer my legislation with the hope that my colleagues will work with me to provide relief for the Amish commu-nity. By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. S ANTORUM ): S. 975. A bill to revise eligibility re- quirements applicable to essential air service subsidies; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-tation. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation designed to improve the De-partment of Transportation's Essential Air Services program and reinstate Lancaster, PA's eligibility to receive subsidized air service. The Essential Air Services program provides operating subsidies to air-lines, enabling them to serve smaller markets which would otherwise be un-able to attract or retain commercial flights. To be eligible to receive such a subsidy, the community where the air-port is located must be greater than 70 miles from the nearest large or me-dium hub airport. If the airport is lo-cated within 70 miles of a hub airport, the Secretary of Transportation may use his or her discretion to award a subsidy if the most commonly used highway route between both places is greater than 70 miles. It is up to the Department of Transportation to de-termine what route is used in making this mileage determination. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5667 May 1, 2003 Residents and businesses in many rural and smaller communities throughout the United States rely heavily upon air service to provide a necessary link to larger cities. Lan-caster, PA is one such community which had been designated as an Essen-tial Air Services city since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Up until the events of September 11, when the Air-port faced a sharp decline in passenger revenue, Lancaster had never required a subsidy under this program. When Lancaster ultimately found it necessary to seek a subsidy for its three daily flights to Pittsburgh, the Department of Transportation issued an Order to Show Cause on March 8, 2002, stating that Lancaster was not el-igible for an Essential Air Services sub-sidy because it was located within 70 miles of Philadelphia International Airport. The Secretary of Transpor-tation declined to use his discretion to award the subsidy because the Depart-ment identified a driving route of less than 70 miles between Lancaster City and Philadelphia Airport. While there is no question that such a route exists, it is by no means the most commonly used highway route as required by law. The route selected by the Depart- ment of Transportation is one which the average person would never travel, via back roads and seldom used streets. In making its distance determination, the Department used a 66 mile route along Route 30 which would take over three hours to drive. The more com-monly used highway route to the Philadelphia International Airport would be along US 222 to the Pennsyl-vania Turnpike, and then on to I-76, which is over 70 miles. The legislation I am introducing today addresses this issue by desig-nating an area's local metropolitan planning organization, rather than the Department of Transportation, as the organization responsible for deter-mining the most commonly used high-way route. If no such organization ex-ists, the Governor of the State in which the airport is located, or the Governor's designee will make the de-termination. I believe that a local enti-ty, not the Department of Transpor-tation, is better suited to identify the route most travelers would drive. In such cases where that route exceeds 70 miles, the Department should be re-quired to designate a community as el-igible to receive subsidized air service. My legislation will not place too great a burden upon the Essential Air Services program by allowing addi-tional airports to participate. I am ad-vised that there are only eight other communities, including Lancaster, which could become newly eligible to receive subsidized air service as a re-sult of the changes I am proposing. Further, I would note that of the $113 million the program received in Fiscal Year 2002, there was an excess of $10.9 million which remained unspent and which carried over into Fiscal Year 2003. Lancaster Airport's only commercial air carrier, Colgan Air, ceased oper-ations on March 23, 2003, because it could not sustain service without a subsidy. The loss of commercial air service has already had a serious im-pact upon the Lancaster community. I am confident that my legislation will not only reinstate Lancaster's eligi-bility for subsidized air service and allow for the return of commercial air service, but it will also provide for a greater level of fairness for other com-munities which rely so heavily upon this important program. By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. A LLEN ): S. 976. A bill to provide for the issuance of a coin to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement; to the Committee on Bank-ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, along with my colleague, Senator A LLEN , to mint a commemorative coin cele-brating the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, VA in 2007. The lasting significance of James- town stretches far beyond its contribu-tions to the Commonwealth of Vir-ginia. Our Nation is indebted to the 104 original inhabitants of Jamestown who, after completing a harrowing journey across the Atlantic in May of 1607, established the first permanent English settlement in America. The legacies of Jamestown extend from the founding of our representative democracy in which we serve today, to the free market enterprise system on which our economy has flourished. Our unshakeable traditions of common law, agricultural production, manufac-turing, and our free market economy received their humble beginnings from the entrepreneurial spirit of the Jamestown colonists. The colonists established and imple- mented the principles of a representa-tive government to build our American democracy that has withstood the test of time and internal conflict. The Jamestown settlers elected America's first democratic assembly, the Virginia House of Burgesses. The structure and procedures of this first legislative body still resonates in the chamber we serve in today. Our political philosophies and traditions took hold in the untamed landscape of Jamestown Island and re-main the cornerstone of our republic today. Jamestown also marked the begin- ning of the American cultural identity, hosting a combination of diverse cul-tural traditions. The settlement united English, Native American, and African cultures compelling each one to learn valuable lessons from the others. The colonists at Jamestown were the first immigrants to travel to America, mak-ing us a nation of immigrants of which we are so proud today. The colony at Jamestown showcased the triumph of American ingenuity and hard work. Colonists at Jamestown were forced to battle starvation, dis- ease, and the weather of their new home. Life in Jamestown was a strug-gle, and the determination shown by the colonists set the foundation for the revolutionary ideas that guided Ameri-cans through the colonial era. Now 395 years later, the history of our Nation continues to come alive in Jamestown. Since 1994, archaeologists have found the remains of the original Jamestown fort constructed in 1607 and over 350,000 artifacts from the colonial period. These fascinating discoveries have given scholars, visitors, and most importantly, America's young people, a realistic view of 17th century American life. The continuing restoration and discovery of the original Jamestown colony provides all Americans with a window on their roots, and to the foun-dation on which this great Nation was built. The proceeds from this commemora- tive coin will help both the National Park Service and the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiq-uities continue their research at the Jamestown site, complete necessary construction projects at the James-town National Park, and provide funds for events surrounding the 400th anni-versary celebration. In addition, this legislation would help ensure that the Jamestown Rediscovery project will have adequate funds to continue edu-cating the American public on our co-lonial history. In the 106th Congress, the House and Senate created the Jamestown 400th Commemoration Commission to ensure that the anni-versary in 2007 is a truly national event. This legislation that I introduce today continues along this same line. Recent events have brought about a renewed reverence and interest in our nation's history among the American people. This legislation would help bring national attention to this impor-tant anniversary and would serve as a fitting tribute to America's first per-manent settlers. This event celebrates America's colonial history and gives every American a chance to help sup-port America's Hometown, Jamestown, VA. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting our Nation's and Virginia's colonial traditions with this important legislation.

By Mr. FITZGERALD (for him- self, Mr. K ENNEDY , and Ms. SNOWE ): S. 977. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Re-tirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require that group and individual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide coverage from treatment of a minor child's congenital or developmental deformity or disorder due to trauma, infection, tumor, or dis-ease; to the Committee on Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children's Deformities Act of 2003, which will re-quire insurance companies to cover corrective surgeries for children with congenital or developmental deformi-ties. According to the March of Dimes, 3.8 percent of babies born annually\u2014about 150,000 babies per year suffer from birth defects. Approximately 50,000 of these babies require reconstructive surgery. Examples of these deformities include cleft lip, cleft palate, skin lesions, vas-cular anomalies, malformations of the ear, hand, or foot, and other more pro-found craniofacial deformities. Plastic surgeons are able to correct many of these problems, and doing so is critical to both the physical and mental health and development of the child. On average, children with con-genital deformities or developmental anomalies will need three to five sur-gical procedures before normalcy is achieved. An increasing number of in-surance companies are denying access VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5669 May 1, 2003 to care by labeling the surgical proce- dures cosmetic or nonfunctional in na-ture. In some cases, carriers may pro-vide coverage for initial procedures, but resist covering later, necessary procedures, claiming that they are cos-metic and not medically necessary. Although insurance companies ulti- mately have decided to cover some of these procedures, families have had to battle through the appeals process of insurance companies for extended peri-ods of time, thereby forcing children to wait unnecessarily for needed sur-geries. The treatment plan for children with congenital defects usually re-quires staged surgical care in accord-ance with the child's growth pattern. Onerous and time-consuming appeals procedures can jeopardize the physical and psychological health of children with deformities. The American Medical Association defines cosmetic surgery as being per-formed to reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve the pa-tient's appearance and self-esteem. In contrast, reconstructive surgery is de-fined as being performed on abnormal structures of the body, caused by con-genital defects, developmental abnor-malities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease. According to the American So-ciety of Plastic Surgeons, reconstruc-tive surgery is performed in order to improve function and approximate a normal appearance. The Treatment of Children's Deform- ities Act of 2003 will prohibit insurers from denying coverage for reconstruc-tive surgery for children. This bill identifies the difference between cos-metic and reconstructive surgery and incorporates the American Medical As-sociation's definition of reconstructive surgery. The measure requires group and individual health insurers and group health plans to provide coverage for treatment of a minor child's con-genital or developmental deformity, disease, or injury. The legislation de-fines ''treatment'' to include recon-structive surgical procedures. These are procedures that are performed on abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tu-mors, or disease. The Treatment of Children's Deform- ities Act of 2003 has been endorsed by the American Society of Plastic Sur-geons, the American Medical Associa-tion, the American Academy of Pediat-rics, and several other medical organi-zations. Fifteen States have already enacted legislation that to different de-grees require insurance companies to cover treatment of craniofacial and congenital anomalies. While governor of Texas, George W. Bush signed into law legislation that is similar to the legislation I introduce today. I would like to thank Senator K EN- NEDY and Senator S NOWE for cospon- soring this important legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill so that children who suffer from congenital deformities or developmental anomalies do not have to wait unnecessarily for needed treatment. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the R ECORD following the conclusion of my remarks. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 977 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator F ITIZGERALD and Senator S NOWE in introducing the Treatment of Children's Deformities Act. The purpose of our bill is to see that health insurers and health plans cover the treatment of children's con-genital and developmental deformities and disorders. About 7 percent of all children are born with significant problems, includ-ing cleft lips or cleft palates, serious skin lesions such as port wine stains, malformations of the ear, or facial de-formities. Plastic surgery can correct many of these conditions, but too often parents face significant barriers in ob-taining care for their children. More than half of all plastic surgeons report that these patients are denied insur-ance coverage or had the struggle to receive it. Too often, insurers deny coverage by calling the treatment cos-metic or not medically necessary. The medical, developmental, and psy- chological problems associated with denied or delayed treatment of these deformities are enormous. Treatment often requires a series of treatments as the child grow. No child should be forced to live with an untreated cleft lip or a facial deformity while parents appeal an insurer's unfair denial. De-layed or denied treatment puts a child's physical and mental health at risk. Our bill requires health insurers and health plans to provide coverage to treat a child's congenial or develop-mental deformity, or disorders caused by disease, trauma, infection, or tumor. It is supported by many med-ical organizations, including the Amer-ican Academy of Pediatrics, the Amer-ican Medical Association, and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. I urge the Senate to support this im- portant bill, and give children and fam-ilies the support they deserve. By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mrs. BOXER , Ms. C ANTWELL , CRAPO , Mrs. M URRAY , Mrs. F EINSTEIN , Mr. R EID, Mr. A LLARD , Mr. BURNS , Mr. W ARNER , Mr. EN- NETT , Mr. S MITH, Ms. S TABE - NOW, and Mr. C OLEMAN ): S. 979. A bill to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to require enhanced disclosures of employee stock options, to require a study on the eco-nomic impact of broad-based employee stock options plans, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend, the junior Senator from California, to in-troduce legislation on an issue that could have a significant impact on the economy. The financial scandals which oc- curred last year at Enron, WorldCom, and other corporations rocked our fi-nancial markets and greatly dimin-ished investor confidence in this coun-try. In response to abuses by a few high-profile corporate executives, Con-gress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Cor-porate Responsibility Act, which closed loopholes that led to those scandals and sought to restore investor con-fidence in our markets. However, in the wake of those scan- dals, I believe that stock options have been incorrectly equated with abuse. Stock option plans reflect America's best business values\u2014the willingness to take risks, the vision to develop new entrepreneurial companies and tech-nologies, and a way to broaden owner-ship and participation among all em-ployees. Last week, the Financial Accounting Standards Board made a tentative deci- sion to mandate the expensing of stock options. This would effectively kill broad-based stock option plans which are used by many high-growth, entre-preneurial companies. Such board- based plans distribute options to rank- and-file employees, not just to senior executives. This is a very different ap-proach than that used by companies as-sociated with the scandals of last year. This issue was brought to my atten- tion by a couple hundred chief execu-tive officers and leaders in the high- tech world. This is their No. 1 issue be-cause, when they are properly struc-tured, stock options are valuable in-centives for productivity and growth. They also help startup companies re-cruit and retain workers\u2014an essential tool in a struggling economy. I think it is absolutely ludicrous that we would risk destroying growth when there isn't even a workable model available to accurately expense stock options. Not only is the plan wrong, it is not doable. The legislation that we are intro- ducing today would provide share-holders with accurate information VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan SENATE S5671 May 1, 2003 about a company's use of stock op- tions, while also preserving this crit-ical tool for all company employees. It would enhance the availability of fi-nancial reporting by requiring the SEC to take very specific steps to give shareholders and investors the impor-tant financial information they need. Additionally, this bill places a 3-year moratorium on the mandatory expens-ing of stock options. This will allow the Department of Commerce to take a very detailed look at the negative im-pact that mandating expensing of stock options could have on our econ-omy. It is important that we do not react to the corporate scandals of last year by stifling this vital tool for economic growth. It would be bad for the econ-omy, bad for workers in this country, and bad for potential investors. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like to thank the Sen-ator from California, Mrs. B OXER , for her hard work on this issue. I would also like to recognize and thank my colleagues who have signed on in sup-port of this bill, Senators G EORGE ALLEN , M IKE CRAPO , L ARRY P BURNS , G ORDON SMITH, R OBERT BENNETT and J OHN WARNER . I yield the floor. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD in the appropriate place. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 979 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Broad-Based Stock Option Plan Transparency Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. Congress finds that\u2014 (1) innovation and entrepreneurship, par- ticularly in the high technology industry, helped propel the economic growth of the 1990s, and will continue to be the essential building blocks of economic growth in the 21st century; (2) broad-based employee stock option plans enable entrepreneurs and corporations to attract quality workers, to incentivize worker innovation, and to stimulate produc-tivity, which in turn increase shareholder value; (3) broad-based employee stock options plans that expand corporate ownership to rank-and-file employees spur capital forma-tion, benefit workers, and improve corporate performance to the benefit of investors and the economy; (4) concerns raised about the impact of em- ployee stock option plans on shareholder value raise legitimate issues relevant to the current level of disclosure and transparency of those plans to current and potential inves-tors; and (5) investors deserve to have accurate, reli- able, and meaningful information about the existence of outstanding employee stock op-tions and their impact on the share value of a going concern.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation intro-duced by Senators B OXER and E NSIGN to improve disclosure of stock option grants in company financial state-ments while, at the same time, delay-ing the adoption of new accounting standards that could fundamentally distort reported earnings. I believe that at this time of contin- ued economic weakness it is critical that we take action to both increase transparency and improve corporate governance, without which we cannot hope to restore investor confidence. The Broad-Based Stock Option Plan Transparency Act would increase the transparency of stock option grants at all levels of public companies, particu-larly executive compensation, and would provide investors with addi-tional tools to make investment deci-sions. Increased disclosure provisions in the bill include: expanded disclosure of the dilutive effect of employee stock op-tions on reported earnings per share; a ''plain English'' discussion of share value dilution, which would allow indi-vidual investors to understand the im-pact of options grants on their invest-ment; more prominent placement and increased comparability of stock op-tion-related footnotes; and a summary of stock options granted to the 5 most highly compensated executives of the company. These provisions help us fulfill the goal of greater transparency in our markets and improved corporate gov-ernance. With passage of the Sarbanes- Oxley accounting reform legislation last summer, we took a major step in that direction, and I believe this bill adds to those achievements. If individual investors do not feel comfortable with the information re-ported by public companies or the ad-vice given by banks and other major players in our financial markets, they will not feel comfortable making new investments and our markets are un-likely to recover. In addition to requiring new disclo- sure of the impact of employee stock options on a company's earnings per share, this bill also requires the SEC to VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5672 May 1, 2003 monitor the effectiveness of increased disclosure requirements for 3 years. The bill also specifies that the SEC must examine the impact of broad- based stock option plans on worker productivity and the performance of the firms which use such plans. As anyone who has spent time in Sil- icon Valley can attest, the phenomenal achievements of high tech companies in California and across the country would not have been possible without employee stock options. Stock options give employees a stake in the success of their company and create a degree of employee loyalty, productivity, and achievement that simply would not be possible if cash were the only form of compensation available. Moreover, it has allowed start-ups that are cash-poor to hire and retain talent that might otherwise have been available only to established firms. A mandatory expensing standard will sharply limit the use of stock options, particularly for rank and file workers, and will slow our economic recovery. Without a strong high tech sector de- veloping new technologies and bringing new products to market, we cannot hope to return to the robust economic growth of the last decade. Moreover, mandatory expensing could actually decrease transparency for the average investor. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has indicated it will implement such a rule within the next year, but has not come up with an adequate means of valuing those options for expensing purposes. The binomial pricing model cur- rently used to value short-term deriva-tives, also known as Black/Scholes, does not work with the types of long- term, restricted options packages granted to employees. Without an ac-curate valuation methodology, we risk giving investors a much less accurate picture of a company's financial health than they would have otherwise. I have spoken with the chief execu- tive officers of a number of companies in my state, including John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems, Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel, and Richard Kovacevich, CEO of Wells Fargo. Each one of those corporate leaders has told me that a mandatory expensing standard would lead them to sharply limit the number of options he grants to his employees. They also told me that it would lead them cut back on hiring and possibly send more jobs abroad. I found those comments disturbing, and they should give us pause and compel us to act pru-dently. That is why we should support further study of the accounting treat-ment of stock options, during which period no new accounting rules per-taining tot stock options could be adopted. I would like to describe briefly the impact of employee stock options on the value of an investor's holdings in the company that granted the option. In order for employee stock options not to be counted as an expense, they must be set at or above the average closing price of the company's stock during a fixed period. They are also generally restricted, and usually can-not be exercised for several years after their grant date. Should the value of the underlying shares fall during the life of the option, the options are underwater and are ef-fectively worthless. Should the share price increase, however, the exercise of those options creates no cash charge to the company whatsoever. Instead, it increases the total number of shares outstanding. To take one concrete example, Cisco Systems recently reported approxi-mately 7.3 billion shares outstanding in their latest annual report. They also reported approximately 600 million op-tions to purchase shares that were ''in the money,'' or had an exercise price below the current share price. If all those options were exercised, and no shares were repurchased, each share would be entitled to approxi-mately 8 percent less in dividends than before. In fact, the actual dilution would likely be somewhat less. If options are expensed, however, the impact on Cisco's bottom line would be dramatic, despite the fact that their only tangible impact is on the number of shares outstanding. Had Cisco ex-pensed their stock options for the 2001 fiscal year, their reported profits would have been 171 percent lower. A roughly $1 billion profit would instead have been a nearly $1 billion loss. Yet the actual value of those options now is almost nil. They were all grant-ed at exercise prices well above the current share price, and may never be exercised. Options are not a cash expense and represent no tangible exchange of as-sets. They are a form of incentive pay that may ultimately be worthless. In short, they are nothing like a cash sal-ary. The legislation introduced by Sen- ators B OXER and E NSIGN recognizes the need for further study, but does not place an indefinite moratorium on FASB action. It is a balanced bill that will help the average investor and ulti-mately strengthen our financial mar-kets. I urge my colleagues to support the Broad-Based Stock Option Trans-parency Act.

A bill to limit the period for which the Federal Government may procure property or services using non-competitive procedures during emer-gency and urgent situations; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation is to ensure that American taxpayers and American businesses are protected when the Fed-eral Government procures property or services. The purpose of this legislation is to close certain loopholes that allow Fed-eral agencies to enter into contracts through a process that does not ensure full and open competition. Current law provides several exceptions that allow Federal agencies to limit competition or provide a sole-source contract. My legislation does not eliminate any of these exceptions, but it does place a 90- day limitation on the broadest excep-tions to ensure that a full and fair bid-ding process takes place as soon as pos-sible. This bill does not extend the 90-day limitation on sole-source or limited- source contracts when full and open competition is not practicable. For ex-ample, the legislation will continue to allow sole-source or limited-source contracts when there is a threat to the national security of the United States or when the property or service is only available from one party. But we must take a common-sense approach to shield taxpayers from waste and abuse. This bill does just that. I have heard from people through-out my state who believe that the ad-ministration is abusing its authority in providing sole-source and limited- source contacts in Iraq. One example is the sole-source con- tract worth up to $7 billion that was awarded earlier this year to Kellogg, Brown and Root\u2014a subsidiary of Halli-burton\u2014to extinguish oil fires in Iraq. The exception under Federal law used to provide KBR with the sole-source contract was that a full and open bid process would cause unacceptable delays. While it is understandable that oil fires cannot be allowed to burn while an open bid process takes place, it is not acceptable that the term of this contract was 2 years. Recently, the administration an- nounced that this contract would be terminated and an open bid process take place. While I applaud this move, I fear it would not have happened with-out the outcry of the American people. My legislation will ensure that certain sole-source contracts will be limited to 90 days. During the 90-day period, a full and open competition would take place so that the long-term contract is awarded to the qualified low-bidder. It is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that these contracts are award-ed in a competitive manner whenever possible. This legislation is a step in the right direction. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 981 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE This Act may be cited as the ''Business and Taxpayer Procurement Protection Act.'' SECTION 2. LIMITATION ON CONTRACTS AWARD- ED ON A NONCOMPETITIVE BASIS. (a) I NGENERAL .\u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, includ-ing the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, section 2304 of title 10, United States Code, and the Federal Acquisi-tion Regulation\u2014 (1) any procurement for property or serv- ices that is not subject to competitive proce-dures under a provision of law or regulation set forth in subsection (b) may not exceed 90 days; and (2) if any property or services procured under the limitations of paragraph (1) are re-quired beyond the 90 days referred to in para-graph (1), such property or services shall\u2014 (A) during the 90-day period, be the subject of a full and open competition in accordance with the appropriate law or regulation; and (B) shall not be procured using procedures other than competitive procedures under a provision of law or regulation set forth in subsection (b). VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan S5674 May 1, 2003 (b) A PPLICABILITY .\u2014The provisions of law and regulations referred to in subsection (a) are the following: (1) Subsections (c)(2), (c)(3)(A), (c)(7), and (d)(1)(B)(ii) of section 303 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253). (2) Subsections (c)(2), (c)(3)(A), (c)(7), and (d)(1)(B)(ii) of section 2304 of title 10, United States Code. (3) Any other provision of law or regula- tion that provides for the use of noncompeti-tive procedures for the same or a similar rea-son as those referred to in clauses (1) and (2). SECTION 3. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act shall apply with respect to con- tracts entered into after the date of the en-actment of this Act. By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. S ANTORUM ): S. 982. A bill to halt Syrian support for terrorism, end its occupation of Lebanon, stop its development of weap-ons of mass destruction, cease its ille-gal importation of Iraqi oil, and hold Syria accountable for its role in the Middle East, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Syria Account-ability Act, a bill that aims to end Syr-ian support for terrorism by diplomatic and economic means. It is well known that terrorist orga- nizations like Hizballah, Hamas, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory and in areas of Lebanon occu-pied by the Syrian armed forces. We must address this issue not with saber rattling but by confronting the Gov-ernment of Syria in a diplomatic way that shows the seriousness of our con-cerns. The Syria Accountability Act works to achieve our foreign policy goals by expanding economic and diplomatic sanctions against Syria until the Presi-dent certifies that Syria has ended its support of terrorism, withdrawn from Lebanon, ceased its chemical and bio-logical weapons program, and no longer illegally imports Iraqi oil. The bill pro-vides flexibility to the President by al-lowing him to choose from a variety of sanctions, as well as the authority to waive sanctions if it is in the interest of United States national security. I hope this legislation will receive the support of the Administration and Congress because it provides the Presi-dent with the flexibility to target spe-cific sanctions against Syria, but in no way threatens or condones the use of military force against Syria. By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. REID, Mr. H ATCH , Ms. M IKULSKI , Ms. C LINTON , Mr. F OHNSON EIN- GOLD , Mrs. F EINSTEIN , Mr. REED, and Mr. C ORZINE ): S. 983. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Di-rector of the National Institute of En- vironmental Health Sciences to make grants for the development and oper-ation of research centers regarding en-vironmental factors that may be re-lated to the etiology of breast cancer; to the Committee on Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator H ARRY REIDand others in introducing the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2003. This bill would establish research centers that would be the first in the Nation to specifi-cally study the environmental factors that may be related to the develop-ment of breast cancer. The lack of agreement within the scientific com-munity and among breast cancer advo-cates on this question highlights the need for further study. It is generally believed that the envi- ronment plays some role in the devel-opment of breast cancer, but the extent of that role is not understood. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Re-search Act of 2003 will enable us to con-duct more conclusive and comprehen-sive research to determine the impact of the environment on breast cancer. Before we can find the answers, we must determine the right questions we should be asking. While more research is being con- ducted into the relationship between breast cancer and the environment, there are still several issues that must be resolved to make this research more effective. They are as follows: There is no known cause of breast cancer. There is little agreement in the scientific community on how the envi-ronment affects breast cancer. While studies have been conducted on the links between environmental factors like pesticides, diet, and electro-magnetic fields, no consensus has been reached. There are other factors that have not yet been studied that could provide valuable information. While there is much speculation, it is clear that the relationship between environ-mental exposures and breast cancer is poorly understood. There are challenges in conducting environmental research. Identifying linkages is difficult. Laboratory ex-periments and cluster analyses, such as those in Long Island, New York, cannot reveal whether an environmental expo-sure increases a woman's risk of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies must be designed carefully, because environ-mental exposures are difficult to meas-ure. Coordination between the National Institutes of Health, NIH, the National Cancer Institute, NCI, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, needs to occur. NCI and NIEHS are the two institutes in the NIH that fund most of the research related to breast cancer and the envi-ronment; however, comprehensive in-formation is not currently available. This legislation would establish eight Centers of Excellence to study these potential links. These ''Breast Cancer Environmental Research Centers'' would provide for multi-disciplinary research among basic, clinical, epide-miological and behavioral scientists in-terested in establishing outstanding, state-of-the-art research programs ad-dressing potential links between the environment and breast cancer. The NIEHS would award grants based on a competitive peer-review process. This legislation would require each Center to collaborate with community organi-zations in the area, including those that represent women with breast can-cer. The bill would authorize $30 mil-lion for the next five years for these grants. ''Genetics loads the gun, the environ- ment pulls the trigger,'' as Ken Olden, the Director of NIEHS, frequently says. Many scientists believe that certain groups of women have genetic vari-ations that may make them more sus-ceptible to adverse environmental ex-posures. We need to step back and gather evidence before we come to con-clusions\u2014that is the purpose of this bill. People are hungry for information, and there is a lot of inconclusive data out there, some of which has no sci-entific merit whatsoever. We have the opportunity through this legislation to gather legitimate and comprehensive data from premier research institu-tions across the nation. According to the American Cancer Society, each year 800 women in Rhode Island are diagnosed with breast can-cer, and 200 women in my state will die of this terrible disease this year. We owe it to these women who are diag-nosed with this life-threatening disease to provide them with answers for the first time. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and cosponsoring this im-portant legislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 983 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Breast Can- cer and Environmental Research Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women. (2) More women in the United States are living with breast cancer than any other cancer (excluding skin cancer). Approxi-mately 3,000,000 women in the United States are living with breast cancer, 2,000,000 of which have been diagnosed and an estimated 1,000,000 who do not yet know that they have the disease. (3) Breast cancer is the most commonly di- agnosed cancer among women in the United States and worldwide (excluding skin can-cer). In 2003, it is estimated that 258,600 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United States, 211,300 VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5675 May 1, 2003 cases of which will involve invasive breast cancer and 47,300 cases of which will involve ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Approximately 40,000 women in the United States die from the disease each year. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States between the ages of 20 and 59, and the leading cause of cancer death for women worldwide. (5) A woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. This risk was 1 in 11 in 1975. In 2001, a new case of breast cancer will be diagnosed every 2 minutes and a woman will die from breast cancer every 13 minutes. (6) All women are at risk for breast cancer. About 90 percent of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease. (7) The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, a public private partnership, has rec-ognized the importance of expanding the scope and breadth of biomedical, epidemio-logical, and behavioral research activities related to the etiology of breast cancer and the role of the environment. (8) To date, there has been only a limited research investment to expand the scope or coordinate efforts across disciplines or work with the community to study the role of the environment in the development of breast cancer. (9) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous potential for avenues of preven-tion, the Federal investment in the role of the environment and the development of breast cancer should be expanded. (10) In order to understand the effect of chemicals and radiation on the development of cancer, multi-generational, prospective studies are probably required. SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator C HAFEE in re- introducing the Breast Cancer and En-vironmental Research Act. Senator C HAFEE and I serve together on the En- vironment and Public Works Com-mittee where we have had the oppor-tunity to take a closer look at dif-ferent environment-related health con-cerns. After a number of children in the small town of Fallon, NV, were di-agnosed with leukemia, the committee traveled to Nevada to investigate what environmental factors may have con-tributed to the cancer cluster. The Fallon hearing reminded me how little we know about what causes can-cer and what, if any, connection exists between the environment and cancer. Three decades have passed since Presi-dent Nixon declared the ''War on Can-cer'' and scientists are still struggling with these and other crucial unan-swered questions about cancer. This is particularly true in the case of breast cancer. We still don't know what causes breast cancer. We don't know if the environment plays a role in the de-velopment of breast cancer, and if it does, we don't know how significant that role is. In our search for answers about breast cancer, we need to make sure we are asking the right questions. To date, there has been only a lim- ited research investment to study the role of the environment in the develop-ment of breast cancer. More research needs to be done to determine the im-pact of the environment on breast can-cer. The Breast Cancer and Environ-mental Research Act would give sci-entists the tools they need to pursue a better understanding about what links between the environment and breast cancer may exist. Specifically, our bill would authorize $30 million to the Na-tional Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to establish eight Cen-ters of Excellence that would focus on breast cancer and the environment. In the year 2003 alone, it is estimated that 258,600 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United States. In Nevada, an estimated 1400 new cases will be diagnosed in 2003, and tragically, approximately 300 women in Nevada will die of breast cancer this year. If we miss promising research opportunities because of Con-gress' failure to act, millions of women and their families will face critical un-answered questions about breast can-cer. During the 107th Congress, almost half of the Senate cosponsored this im-portant legislation. There is no reason we should not be able to work together during this session to pass this bill so we can find answers for the millions of Americans affected by breast cancer. I urge my colleagues to join in our quest for answers about this deadly disease and to support the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act. By Mr. BAUCUS: S. 984. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate opportuni-ties to enhance domestic oil and gas VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5676 May 1, 2003 production through the exchange of nonproducing Federal oil and gas leases located in the Lewis and Clark National Forest, in the Flathead Na-tional Forest, and on Bureau of Land Management land in the State of Mon-tana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-sources. Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am in- troducing a bill today that I hope will take us one step closer to achieving permanent protections for Montana's magnificent Rocky Mountain Front. The Front, as we call it back home, is part of one of the largest and most intact wild places left in the lower 48. To the North, the Front includes a 200 square mile area known as the Badger- Two Medicine in the Lewis and Clark National Forest. This area sits just south-east of Glacier National Park, one of our greatest national treasures. The Badger-Two Medicine area is sa-cred ground to the Blackfeet Tribe. In January of 2002, portions of the Badger- Two, known as the Badger-Two Medi-cine Blackfoot Traditional Cultural District, were declared eligible for list-ing in the National Register of Historic Places. South of the Badger-Two, the Front includes a 400 square mile strip of na-tional forest land and about 20 square miles of BLM lands, including three BLM Outstanding Natural Areas. Not only does the Front still retain almost all its native species, but it also harbors the country's largest bighorn sheep herd and second largest elk herd. The Rocky Mountain Front supports one of the largest populations of griz-zly bears south of Canada and is the only place in the lower 48 states where grizzly bears still roam from the moun-tains to their historic range on the plains. Because of this exceptional habitat, the Front offers world renowned hunt-ing, fishing and recreational opportuni-ties. Sportsmen, local land owners, hikers, local communities and many other Montanans have worked for dec-ades to protect and preserve the Front for future generations. In short, a majority of Montanans feel very strongly that oil and gas de-velopment, and Montana's Rocky Mountain Front, just don't mix. The habitat is too rich, the landscape too important, to subject it to the roads, drills, pipelines, industrial equipment, chemicals, noise and human activity that come with oil and gas develop-ment. Building upon a significant public and private conservation investment and following an extensive public com-ment process, the Lewis and Clark Na-tional Forest decided in 1997 to with-draw for 15 years 356,000 acres in the Front from any new oil and gas leas-ing. This was a significant first step in protecting the Front from development that I wholeheartedly supported. However, in many parts of the Rocky Mountain Front, oil and gas leases exist that pre-date the 1997 decision or are located in the Badger-Two Medi- cine area, where the lease suspension could be lifted soon. These leaseholders have invested time and resources in ac-quiring their leases. Several lease-holders have applied to the federal gov-ernment for permits to drill. These leases are the subject of my proposed bill. History has shown that energy explo- ration and development in the Front is likely to result in expensive and time- consuming environmental studies and litigation. This process rarely ends with a solution that is satisfactory to the oil and gas lessee. For example, in the late 1980's both Chevron and Fina applied for permits to drill in the Badg-er Two Medicine portion of the Front. After millions of dollars spent on studies and years of public debate, Chevron abandoned or assigned all of its lease rights, and Fina sold its lease rights back to the original owner. Therefore, I think we should be fair to those leaseholders. We want them to continue to provide for our domestic oil and gas needs, but they are going to have a long, difficult and expensive road if they wish to develop oil and gas in the Rocky Mountain Front. My legislation would direct the Inte- rior Department to evaluate non-pro-ducing leases in the Rocky Mountain Front and look at opportunities to can-cel those leases, in exchange for allow-ing leaseholders to explore for oil and gas somewhere else, namely in the Gulf of Mexico or in the State of Montana. In conducting this evaluation, the Sec-retary would have to consult with leaseholders, with the State of Mon-tana, the public and other interested parties. When Interior concludes this study in two years, the bill calls for the agency to make recommendations to Congress and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the advisability of pur-suing lease exchanges in the Front and any changes in law and regulation needed to enable the Secretary to un-dertake such an exchange. Finally, in order to allow the Sec- retary to conduct this study, my bill would continue the current lease sus-pension in the Badger-Two Medicine Area for three more years. This lease suspension would only apply to the Badger-Two Medicine Area, not the en-tire Front. That's it, that's all my bill does. It doesn't predetermine any outcome, it doesn't impact any existing explo-ration activities or environmental processes. It just creates a process through which the federal government, the people of Montana and leaseholders can finally have a real, open and hon-est discussion about the fate of the Rocky Mountain Front. I would also point out that the Ad- ministration recently completed an in-ventory of the onshore oil and gas re-serves on federal lands in five basins in the Interior West, including the Rocky Mountain Front, also known as the Montana Thrust Belt. The Administra-tion's study found that this area con- tains the smallest volumes of oil and gas resources of all five of the Western inventory areas. For example, the mean estimate of all natural gas re-serves in the Uinta/Pinceance Basin in Colorado and Utah is 22 trillion cubic feet. In the Front, the mean estimate is only 8.6 trillion cubic feet. Additionally, the study concluded that in reality, the vast majority of Federal lands in the interior West are available for leasing with few if any re-strictions. Although a large percentage of federal lands in the Front are cur-rently unavailable for leasing, many of those lands are unavailable because they lie under Glacier National Park, Indian lands, and already established wilderness areas, which comprise much of the Federal land in the Front. So, not only is the Front relatively poor in terms of oil and gas reserves, many of those reserves\u2014by Congressional man-date, executive order or treaty\u2014will never be available for leasing. We should look for ways to fairly compensate leaseholders for invest-ments they've made in their leases if they decide to leave the Front rather than waste years and millions fighting to explore for uncertain\u2014and small\u2014 oil and gas reserves. A lot of Mon-tanans just don't want to see the Front developed, and they will fight to pro-tect it. Including me. So, developers can wait years, or dec- ades, or most likely never, for oil and gas to flow from the Front. Or we can look at ways to encourage domestic production much sooner, in much more cost effective, appropriate and efficient ways somewhere else. That is what I hope this legislation will accomplish Mr. President, and I hope my colleagues in the Senate will support it.

A bill to amend the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act of 1990 to adjust the percentage differen-tials payable to Federal law enforce-ment officers in certain high-cost areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that is important to America's Federal law en-forcement officers and the people they protect across the country. I am joined today by Senator C OLLINS , Senator CLINTON , Senator C ORZINE , , Senator Senator L EAHY , Senator SNOWE , Senator R EED, Senator B Senator F EINSTEIN , Senator S CHUMER , VerDate Mar 15 2010 S5677 May 1, 2003 Senator L IEBERMAN , Senator W , Senator SARBANES , and Senator J EFFORDS . The legislation that we are offering will amend the Federal Law Enforce-ment Pay Reform Act of 1990 to ensure that the government treats Federal law enforcement officers fairly. This bill will partially increase the locality pay adjustments paid to Federal agents in certain high cost areas. These areas have pay disparities so high they are negatively affecting our Federal law enforcement officers, since locality pay adjustments have either not been in-creased since 1990, or have been in-creased negligibly. All over America, Federal law en- forcement personnel are enduring tre-mendous stress associated with our Na-tion's effort to protect citizens from the threat of terrorism. Unfortunately, that stress has been compounded by ongoing pressing concerns among many such personnel about their pay. I have heard from officers who have described long commutes, high personal debts, and in some cases, almost all-con-suming concerns about financial inse-curity. Many of these problems occur when agents or officers are transferred from low-cost parts of the country to high-cost areas. I have been told that some Federal officers are forced to sep-arate from their families and rent rooms in the cities to which they have been transferred because they cannot afford to rent or buy homes large enough for a family. Unfortunately, the raise in the cost of living in many cities across America has outstripped our Federal pay sys-tem. I recognize that this is a problem for other Federal employees and I am prepared to work with my colleagues to address this larger issue. The cost of living has also had a very negative im-pact on non-federal employees as well and I have consistently worked to en-sure that all working Americans enjoy a truly livable wage. The legislation that we are introducing today in no way suggests that the needs of other workers should be ignored, but it ac-knowledges that as we continue to ask Federal law enforcement personnel to put in long hours and remain on heightened alert, we must provide them with a salary sufficient to allow them to focus on their vital work with-out nagging worries about how to pro-vide their families with the essentials of food, clothing, and shelter. The Federal Law Enforcement Offi- cers Association, representing more than 19,000 Federal agents, along with the Fraternal Order of Police, National Association of Police Organizations, National Troopers Coalition, National Organization of Black Law Enforce-ment Executives, International Broth-erhood of Police, and the Police Execu-tive Research Forum have endorsed this legislative proposal. In these difficult times, we must re- main committed to recruiting, hiring, and retaining law enforcement officers of the highest caliber. However, we must also recognize that the Federal government is in competition with State and Local police departments that often pay more and provide better standards of living. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in this effort. I hope that we can quick-ly pass this important legislation be-cause it will improve the lives of the men and women who are dedicated to protecting us. In so doing, it will im-prove the Nation's domestic security. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 985 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

R ES. 130 Whereas Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity to honor and cele-brate the commitment of individuals who meet the needs of the Nation through work at all levels of government; Whereas over 20,000,000 men and women work in government service in every city, county, and State across America and in hundreds of cities abroad; Whereas Federal, State, and local officials perform essential services the Nation relies upon every day; Whereas the United States of America is a great and prosperous Nation, and public service employees have contributed signifi-cantly to that greatness and prosperity; Whereas the Nation benefits daily from the knowledge and skills of these highly trained individuals; Whereas public servants\u2014 (1) help the Nation recover from natural disasters and terrorist attacks; (2) fight crime and fire; (3) deliver the mail; (4) teach and work in the schools; (5) deliver social security and medicare benefits; (6) fight disease and promote better health; (7) protect the environment and national parks; (8) defend and secure critical infrastruc- ture; (9) improve and secure transportation and the quality and safety of water and food; (10) build and maintain roads and bridges; (11) provide vital strategic and support functions to our military; (12) keep the Nation's economy stable; (13) defend our freedom; and (14) advance United States interests around the world; Whereas public servants at the Federal, State, and local level are the first line of de-fense in maintaining homeland security; Whereas public servants at every level of government are hard-working men and women, committed to doing a good job re-gardless of the circumstances; Whereas Federal, State, and local govern- ment employees have risen to the occasion and demonstrated professionalism, dedica-tion, and courage while fighting the war against terrorism; Whereas the men and women serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, as well as those Federal employees who provide sup-port to their efforts, contribute greatly to the security of the Nation and the world; Whereas May 5 through 11, 2003, has been designated Public Service Recognition Week to honor America's Federal, State, and local government employees; and Whereas Public Service Recognition Week will be celebrated through job fairs, student activities, and agency exhibits: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) commends government employees for their outstanding contributions to this great Nation; (2) salutes their unyielding dedication and spirit for public service; (3) honors those public servants who have given their lives in service to their country; (4) calls upon a new generation of workers to consider a career in public service as an honorable profession; and (5) encourages efforts to promote public service careers at all levels of government. Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. Today I rise to pay tribute to the hard-working men and women who dedicate their lives to public service. Whether it is on the Federal, State, or local level, pub-lic servants perform essential func-tions that Americans rely on every day. For this reason, it is a privilege to submit a resolution to honor these em-ployees for Public Service Recognition Week. I am delighted to be joined in this effort by Senators F ITZGERALD , COLLINS , LIEBERMAN , and L EVIN. Public Service Recognition Week takes place the week of May 5, 2003. Since 1985, the first week in May show-cases the talented men and women who serve America as Federal, State and local government employees. Through-out the Nation and around the world, public employees use the week to edu-cate their fellow citizens how govern-ment serves them, and how govern- ment services make life better for all of us. For example, public servants help the Nation recover from natural disasters and terrorist attacks; fight crime and fire; deliver the mail; teach our chil-dren; provide local transportation; pro-tect the environment; fight disease and promote better health; improve the quality and safety of water and food; and defend our freedom. Since Sep-tember 11, 2001, public servants at the Federal, State, and local level worked around the clock to prevent terrorist attacks and reduce our vulnerability to future attacks in addition to carrying out their other job related responsibil-ities. Such dedication and hard work deserve our recognition. I would like to pay particular atten- tion to the men and women who serve in our armed forces, and the civilian employees who support their missions. These employees are key to the secu-rity and defense of our Nation. From the war against terrorism to Operation Iraqi Freedom, our military and civil-ian support staff show courage in the face of adversity. They too are ready, willing, and able to make this a safer world. While Public Service Recognition Week represents an opportunity for us to honor and celebrate the commit-ment of individuals who serve the needs of the Nation as government and municipal employees, it is also a time to call on a new generation of Ameri-cans to consider public service. As my colleagues know, the Federal Govern-ment is facing a crisis in its recruit-ment and retention efforts. The prob-lem is so critical that the General Ac-counting Office, GAO, has placed the so-called 'human capital crisis' on its High Risk List. According to the GAO, nearly 50 percent of the Federal work-force will be eligible to retire by 2005. Although no one knows how many will actually retire, this situation poses se-rious challenges for succession plan-ning in addition to mission perform-ance. Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity for individuals to gain a deeper understanding of the exciting and challenging work in the Federal Government and career oppor-tunities available. I invite my colleagues to honor the patriotic commitment to public service that our Federal employees exemplify and to join in the Federal Govern-ment's annual celebration. During the week there will be an extensive exhibit on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., showcasing many of our Federal agencies and branches of the military, as well as highlighting the services these agencies provide. In addition to the Mall exhibits, I encourage my col-leagues to recognize Federal employees in their states, as well as State and local government employees, to let them know how much their work is ap-preciated.

SA 534. Mr. M CCONNELL (for Mr. LUGAR ) proposed an amendment to the joint resolution S.J. Res. 3, expressing the sense of Congress with respect to human rights in Central Asia; as fol-lows: Strike the preamble and insert the fol- lowing: Whereas the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are providing the United States with assistance in the war in Afghanistan, from military basing and overflight rights to the facilitation of hu-manitarian relief; Whereas in turn the United States victory over the Taliban in Afghanistan provides im-portant benefits to the Central Asian nations by removing a regime that threatened their security and by significantly weakening the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a terrorist organization that had previously staged armed raids from Afghanistan into the re-gion; Whereas the United States has consist- ently urged the nations of Central Asia to open their political systems and economies and to respect human rights, both before and since the attacks of September 11, 2001; Whereas Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are members of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), both of which confer a range of obligations with respect to human rights on their members; Whereas while the United States recog- nizes marked differences among the social structures and commitments to democratic and economic reform of the Central Asian nations, the United States notes neverthe-less, according to the State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, that all five governments of such nations, to differing degrees, restrict freedom of speech and association, restrict or ban the activities of human rights organizations and other non-governmental organizations, harass or prohibit independent media, imprison polit-ical opponents, practice arbitrary detention and arrest, and engage in torture and extrajudical executions; Whereas by continuing to suppress human rights and to deny citizens peaceful, demo-cratic means of expressing their convictions, the nations of Central Asia risk fueling pop-ular support for violent and extremist move-ments, thus undermining the goals of the war on terrorism; Whereas President George W. Bush has made the defense of human dignity, the rule of law, limits on the power of the state, re-spect for women and private property, free speech, equal justice, religious tolerance strategic goals of United States foreign pol-icy in the Islamic world, arguing that ''a truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of dissent for all groups that pursue their as-pirations without violence''; and Whereas Congress has expressed its desire to see deeper reform in Central Asia in past resolutions and other legislation, most re-cently conditioning assistance to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan on their progress in meeting commitments to the United States on human rights and democracy: Now, there-fore, be it f AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE , SCIENCE , AND TRANSPORTATION Mr. M CCONNELL.

(3) Taiwan's population of 23,500,000 people is greater than that of three-fourths of the member states already in the World Health Organization (WHO). (4) Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy levels in Asia, mater-nal and infant mortality rates comparable to those of western countries, the eradication of such infectious diseases as cholera, small-pox, and the plague, and the first to eradi-cate polio and provide children with hepitis B vaccinations. (5) The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its Taiwan coun-terpart agencies have enjoyed close collabo-ration on a wide range of public health issues. (6) In recent years Taiwan has expressed a willingness to assist financially and tech-nically in international aid and health ac-tivities supported by the WHO. (7) On January 14, 2001, an earthquake, reg- istering between 7.6 and 7.9 on the Richter scale, struck El Salvador. In response, the Taiwanese government sent 2 rescue teams, consisting of 90 individuals specializing in firefighting, medicine, and civil engineering. The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also donated $200,000 in relief aid to the Sal-vadoran Government. (8) The World Health Assembly has allowed observers to participate in the activities of the organization, including the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, the Order of Malta, and the Holy See in the early 1950s. (9) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, declared its intention to sup-port Taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations. (10) Public Law 106-137 required the Sec- retary of State to submit a report to the Congress on efforts by the executive branch to support Taiwan's participation in inter-national organizations, in particular the WHO. (11) In light of all benefits that Taiwan's participation in the WHO can bring to the state of health not only in Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, Taiwan and its 23,500,000 people should have appropriate and meaningful participation in the WHO. (12) On May 11, 2001, President Bush stated in his letter to Senator Murkowski that the United States ''should find opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in international organizations in order to make a contribu-tion, even if membership is not possible'', further stating that his Administration ''has focused on finding concrete ways for Taiwan to benefit and contribute to the WHO''. (13) In his speech made in the World Med- ical Association on May 14, 2002, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thomp-son announced ''America's work for a healthy world cuts across political lines. That is why my government supports Tai-wan's efforts to gain observership status at the World Health Assembly. We know this is a controversial issue, but we do not shrink from taking a public stance on it. The people of Taiwan deserve the same level of public health as citizens of every nation on earth, and we support them in their efforts to achieve it''. (14) The Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan, in response to an appeal from the United Nations and the United States for resources to control the spread of HIV/AIDS, donated $1,000,000 to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Ma-laria in December 2002. (b) P LAN.\u2014The Secretary of State is au- thorized\u2014 (1) to initiate a United States plan to en- dorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the annual week-long summit of the World Health Assembly in May 2003 in Gene-va, Switzerland; and (2) to instruct the United States delegation to Geneva to implement that plan. (c) R EPORT .\u2014Not later than 14 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to Congress in unclassified form describing the action taken under subsection (b). f HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA Mr. M CCONNELL.

The amendment (No. 534) was agreed to, as follows: Strike the preamble and insert the fol- lowing: Whereas the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are providing the United States with assistance in the war in Afghanistan, from military basing and overflight rights to the facilitation of hu-manitarian relief; Whereas in turn the United States victory over the Taliban in Afghanistan provides im-portant benefits to the Central Asian nations by removing a regime that threatened their security and by significantly weakening the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a terrorist organization that had previously staged armed raids from Afghanistan into the re-gion; Whereas the United States has consist- ently urged the nations of Central Asia to open their political systems and economies and to respect human rights, both before and since the attacks of September 11, 2001; Whereas Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are members of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), both of which confer a range of obligations with respect to human rights on their members; Whereas while the United States recog- nizes marked differences among the social structures and commitments to democratic and economic reform of the Central Asian nations, the United States notes neverthe-less, according to the State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, that all five governments of such nations, to differing degrees, restrict freedom of speech and association, restrict or ban the activities of human rights organizations and other non-governmental organizations, harass or prohibit independent media, imprison polit-ical opponents, practice arbitrary detention and arrest, and engage in torture and extrajudical executions; Whereas by continuing to suppress human rights and to deny citizens peaceful, demo-cratic means of expressing their convictions, the nations of Central Asia risk fueling pop-ular support for violent and extremist move-ments, thus undermining the goals of the war on terrorism; Whereas President George W. Bush has made the defense of human dignity, the rule of law, limits on the power of the state, re-spect for women and private property, free speech, equal justice, religious tolerance strategic goals of United States foreign pol-icy in the Islamic world, arguing that ''a truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of dissent for all groups that pursue their as-pirations without violence''; and Whereas Congress has expressed its desire to see deeper reform in Central Asia in past resolutions and other legislation, most re-cently conditioning assistance to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan on their progress in meeting commitments to the United States on human rights and democracy: Now, there-fore, be it The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.

The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 289) to expand the boundaries of the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Com-plex and a Detroit River International Wild-life Refuge. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. Mr. M CCONNELL.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 81, S. Con. Res. 15, which was re-ported earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 15) commemorating the 140th anniversary of the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution. Mr. M CCONNELL.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 15) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows: S. C ON. RES. 15 Whereas Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President of the United States, issued a proc-lamation on September 22, 1862, declaring that on the first day of January, 1863, ''all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and for-ever free''; Whereas the proclamation declared ''all persons held slaves within the insurgent States''\u2014with the exception of Tennessee, southern Louisiana, and parts of Virginia, then within Union lines\u2014''are free''; Whereas, for two and half years, Texas slaves were held in bondage after the Eman-cipation Proclamation became official and only after Major General Gordon Granger and his soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, were African-American slaves in that State set free; Whereas slavery was a horrendous practice and trade in human trafficking that contin-ued until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitu-tion ending slavery on December 18, 1865; Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation is historically significant and history is re-garded as a means of understanding the past and solving the challenges of the future; Whereas one hundred and forty years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclama-tion, African Americans have integrated into various levels of society; and Whereas commemorating the 140th anni- versary of the Emancipation Proclamation highlights and reflects the suffering and progress of the faith and strength of char-acter shown by slaves and their descendants as an example for all people of the United States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep- resentatives concurring), That Congress\u2014 (1) recognizes the historical significance of the 140th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation as an important period in the Nation's history; and (2) encourages its celebration in accord- ance with the spirit, strength, and legacy of freedom, justice, and equality for all people of America and to provide an opportunity for all people of the United States to learn more about the past and to better understand the experiences that have shaped the Nation. f COMMEMORATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS f Mr. M CCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Cal-endar No. 82, S. Res. 75, which was reported earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: f A resolution (S. Res. 75) commemo- rating and acknowledging the dedi-cation and sacrifice made by the men and women who have lost their lives while serving as law en-forcement officers. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am happy that the Senate is passing S. Res. 75, a resolution that would des-ignate May 15, 2003, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. Senator C AMP- BELL and I introduced this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice and commit-ment of those law enforcement officers who lost their lives serving their com-munities. We are joined by 20 cospon-sors, including Judiciary Committee Chairman H ATCH , and Judiciary Com- mittee members B IDEN, DURBIN , SCHU- MERand K OHL. I commend Senator C AMPBELL for his leadership in this issue. As a former deputy sheriff, he has experienced first- hand the risks faced by law enforce-ment officers every day while they pro-tect our communities. I also want to thank each of our nation's brave law enforcement officers for the jobs they do. They are real-life heroes, too many of whom often give the ultimate sac-rifice, and they remind us of how im-portant it is to support our state and local police. Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who serve this Nation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Each year, 1 in 15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 officers is injured, and 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of duty somewhere in America every other day. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 72 peace officers died while trying to en-sure that their fellow citizens in those buildings got to safety. That act of ter-rorism resulted in the highest number VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan \u2014 SENATE S5692 May 1, 2003 of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of this country. In 2002, over 152 law enforcement offi- cers died while serving in the line of duty, well below the decade-long aver-age of 165 deaths annually, and a major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 offi-cers were killed. A number of factors contributed to this reduction including better equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, longer prison terms for vio-lent offenders, and advanced emer-gency medical care. And, in total, more than 16,700 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice. National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the United States with the opportunity to honor that extraordinary service and sacrifice. More than 15,000 peace offi-cers are expected to gather in Wash-ington to join with the families of their fallen comrades who, by their last full measure of devotion to their respon-sibilities and the right and security of their fellow citizens, have rendered a dedicated service to our nation. I look forward to passage of this important resolution, a fitting tribute for this special and solemn occasion. Mr. M CCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statement related to this mat-ter be printed in the R ECORD . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 75) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows: S. R ES. 75 Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance and dedica-tion of law enforcement personnel; Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to their personal safe-ty, presently serve their fellow citizens as guardians of peace; Whereas peace officers are on the front line in preserving the right of the children of the United States to receive an education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence in schools; Whereas more than 145 peace officers across the Nation were killed in the line of duty during 2002, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and a major drop from 2001 when 230 officers were killed, including 72 officers in the September 11th terrorist attacks; Whereas a number of factors contributed to this reduction in deaths, including better equipment and the increased use of bullet-re-sistant vests, improved training, longer pris-on terms for violent offenders, and advanced emergency medical care; Whereas every year, 1 out of every 9 peace officers is assaulted, 1 out of every 25 peace officers is injured, and 1 out of every 4,400 peace officers is killed in the line of duty somewhere in America every other day; and Whereas on May 15, 2003, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington, D.C. to join with the families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those comrades and all others who went be-fore them: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) recognizes May 15, 2003, as Peace Offi- cers Memorial Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or disabled in the line of duty; and (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect. f AUTHORIZATION FOR COMMITTEE TO FILE Mr. M CCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the Sen-ate's adjournment, the Commerce Committee have from 10 a.m. until 12 noon on Friday, May 2, to file S. 824, the FAA reauthorization bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Would the distinguished majority whip yield? Mr. M CCONNELL. I yield. Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have completed a number of unanimous con-sent requests this evening. A number of them\u2014about 10 in number\u2014deal with various positions that have been con-firmed by the Senate this evening. These we read off by virtue of numbers. We do this almost every night, but I think sometimes we fail to realize these are real people and they are more than just numbers. The people on this list that we have read off today, they will have celebrations tonight. These are extremely important days in the life of every one of these people whose names we have read off today. I think it does us good to once in a while just pause and recognize that the things we do here deal with more than just numbers. I ask we all once in a while stop and join in the celebration of these victories that these people have. It is difficult, with the present situa- tion\u2014present situation? I think it has been going on for 20 years, how dif-ficult it is to get nominations that the President sends to us, Democrat or Re-publican. The process is not very good. We are now into the second year of this administration and we are just getting approved people he submitted earlier\u2014some of whom he didn't sub-mit earlier\u2014just because the process is so slow. I hope someday a bipartisan commission or some organization can be set up so we can do this separate and apart from the situation that in-volves the judiciary. But just on nomi-nations that come from the President, we need a system that works much bet-ter, more quickly than what we have. I don't want to prolong the point other than to say congratulations to all these people who have been ap-proved tonight. Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the assistant Democratic leader, his points are well made both on the congratulations that are certainly due these individuals who have been confirmed tonight and on the need to improve the process by which we get individuals confirmed here in the Senate. I must say, without the able and effective assistance of the assistant Democratic leader, we would not have been able to clear some of these nominations tonight. I thank him for his perseverance in making that possible. f ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 5, 2003 Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until noon, Mon-day, May 5. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Sen-ate then begin a period of morning business until 12:45, with the time equally divided between the majority leader and Senator D ORGAN or their designees, provided that at 12:45 the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 34, the nomination of Deborah Cook to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit as provided under the previous order. I further ask unanimous consent that upon the completion of the vote on the Cook nomination, the Senate resume consideration of the nomination of Miguel Estrada, with the remaining time until 6 p.m. equally divided be-tween the chairman and ranking mem-ber of the Judiciary Committee, pro-vided further that at 6 p.m. the Senate proceed to a cloture vote on the Estrada nomination. Mr. REID. No objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f PROGRAM Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, on Monday the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:45. Fol-lowing morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the Cook nomination to the Sixth Circuit. Under the agreement entered into earlier today, there will be up to 4 hours of de-bate on the nomination prior to a vote on confirmation. Therefore, the first vote on Monday will occur at 4:45 p.m. Upon the disposition of the Cook nomination, the Senate will debate the nomination of Miguel Estrada until 6 p.m. At 6 p.m., the Senate will conduct its fifth cloture vote on the Estrada nomination. In addition to judicial nominations, the Senate may proceed to any of the following items next week: The NATO expansion bill, the energy bill, the bio-shield legislation, the State Depart-ment authorization bill, the FISA leg-islation, and any other items that can be cleared for floor action. Therefore, I encourage our colleagues to prepare for a very busy week, with numerous roll-call votes occurring throughout next week. VerDate Mar 15 2010 21:02 Jan 14, \u2014 SENATE S5693 May 1, 2003 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 5, 2003 Mr. M CCONNELL. If there is no fur- ther business to come before the Sen-ate, I ask unanimous consent the Sen-ate stand in adjournment under the previous order.

FRANK R. WOLF OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 29, 2003 Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, Africa is on the brink of a crisis of biblical proportions. I trav-eled to Ethiopia and Eritrea earlier this year to see the famine conditions, and never imagined that I'd see conditions as bad as I saw in 1984. In 1984, 8 million were in need of food aid. In January, more than 11 million people strug-gled for their next meal. I saw women and children that were too weak to feed them-selves. This is absolutely tragic in a world with food as plentiful as ours. Today, the situation is even more dis- tressing. I recently read a cable from the American ambassador in Ethiopia describing a grimmer outlook for the coming months than had previously been expected. I will be sub-mitting into the R ECORDthe cable and the lat- est NOAA weather forecast, which revises ex-pectations for crop viability downward. This paints a bleak outlook for millions more Ethio-pians for months to come. In March, I wrote U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urging him to appoint a special envoy for hunger. Many European news out-lets have run stories in recent days on the growing number of Africans, whose lives are now in jeopardy. The Ethiopian Government is planning another ''Live-Aid'' concert to re-ener-gize the donor community and draw inter-national attention to the situation. The momen-tum of this concert, coupled with the appoint-ment of a U.N. special envoy, may help draw enough attention and resources to the con-tinent and save the lives of millions of women and children. In Matthew 25, Jesus talks about the obliga- tion to feed the hungry. The United States has responded to this crisis with an enormous amount of compassion. Many countries have the ability to give more, and may just be wait-ing to be asked. Time, resources and attention must be devoted to mobilizing and coordi-nating the resources required. This is a crisis that will require enormous coordination be-tween international aid agencies, religious leaders and governments from every corner of the globe. The war in Iraq has demanded our atten- tion, but we can not allow this silent emer-gency to grow worse. The lives of millions of women and children depend on this story being shared loudly and boldly. I hope you'll do your part. FROM AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1559 SUMMARY 1. The mission believes that the number of people in need of emergency assistance will continue to increase from current levels of 11.3 million to 14 million people over the course of the year, forcing a deliberate shift from the mid-case to the worst-case scenario as described in the October 2002 USAID/Ethi-opia Contingency Plan. 2. Life-saving interventions are ongoing throughout Ethiopia, with special attention to pocket areas with high malnutrition. However, poor belg rains to date continue to raise vulnerability and needs and potentially threaten grave consequences, including in-creased mortality. 3. The sheer magnitude, severity and dura- tion of Ethiopia's food security emergency has left people in an extreme state of vulner-ability where coping strategies have been ex-hausted and livelihoods destroyed leading to widespread destitution. Increased destitution and continued shocks threaten a sharp in-crease in mortality levels as any possible harvest is still months away and health sta-tus of the most affected continues to decline. 4. Pre-famine indicators are present in Ethiopia for a significant portion of the at-need population and support the movement of contingency planning efforts to a worst-case scenario. BACKGROUND 5. As per Reftel (A), USAID/Ethiopia issued a contingency plan (October 2002) to the horn response working group in USAID/W out-lining a mid-case and two worst-case sce-narios as well as a mitigation and response plan. 6. The mission believes that the response to date, particularly led by the GFDRE and the USG, has provided the necessary re-sources to mitigate against the absolute worst-case scenario (Worst-Case Scenario Two as per the plan). However, current rains are again inadequate and NOAA projections indicate ''normal to below normal'' rainfall is anticipated. 7. Continued drought can be expected to in- crease the beneficiary caseload beyond cur-rent levels of 11.3 million people to 14 million or more over a wider geographic area. Thus, we can expect to meet criteria for the plan's Worst-Case Scenario One. 8. A worst-case scenario will result in un- acceptable levels of mortality over a wide area and further breakdowns of long-term livelihood and coping strategies. In addition, one can anticipate further depletion of pro-ductive assets (destitution), distress migra-tion, increased rural and urban vulner-ability, malnutrition, and mortality will occur over the coming months based on cur-rent indicators. The pre-famine indicators will only worsen if rains continue to be much below average. 9. The current crisis is not likely to result in the mortality levels of the 1980's, in large part due to an early response by the GFDRE, donors, and institutions such as the Emer-gency Food Security Reserve, and early warning systems. In the likely event of pipe-line breaks and/or epidemic outbreaks, the worst-case scenario could result in a signifi-cant spike in mortality. FACTORS LEADING TO A WORST -CASE SCENARIO A. MASSIVE CROP FAILURE AND NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN NEED 10. Following the December 2002 crop as- sessment (estimated 25 percent decrease from the 2001/2002 harvest and 21 percent de-crease from the last five-year average (FAO) production decline), DPPC and multi-agency teams concluded that 11.3 million people would require emergency assistance. a fur- ther 2.9 million people were identified as being under close monitoring. 11. A March 14 addendum to the appeal (SEPTEL C) increased needs slightly from 1.44 to 1.46 million metric tons and those under close monitoring from 2.9 to 3.1 mil-lion. 12. Production is most severely affected in Eastern Ethiopia, particularly in lowland areas, where losses range from 70 to 100 per-cent. However, food production is also down in surplus areas in the west. Reduction in food production in surplus areas will limit timely local purchase of food aid and cereal prices will increase further through the hun-gry season (July-September) when more than 90 percent of farmers' cereal holdings will be depleted. 13. Note: The 1999-2000 food shortage emer- gency (labeled as localized famine retrospec-tively by CDC with respect to excess mor-tality in the Gode Zone of Somali Region and low-level famine in the Ethiopian high-lands by experts such as Stephen Devereaux) was largely limited to belg producing and pastoral areas. This is not true in 2003. Cur-rent pre-famine indicators are found in many areas that are main meher-season producers. In the 1999 and 2000 contingency plans, the mission warned that a true worst-case sce-nario would be a failure of production in main season agricultural areas. This is in fact the situation that we now face in Ethi-opia. B. CHANGED DISEASE ENVIRONMENT 14. As per Reftels B and E, mortality and morbidity indicators are deteriorating. Of the 130 worst drought-affected districts, sur-veys with mortality data are now available for 30. Of these, 18 districts with a total sur-veyed population of 2.1 million report mor-tality rates at or above emergency thresh-olds of 1 per 10,000 per day for crude mor-tality or 2 per 10,000 children under five years of age per day. 15. Recent nutrition surveys in areas where interventions are ongoing suggest that nu-tritional status has stabilized or improving in a number of districts. Other areas, par-ticularly those in the southern nations, na-tionalities and peoples region (SNNPR) and other pocket areas in the north-central high-lands, However, are now deteriorating (in-cluding the development of pellagra). 16. Of particular concern are reports of pel- lagra and other micronutrient deficiencies from UNICEF nutrition experts traveling in North Wello. Pellagra results from a lack of niacin, often occurring in populations reliant on a homogenous diet of corn. After several months of dependency upon relief food com-prised of corn or wheat only, (blended foods and pulses are in short supply), micro-nutrient deficiencies such as pellagra are not surprising. UNICEF nutrition experts re-ported seeing cases in most villages they vis-ited. As the rash-like symptoms of pellagra are only visible at advanced stages of the micronutrient deficiency, pellagra is very likely to be affecting a much larger propor-tion of the population than was observed. 17. Since early February, measles out- breaks have been reported in Bale Zone in Oromiya, Silti Zone in SNNPR and the WAG HAMRA Zone in Amhara. 18. Cases of meningitis have been reported in Tigray, SNNPR, Afar, Benishangul and Amhara. The ministry of health is making VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E822 May 1, 2003 aggressive efforts to determine the strain. The threat of cholera increases with the ad-vent of rain in the northern part of the coun-try. Malaria cases are increasing and will likely increase further as people move to lowlands C. A DEEPENING CRISIS , COUPLED WITH POOR RAINS IN 2003 19. On March 25, 2003, the Disaster Preven- tion and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) launched a multi-agency assessment team to Tigray, Amhara, Oromiya and Southern Na-tions, Nationalities and Peoples Regions (SNNPR). The assessments will revise the status of 3.1 million people under the ''close-monitoring'' category and verify any addi-tional need. Early indications point to an in-crease in needs beginning May 1, 2003, of 1.5 million people as a result of the emerging and deepening crisis and the lack of relief provided by the current belg season. Assess-ment results will be known on April 25, 2003. 20. On April 9, the DPPC Commissioner commented that he believes the assessment would show significant movement of those under ''close-monitoring'' to the beneficiary group requiring immediate assistance. 21. Fews net assessments of the rains to date indicate that although there are spo-radic intensive rains in a few pocket areas, the belg is below-average to much below-av-erage in the eastern portion of Ethiopia gen-erally, and specifically in the Afar, Somali, West Hararghe and SNNPR regions. Given that a good belg season in recent years is more the exception than the rule, we antici-pate, based on experience, that the outcome this year will likely be much below-average. A significant reduction in area-planted for belg producers are already being reported over a widespread area. D. INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN NEED 22. To date, the effect of the much below- average belg is a deepening of the severity of the drought in already affected food deficit areas, pastoral areas, and newly emerging areas (SNNPR and some parts of the Oromiya Region). Assuming at this time, a much below-average belg performance (and poor pastoral rains), but not a total failure, we expect an increase of an additional 1 mil-lion people in need of assistance over a wide-spread area beginning in July or a revised total beneficiary caseload of 13.8 million (ini-tial caseload of 11.3 million beneficiaries, projected may increase of 1.5 million people, and July increase of 1 million). 23. Based on this estimate, the following can be expected: \u2014Rather than needs peaking between April and June and declining in July, the mission believes that overall needs will increase ini-tially in May and then remain at peak levels for the period June, July and August, and possibly through September. \u2014The overall increase in beneficiaries by 2.5 million people will result in increased ce-real needs by some 170,000 mt (using 12.5 kg/person) and blended food requirements of 39,375 mt between May and September. This will increase overall needs during the appeal period from 1.46 mt to 1.66 mt (or an increase of about 210,000 mt overall (cereals and blended food) for the five month period). E. PIPELINE BREAK FOR CEREALS AND BLENDED FOOD 24. The most recent USG contribution to- taling 186,500 mt, as well as new contribu-tions from other donors, brings the total pledges against CY 2003 to more than 1 mil-lion mt including 939,252 mt of cereals, 65,685 mt of blended food and 15,267 mt of vegetable oil. This represents some 70 percent of the estimated needs for 2003. 25. However, it should be noted that these are pledges, not deliveries and continued co-ordination and robust deliveries are nec- essary to avert a pipeline break. Any delay could result in a pipeline break, which will have lasting repercussions for relief deliv-eries for the rest of the year, and could cause all major indicators to spike (morbidity, malnutrition, mortality, migration, etc.) 26. Actual deliveries are lagging. For exam- ple, the USG has pledged some 535,000 mt in CY 2003, but over 250,000 mt has not yet been purchased or shipped from the US and re-mains unscheduled in terms of delivery to Ethiopia. Consequences of a prolonged pipe-line break include: \u2014Sharp increase of severe malnutrition and mortality; \u2014Ration reductions further compounding high levels of of food to inac- cessible areas; \u2014Reduction in distributions, requiring parallel import measures to the distribution sites and the emergency food security re-serve, or partner warehouse; \u2014Mass migration during the agricultural season will affect this year's overall produc-tion and next years' assistance require-ments; and \u2014Mass displacement and rural to urban migration. 27. With the addition of some 2.5 million people in need, it is expected that current pledges and delivery schedules for cereals will fall short of needs beginning in late-July with delivery lulls and gaps as early as May. 28. The blended food availability remains dangerously low with only 50 percent of the supplementary food needs pledged. Current available information points to a break of supplementary food availability in the mid-dle of June. 29. Maintaining a pipeline at a minimum of 83 percent (representing the reduced ration of 12.5 kg-per person) of needs is necessary, not just to meet less-than-minimal nutri-tional requirements and limit spontaneous migration in search of food, but also to en-sure that stability is maintained. 30. The mission is concerned about contin- ued targeting difficulties and dilution of ra-tions from the reduced level of 12.5 kg per person-per month, to even lower-levels as local officials stretch food available for an increasing number of people in need. The long-term impact on health status of keep-ing people barely within nutritional require-ments is a serious concern. 31. The mission continues to stress the im- portance of improved targeting to increase the effectiveness of the emergency aid and in particular the present supplementary dis-tributions. However, this often falls on deaf ears at the local level where absolute num-bers in need are immediately apparent. PLAN TO MEET INCREASING NEEDS 32. To date, the major stabilizing factor has been the USG contribution of 712,000 mt ($319 million) of emergency food aid since the crisis emerged in July 2002. Non-food con-tributions include ofda grants ($7.2 million with additional grants expected in the com-ing weeks), and USAID/Ethiopia grants to-taling $17 million. Accordingly, the USG has played the leading role to meet critical needs. 33. Recently signed grants will complement and increase the immediate health response, including increasing the number of nutri-tional surveys, health services and measles campaigns in the worst affected areas. Funds will also support services to emerging hotspots, increase potable water and expand the school-feeding program through the sum-mer and fall. A. Health and Non-Food Interventions: 34. But more is needed. One of the most significant and damning criticisms of the 1999-2000 response in the Somali Region of Ethiopia, was the inability of the UN Agen-cies and non-government organizations to undertake a timely measles immunization campaign and appropriately link food and health interventions to minimize excess mortality. The following critical actions need to be undertaken by the GFDRE, DO-NORS, NGOS, etc. In the next ninety days in order to avoid further excess deaths: \u2014Implement mass measles immunization campaigns (currently underway). In all, 16.2 million people under the age of 15 will be reached by June. \u2014Provide basic health, water and sanita- tion services at food distribution and supple-mentary feeding sites. \u2014Provide food and basic health services to displaced, mobile and other difficult to reach populations, including out-reach services; \u2014Improve targeting and ensure that food distributions are integrated generally with an overall health response; \u2014Increase availability and improve tar- geting of CSB; \u2014Implement an aggressive outbreak inves- tigation and response to diseases of epidemic potential (e.g., meningitis); \u2014Implement a nutrition and mortality survey to cover the worst drought affected districts in order to obtain a better estimate of the overall magnitude of the problem (this is a follow-on to previous Center for Disease Control (CDC) support. USAID/Ethiopia is working with OFDA to identify appropriate assistance.); and \u2014Increase preparedness for therapeutic feeding by creating mobile teams of trained medical personnel that can move to sites where malnutrition rates rise to require spe-cialized therapeutic feeding. B. Support a Livelihoods Approach To Meeting Needs: 35. It is critical that the USG look to an in- creasing broad pool of implementing agen-cies to meet the widening humanitarian needs in Ethiopia. A significant surge-capac-ity is required to integrate food, non-food, livelihood and counter-famine responses to address the depth of the crisis. 36. Millions of families have lost their as- sets and require protection from further asset losses. Households also require access to a safety net and other opportunities for asset building. Provision of drought and dis-ease resistant crops and pastoral interven-tions to assist in the recovery of populations in need, is critical prior to the onset on the main rains and the hunger-season in June. C. Support Counter-Famine Measures: 37. Counter-famine measures such as the introduction of marketing interventions to improve access to grains and support the sta-bilization of, and access to, food and seeds, must be identified and funded now to ensure a continuation of the proactive and robust emergency response. 38. In support of USG efforts to minimize the effects of the food crisis in Ethiopia, the mission began receiving technical assistance from the Feinstein International Famine Center (FIFC) At Tufts University, through joint funding from OFDA and USAID/Ethi-opia. The assistance will project the wide-spread nature of the current crisis, identify pre-famine level indicators in Ethiopia, AND assist in the identification and design of strategies to support livelihood and counter-famine measures and interventions that di-rectly mitigate and minimize outcomes such as malnutrition, destitution and mortality. 39. Comment. The characteristics of the current crisis depict one of widespread and severe-hunger where 20 percent of Ethiopian households are dependent on relief distribu-tions. This is a crisis that could be exacer-bated immensely with a pipeline break, an epidemic outbreak or continued under-re-sponse relative to needs. Pre-famine indica-tors are in place in Ethiopia, including: VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May May 1, 2003 irreversibility, increased morbidity and mor- tality beyond acceptable levels and migra-tion. RECOMMENDATIONS 40. Given the continued deterioration of the situation, and the likelihood of increased needs and a wider affected population experi-encing irreversible outcomes of the crisis, the mission recommends the following: A. Issue demarche to other donor countries and request further assistance (see Reftel F). B. Establish a reserve allocation of 150,000 MT from the Emerson Trust that can be used to respond to needs at the height of the hun-gry-season (July-September). Food would be distributed through NGOS and the World Food Program. C. Continue CSB contributions and deliv- eries through NGOS and the World Food Pro-gram to meet the deterioration of nutri-tional status in developing hot-spots. Based upon needs, up to 25,000 MT of CSB should be made available for delivery in July and Au-gust 2003. D. Use additional agency funding to meet immediate needs and put in place livelihood interventions and counter-famine measures particularly through U.S. non-governmental organizations now implementing the joint emergency operation. E. Broaden the normal pool of imple- menting agencies and the tools to meet needs (i.e., beyond traditional food and non-food programs). It has become clear over the last several months that our NGO partners are quickly coming to a saturation point re-garding their capacity and additional surge capacity is needed. F. Provide follow-up CDC assistance to track epidemic outbreaks and implement ap-propriate nutritional and mortality surveys to deepen the understanding of the overall magnitude of the crisis. G. Press the United Nations for the ap- pointment of a special envoy and/or a senior operational humanitarian coordinator to es-tablish an effective and credible emergency response across UN agencies. This point can-not be over-stated. Brazeal. f FREEDOM'S OBLIGATION HON. J. DENNIS HASTERT OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. HASTERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to submit the words of John Marc Sianghio, Jr., a young man from Oswego, Illinois, to the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD. John was recently named a winner in the Veterans of Foreign Wars Voice of Democracy scriptwriting contest for 2003. The Veterans of Foreign Wars holds a Voice of Democracy competition each year in order to give high school students an oppor-tunity to express their patriotism. This year, an overwhelming 80,000 students across the country participated in the contest. John's essay reflects upon the responsibilities inher-ent to life in a free nation\u2014freedom's obliga-tion. I commend the Veterans of Foreign Wars for their continued commitment to fostering a sense of patriotism and responsibility in the youth of our great nation. And I congratulate John on his success and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.2002-2003 VFW V OICE OF DEMOCRACY SCHOLARSHIP CONTEST ''FREEDOM 'S OBLIGATION '' (Illinois Winner.\u2014John Marc Sianghio, Jr.) Lady Liberty stands vigil over a city, and a nation that does not sleep. In her torch shines perpetual daylight, fueled by the great virtue that is tireless action. ''Action'' she demands. Even her silence cries out to the world, ''Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'' Though the words say ''give me'' the sub- text shouts ''come!'' It is not an invitation, it is a command: not a gift, a demand. The imprisoned lightning in her torch thunders with a message understood in every lan-guage, that the Republic over which she stands with its liberties and justices, is not for all. It stands only for all those with the boldness to take it, for all those willing to pay its price. This precious freedom is open only to those who can meet its obligation. That obligation can only be action, for America is a republic born of a hard and painful labor, a republic that earned its free-dom at the point of a gun, and that has held its freedom with the same. America is a na-tion that did not emerge as the random off-spring of intercoursing tribes. It emerged by the active will of its people. Nor was its rev-olution won in the minds of inert philoso-phers, rather in the hearts of the masses; hearts that not only had passive sentiment, but that physically pumped charged blood into live limbs, stirring them to action: Hearts that bled freely so that the flag of independence might be striped in scarlet . . . But that once vibrant crimson has faded through uncounted years of stagnancy. Stagnancy is the greatest treason. We jus- tify it in this age by referring to it by an alias. Like the devil it is, it has many names. It is called caution, debate, delay, fil-ibuster, complaint, apathy, and inaction. If it is not action . . . it is treason. Treason was not a word in my vocabulary when I immigrated to this country. I was two at the time. Freedom when I first set foot on American soil meant that I would be out of the coach class seat that held me for twenty two hours, that I could stretch my legs on solid ground. Was that true freedom? Of course not. I had to learn freedom. I had to earn freedom. From the moment I was first old enough to realize the opportunities and liberties gifted to me by American Freedom, the enormity of Freedom's obligation was already creeping onto my shoulders. As I have grown older and learned more and more about my rights, the responsibilities wrapped inside these rights also began to emerge. As immigrants to this country, there was a long difficult process which my family and I had to undertake to stay in this country. This process required much sacrifice by each individual involved. However, we wanted to work to earn the freedoms we enjoyed. Had we not done it, we would have debased our honor and lowered ourselves to the state of common thieves. The sacrifices I have made earned me my freedom. Your story, your struggles, your road to earning freedom is probably much different. However, our obli-gations to freedom are in essence the same. So what is the spirit of our obligation? What is the common labor that must be un-dertaken to be worthy of Lady Liberty's em-brace? It is simply love. Patriotic love. I speak of a patriot's love, not as the lust of a fool who thinks he serves his country by ignoring her laws and making his own rules because he believes they are better. I speak of true love, like that in marriage. Free-dom's obligation is the marriage of our minds and our souls. It is a dreamer's desire for the ideal, guided by the rational hands of what is real. Our obligation is to strive for that ideal. Realistically, we know that true freedom can only come when every human being is rid of their every chain, chains of poverty, chains of addiction, and chains of hatred. Still we are obligated as individuals to strive for the ideal of freedom. The ideal that every person is created equal because every person creates himself equal. It starts with one. It starts with me, and it starts with you. If we do not meet our obligations, this ideal can never be reached. If we do not meet our obligations, we cheapen freedom, and we cheapen ourselves. For it is freedom's obligation, the great price at which freedom comes, that gives it its value. That is why we must act, so free-dom may retain its value, and that we as in-dividuals may maintain our integrity and human worth as well. For the obligation of freedom is Lady Liberty's call to the indi-vidual who longs to be free. Who, like a new-born child that struggles for its first life sus-taining breath, expands his lungs against the weight of apathy so that he may breathe free. f HONORING 2002 PRE-TEEN AMER- ICA SR. TITLEHOLDER KATIE BECK HON. MIKE ROSS OF ARKANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize and honor Katie Beck for being named 2002 Pre-Teen America Na-tional Sr. Titleholder, and thank her for her outstanding contributions to her community. Competing against talented young ladies from all across the country, Katie distinguished her-self through a demonstrated commitment to community, steadfast character, and drive: all the values that we, as parents, teachers, com-munity members, and legislators, hope to in-still in our next generation. As a parent, I understand the demands that our young people face, which is why I am so encouraged by what Katie has accomplished. In addition to being an active member of her church, captain of the dance team, and the starting pitcher for her softball team, Katie has maintained an A average in school from grades first through eighth. Her energy and dedication have earned her numerous acco-lades and honors including: Duke University TIP Award, President's Education Award, and the National Science Award. At a time when our country needs youth leadership more than ever, Katie has answered the challenge and set a course that can serve as an example for us all. This is a young lady who exemplifies the Arkansas spirit, and who is destined for great things. Just qualifying for the rigorous Pre-Teen program speaks volumes for the character and accomplishments of the young women who compete; however, by being named Pre-Teen America Sr. Titleholder, Katie has also shown maturity and poise beyond her years on top of her many accomplishments. And already, at such a young age, Katie has demonstrated leadership, and exemplary character and grace. Again, I say to Katie, ''Congratulations.'' You are a credit to yourself, your wonderful par-ents, your community, and your state, which is VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E824 May 1, 2003 why it is such an honor for me to be able to thank you again for your contributions to the community and residents of White Hall. f RECOGNITION OF AL HENDERSON HON. C.L. ''BUTCH'' OTTER OF IDAHO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Al Henderson of Boise, Idaho as the recipient of The Salvation Army's William Booth Award for service to community. The William Booth Award is one of the highest awards that may be conveyed upon an indi-vidual by The Salvation Army. Al Henderson's many past civic associations include being co-founder of Idaho Working Partners and the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame, The Salvation Army advisory board chairman, Chamber of Commerce board member, Rotary Club member, American Can-cer Society, West Side Optimists Club and the Boise City Library Board. Mr. Henderson is also closely involved with the good works of the University Christian Church in Boise. Cur-rently he serves part time as an employee for the Federal Emergency Management Adminis-tration. Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate Al Hen- derson for his receipt of this distinguished award. I have had the honor of being person-ally acquainted with Al for many years, and I can think of no other person more worthy or deserving of such an award. I have been in-spired by Al's principled character and his steadfast commitment to the State of Idaho. His achievements, continued unselfish work, and sense of community serve as a lustrous model of exemplary citizenship. f IN HONOR OF A DECADE OF MARK SIMON'S PENINSULA INSIDER COLUMN HON. ANNA G. ESHOO OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mark Simon, who for ten years has educated, amused, irritated, informed and instructed the readers of the San Francisco Chronicle with his well-written, well-read column. ''From beaches to redwoods,'' Mark Simon loves the region of which he writes. Over the years, the people, politics and problems of our region have all become grist for his Chronicle column. He has regaled us with tales of John Madden's taste for tamales and kept us up to date on the unfolding of the Century Loan scandals. He has raised awareness and in-formed his readers on issues as diverse as campaign finance reform, gunshot locators, Devils Slide, and breast cancer treatment for low income women in our community. Mark has reported on every side of Stanford, from sports to the opening of the Cantor Art Mu-seum. His columns have traced the dynamic changes in our community: Silicon Valley's ups and downs, the birth and death of a San Francisco Bay Olympic bid, and the constant rising and falling of housing prices. He has filled the narrative of our region with a variety of colorful events and characters, spotlighting the Tour de Peninsula, former monks, great achievers such as LaDoris Cordell, and even his own beloved sons. We know them all now and we're grateful to Mark as a son of the Pe-ninsula, for his unswerving love of it. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mark Simon for his service to our community as the Chronicle's chronicler of life on the San Francisco Peninsula and the mag-nificent 14th Congressional District. No one has done it better or with as much knowledge, guts, intelligence or love of our area. f APPLAUDING THE ANAHEIM CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the Anaheim City School District for emphasizing the impor-tance of literacy in their curriculum. With a few thousand dollars left in its Propo- sition 10 budget, the early childhood education office put together ''literacy baskets'' that in-cluded crayons, alphabet books, puzzles, and other educational materials. These baskets will be given to adults to take home and throw ''literacy parties'' where they can invite neighbors, friends and relatives over and discuss practical tips on teaching toddlers how to read. The program has been so suc-cessful, that it is quickly running out of bas-kets. A survey by UCLA and the Field Institute shows that nearly half of all adults do not read to their children. Educators believe that rate is worse for low-income families. I want to applaud the Anaheim City School District for working hard to promote literacy to young children. The ''literacy baskets'' will help to improve early literacy and make a dif-ference for thousands of kids. f WARREN HIGH SCHOOL'S CONTIN- UED TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE HON. MIKE ROSS OF ARKANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, it was only two years ago that I was congratulating the War-ren High School Lumberjacks, and their head coach, Bo Hembree, for winning the Arkansas AAA Boys High School State Football Cham-pionship, and here we are again. It is an im-pressive feat just to win one state title, but winning two in three years is a real testament to preparation, character, and purpose. I think it also demonstrates the spirit of determination and hard work that has always distinguished Arkansans. As a concerned parent, I understand even more that paramount among my duties as a U.S. Congressman is to provide the necessary resources to our students, teachers, and schools that will enable our young men and women to excel and succeed in all their en-deavors. Educating the next generation is an important issue not only in the classroom, and the halls of Congress, but also around our kitchen tables at home. I have long been an advocate of athletics and extracurricular activities as a supplement to academic excellence for their ability to instill leadership, character, and perseverance. Ac-tivity outside the classroom instills a habit of serving the community, preparing them to take leadership roles and eventually shape the larger world around them. Championships are won in the heart as much as on the field. The will to overcome ad-versity, the daily drive to succeed, and the mental toughness to perform under pressure carried the young men during their champion-ship season, and will provide them with a well to draw from throughout their entire lives. That is why it brings me so much pleasure to again congratulate the Warren High School football program on winning the AAA Boys High School Football Championship: It is evi-dence of a culture of excellence and hard work among the student body, coaching staff, Warren High School faculty, and the commu-nity. We can all take great pride in the accom-plishments of this team, and how they achieved their goals. I am proud of you. It is an honor for me to salute the coaches, par-ents, and players who stayed the course, and met adversity and challenge to become cham-pions. f RECOGNITION OF COURTNEY FLOYD HON. C.L. ''BUTCH'' OTTER OF IDAHO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of the House the distin-guished accomplishments of Courtney Floyd of Boise, Idaho. Courtney is the recipient of the Salvation Army's Emily Reno award for service to community. Courtney, the daughter of Greg and Su- zanne Floyd, is a senior at Centennial High School in Boise, Idaho, where she serves as a student council officer, cheerleader, and member of the Key Club. In addition to her ex-tensive involvement in school activities, Courtney has served her community in various volunteer capacities\u2014through her involvement with Special Olympics, soup kitchens, humani-tarian aid projects, and retirement centers. A key element in the Salvation Army's Christmas food drives; Courtney has initiated the collection of more than 590,000 pounds of food for the needy during the past 3 years. Mr. Speaker, I wish to convey a special thanks to Courtney Floyd for her hard work and sense of community. Courtney's unselfish actions epitomize the ministry and mission of the Sal-vation Army. f IN HONOR OF WILLIAM R. BRODY HON. ANNA G. ESHOO OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor William R. Brody, M.D., Ph.D., who has VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May Remarks E825 May 1, 2003 earned the J.E. Wallace Sterling Lifetime Achievement Award and will be presented with it by the Stanford Medical Alumni Association and its Board of Governors on May 2, 2003. Dr. Brody is a native of Stockton, California, who earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees from MIT and his M.D. and Ph.D. from Stanford University. Following post-graduate training in cardiovascular surgery and radiology at Stan-ford, the National Institutes of Health and the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Brody was professor of radiology and elec-trical engineering at Stanford. He's been a co-founder of three medical device companies, is responsible for over 100 publications and one U.S. patent in the field of medical imaging. He has made contributions in the fields of medical acoustics, computed tomography, digital radi-ography and magnetic resonance imaging. Dr. Brody, who became the 13th president of the Johns Hopkins University on September 1, 1996, has extensive ties to the 14th Con-gressional District which I'm proud to rep-resent. He and his family lived in Palo Alto for many years and his children attended several years of school in our community. In addition to his extraordinary accomplishments in the fields of engineering, medicine and education, Dr. Brody is a talented musician, a great ath-lete, a loving husband, a proud father, and an exceptional friend to many. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. William R. Brody for his life-time of service to others and for his extraor-dinary contributions to medicine. He has made our country stronger and better, and for this we salute and honor him. f HONORING CATHERINE SPEAR OF ORANGE COUNTY HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Catherine Spear of Orange County, California. A published poet, and leader in her commu- nity, Catherine was recently named executive director of the nonprofit Catholic Charities of Orange County. Catherine is known in her community as an expert fundraiser, raising millions for schools in Orange County. This talent serves her well as executive director, bringing sound business experience to a nonprofit to help Catholic Charities serve the community. The agency's mission is to serve the poor, help immigrants settle into their new commu-nities, and serve food to needy families. The agency is open to persons of other religious faiths, and is separate from the Diocese of Or-ange. Catholic Charities served over 92,000 peo- ple last year. And with the leadership of Cath-erine, I believe that Catholic Charities will be-come even more of an asset to its community. I wish Catherine the best of luck.A TRIBUTE TO BART LINDSEY HON. MIKE ROSS OF ARKANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to Bart Lindsey, a beloved resident of the community of Helena and a distinguished Arkansan, who recently passed away at age 56. Mr. Lindsey's life-long contributions to fam-ily, community, and country will be missed. Bart Lindsey first made a name for himself in the banking business. Always active in the community, and with an early interest in bank-ing, Bart would come home for summer breaks from the University of Arkansas at Fay-etteville to work as a teller for First National Bank of Phillips County. After graduating col-lege and serving in the military, where he earned a Bronze Star and Army Commenda-tion Medal for his service in Vietnam, Bart re-turned home to the community he loved and accepted a position at that same bank, where he would eventually rise to become chief ex-ecutive officer. Bart's life provided an example to us all. He found time to serve as an elder in his church, and to serve as vice chairman of the Board of Directors of the Arkansas-Oklahoma Pres-byterian Foundation. He served his State and community by sitting on the Board of Directors of the American Bankers Association, and by serving as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas, and president of the Helena-West Helena Rotary and Kiwanis clubs. But of all his professional accomplishments, I think the one that demonstrates the true depth of Bart Lindsey's character was the Best Boss Award. For 5 years running, Bart held this title because, as one employee put it, ''All of the employees loved him and he always took time to speak to everyone.'' It is a fan-tastic tribute to Bart's memory that he put peo-ple first, and was able to leave for us a lasting legacy of hard work, service, and compassion. While Bart Lindsey may no longer be with us, his spirit and his legacy live on in the example he set and the many lives he touched. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. VITO FOSSELLA OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, I am not re- corded on rollcall Nos. 146, 147, and 148. I was unavoidably detained and was not present to vote. Had I been present, I would have voted ''yea'' on rollcall Nos. 146, 147, and 148. f RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU- TIONS OF FRED LUND TO THE CITY OF SOMERVILLE, MASSA-CHUSETTS HON. MICHAEL E. CAPUANO OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Fred Lund for his many years of public service. Fred devoted fifty years working for the City of Somerville and his contributions to the community he served are numerous. Fred Lund began working for the City of Somerville in 1953. Over the past fifty years he worked with eleven different mayors, in-cluding myself. In his capacity as Somerville's senior draftsman, Fred has drawn every map for the City of Somerville by hand. He also prepared mayoral citations by hand, creating pieces of art. When the City of Somerville's Office of Housing and Community Development honors Fred on April 30th for his fifty years of service, this will not be the first time his community has honored Fred. The Art Department at the Cummings School was named in his honor. Fred is not only an accomplished public servant, but an avid historian as well. He plans various historic events in the City of Somerville and attends them in his Colonial Soldier uniform. He can be found every New Year's Day on Prospect Hill for the flag raising reenactment, celebrating the first raising of the Colonial Flag. After fifty years, Fred Lund has no intention of stopping his service. He comes into work every day and has no plans to retire. His dedi-cation is remarkable and an inspiration to those around him. Fred Lund deserves our ad-miration and our thanks. f FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED COMMUNITY BANK IN DENTON COUNTY, TEXAS HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the five-year anniversary of the United Community Bank in Denton County, Texas. The United Community Bank opened its doors on May 27, 1998, in Highland Village to pro-vide hometown service to the local community. Coordinated by local area shareholders, the customers in need of exceptional attention to both their individual as well as commercial needs are provided with outstanding service. Not only has United Community Bank been honored with the Reader's Choice Award as the #1 financial institution in Denton County, but it was also selected as the Business of the Month by the Lewisville, Flower Mound and Old Town Business Association during 2002. Today I honor the employees of United Community Bank for their continued hard work in garnering the community support that has significantly contributed to the expansion of the bank's assets as well as to a contented customer base. I also thank the numerous customers of United Community Bank who have shared in creating such success over the last five years. May there be many more years of thriving business in Denton County. f ENSURE TRANSPARENCY IN IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS HON. GERALD D. KLECZKA OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. KLECZKA. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month it came to light that a limited number of VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E826 May 1, 2003 companies were invited to bid on post-war re- construction contracts in Iraq. Most promi-nently, Bechtel, an engineering and construc-tion firm, was awarded an initial contract of $34.6 million that could potentially grow to $680 million over the next year and a half. It is critical that openness and transparency are the hallmarks of the reconstruction process, and for that reason, I am introducing the ''Sun-shine in Iraq Reconstruction Contracting Act.'' Although legal, the bidding process thus far leaves much to be desired. Left unanswered are questions about why open competition was not allowed, and the size and scope of the reconstruction contracts awarded. We should all be able to agree that the U.S. gov- ernment's reconstruction bidding process should be as open to disclosure as possible to ensure that there is no question of political fa-voritism or backroom deal making. After all, these contracts are spending hard-earned tax-payer dollars, and our constituents deserve to know to whom their money is going and why. My legislation, which mirrors a bipartisan Senate measure, simply requires federal agencies that award contracts for Iraqi recon-struction activities to publicly disclose how a non-competitive contract was awarded, and the justification for foregoing an open-bid proc-ess. These details, along with a brief description of the contract's cost and scope, would have to be published in the Federal Register within 30 days of the date the contract was awarded. Any classified information would only be pro-vided to the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Government Reform Committees, as well as whichever committee has jurisdiction over an agency that awards a non-competitive contract. It only makes it more difficult for the United States to hold ourselves up as a model for a future Iraqi government if the contracts the federal government awards are done with little or no competition and without adequate public disclosure. The Iraq reconstruction process should be as open as possible. This is not a partisan issue, but one that concerns the pub-lic interest and American credibility. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this measure. f IN LASTING MEMORY OF RONALD LAGRONE HON. MIKE ROSS OF ARKANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to acknowledge the life and legacy of Ronald LaGrone, a colleague and a friend of mine from Hamburg, Arkansas. I was honored to have known Mr. LaGrone, a man who, in deed and action, distinguished himself as a hus-band, father, businessman, and church and community leader. Ronnie LaGrone owned and ran the LaGrone Drug Store in Hamburg with his brother Fred. For 38 years, he helped to care for the health of his friends and neighbors. Ronnie leaves behind him a proud legacy of service and compassion. He served as Dea-con of the First Baptist Church, as Hamburg City Councilman, and as board member of the Arkansas Pharmacy Association. As a pharmacy owner, I owe him a debt of gratitude for his long service of leadership to our profession. Ronnie set out to improve the lives of others through both his professional and his private life. As a member of a small community, I know what men like Ronnie mean to their neighbors; his service was out of true concern for their livelihood. Ronnie's contributions were recently recog- nized by the Hamburg Chamber of Com-merce, as he was named winner of the Fred LaGrone Lifetime Achievement Award for his role as community pharmacist and as commu-nity leader. Clearly, his community mourned his loss. I know Ronnie's passing was espe-cially difficult for his wife, Patricia, and their three daughters, Terri, Kelli, and Staci, and I have kept all of them in my thoughts and in my prayers. While Ronnie LaGrone may no longer be with us, his spirit and his legacy live on in the example he set and the many lives he touched. f HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVER- SARY OF DOWNINGTOWN LIONS CLUB HON. JIM GERLACH OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. GERLACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Downingtown Lions Club during its 75th anniversary celebration. The Downingtown Lions Club was chartered in January of 1928 and they were sponsored by the Coatesville Lions Club. As we all know, Lions Clubs across the na- tion are made up of active and energetic citi-zens who undertake numerous initiatives and projects to make their communities better places to live and raise families. They are par-ticularly committed to providing help and serv-ice to the blind through a wide variety of sup-port activities. The Downingtown Lions Club hosts four major fundraising events each year\u2014White Cane Day, a golf outing, Good Neighbor Day and a pancake breakfast. These efforts have helped many charitable organiza-tions over the years, including the Chester County Association for the Blind and the Downingtown Area Senior Center. The good works of the Club have also re- sulted in contributions to the Downingtown Area Veterans Memorial Fund, Downingtown Historical Society and various health appeals. And the entire community has benefited from the Club's particular attention to the develop-ment of Kerr Park, including a pavilion, the war memorial, and a water fountain. I am proud to be a member of and rep- resent an organization that has spent so many years in the service of others. I wish to extend my thanks, and the thanks of all those who have been helped by members of the Club. I encourage my colleagues to join me in salut-ing Downingtown Lions Club on reaching this milestone. f IN RECOGNITION OF MR. BURNEY L. ADAMS HON. DONALD M. PAYNE OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to recognize a great man and leader, Mr. Burney L. Adams. A man who has given much to his community, Mr. Adams will be honored this Friday, May 2, 2003 by Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University's National Alumni Association with their 2003 Distinguished Alumni Award. After graduating from Florida A&M, Mr. Adams was signed with the Canadian Profes-sional Football team, the Hamilton Tigers. Upon release, he journeyed to Newark, New Jersey where he took a job with the Newark Board of Education. Mr. Adams made Newark his home, and has been a role model and sig-nificant contributor to the community for the past 40 years. Through his work with the Board of Edu- cation as well as Football Coach at Weequahic High School, Mr. Adams saw the need for assistance of minority students in pursuing higher educational goals. Since 1963 he has been instrumental in obtaining college scholarship assistance for more than 900 youth in both my district as well as neigh-boring areas. As a former teacher and current member of the Education & the Workforce Committee here in the House of Representatives, I appre-ciate the drive and determination of educators such as Mr. Adams. Coach Adams has a dedication and devotion not only to his players on the field but also to the youth of his com-munity. Investing personal time, effort, and money into his students, Coach Adams be-lieves in the spirit of his students to succeed. It is members of our community like Mr. Adams who give so selflessly of their time that enables our youngest citizens to reach their dreams. Mr. Speaker, I know that my colleagues here in the U.S. House of Representatives join me today as I recognize Burney Adams and his well deserved award from Florida A&M University. I wish him the very best on this special occasion and best wishes in all his fu-ture endeavors. f POSTHUMOUS TRIBUTE TO THE LATE FAMU COACH, PROFESSOR ROBERT T. ''BOB'' MUNGEN HON. KENDRICK B. MEEK OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, though it is a sad day for the entire Florida A&M Univer-sity family, find it a great privilege to pay this posthumous tribute to the late Coach and Pro-fessor Robert T. ''Bob'' Mungen. His untimely demise this past Sunday, April 20, 2003, leaves a great void in our historic institution. He is survived by his beloved wife Doretha, his son Robert and daughters Toyka and Sonya Lynn. Coach Mungen's magnificent contributions to the personal and professional growth of countless students and scholar-athletes at FAMU, Edward Waters College and Knoxville College are legendary and now emblaze the halls of academia. To his credit, young men and young women who came under his tute-lage found a caring professor and an indomi-table coach, who was at the same time highly regarded and loved as a confidant and a dot-ing father-figure. Nowhere has his role of advocating played out so genuinely in the lives of his students VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E827 May 1, 2003 than in the indelible mark he left on Barbara Thompson, a former student and colleague of his. Captured recently by the daily paper, The Tallahassee Democrat, she cogently charac-terized him as ''. . . someone I could go and get real good advice from like a daughter . . . As a student, I confided in him. As a col-league, I confided in him.'' A Jacksonville native, ''Bob'' Mungen played under the legendary Coach A.S. Jake Gaither in three choice positions as quarterback, de-fensive back and running back on the FAMU football team. His prowess in playing those positions were so remarkable that Coach Gaither superlatively dubbed him as ''. . . the most versatile athlete I ever coached.'' Professor Mungen served as head football coach at Edward Waters College in Jackson-ville and later on at Knoxville College in Ten-nessee before coming back to FAMU in 1961. Assigned to the physical education depart-ment, he took over the men's tennis program and served in this capacity until his retirement in 1997. In his role as teacher and coach, he gained the confidence of countless parents who saw in him as the educator par excellence. They entrusted him with the future of their children, fully confident that they too would learn from him the tenets of scholarship and the pursuit of academic excellence under the rigors of a no-nonsense discipline and personal responsi-bility. In times of crises crowding his students' quest for learning, his forthright guidance was one that verged on faith in God and con-fidence in one's ability to survive the vicissi-tudes of life. Indeed, our FAMU family is deeply touched and comforted by the undaunted leadership and personal warmth he exuded to those who came to him through the longevity of his serv-ice. This is the genuine legacy he bequeathed to those of us he left behind. In a special way, I am privileged to be a grateful alumnus of a great institution of learning, graced bountifully by his remarkable contributions. f NOMINATION OF JEFFREY SUTTON TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT HON. STEVE ISRAEL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deep concern over the President's nomina-tion of Jeffrey Sutton to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Accord-ing to a recent editorial in the New York Times, Mr. Sutton has pursued an extremist agenda against the employment rights of women with breast cancer as well as victims of domestic violence. Here is what the New York Times reported on April 28th. ''Mr. Sutton argued a landmark disability rights case in the Supreme Court. Patricia Garrett, a nurse at an Alabama state hos-pital, asserted that her employer fired her because she had breast cancer, violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Mr. Sutton argued that the Act did not protect state employees like Ms. Garrett. His states'-rights argument narrowly won over the court, and deprived millions of state workers of legal protection. He also invoked fed- eralism to urge the court to strike down the Violence Against Women Act. It did so, 5 to 4, dismantling federal protection for sexual assault victims.'' Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a moderate and independent Member of this House. I don't believe that extremism on either end of the spectrum can solve the challenges facing our nation. But I am concerned about a pat-tern of judicial nominations by the Administra-tion which would fill our benches with the most ideologically driven nominees at the most ex-treme right of the conservative movement. Nominating an individual who has sought to dismantle federal protections against victims of domestic violence and who has advocated de-nying a woman with breast cancer legal pro-tection is deeply disturbing. I insert ''Another Ideologue for the Courts'' in today's R ECORD, and urge my colleagues to consider it: [From the New York Times, Apr. 28, 2003] ANOTHER IDEOLOGUE FOR THE COURTS It seems likely that Jeffrey Sutton, a nominee to the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, will be confirmed by the Senate this week. But it is important to recognize why he was se-lected, and how he fits the Bush administra-tion's plan for an ideological takeover of the courts. Whichever way the Senate votes on him, it must insist that the administration start selecting judges who do not come with a far-right agenda. There is no shortage of worthy judicial nominees. Federal courts are filled with dis-trict court judges, Republicans and Demo-crats, who have shown evenhandedness and professionalism, and many would make fine appeals court judges. State courts are over-flowing with judges and lawyers known for their excellence, not their politics. The Bush administration, however, has sought nominees whose main qualification is a commitment to far-right ideology. Mr. Sutton is the latest example. He is an activ-ist for ''federalism,'' a euphemism for a rigid states'-rights legal philosophy. Although fed-eralism commands a narrow majority on the Supreme Court, advocates like Mr. Sutton are taking the law in a disturbing direction, depriving minorities, women and the dis-abled of important rights. Mr. Sutton argued a landmark disability rights case in the Supreme Court. Patricia Garrett, a nurse at an Alabama state hos-pital, asserted that her employer fired her because she had breast cancer, violating the Americans With Disabilities Act. Mr. Sutton argued that the act did not protect state em-ployees like Ms. Garrett. His states'-rights argument narrowly won over the court, and deprived millions of state workers of legal protection. He also invoked federalism to urge the court to strike down the Violence Against Women Act. It did so, 5 to 4, disman-tling federal protection for sexual assault victims. Mr. Sutton has said that he was only doing his job, and that his concern was building a law practice, not choosing sides. But throughout his career, he has taken on major cases that advance the conservative agenda. He has left little doubt in his public statements that he supports these rulings. At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sutton faced protesters with guide dogs and wheel-chairs, who were upset about his role in roll-ing back disability law. Naturally, they urged the Senate to reject him. But the sen-ators' duty to advise and consent goes be-yond their vote on any particular nominee. They must make it clear that in a nation brimming with legal talent, it is unaccept-able to focus the search for federal judges on a narrow group of ideologues.U.S. GOLD AWARD FOR MEREDITH ELLIS OF GIRL SCOUT TROOP 4043 HON. LANE EVANS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to salute an outstanding young woman who has been honored with the Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award by Girl Scouts of the Mis-sissippi Valley, Inc. in Rock Island, Illinois. She is Meredith Ellis of Girl Scout Troop 4043. She is being honored for earning the high- est achievement award in Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and per-sonal development. The Girl Scout Gold Award can be earned by girls ages 14-17 or in grades 9-12. Girl Scouts of the USA, an organization serving over 2.6 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must fulfill five requirements: earn four interest project patches, earn the Career Ex-ploration Pin, earn the Senior Girl Scout Lead-ership Award, earn the Senior Girl Scout Chal-lenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold project. A plan for fulfilling the require-ments of the award is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close co-operation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer. As a member of the Girl Scouts of the Mis- sissippi Valley, Inc., Meredith began working toward the Girl Scout Gold Award in June 1999. Meredith worked with her partner Maria Witte on painting a wall mural for a local gym-nastics facility. The earning of the Girl Scout Gold Award is a major accomplishment for Meredith and I believe she should receive the public recogni-tion due her for this significant service to her community and her country. f HONORING JUDGE VERNELIS K. ARMSTRONG HON. MARCY KAPTUR OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special constituent, United States District Court Magistrate Judge Vernelis K. Armstrong, on the occasion of her receipt of the Ohio Women's Bar Association's Justice Alice Robie Resnick Award of Distinction. This award is the OWBA's highest award for pro-fessional excellence and is bestowed annually on a deserving attorney who exhibits leader-ship in the areas of advancing the status and interests of women and in improving the legal profession in the state of Ohio. It gives me great pleasure to wish Judge Armstrong my warmest congratulations on this truly special occasion. The Honorable Vernelis K. Armstrong is a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Northern District VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E828 May 1, 2003 of Ohio, assigned to the Western Division in Toledo. She has served as a United States District Court Magistrate since she was ap-pointed to the Federal bench in September of 1994. Judge Armstrong is a 1956 graduate of Wayne State University, and also received her law degree from Wayne State University Law School in 1960. Prior to her appointment as a Federal Magistrate, Judge Armstrong served as an Assistant United States Attorney in To-ledo for fifteen years, primarily handling civil litigation matters. Judge Armstrong has been a member of the Ohio Women's Bar Association since 1993. She is currently a member of the Toledo Bar Association Round Table, the Minorities in the Profession and Federal Court Committees. In the past, she served as Secretary for the Board of Trustees for the Toledo Bar Associa-tion, on the Bankruptcy Committee, as liaison to the Bankruptcy and Minorities in the Legal Profession Committees and on the Pro Bono Advisory Board. Judge Armstrong's past recognitions and awards include receiving the Arabella Mans-field Award by the Toledo Women's Bar Asso-ciation in 1988, the Excellence in Law Award by the Black American Law Students' Associa-tion (BALSA) in 1989 and 1997, the Mile-stones Award by the Young Women's Chris-tian Association in 1997, and in 1999 she was the recipient of the Athena Award by the Chamber of Commerce. The OWBA was initially formed in 1991 and is the only statewide bar association within Ohio solely dedicated toward advancing the interests of women attorneys while encour-aging networking and the creation of a state-wide mentor program for women attorneys. On May 1, 2003, Ohio Supreme Court Jus- tice Alice Robie Resnick will be presenting Judge Armstrong with the Ohio Women's Bar Association's Justice Alice Robie Resnick Award of Distinction at its Annual Meeting in Cleveland, Ohio. It gives me great pleasure to rise today, Mr. Speaker, and join the OWBA in congratulating Magistrate Judge Vernelis Armstrong and wishing her continued success. f TRIBUTE TO MR. CHARLES BOUCHER HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN OF RHODE ISLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Charles Boucher, an excep-tional teacher and role model from Burriville, RI. Mr. Boucher has been named the Rhode Island Teacher of the Year for 2003. As an Applied Science and Technology teacher at Burriville High School, he has shown exem-plary commitment to making education engag-ing and exciting. Under his tutelage, Mr. Bou-cher's students have received more than 30 state and national awards and his Bio Tech-nology class was featured on a Discovery Channel program. His work and creativity have helped hundreds of student transition from school to the working world. Mr. Speaker, I find it heartening that there are educators in this country who devote so much time and effort to shaping the minds of our young people. I hope you and our col- leagues will join me in recognizing Mr. Charles Boucher for his dedication to education and vocational training. f HONORING MR. DAVID CHUBB FOR HIS CAREER AND SERVICE HON. TOM DAVIS OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to honor Mr. David Chubb upon the conclusion of his ca-reer in education as an Elementary School Principal. Throughout his career in education, David has demonstrated a strong aptitude for and commitment to the field of school adminis-tration. The conclusion of the 2002-2003 school year sees David retiring from his position as the Camelot Elementary School Principal after working as an educator in Fairfax County for more than twenty years. Always held in high regard by his colleagues, he has served as Principal at Fairhill Elementary School and Camelot Elementary School. In addition, David served as Assistant Principal at Newington Forest Elementary School and Bailey's Ele-mentary School. Of course, he first logged many an hour in the classroom. In fact, he al-most broke the two-decade mark as a teacher, spending 18 years at the front of the class. In his 15 years as Assistant Principal and Principal, David developed into a consummate administrator. His relationship with his staff is excellent, fostered by an open-door policy and consistent fair treatment. He is also known for his skill in finances, which will certainly be missed by the Fairfax Association of Elemen-tary School Principals. Above all, David commits himself to the school with all of his energy. As his staff warmly noted, ''the school is like his home.'' At Camelot, he knows the names of every single student\u2014all 500 of them! He personally greets the buses as they arrive at school every morn-ing and says goodbye to them at night, there-by achieving a remarkable rapport with the students. David pitches in with any project in need of help, even the smallest jobs that are someone else's responsibility: he's been known to help the custodians with cleaning or painting. He will be greatly missed by his col-leagues at Camelot Elementary and warmly remembered by all who were lucky enough to encounter him. Mr. Speaker, in closing, it gives me great pleasure to extend my warmest congratula-tions to David Chubb for his continuing com-mitment to making a difference in children's lives through education. From his very first students, to the staff who speak so warmly of their supervisor, everyone touched by David Chubb's energy and commitment recalls him fondly and has benefited from his help. Fairfax County is grateful for his service and can only hope that our education system will continue to attract teachers and principals of his caliber. I call upon all my colleagues to join me in ap-plauding David Chubb's remarkable career.PETRI-KIND TEACHER VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE ACT OF 2003 HON. THOMAS E. PETRI OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, today with my col- league from Wisconsin, R ONKIND, I am intro- ducing the Teacher Voluntary Early Retire-ment Incentive Act. It is a common practice across the country for school districts to provide senior employ-ees an opportunity or incentive to voluntarily retire before the age at which they could re-ceive Medicare coverage and full retirement benefits from a state or municipal retirement system. These early retirement incentive plans, ERIPs, are truly a win-win proposition for school districts and employees. School dis-tricts are able to lower overall payroll costs and pass the savings on to early retirees in the form of greater retirement options and supplemental benefits. In a profession where many experience ''burnout'' before full retire-ment age, ERIPs are a highly valued option among teachers, retirees, and school boards. Despite the popularity and mutual benefits of these plans, school districts in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa over the past several years have been threatened with age discrimi-nation charges by the Equal Opportunity Em-ployment Commission for their voluntary early retirement incentive plans, and many school districts in other states may be at risk for simi-lar action. We do not believe that it was the intent of Congress that voluntary benefits, ne-gotiated between unions and employers and offered to all employees who reach a certain age, should come under the definition of age discrimination. The Petri-Kind Teacher Vol-untary Early Retirement Incentive Act of 2003 would clarify the Congress' intent by carving out an exemption in federal age discrimination law for voluntary early retirement plans offered to elementary and secondary school teachers, similar to the exemption that already exists for teachers in colleges and universities. This bill will go a long way in clearing up the legal uncertainty surrounding voluntary ERIPs, thus making available greater retirement op-tions for teachers and giving school districts more flexibility in managing their workforce. f HONORING ALMA MARTINEZ AND HER THIRD-GRADE CLASS FROM FENLEY-FLANDERS ELEMEN-TARY SCHOOL HON. CIRO D. RODRIGUEZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, educators from Fenley-Flanders Elementary, which is lo-cated in my Congressional district, have been preparing their third grade classes for the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test. The Express News from San An-tonio followed third grade teacher Alma Mar-tinez and her eleven students as they pre-pared for the test, which they took on March 4, 2003. During Spring Break the results of the test came back, and an overwhelming majority VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, Remarks E829 May 1, 2003 of Ms. Martinez's class passed the test, which allows them to advance onto fourth grade. Starting this year, third graders will be among the 2 million elementary, middle and high school students taking a TAKS test. Stu-dents who do not pass the exam will have two more opportunities to pass the TAKS test. I would personally like to congratulate Ms. Martinez and her third grade class on an out-standing job in the preparing for and taking the TAKS test and their advancement onto the fourth grade next year. Schools are a reflection of our community and it takes everyone working together to make them quality institutions. The administra-tion, teachers, staff, students and their families should be commended for their hard work and dedication in preparing the children of Fenley-Flanders Elementary for their performance on the TAKS tests. f CONGRATULATING UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE ON 175TH ANNIVERSARY HON. JOHN B. LARSON OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I am an original co-sponsor of H. Con. Res. 156, honoring the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police as they celebrate the 175th an-niversary of the police force. Congress established the Capitol Police dur- ing the administration of John Quincy Adams. Ponder how different the world was then, when the U.S. Congress was a young and largely untested deliberative body located in a relatively isolated town that was as much wil-derness as it was settled territory. In the last 175 years, the world has changed immeasurably, and so has the work of the Capitol Police. Today the U.S. Capitol\u2014which is simulta- neously a national shrine, tourist attraction, and working office building\u2014imposes extraor-dinary security requirements. For example, more than three million tour- ists visited the Capitol complex in 2000. At the same time, the Capitol hosted more than 1,200 American and foreign dignitaries and 1,000 special events, and was the site of nearly 500 scheduled demonstrations. In addi-tion to lawmakers and their staffs, a sizable number of journalists, concerned citizens, lob-byists, and service personnel also work within the Capitol complex. To address these security requirements while keeping Congress as open and acces-sible as the Framers of the Constitution in-tended, the mission of the Capitol Police has expanded to provide the Congressional com-munity and visitors with the highest possible quality of a full range of police services. These services are provided through the use of a va-riety of specialty support units and a network of foot patrols, vehicular patrols, and fixed posts. In modern times, the Capitol Police have also had to cope with emergencies, bombings and shootings, including the tragic 1998 mur-ders of Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, that remain so painfully fresh in our memories. After that tragic event, Congress properly heightened Capitol security, adopting a pos-ture that requires considerable additional man- power. Recent events in the Middle East and elsewhere have obviously underscored the need for more officers and greater security. Fortunately, additional resources have been provided. Congress has appropriated money to fund all the additional officers the Capitol Police can hire and train. Supplemental funds have also been provided to address needs identified since September 11, 2001. Today, the Capitol Police face evolving threats from those who, for whatever reason, wish our country and our democracy harm. What was unthinkable only 18 months ago, has been done. We must remain vigilant and prepared as we work to rid the world of the scourge of terrorism and preserve and expand the promise of peace and democracy. We will continue to rely on the Capitol Po- lice as the first line of defense for the People's House and all who work and visit here. The men and women of the Capitol Police meet their challenges with courage and a level of professionalism not exceeded anywhere. Since the dastardly attacks of September 11, and again after the heightened security level of the past few months, Capitol Police officers, under the able leadership of Chief Terrance Gainer, have worked long hours under ad-verse conditions. These men and women clearly represent the best that America has to offer. I want to express my personal thanks for a job well done and wish the United States Cap-itol Police a sincere and happy 175th anniver-sary. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the H. Con. Res. 156. f COMMENDING THE CENTER FOR RURAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENT FOR WEST VIRGINIA HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO OF WEST VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend an exceptional organization in West Virginia on its receipt of a prestigious certifi-cation of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Center for Rural Health Development has been working since 1994 to make sure that West Virginians in rural communities have access to the highest standards of health care services. Its dedicated Board of Directors and professional staff have worked effectively to bring essential infrastructure, equipment, tech-nical assistance, and skilled health care pro-viders of all types to rural counties in our be-loved State. Ever mindful of the fact that a community's economic health is linked to the quality of its health care delivery system, the center has played a vital role in the growth and develop-ment of many rural and underserved areas, opening up opportunities for jobs, both in health care fields and in new businesses at-tracted to the high quality of life in West Vir-ginia. Its loan partners in the private sector and sponsors, including the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, the Robert Wood John-son Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agri-culture, Appalachian Regional Commission and the State of West Virginia, have long rec- ognized the financial expertise of the Center for Rural Health Development. It is now my pleasure to note that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, through its Com-munity Development Financial Institutions Fund, has certified the Center for Rural Health Development as a ''Community Development Financial Institution''. The CDFI designation is a testament to high standards of practice and exceptional results, and serves as a signal to financial markets and West Virginia commu-nities that the confidence they place in the Center for Rural Health Development is well deserved. I ask that my colleagues join me in com- mending the Center for Rural Health Develop-ment and its Director, Ms. Sharon Lansdale, on its CDFI certification, and in expressing our appreciation for the vital role they have played in the lives of so many West Virginians. f PROCLAMATION HON. DANNY K. DAVIS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on Satur- day, May 3, 2003, the Chicago ''DODO'' Chapter of Tuskegee Airmen Incorporated, in concert with Black Pilots of America will honor three of aviation's pioneer women of color, Bessie Coleman, Willa Beatrice Brown and Janet Harmon; Bessie Coleman journeyed to France in 1920 to enter the field of aviation, planning to return to America to open an aviation program for African Americans; and Bessie Coleman died on April 30, 1926, while preparing for an air show to benefit the Negro Welfare League of Jacksonville, Florida; In 1939, Willa B.

VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E830 May 1, 2003 ENERGY POLICY HON. TOM UDALL OF NEW MEXICO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2003. We should be using this opportunity today to pass an effec-tive and balanced energy bill that will help conserve our nation's resources and lessen our dependence on energy sources that are detrimental to our environment and even our national security. Instead, the bill being de-bated today harms the environment, threatens public health, endangers wildlife, and hurts consumers. I believe a balanced national energy policy would be one that helps consumers by in-creasing energy production and reducing en-ergy demand. Further, I feel that America's current and future energy needs should be met through a balanced approach that sup-ports our fundamental environmental values. We must focus on becoming more energy effi-cient, investing in innovative technologies, and ensuring that energy markets are fair and competitive. We must also focus on reducing America's dependence on international oil suppliers and developing clean and renewable energy sources. Unfortunately, this bill accom-plishes none of these goals. Before consideration of the bill, I testified before the Rules Committee and requested that I be allowed to offer three amendments. The first would have required retail electricity suppliers to obtain 15% of their power produc-tion from a portfolio of renewable energy re-sources by 2020 and within 5 years add an additional 5%. This would allow us to enhance our nation's energy independence and na-tional security while lowering prices for con-sumers by mitigating the effects of energy shortages and natural gas spikes. In addition, I believe including a Renewable Portfolio Standard in our nation's energy policy would create jobs and expand economic develop-ment, while simultaneously reducing air pollu-tion and the threat of global warming. The second amendment I hoped to bring to the floor was in support of the thousands of farmers, ranchers and homeowners across the west that are directly impacted by oil, gas and coal bed methane development activities on their lands. This amendment would have re-quired surface use agreements between land-owners and the oil and gas industry prior to any development of subsurface mineral rights owned by the federal government. Many farm-ers and ranchers own split estate interests, meaning that they own the surface resources and the federal government owns the sub-surface mineral rights that it leases to the oil and gas industry. Currently, it is not required that the oil and gas companies repair and clean up a project site during or after its com-pletion. Instead, the surface use agreements are only voluntary. Oftentimes as a result, many surface owners suffer loss of income, impairment of water quality, erosion and con-tamination of soil, harm to livestock and wild-life species, and they have no recourse be-cause they did not have surface use agree-ments with the oil and gas companies. My amendment would have given these land-owners the legal recourse they deserve. Unfortunately, neither of these amendments was accepted by the Rules Committee. How-ever, I was able to offer before the full House an important amendment that would strike an unnecessary and potentially dangerous sub-sidy included in H.R. 6 pertaining to uranium in situ leach mining. As written, the subsidy al-lots $30 million to the domestic uranium indus-try. The in situ leach mining procedure could cause radioactive uranium and other toxic chemicals to leach into groundwater. The area where this mining could potentially be under-taken in my district is near a high-quality aqui- fer, which is the sole source of scarce drinking water for over 10,000 people of the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. This subsidy com-pounds past disasters by promoting mining that could have dangerous health and environ-mental implications. Although my amendment was defeated, the roll call made it clear that there is bipartisan backing for striking this un-fair and unwise subsidy. As this bill is nego-tiated in conference, I will continue to work to protect my constituents in New Mexico who have suffered so much from uranium related activities near their homes. As we move into the future, we must act re- sponsibly in ways that take into account the changing landscape of the world's energy situ-ation instead of exacerbating the already dire energy dependence problem our nation faces. Conservation\u2014getting the maximum value out of every bit of energy we use\u2014must become a central feature of our nation's energy philos-ophy. We praise those who maximize the value of every dollar they spend; we should do the same with our energy. America should prize efficient and productive use of all our im-portant resources, including energy. Conserva-tion is real, achievable, and crucial. Again, in those areas, this energy bill falls short. H.R. 6 weakens consumers protections, allows companies to contaminate water, allots over $18 billion in unnecessary subsidies to big oil and gas corporations, and takes one more step toward drilling in the untouched wil-derness of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). This will not enhance conservation or provide for the security of the energy supply for the American people as proponents of this bill claim. What it will do is reward the energy companies and leave the responsibility of keeping secure the nation's energy supply to yet another generation. It is my hope that a conference committee will help produce a more sound compromise energy bill that does not threaten the future of either the environment or the country's energy needs. I will continue to work to see that our nation implements an energy plan that is bal-anced and addresses environmental concerns in a way that also provides for our continued economic success. f A TRIBUTE TO MELISSA ELLIS BARTLETT HON. RICHARD BURR OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. BURR of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to a fellow North Carolinian and an outstanding member of our community, Melissa Ellis Bartlett. I com-mend her for her dedication to children and education. Melissa has been a distinguished teacher for the past 18 years, sharing her gift of teach-ing both nationally and internationally. For the past four years, Melissa has taught at Iredell-Statesville Schools, where she is a cherished language arts educator. Previously, Melissa taught social studies and worked with at-risk students in central North Carolina. She also taught English in Cairo, Egypt, and remedial reading to students in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Melissa's commitment to her students and her excellence in the classroom has brought her to Washington today to be honored by President George W. Bush at the National Teachers of the Year ceremony. Melissa rep-resents the finest of teaching professionals na-tionwide, and I am proud of all that she has accomplished. Teachers who share Melissa's dedication are a true treasure. I ask my colleagues and fellow North Caro- linians to join me in extending our congratula-tions and heartfelt thanks to Melissa Bartlett for her years of selfless service. May she con-tinue to inspire and enlighten students for many years to come. f INTRODUCTION OF THE MILITARY PAY COMPATIBILITY ACT OF 2003 HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Military Pay Compat-ibility Act of 2003. Joining me is my dear friend and colleague Representative I KESKEL- TON, the ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee. He is a man of great wis-dom and preeminence with respect to all things military and I appreciate his guidance and support. In short, this legislation will ensure that mili- tary pay raises keep pace with civilian pay growth. Please allow me to explain why this is im- portant. Military pay tables were overhauled in 1971, with the advent of the all-volunteer force, and basic pay was set to provide rea-sonable pay comparability with private sector pay for civilian workers with similar skills, edu-cation and experience. But military raises were capped for budg- etary reasons during the 1970's, and serious retention and readiness shortfalls followed. These problems were addressed with double-digit raises in 1981 and 1982, after which it was generally acknowledged that military pay was reasonably comparable with private sec-tor pay. Despite this hard-learned lesson, the ex- tended retention rebound of the 1980's, cou-pled with rising budget deficits, led multiple Administrations and Congress to continue cap-ping military raises below private sector pay growth in 12 of the next 16 years. In 1999, the cumulative military pay raise shortfall since 1982 had reached 13.5 per-cent\u2014predictably accompanied by a new re-tention and readiness crisis. Congress responded by enacting provisions in the FY 2000 Defense Authorization Act specifying that, for years 2000 through 2006, each year's military pay raise is to exceed the civilian pay growth, as measured by the Bu-reau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E831 May 1, 2003 Index, or ECI, by 12percent per year. The 2001, 2002 and 2003 pay raises actually ex-ceeded this standard and cut the gap from 13.5 percent to 6.4 percent. In May 2002, the Department of Defense re- leased its Ninth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC), which acknowledged that current pay structure lags considerably behind pay for civilians of comparable age and education. And, the Department of Defense has been supportive of increased raises to re-store a new comparability standard. In summary, the capping of military pay raises below private sector pay growth for ex-tended periods during the past 30 years has led to significant retention problems among second-term and career members of the Armed Forces. Such retention problems cost the United States more in terms of lost military experi-ence, decreased readiness, and increased training costs than maintaining the principle of pay comparability. The remaining so-called pay comparability gap should be eliminated as quickly as pos-sible, and military pay increases must sustain full comparability with increases in the Em-ployment Cost Index. My bill would ensure that military pay raises never again lag civilian pay raises. Existing authority to close the pay gap expires in 2006. This legislation adds to that authority by speci-fying that military pay raises must be at least at the level of civilian wage growth beginning in 2007. I have been asked if I am doing this be- cause of our troops returning from the Middle East and the war in Iraq. The answer is no and yes. No because this legislation builds on the legislation I offered in the 107th Congress and addresses the same problem of the pay gap with a different approach. This issue is not new to me. The answer is also yes because I can think of no better way to show continued support for our troops than to send them a clear signal that the Congress and the nation value their service and sacrifice, both today and in the fu-ture. This measure has the full endorsement of the Fleet Reserve Association and the Military Coalition, and I have attached their letter of endorsement. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to co- sponsor this important legislation and work to ensure its quick passage. Nearly identical leg-islation was introduced in the Senate yester-day. Working together with our Senate col-leagues, I urge my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee to include this leg-islation as a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. THEMILITARY COALITION , Alexandria, VA, April 30, 2003. Hon. S USAN A. D AVIS, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D EARREPRESENTATIVE DAVIS: The Military Coalition (TMC), a consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans' organizations representing more than five and one half million current and former members of the seven uniformed services, plus their families and survivors, strongly supports legislation you are preparing to in-troduce that would amend title 37, United States Code, concerning future military pay raises and their comparison with private sec-tor pay growth. Under the provisions of your proposal, increases in pay for members of the uniformed services would match the growth in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). This is a priority issue, and the Coalition strongly supports the introduction of such legislation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) already recommended that fu-ture military pay raises be based on the Con-sumer Price Index (CPI). If that were adopt-ed, military personnel would not receive comparable pay increases with those in the private sector, thus halting progress in clos-ing the pay gap between military and civil-ian pay levels. In addition, the Administra-tions budget request would cap FY2004 pay increases for NOAA and PHS personnel at the CPI level. The ECI measures private-sector wage in- creases, while the CPI is an inflation gauge to preserve the purchasing power of retired pay, veterans' benefits and other programs. Retaining the ECI will ensure that pay in-creases for all seven of the uniformed serv-ices mirror those in the civilian economy. This is important to maintaining adequate recruiting and retention within the services and subsequently to our Nation's military readiness. The Coalition appreciates your leadership on this issue and will work toward the enact-ment of this legislation into law. Sincerely, T HEMILITARY COALITION . f TRIBUTE TO AMANDA BEAVER AND ASHLEY WATSON HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to recognize Amanda Beaver and Ashley Watson of Grand Junction, Colorado. Amanda and Ashley are making a difference in their community and touching the lives of many of their neighbors in the Grand Valley, and today I would like to honor their accomplishments before this body of Con-gress and this nation. Amanda and Ashley are fourteen-year-old students at Grand Mesa Middle School. This past year, they planned a fundraiser, ''Answer to Cancer,'' to honor families who have been touched by cancer and to support the Amer-ican Cancer Society. The girls, who both have grandparents with cancer, have spent nearly a year planning the event, which features danc-ing, games, and refreshments. They have seen outstanding support from the local com-munity, receiving donations from local busi-nesses and numerous individuals. Mr. Speaker, Amanda Beaver and Ashley Watson have shown extraordinary leadership as young citizens of Grand Junction. Their vol-unteer efforts are offering hope to an impor-tant segment of the community and creating greater awareness of cancer among their peers as well as their elders. These two tal-ented and determined young women clearly have great things ahead of them, and it is my great honor to recognize their hard work be-fore this body of Congress and this nation today. I wish them all the best in the future.HONORING THOMAS RONAYNE HON. STEVE ISRAEL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Thomas Ronayne, a decorated vet-eran and Commander of the Huntington Sta-tion Veterans of Foreign Wars. After entering the United States Navy in January of 1980, Tom served aboard the USS Vogelgesang and the USS Vreeland. In Sep-tember of 1983, he was Honorably Discharged from the Navy. For his service, Tom was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, two Navy Battle ''E'' ribbons, Navy Sea Service Deploy-ment Ribbon, the Navy Pistol Expert Ribbon, one Atlantic Fleet Command ''Golden Grammy Awards'' for Gram Analysis Excellence and two ''Silver Grammy'' Awards for Gram Anal-ysis Excellence. Tom became a member of Veterans of For- eign Wars of the United States in 1996, joined Post #1469 in Huntington Station in 1998 and held various offices before being elected Com-mander in 2000. He still serves as Com-mander of the Huntington Station VFW, Na-than Hale Post 1469, the oldest VFW Post on Long Island and largest in downstate New York. Tom also participated significantly in the op- erations and efforts at Ground Zero. He was injured as a result of the attacks on the World Trade Center and remained on scene for over seven months, participating in the recovery, clean-up and rebuilding efforts. Tom still visits regularly with the workers at Ground Zero. Tom has three sons and lives in Greenlawn, NY with his wife Linda. I commend Tom Ronayne for his dedicated service to our country during his time in the Navy and in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center, and for his hard work on behalf of vet-erans on Long Island. f TRIBUTE TO FRED FLOWER HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with a sol- emn heart that I take this opportunity and pay tribute to an icon of the Montrose, Colorado community who recently passed away. Leo Fred Flower, Jr. died at the age of 84 and as his family and friends mourn his loss, I think it is appropriate that we remember Fred for his many contributions throughout his life. Fred was a longtime civic and business leader in Montrose whose affiliations ranged from the Western Slope Livestock Commission to the Montrose Industrial Development Board. He graduated from Montrose High School in 1934 and began working at a grocery store, later driving a truck for the Montrose Flour Milling Co. and pursuing further education. Eventually Fred began doing office work for the flour mill and for a local ranch and live-stock business, which he would later pur-chase. In 1940 Fred began a career in banking, in- terrupted by his service in the Army from 1942 VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E832 May 1, 2003 to 1946. He eventually became president of Montrose National Bank and Montrose Sav-ings and Loan, and also spent a few years as a rancher. In 1968 he bought the family busi-ness, Flower Motor Company, which his son now owns. Fred was a dedicated community leader and played an integral role in establishing Montrose Memorial Hospital. He established the first Kiwanis Club in Montrose, and served on the local school board and on the board of the Colorado Western College. He gave his time and efforts to innumerable community or-ganizations, and was most recently involved in Montrose's senior center. Mr. Speaker it is with profound sadness that we remember the life and memory of Fred Flower who so deeply touched the Montrose community. As family and friends mourn his passing, I would like to recognize the wonder-ful life Charlie lived. He will be missed. f HONORING LIEUTENANT COMMANDER GLENN SULMASY HON. ROB SIMMONS OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. SIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a member of my staff for his tireless ef-forts on behalf of the good people of Connecti-cut's Second Congressional District. Lieuten-ant Commander Glenn Sulmasy will soon con-clude his service in my Norwich, Connecticut office and become a distinguished teacher of International Law at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Since my term started, Glen has been a liai- son in my office to the Coast Guard Academy. As the vice-chairman of the Coast Guard Sub-committee, I came to rely on this relationship. What's more, I rely on his input and his per-spective\u2014built from years of expertise and driven by his faith in our country,. Glenn's commitment to me and to my con- gressional office should be no surprise\u2014he has long had a passion for public service. A 1988 graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Acad-emy and 1997 graduate of the University of Baltimore School of Law, Glenn has given 15 years of service as a ''coastie'' in the U.S. Coast Guard\u2014with time spent in the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm, and more recently as a teacher of law at the Coast Guard Acad-emy. Using his experience to enhance that of our other cadets, Glenn demonstrates an admi-rable loyalty to his values and the Coast Guard tradition. He has also taught at the Roger William School of Law in Bristol, Rhode Island and serves on the Board of Directors of the Center for International and Comparative Law, the National Coast Guard Museum Asso-ciation, the New London Parks Conservancy, and the Connecticut Anti-Terrorism Task Force. Mr. Speaker, Glenn Sulmasy lives by the daily commitment of the Coast Guard's core values of honor, respect and devotion to duty. And while I will miss Glenn's presence in my Connecticut office, I wish him well and feel confident that I can still count on him. On behalf of the rest of my staff, I wish to express our affection and gratitude to Lieuten-ant Commander Glen Sulmasy for his dedi-cated work. Glenn, thank you for your service to me, best wishes and Semper Paratus. f HONORING DREAM WEAVERS OF SOUTHERN COLORADO HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an out-standing community organization in my district, Dream Weavers of Southern Colorado. For twenty-one years, Dream Weavers has been working hard to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening illnesses and today I would like to honor their efforts before this body of Congress and this nation. Dream Weavers is an inspirational all-volun- teer organization founded in 1982. Over the last twenty years Dream Weavers has fulfilled the dreams of nearly 230 children, organizing vacations at Disney World, fishing trips and family reunions. Sometimes a child simply wishes for a computer, which the organization is only happy to provide. Dream Weavers also hosts frequent events and parties for its wish recipients, providing critical and continuing support for children and their families. To achieve its goals, Dream Weavers depends on community support from local corporations and individuals as well as its annual Bowl-A-Thon fundraiser. Mr. Speaker, Dream Weavers of Pueblo is an inspirational organization that truly makes a difference in the lives of children struggling with life-threatening diseases. By focusing on family involvement, Dream Weavers provides wonderful opportunities and memories for chil-dren, parents and siblings, and I am honored to have such a compassionate program serv-ing the citizens of my district. f 10 YEARS OF REMEMBRANCE: THE UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST ME-MORIAL MUSEUM HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today I want to pay special tribute on the 10th anniversary of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. During the past decade, the institution and its dedicated staff members have worked tirelessly to promote remem-brance of the Holocaust and to draw lessons for the future from this very dark chapter of mankind's recent history. When the Museum was dedicated and formally opened in late April 1993, this event culminated over 10 years of preparation that started in 1980 with the chartering of the institution by a unani-mous Act of Congress. Recognizing the work of the Museum this week is very fitting, as it is the week of Holocaust Remembrance Day, a time for honoring the millions of Jews who died almost 60 years ago under Nazi tyranny. As set forth in its mission statement, the Holocaust Memorial Museum has become America's national institution for the docu-mentation, study, and interpretation of Holo-caust history, and is this country's memorial to the millions of people murdered during the Holocaust. The Museum and its International Archives Project focuses on all individuals who suffered during the Holocaust, in addition to the six million executed Jews, the horrific Nazi treatment of millions of Roma, disabled, reli-gious and political prisoners, and prisoners of war. The Museum plays a critical role in ad-vancing and disseminating information, docu-menting the historicity of the Holocaust, while also preserving the memory of individuals who suffered. While insuring that the lessons of the past will not be forgotten, the Museum has actively and creatively developed ways to work to-wards a better future. The institution's dedica-tion to dealing with the horrors of genocide, whether in Nazi Germany, Bosnia, Rwanda or Cambodia is a critical part of the effort to mo-bilize international action against this plague on all humanity. The Committee on Con-science plays a particularly significant role in bringing timely attention to acts of genocide or related crimes against humanity. The Museum has rightfully become one of Washington's most revered attractions. The hundreds of thousands of visitors who have toured the Museum since its opening have left with an unforgettable experience and the op-portunity to reflect on the deep moral ques-tions stemming from the tragedy of the Holo-caust. The Museum's research center has served as a critical resource for scholars who try to help us better understand the lessons of this terrible chapter of human history. The cre-ation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has also encouraged other countries to move to establish comparable institutions including, most significantly, in Berlin, Ger-many. The U.S. Helsinki Commission, which I co- chair, has worked with the Museum on several occasions, from pushing for the release of documents from the Romani concentration camp in Lety, Czech Republic, to urging Ro-mania to give greater meaning to its stated commitment of rejecting anti-Semitism by re-moving Antonescu statues from public lands. In response to the alarming spike of anti-Se-mitic incidents found last summer in Europe, myself and other Members of the Commission have been very active in urging governments and elected officials to denounce the violence and ensure their laws are enabled to pros-ecute the perpetrators. In support of this effort, I have introduced H. Con. Res. 49, urging, among other things, European states to ''pro- mote the creation of educational efforts throughout the region encompassing the par-ticipating States of the OSCE to counter anti-Semitic stereotypes and attitudes among younger people, increase Holocaust aware-ness programs, and help identify the nec-essary resources to accomplish this goal.'' It is my hope that other countries will copy the unique and effective model of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Congress has designated April 27th to May 4th as ''Days of Remembrance,'' when our na-tion will commemorate again the victims of the Holocaust. May we use this time of reflection that will reinforce our common determination to learn from history's harsh lessons. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E833 May 1, 2003 TRIBUTE TO TOM SHARP HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Tom Sharp, a helicopter pilot from Telluride, Colorado and thank him for the contributions he has made to local search and rescue efforts. Tom recently risked his life and his helicopter to save two avalanche victims trapped on a steep slope near Telluride Ski Area, and today I would like to honor his service before this body of Con-gress and this nation. Tom has been a pilot with Helitrax, a heli- ski guide service, for over twelve years. When he was called to assist in the rescue of two skiers caught in an avalanche, he immediately responded along with two Helitrax guides, braving a dangerous landing near one of the injured skiers before picking up more rescuers and dropping off more medical supplies. Then Tom made a daring attempt to reach the other skier, flying close to dangerous jagged rock in spite of unpredictable afternoon winds. Though he was unsuccessful, Tom and his fel-low rescuers dropped supplies to the stranded skier that allowed him to climb out of the cou-loir and communicate with rescuers. Mr. Speaker, pilots with the expertise and skill of Tom Sharp are crucial to successful search and rescue operations, and it is a great privilege to honor Tom here today. His years of experience and his willingness to take risks are a tremendous asset to the citizens of Tel-luride and to all of Colorado. f TRIBUTE TO MR. MISHLER HON. BILL SHUSTER OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, on May 4, 2003 the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, in conjunction with the Altoona Area School District and the Blair County Arts Foundation, will be dedicating a long-deserved historical marker commemorating Isaac Charles Mishler, the original owner of the Mishler Theater, located in downtown Altoona, Pennsylvania. I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Mishler for his vision of bringing the arts to his fellow citi-zens. The theater and the community's dedi-cation to the arts have stood the test of time. Indeed, since its opening in 1906, the Mishler Theater has hosted the cream of the entertain-ment crop for almost 100 years. The hallowed halls of the Mishler have seen the likes of John Drew, the Barrymores, Hou-dini, the Zeigfeld Follies, Bernadette Peters and George Burns. With over $1.3 million in improvements over the years, the Mishler con-tinues to provide the community with top-notch entertainment today. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have had the opportunity today to recognize the efforts of the Altoona community and the numerous or-ganizations that have worked together to pre-serve the Mishler Theater. Their efforts are a fitting tribute to Isaac Mishler's vision of a the-ater that serves as a center of arts and enter-tainment for the entire community.TRIBUTE TO REV. HOLMES ROLSTON III HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to inform this body of a brilliant man from my home state. The Reverend Holmes Rolston III, a philos- ophy professor at Colorado State University, is the winner of this year's Templeton Prize. The award recognizes research and discoveries that advances the understanding of God and spiritual realities. In winning this prestigious award, Reverend Rolston joins such lumi-naries as Mother Teresa, Billy Graham, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Holmes grew up poor in rural Virginia in a home without running water or electricity. From that humble beginning, he rose to be-come what many consider the father of envi-ronmental ethics. Along the way he has lec-tured on all seven continents, written books that are used as texts at more than 150 uni-versities, and co-founded the leading journal in his field, ''Environmental Ethics.'' Even though he has degrees in physics, theology, and philosophy, he still\u2014at the age of 70\u2014sits in on science classes. Learning is so important to this professor that he plans to donate his prize, which is worth more than $1 million, to establish an endowed chair in science and religion at his alma mater. Mr. Speaker, Reverend Holmes has distin- guished himself as a professor, theologian, ethicist, environmentalist and philanthropist. He is not only a model citizen, but also an in-spiration to his students, peers, and the com-munity. It is an honor and a privilege to inform this body of his achievements. Congratulations on winning the Templeton Prize, Reverend Holmes, and best of luck with your future en-deavors. f CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1559, EMERGENCY WARTIME SUPPLE-MENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2003 SPEECH OF HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Saturday, April 12, 2003 Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1559, the Emergency Wartime Supplemental bill. I support this bill to honor our troops and provide relief to Americans suf-fering through these difficult economic times. In this time of war and economic crisis, we do not need massive tax cuts. I applaud my Democratic colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their tireless efforts to reach a Budget Resolution that achieves mutual rec-onciliation, supports our military, and helps to stabilize the economy in this time of economic crisis. We need mutual reconciliation right now, not disagreement. I applaud the supplemental funds allocated for homeland security. I applaud the 26-week provision designed to help provide relief to the unemployed. Since the tragic events of Sep-tember 11, 2001, I have fought on this floor for the employees of the airline industry. I believe this bill goes a long way to providing the em-ployees of the airline industry economic relief. My Democratic colleagues on Appropria- tions did a wonderful job reducing many of the Administration's inflated fund requests. We lowered the President's request for a ''flexi-bility fund'' from $59.9 billion to $15.7 billion. We reduced the alien nations fund from $50 million to $25 million. These fund reductions, and the many others included in the supple-mental will provide relief to every American. The original emergency supplemental was illogical legislation. Never before have I seen such an outrageous departure from estab-lished Congressional procedure. The Senate approved an emergency supplemental bill for $350 billion. Instead of following the wisdom of the Senate, the House proposes an emer-gency supplemental bill for $550 billion. Never before have I seen Congress make such a frivolous budget decision. I congratulate the hard work of the Appropri- ators. However, I would have preferred to see funds, such as a portion of the $2.4 billion used for the reconstruction of Iraq, used to help domestically. I would like to see funds al-located to reach out to our small and minority-owned businesses, and not to large conglom-erates and multi-national corporations. I am on my way to visit Tommy Franks, and the many brilliant military strategists at Central Command. Plus, I recently visited several of the valiant soldiers who suffered injuries fight-ing in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Having met these brave young men, I know how much their sacrifice means to America. I support H.R. 1559 to support our troops and to support the U.S. Economy. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. MICHAEL M. HONDA OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall vote Nos. 146, 147, and 148, I was unavoidably detained with important matters in my district. Had I been present, I would have voted ''yea'' on rollcall vote 146, Congratulating Charter Schools Across the United States, ''yea'' on rollcall vote 147, Extending Con-gratulations to the United States Capitol Police on the Occasion of its 175th Anniversary, and ''yea'' on rollcall vote 148, Expressing Support for the Celebration of Patriots' Day and Hon-oring the Nation's First Patriots. f COMMENDING ARMY RESERVE SPECIALIST ROY RUSSELL BUCKLEY HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I wish to com-mend Army Reserve Specialist Roy Russell Buckley for his bravery in the field of battle and his willingness to fight for his country. Specialist Buckley lost his life on Wednesday, April 23, 2003 in Baghdad, Iraq while trans-porting fuel trucks for the 685th Transportation VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E834 May 1, 2003 Company, part of the United States Army's 3rd Infantry Division. His sacrifice will be re-membered at funeral services on Saturday, May 3, 2003 by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own. A native of Merrillville, IN, Specialist Buckley graduated from Merrillville High School in 1996. He was a gifted athlete, with an orange belt in karate and possessed the strength to lift over 950 pounds. After graduating from high school, Specialist Buckley decided to join the Army Reserves with the hope that it would assist him financially with college, help him learn a trade, and allow him to find himself through the discipline and order that it pro-vides. It came as no surprise to those who knew Specialist Buckley that he would serve his country. A true patriot, his love for his country was evident from the time that he was a child. He collected items with patriotic themes, and his bedroom remains adorned with symbols of his patriotism. A poster of the Declaration of Independence hangs above his bed, and an ''Army of One'' poster hangs by the door. He once hung an American flag next to a bright light in his bedroom because he wanted to see the flag glow, and now a flag serves as the curtain for his window. Specialist Buckley felt tremendous pride for his country, and he was willing to endanger his own life to-protect the lives of his fellow citizens. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled. Mr. Speaker, Specialist Buckley, along with 160 other local reservists with the 685th Transportation Company, left for Fort Camp-bell, KY on January 24, 2003 after being called into active duty. His unit was deployed to Kuwait in February, and was instrumental in the battle to liberate the Iraqi people. Spe-cialist Buckley was riding in a large fuel truck when an accident occurred and he was thrown from the vehicle. He gave his life so that the freedoms and values that he treasured could be enjoyed by those around the world. Although he loved his unit and his country, Specialist Buckley treasured his family above all else. He is survived by his mother, Janie Espinoza, his stepfather, Phillip Espinoza, his four siblings, his fiance, Jenina Bellina, and his 6-year-old daughter, Alicia Faith Buckley. Jenina is stationed in Iraq with the same re-servist unit for which her fiance gave his life. These individuals were the heroes to a man that we will forever call a hero, and we should honor them in this tumultuous moment as well. Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, U.S. Army Reserve Specialist Roy Russell Buckley. Specialist Buckley is the third resident of Northwest Indi-ana to sacrifice his life during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and his passing comes as a difficult setback to a community already shaken by the realities of war. Specialist Buckley will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country; thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.IN HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF JOSEPH J. GOLUBSKI HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and remembrance of Joseph J. Golubski\u2014beloved family man, community leader, and friend and mentor to many. Mr. Golubski graduated from South High School in 1946 He earned a Bachelor's de-gree from John Carroll University, and a law degree from John Marshall College. In 1950, he married Rita D. Krysinski. Together they raised seven children. In 1952 Mr. Golubski became a licensed funeral director, continuing the family business that his father established in 1913. With a keen intellect and high energy for learning, Mr. Golubski became a licensed attorney in 1953. Despite his exceptional scholastic and busi- ness achievements, Mr. Golubski's foremost priorities were his family and native commu-nity\u2014the Slavic Village neighborhood. His family, community, faith and heritage were central within his life. Mr. Golubski was very active in and supportive of the community along Fleet Avenue. He supported many projects at several area churches, including St. Stanislaus, Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, St. Hyacinth Church, Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, and the former Transfiguration Church. Additionally, Mr. Golubski was an ac-tive member of the St. Stan's Dad's Club, Knights of Columbus South East Council, Cleveland Society of Poles, Slavic Village Merchant's Guild, and the National Funeral Di-rector's Association, among many others. Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honor and remembrance of Joseph J. Golubski, beloved husband of Rita; beloved father of Linda, Joseph E., Robert, Nancy, Steven, Cheryl, and Pamela; and adoring grandfather of Stephanie, Denise, Rita, Anne, Matthew, Adam, Martha and Joseph. Mr. Golubski's joyous life was defined by his deep dedication to family and friends, and his ex-ceptional service to his community. His strong spirit, integrity, energy and good works have served to uplift the lives of countless individ-uals, families\u2014and the entire Cleveland com-munity. f IN HONOR OF SISTER ROSE THERING HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sister Rose Thering for her dedica-tion to promoting religious understanding and providing educational opportunities for her community. Sister Thering was the keynote speaker at the annual Holocaust Remem-brance Day Observance on April 29, 2003 at the Bayonne City Council Chambers. Professor Emerita at Seton Hall University, Sister Thering has been an active writer, speaker, and lecturer on Judeo-Christian and Holocaust studies for over 30 years. Sister Thering has organized and directed the annual Seton Hall University Study Tour to Israel since 1972, and has traveled to Israel on over 50 occasions during her tenure at Seton Hall. As an active member of a number of aca-demic, religious, and community organizations, she continues to be a strong advocate for building relations between Jews and Chris-tians. Sister Thering currently serves on the New- ark Archdiocesan Commission for Interreli-gious Affairs and is executive director of the National Christian Leadership. She was ap-pointed to the Board of Trustees of Kean Uni-versity in 1994 and has been a member of the New Jersey Commission for Holocaust Edu-cation since 1980. She also served on the U.S. Bishops' Advisory Committee to the Sec-retariat for Catholic-Jewish Relations for 20 years. At Seton Hall University, she continues to improve the Endowment Fund established in her honor, which provides scholarship as-sistance to school teachers furthering their education in Holocaust studies. Sister Thering is a life member of Hadas- sah, the National Council of Jewish Women, and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. As a leader and educator on an issue as important as the Holocaust, I want to praise her for dec-ades of tireless determination and dedicated work. She has touched so many lives by re-minding us of the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust during human kind's darkest hour. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Sister Rose Thering for her commit-ment to pursuing religious understanding and for her desire to educate and serve members of our community. f RECOGNIZING BONNIE JEAN LONG FOR HER OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME OF HER RETIREMENT AS CITY MAN-AGER HON. MIKE THOMPSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the distinguished service of Bonnie Jean Long, the city manager of St. Helena, California. Her outstanding lead-ership and commitment to community service has significantly benefited the people of St. Helena and she will be sorely missed upon her retirement. When looking to hire the first-ever city man- ager in St. Helena, our community would have had a truly difficult task trying to find someone more qualified than Bonnie. Prior to taking of-fice, Bonnie served as the Cotati, California city manager. Adding to her preparation were the years she spent as the assistant city man-ager for the cities of Davis and Modesto, Cali-fornia. Mrs. Long's expertise is matched only by her dedication to improving her community and her tremendous work ethic. As city man-ager, she has worked tirelessly to manage St. Helena's budgets, to maximize our resources and to handle the needs of our growing popu-lation. Somehow she has managed to make this difficult task look easy. While serving our community as city man- ager, Bonnie has found additional ways to get VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E835 May 1, 2003 involved in bettering St. Helena through her volunteer work. Bonnie is a member of the St. Helena Rotary club, the Kiwanis club and she sits on the REMIF Board of Directors. Mr. Speaker, as impressive as Mrs. Long's professional contributions and service to St. Helena are, she would be the first to tell you that her real success has been as a dedicated wife, a loving mother and an adoring grand-mother. Whether traveling with her husband John, giving advise to her daughter Samantha or playing with her grandson Zachary, Bonnie has been a shining example of how to keep your priorities straight. For Bonnie, family is the true joy of life. Mr. Speaker, because of the many contribu- tions she has made to the town of St. Helena and for her excellence and dedication, it is proper for us to honor Bonnie Jean Long today as she retires from the office city man-ager. f HONORING HENRY COVELLO HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Henry Covello, a veteran of World War II and Korea. Mr. Covello served our country in World War II as a young man. His honor and bravery earned him a Purple Heart for his service in the war. His lifelong dedication to the United States Army is reflected by the prestige of the Purple Heart, among the highest honors an American citizen can receive. Following his service in World War II, Mr. Covello went off to serve in Korea where he earned his second Purple Heart. I am proud to tell my colleagues that this weekend Mr. Covello will post-humously receive his third Purple Heart. Mr. Covello served in the United States Army with the 82nd Airborne Division,504th Parachute Regiment, the 5th Airborne Ranger Co., 25th Division, and D Company, 19 Regi-ment, 24th Division. He served for nearly 25 years in the Army before permanently retiring to Worcester, Massachusetts. Mr. Covello is an example for all Americans. Devoting himself to our armed forces, Mr. Covello's awards are the sign of a grateful na-tion. His service in the fight against tyranny and oppression should not be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, I extend my sincere thanks to Mr. Covello, and to all of our veterans, for bravely fighting to protect our security and lib-erty. I am confident that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives will join me in thanking Mr. Covello for his service. f INTRODUCTION OF H.R. 1906, THE SERVICEMEMBERS' TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND SERVICES ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2003 HON. LANE EVANS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to in- troduce the Servicemembers' Transition As-sistance Program and Services Enhancement Act of 2003. This legislation would improve our servicemembers' often challenging transi-tion process from active-duty military service back into civilian life. In the Homeless Vet-erans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-95), Congress made a com-mitment to end chronic homelessness among veterans within this decade. This legislation is a strong step forward to honoring that commit-ment. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that this bill is a proactive measure; it aims to educate our separating servicemembers about the risk fac-tors associated with homelessness, as well as provide them with the tools they need to ob-tain quality long-term employment. Unemployment and continual underemploy- ment can lead to poverty, which is the com-mon denominator and root cause of homeless-ness. This measure would ensure that all servicemembers have the opportunity to par-ticipate and take advantage of important Tran-sition Assistance Program (TAP) services prior to leaving military service. TAP is jointly administered by the Depart- ments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans Af-fairs. These services generally include, em-ployment counseling, career assistance, and veterans' benefits guidance for active-duty servicemembers returning to civilian life. Cur-rently, only the Marine Corps requires manda-tory TAP attendance for all of its separating or retiring servicemembers. The Marine Corps again leads the way! Mr. Speaker, every veteran and servicemember I have spoken with concerning TAP has said that attending a transition work-shop was a positive experience, and that the services truly helped them in their civilian job search. Additionally, as we all know, the mili-tary is comprised of a substantial number of married servicemembers. This measure ac-knowledges the special people that make-up our military community, and encourages full spousal participation in TAP services. Further, this important legislation would also require that TAP workshops include homeless-ness risk awareness assessments. As servicemembers leave military life to become civilians, they must adjust to new responsibil-ities and in certain ways a new lifestyle. This transition can be particularly challenging to veterans who are at greater risk of becoming homeless. According to recent studies, veterans: com- prise 23 percent of the overall homeless popu-lation and 33 percent of the homeless male population; are twice as likely to become homeless as non-veterans; female veterans are approximately four times as likely to be-come homeless as their non-veteran counter-parts; 40 percent of homeless veterans re-ported mental health problems; 49 percent re-ported alcohol abuse; 31 percent reported drug use; 52 percent reported chronic medical conditions. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Linda Boone and the entire staff of the National Co-alition for Homeless Veterans. I very much ap-preciate their advocacy on behalf of homeless veterans. I encourage all my colleagues to support this proactive legislation.HONORING DR. ARTHUR O. HAZARABEDIAN HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. RADANOVICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Arthur O. Hazarabedian posthumously for his vast contributions to his community and to the Armenian culture. His passing on March 31st of this year was a trag-ic loss to all who knew him. Arthur graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture Economics in 1953. He then received a Degree in Veteri-nary Medicine in 1959 from U.C. Davis. Dr. Hazarabedian's compassion for the animal community was shown in his ownership of Harmar Veterinary Services in the East Bay of San Francisco. Most of his career as a veteri- narian was dedicated to aiding pets, and he offered his services to four veterinary hospitals over the span of 40 years. Dr. Hazarabedian's love for helping other creatures is evident in his being a founding member of many veteri-nary organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association and their Busi-ness Management Committee. He also served as a representative of the California Board of Equalization and was a Charter member of the California Academy of Veterinary Medicine. Dr. Hazarabedian has made a significant impact on many lives in the Armenian commu-nity. One of Dr. Hazarabedian's greatest ac-complishments was the founding of the Arme-nian Technology Group, Inc. He, and the other ATG co-founders, formed the organization to assist Armenia in its transition from a subject state of the Soviet Union to a free and inde-pendent nation. Under Dr. Hazarabedian's leadership, the goal of ATG has been the ad-vancement of democracy in Armenia through the development of a modern agricultural base in a free-market economy. ATG has sought to introduce modem farming practices and tech-nologies to Armenian farmers and government representatives through programs designed to promote independent action and knowledge sharing. In 1990, he received the Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award from the Faculty at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, which is the highest award for contributions, public service and ex-cellence in the veterinary profession. Three weeks before he passed away, on March 8, Dr. Hazarabedian received the Man-of-the-Year award from the Armenian National Com-mittee of America\u2014Bay Area Chapter, at a ceremony held in San Francisco, CA for his outstanding service to Armenia and Armenian-American causes. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Arthur O. Hazarabedian for his exceptional services to the protection of the humanitarian cause. I invite my colleagues to join me in commending Arthur for an exceptional career and for his everlasting contributions. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:28 May 02, of Remarks E836 May 1, 2003 HONORING THE DEDICATED LIFE AND WORK OF MR. JAMES A. WILDING HON. TOM DAVIS OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. James A. Wilding, an outstanding citizen of Northern Virginia who has served his community and country for al-most half a century. Mr. Wilding will retire from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority this month after 43 years of service. Revered as a leader in both the public and private sectors, Jim will leave behind a legacy of dedication and excel-lence beyond compare. Jim graduated from the Catholic University of America as a Civil Engineer in 1959. He then joined the Federal Aviation Administra-tion, where his key role in the transformation of the Washington region began. Jim was one of the original planners of the Washington Dul-les International Airport. En route to his posi-tion as Chief Engineer, Jim advanced through the ranks of the FAA, working in many dif-ferent engineering capacities on both Wash-ington Dulles International and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. By 1979, Jim had successfully mastered the positions of Chief Engineer, Deputy Director, and finally Director of the FAA's Metropolitan Washington Airports. Upon the 1987 transfer of the region's air- ports to the new Metropolitan Washington Air-ports Authority, Jim began his tenure as that organization's President. He continued to im-plement his vision of a globally connected Washington area, easily accessible by world-class air facilities. Of course, this vision was far removed from reality; the region's current economic prosperity may obscure the collec-tive memory of the wholly government-cen-tered Metropolitan area of 50 years ago. Mr. Wilding's involvement in the region's air serv-ice played a large role in changing that. He oversaw a capital development program of more than 3 billion dollars at the two federally owned airports in the region and led the mod-ernization of Reagan National Airport. Dulles also underwent major growth in the 1990's. Under Jim's leadership, passenger activity at the two airports has almost doubled to 31 mil-lion passengers in 2002. Widely acknowledged as an expert in the aviation industry, Jim has won numerous awards, including the highest award in the Transportation Department: the Secretary of Transportation's Gold Medal. He has served namely as Chairman of the Airports Council International\u2014North America, as President of the Aero Club of Washington, and has served on the Board of Directors of the regional orga-nization, and on the Board of its worldwide parent based in Geneva, Switzerland. Cur-rently, he serves on the Policy Review Com-mittee of the American Association of Airport Executives. The United Way Campaign of Arlington County, Virginia is only one of the many re-gional groups indebted to Jim for his support and active participation. Jim is a member of the Economic Development Commission of Ar-lington County and has served on the Board of Directors as well as the Executive Com-mittee of the Arlington County Chamber of Commerce. He has served on the Advisory Board of the Eno Transportation Foundation, and currently serves on the Board of the Washington, DC Convention and Tourism Cor-poration, on both the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of the Dulles Area Transportation Association, and has served on the Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board. The people of Northern Virginia join these organizations in their debt of gratitude to Jim Wilding, and extend him heartfelt thanks for his continuing role in advancing the prosperity of the Washington region. Mr. Chairman, the life and service of this Virginian serve as a shining example to all who wish to improve the well-being of their community through dy-namic public and private activity. f TRIBUTE TO DR. MYLES MARTEL HON. DAVE CAMP OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Myles Martel in celebration of his 60th birthday. Dr. Martel has been involved with the United States political process for decades, leaving behind him a legacy of leadership. He came to prominence serving as former President Ron-ald Reagan's personal debate advisor, after which he moved on to become an advisor to the White House Office of Communications. Dr. Martel has also served as a speech advi-sor to ambassadors, congressmen, senators, governors and cabinet members. His expertise has awarded him many honors, including the George Washington Honor Medal, and the Distinguished Alumni Award for Outstanding Professional from the University of Con-necticut. Dr. Martel has published five books, and has been quoted by many nationally rec-ognized newsmagazines and newspapers. I am honored today to recognize Dr. Myles Martel for his many accomplishments, and to wish him the best on the celebration of his 60th birthday. f TRIBUTE TO REVEREND RONALD L. BAILEY, D. MIN. HON. JOSE\u00b4E. SERRANO OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding individual who has dedicated his life to serving others, the Reverend Dr. Ronald L. Bailey, D. Min., who on April 26 of this year was elevated to the position of Bishop by the Love Gospel Assem-bly, a non-denominational church serving over 2,500 members within my Congressional dis-trict in the South Bronx. Dr. Bailey was born and raised in Harlem, New York, and is the Senior Pastor of Love Gospel Assembly, one of the larger multi-fac-eted, multi-cultural ministries in New York City. Dr. Bailey was ordained in 1987 by the late Bishop Gerald Julius Kaufman, founder of Love Gospel Assembly, who also mentored Dr. Bailey in full-time ministry for eight years. Dr. Bailey's life and work as he labored beside Dr. Kaufman have built on the foundation of ministry to and for the poor and inner cities that was clearly articulated and demonstrated by Dr. Kaufman and continued the important work of Love Gospel Assembly. Dr. Bailey has a Bachelor of Arts in Theo- logical Studies, a Master of Arts in Theology from Evangelical Theological Seminary and a Doctor of Ministry (D. Min) from United Theo-logical Seminary in conjunction with Robert Schuller's School for Preaching (Fuqua School of Communication). Dr. Bailey sits on the Board of Directors for The Urban Youth Alliance Inc., the Steering Committee for the Bronx National Day of Pray-er, and the Board of Directors for the Concerts of Prayer, Greater New York. Dr. Ronald L. Bailey has been married for 35 years to Dorothy Bailey and they have three children, Ron, Jr., Rachel, and Danielle and one grandchild, Anaiah. Among other things, Dr. Bailey serves meals to over 700 people weekly, conducts a food pantry and provides clothing to the needy. As it is written in Hebrews 6:10, ''for God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them,'' the community recognizes him and honors him with this consecration. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to and in congratulating the Reverend Dr. Ronald L. Bailey, D. Min. on his consecration as Bishop of Love Gospel As-sembly. f CONGRATULATIONS, MONSIGNOR JOSEPH SEMANCIK ON 50TH AN-NIVERSARY OF ORDINATION HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and sincerity that I wish to con-gratulate Monsignor Joseph Semancik as he celebrates the 50th anniversary of his ordina-tion into the priesthood. He will be honored by his parishioners with a luncheon following an 11:00 am Mass at Sacred Heart Parish in East Chicago, Indiana on Sunday, May 2, 2003. A native of Northwest Indiana, Monsignor Semancik was born in Whiting on March 3, 1929 to Frank Semancik and Lillian Duray. He attended St. John the Baptist School and Catholic Central High School. After graduating from high school, Monsignor Semancik's pas-sion for his faith led him to study at Sacred Heart Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and later at St. Meinrad Seminary in Southern Indi-ana. He was ordained into the priesthood on May 1, 1953, and this important event became a stepping stone for his lifelong dedication to the citizens of Northwest Indiana. Monsignor Semancik began his career as an Assistant Priest for Assumption Parish in East Chicago and at St. Catherine of Siena in Hammond, Indiana. He was appointed admin-istrator at Sacred Heart Parish in 1960, a posi-tion he held until being named pastor at Holy Trinity Church in Gary in 1969. After five years as pastor for Holy Trinity, Monsignor VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May Remarks E837 May 1, 2003 Semancik returned to Sacred Heart as pastor, a position he has held to this day. Mr. Speaker, in addition to his exceptional efforts to guide his congregation at Sacred Heart, Monsignor Semancik also has worked extensively with Catholic Charities in North-west Indiana. He began his mission with Catholic Charities in 1960, and was named Di-ocesan Director in 1962, a position he held until 1998. Under his guidance, the agency provided social services throughout the four counties that comprise Northwest Indiana and expanded to seven offices throughout the re-gion. Monsignor Semancik has also served Catholic Charities, USA as a member of the Board of Directors, as well as serving as a member of the Study Cadre that redirected the mission of Catholic Charities. He also ably served as Chairman of various Catholic Charities's committees. Monsignor Semancik has also enriched the Northwest Indiana community through his work in other community organizations, such as serving as the President of both the Lake County Economic Opportunity Council and the Lake County Community Development Coun-cil. He was one of the founders of the Indiana Catholic Conference and of the Hospice of the Calumet Area. He has received many com-mendations for his work, including the Saga-more of the Wabash Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Governor of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Monsignor Joseph Semancik as he celebrates the 50th anniversary of his ordi-nation into the priesthood. Monsignor Semancik has been a fixture in Northwest In-diana throughout his career in the ministry, and he has touched the lives of many through-out the community. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to rep-resent him in Congress. f IN HONOR OF THE POLISH AMER- ICAN CONGRESS OHIO DIVISION HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Polish American Congress, Ohio Division, as they celebrate their 54th anniver-sary\u2014sharing their cultural gifts along a pa-rade route lined with food, song and joyous celebration. On May 18, 1949, the Ohio Division of The Polish American Congress was founded. The Polish American Congress is composed of in-dividuals of Polish ancestry as well as Polish organizations. The group serves as a unifying force for both Polish Americans and Polish citizens living in America. Taking a positive stand on issues concerning the people of Po-land, the group strives to attain a free market economy within the framework of a democratic society. The goal of The Polish American Congress is to make Americans of Polish heritage more successful U.S. citizens by encouraging them to assume the responsibilities of citizenship. In addition, the group supports fraternal, profes-sional, religious, and civic associations dedi-cated to the improvement of the status of all Americans of Polish heritage. It is evident that the Polish American Con- gress has played a crucial role in the Polish Community, and in its many years of service has been an invaluable contribution to the Cleveland Community. Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honor and celebration of the Polish Amer-ican Congress, as they celebrate 54 years of service to their members and to the Cleveland community. f IN HONOR OF DR. DEVARAJAN P. IYENGAR HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Devarajan P. Iyengar for his con-tributions to the medical field and his dedica-tion to the people of Jersey City, Kearny, and Bayonne, New Jersey. He was honored by the Bayonne Community Cancer Support Group at Puccini's Restaurant on April 26, 2003 in Ba-yonne.

MIKE THOMPSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sonoma Valley Chorale as this organization celebrates its 30th anniversary. The Sonoma Valley Chorale was founded in 1973 by Jim Griewe. It's first performance space was in the Pioneer Chapel of the First Congregational Church of Sonoma. As the membership grew, the Chorale relocated, first to St. Francis Solano Church and finally to the Veterans' Memorial Building. Sonoma Valley Chorale, Inc. has a member- administered Board of Directors and serves as an umbrella organization for the 130 voice Choral, Chamber Ensemble, Orchestra, Sonoma Valley Children's Chorus and for community programs promoting small ensem-ble performances. During its 30 year history, the Chorale has received many musical honors and has toured France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the New England states. The Chorale was fea-tured during both the 10th anniversary concert series of the Napa Valley Symphony and the 50th anniversary concert gala of the Santa Rosa Symphony. Guest conductors have included world re- nowned composer-conductor Jester Hariston. In 2000 the Chorale performed the world pre-mier of ''Come Life, Shaker Life'' by American composer Gwyneth Walker. This work was commissioned by and composed specifically for the Sonoma Valley Chorale and its music director, Jim Griewe. The Chorale's repertoire ranges from 1100 AD to the present and spans musical genres from Gregorian chants to Broadway show tunes. Mr. Speaker, the Sonoma Valley Chorale is an integral part of the cultural landscape of the First Congressional District and a true treasure for the people of the Sonoma Valley. It is therefore appropriate that we acknowledge and honor the Sonoma Valley Chorale, its founder and director Jim Griewe, and the hun-dreds voices who have contributed to the leg-acy and success of this organization. f HONORING HERBERT ADAMS HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a distinguished veteran of our armed forces, Herbert Adams. Mr. Adams served our nation as a member of the United States Army where he was awarded numerous medals for his distin-guished service on the battlefield. Following his service in World War Two, the govern-ments of Belgium and the Netherlands recog-nized Mr. Adams' role in freeing those nations from the Nazi regime. In addition to the European medals awarded to Mr. Adams, he received numerous Amer-ican medals including the Purple Heart; the Bronze Star; the Combat Infantry Badge; the Armey Occupation with German Clasp; the Honorable Service Lapel Button for World War Two; and the European-African-Middle East-ern Campaign Medal with four Bronze Service Stars. I am grateful for Mr. Adams' service. He dis- tinguished himself on the battlefield through bravery, strength, and commitment to the American cause of ridding Europe of the Nazi menace. Mr. Speaker, I extend my sincere thanks to Mr. Adams for bravely fighting in defense of VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E838 May 1, 2003 our nation. In addition, I am confident that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representa-tives join me in honoring Mr. Adams for his service. f USA GOLD AWARD FOR MARIA WITTE OF GIRL SCOUT TROOP 4043 HON. LANE EVANS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to salute an outstanding young woman who has been honored with the Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award by Girl Scouts of the Mis-sissippi Valley, Inc. in Rock Island, Illinois. She is Maria Witte of Girl Scout Troop 4043. She is being honored for earning the high- est achievement award in Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and per-sonal development. The Girl Scout Gold Award can be earned by girls ages 14-17 or in grades 9-12. Girl Scouts of the USA, an organization serving over 2.6 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must fulfill five requirements: earn four interest project patches, earn the Career Ex-ploration Pin, earn the Senior Girl Scout Lead-ership Award, earn the Senior Girl Scout Chal-lenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold project. A plan for fulfilling the require-ments of the award is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close co-operation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer. As a member of the Girl Scouts of the Mis- sissippi Valley, Inc., Maria began working to-ward the Girl Scout Gold Award in June 1999. Maria worked with her partner on painting a wall mural for a local gymnastics facility. The earning of the Girl Scout Gold Award is a major accomplishment for Maria and I be-lieve she should receive the public recognition due her for this significant service to her com-munity and her country. f HONORING THOMAS CHARLES TURK HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. RADANOVICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Undersheriff of Madera County, Thomas Charles Turk on the occasion of his retirement. The event commemorating the occasion will be held in Madera County at the Fairgrounds in Chowchilla, California on Saturday, April 26th, 2003. Thomas Turk has dedicated half of his life to law enforcement. As a young man he was drafted into the United States Army and served for two years as a military policeman. When he came out of active duty, he joined the Madera County Sheriff's department and was assigned to the jail. After one year, he began patrolling the Chowchilla streets work-ing out of a substation. He was respected and admired by the community. For much of his career, Tom was on a first name basis with most of Madera County. He was later ap-pointed to the Detective Division and then to Sergeant. There, he learned that every time you get promoted you get moved to the grave-yard shifts. Tom worked his way up through the ranks, from Sergeant to Lieutenant, and then to Undersheriff. Undersheriff Turk dedicated his life to his department and the people of Madera County. He never stopped promoting the integrity of the Department and the honor of his position. Tom has worked countless overnight shifts, which accounts for his two ''Officer of the Year'' commendations, and has done so with the utmost humility. Tom's dedication to his job makes great departments such as the one in Madera County. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Under- sheriff Thomas Charles Turk for his service to the County of Madera and for his outreach to the community of which he served. I invite my colleagues to join me in commending Thomas for his devotion throughout his career and in wishing him many years of continued success. f HONORING THE SELECTION OF MS. ELIZABETH ANN KRABILL AS THE 2003 UNITED STATES CHER-RY BLOSSOM QUEEN HON. TOM DAVIS OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to honor Ms. Elizabeth Ann Krabill upon her selection as the 2003 United States Cherry Blossom Queen. Elizabeth, a sophomore Economics major at Cornell University, was selected as the U.S. Cherry Blossom Queen on April 4, 2003. The tradition of crowning a national Cherry Blos-som Queen is a long one, started by the Na-tional Conference of State Societies in 1948. Elizabeth joins her 53 predecessors in rep-resenting America as a Goodwill Ambassador. In fact, she will depart for a goodwill visit to Japan on May 1, 2003\u2014less than a month after her coronation. In Japan, Elizabeth will participate in a series of celebrations and con-ferences over two weeks. Before her ascent to the national crown, Elizabeth was chosen as Virginia's 2003 Cher-ry Blossom Princess. Elizabeth finds herself in familiar company: Elizabeth's mother, aunt and sister all preceded her as Cherry Blossom Princesses at one time. Elizabeth grew up in McLean, Virginia and graduated from National Cathedral School. She excelled at competitive swimming in high school and was twice cho-sen as captain of her swim team. She has spent two summers sharing her swimming tal-ents with children as a swimming lesson in-structor at Beauvoir Summer Camp. At Cor-nell, Elizabeth is active in her sorority, Alpha Phi, as the Vice President of Marketing. Virginia is proud to send one of her native daughters into the international arena to rep-resent the United States. A well-rounded and gifted individual, Elizabeth Krabill will rep-resent her country with dignity and poise, and I applaud her initiative in seeking this great honor.TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM A. SEDERBURG OF FERRIS STATE UNIVERSITY HON. DAVE CAMP OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. William A. Sederburg for his faithful service as president of Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan. After eight years as president and one year as interim president at Ferris, Dr. Sederburg is retiring from his position. He became the 16th president of the college in 1995 after a distinguished career as a pro-fessor, Michigan state senator, and successful businessman.

I am honored today to recognize Dr. William A.

SERRANO OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, it is with joy that I rise today to once again pay tribute to Bronx Community College, which will hold its 25th Anniversary Hall of Fame 10K Run on Saturday, May 3, 2003. The Hall of Fame 10K Run was founded in 1978 by Bronx Community College's third president, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown and today continues to be an event of great significance. Its mission is to highlight the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, a national institution dedi-cated to those who have helped to make America great. The 10K race tradition continues under the stewardship of Dr. Carolyn G. Williams. Dr. Williams has endorsed and follows the com-mitment made by Dr. Brown to promote phys-ical fitness and highlight higher education. As one who has run the Hall of Fame 10K Run, I can attest that the excitement it gen-erates brings the entire City together. It is a celebration and an affirmation of life. It feels wonderful to enable more than 400 people to have this experience\u2014one that will change the lives of many of them. It is an honor for me to join once again the hundreds of joyful peo-ple who will run along the Grand Concourse, VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E839 May 1, 2003 University Avenue and West 181 Street and to savor the variety of their celebrations. There is no better way to see our Bronx community. The Annual Hall of Fame 10K Run is joined by a 2 Mile Fitness Walk and, for the second year, a Hall of Fame Excalibur One Mile Boys and Girls Youth Challenge for 9 to 18 years olds. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the individuals and participants who are making the Bronx Community Col-lege's 25th Annual Hall of Fame 10K run pos-sible. f CONGRATULATIONS TO CROATION SONS LODGE NUMBER 170 HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is my dis- tinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge Number 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union of America on the festive occasion of its 96th Anniversary and Golden Member ban-quet on Sunday, April 27, 2003. In addition to honoring thirty new 50-year members, the Lodge will also honor Martha J. Woss with the Woman of the Year Award, and Valentine-Walter Bahun with the Man of the Year Award. This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala event at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the anniver-sary celebration entails a formal recognition of the Union's Golden Members, those who have achieved fifty years of membership. This year's honorees include: Richard D. Bekelya, Josephine Blaschke, Violet Giorgi, Marija Jugovic, Pauline Muraida, George Nosich, Carol Jean Pettit, John L. Ramuscak, Rudolph J. Ramuscak, Mary C. Rozmanich, Joanna Russ, Annie Jane Seral, Bartol Weger, Jose-phine Williamson, and Mary Yurkas. These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with over 300 additional Lodge members who have previously attained this important designation. Mr. Speaker, Martha Woss has been a fix- ture with the Croatian Fraternal Union for 78 years. She has served as president, vice president, recording secretary, and scribe, as well as serving as the chair for numerous committees. Martha also wrote a weekly col-umn reporting the events of her Lodge, as well as other area Lodges. She was the first woman to bowl in the Joe Rady Tourney, and she was awarded a plaque from the national president for this honor. Martha has been a dedicated member of the Lodge since 1925, and because of her commitment and hard work, she has achieved the honor of being designated as Woman of the Year. On January 17, 2003, Valentine-Walter ''Wally'' Bahun celebrated not only his 83rd birthday, but also 65 years of service for Lodge 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union of America. Wally has served in various positions throughout his time with the Lodge, including president, vice president, and trustee. He was also elected as a delegate to the Toronto 15th Convention in 1979, and has been elected as a delegate each year since for his dedication to Lodge 170. His commitment to the Croatian community of Northwest Indiana serves as an example of the dedication we all must show to keep our nation great. Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distin- guished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President Betty Morgavan, and all the other members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170, for their loyalty and ongoing display of passion for their ethnicity. The Croatian community has played a key role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed hope and prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families. I am proud to represent these gifted residents of the First Congressional District of Indiana. f SALUTING THE CARGILL SALT MINERS OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL NO. 436 IN THEIR STRUGGLE TO RETAIN REPRESENTATION AND END A LOCK-OUT DESPITE COM-PANY EFFORTS TO BREAK THE UNION HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup- port of the members of Teamsters Local No. 436. This racially and ethnically diverse group of salt miners constitutes the bargaining unit at Cargill's Cleveland salt mine in Ohio's 10th Congressional District. Many of them are locked out of the mine in a labor dispute, the outcome of which will have major implications for working men and women everywhere. In May 2002, the salt miners went on strike. Between May and August, the miners and the company met on several occasions to resolve the dispute and draft a mutually agreeable labor contract. On August 13, 2002, while still engaged in good faith negotiations with Cargill, the union miners made an uncondi-tional offer to return to work. When the miners attempted to return to their jobs, they learned that Cargill hired permanent replacement workers who were either hired before August 13, or their dates of hiring were backdated prior to August 13. All but 26 of the union min-ers were locked out. The hiring of replacement workers in this manner violates the National Labor Relations Act as an act of bad faith in labor negotiations. Shortly after the lockout, one of the replace- ment workers filed a decertification petition with the National Labor Relations Board. In a strong show of support, the working and locked out union miners showed up at the mine at 6:00 in the morning on April 10, 2003, to support the union. One locked out miner drove 150 miles from Columbus for the vote while another left his hospital bed to vote. The result of the election was a 63-58 victory for the union. Even though the Cargill-supported replacement workers appealed the election, the union workers again rallied to oppose the decertification and voted 64-61 to retain the union. The union workers have my full support. The replacement workers, too, should under-stand that the good pay and benefits they enjoy at Cargill were hard-fought by the Team-sters locally and the national organized labor movement in general. Once the union is gone, no one will be there to represent them in gain-ing and retaining their pay, rights, and bene-fits. Unions are good for workers and compa-nies alike. I support the union workers' efforts to stop the decertification of their union and to end the lock-out so they can return to work as soon as possible. I call on Cargill to accept the democratic process built into our nation's labor law, accept the will of the workers to re-tain union representation, and return imme-diately to good faith negotiations with the Teamsters. f IN HONOR OF LUDO NOLFO, RE- CIPIENT OF BAYONNE UNICO FOUNDATION'S 2003 MAN OF THE YEAR AWARD HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ludo Nolfo, for his outstanding dedi-cation to the community of Bayonne, New Jer-sey. Mr. Nolfo was named the 2003 Man of the Year by the Bayonne Chapter of UNICO National on April 5, 2003 at the Chandelier Restaurant in Bayonne. An Italian immigrant at age 16, and a grad- uate of New York University with a degree in accounting, Mr. Nolfo served two years in the United States military before working with Manufacturers Hanover in New York. For over 27 years, Mr. Nolfo worked for First Union Na- tional Bank, where he was Vice President of Trade Services. He is currently Vice President of International Trade Banking at the New York Branch of Rabobank Nederland. In addition to his remarkable professional record and successful career, Mr. Nolfo has a distinguished record of community service. As trustee of the Bayonne Board of Education and Our Lady of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church, commissioner of the Ba-yonne Housing Authority, and treasurer of the Board of the Bayonne Visiting Nurses Asso-ciation, Mr. Nolfo continues to demonstrate an impressive level of commitment to serving the people of Bayonne. A past president and district governor of the Bayonne Chapter of UNICO National, Mr. Nolfo has been committed to serving the Italian community throughout our region. He is a founding member and formal grand marshal of the Bayonne Columbus Committee; a mem-ber and past president of the Bayonne Sicilian Citizens Club; and a member of the Sons of Italy of Bayonne. He also served on the Com-mittee on Italian Migration, sponsored by the Italian Consulate. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Nolfo for his exceptional service to the people of Bayonne and in congratu-lating him on being named Bayonne UNICO's 2003 Man of the Year. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E840 May 1, 2003 IN RECOGNITION OF DOMAINE CHANDON OF NAPA VALLEY HON. MIKE THOMPSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Domaine Chandon, the Napa Valley leading sparkling wine pro-ducer, as it celebrates its 30th Anniversary. Domaine Chandon was founded in 1973 as the first American sparkling wine venture es-tablished by the French Champagne house, Moet et Chandon. As pioneers in producing California sparkling wine, Domaine Chandon has had a far-reaching impact on winemaking in the Napa Valley and is continuing to break new ground with its foodloving wines, both sparking and varietal stills. Before Domaine Chandon was established, American-made sparkling wine was over-shadowed by French Champagne. When Moet et Chandon, makers of Dom Perignon and other fine Champagnes, selected the Napa Valley as the next world class sparkling wine regions, it helped establish California's reputa-tion as one of the world's top wine producing regions. In addition to producing premium sparking wine and a highly regarding line of still wines, Domaine Chandon has proven that sparkling wines shouldn't be limited to New Year's Eve and weddings. With eight sparkling wine cuvees available nationally and five specialty wines available at the winery, Domaine Chandon offers a full range of flavors and styles that are very well matched with foods. As the only Napa Valley winery with an on-site restaurant, Domaine Chandon showcases the pairing sparkling wine with food and in doing so, has help establish the region as a world-renowned dining destination. Mr. Speaker, as Domaine Chandon cele- brates its 30th anniversary with a showcase 30-course dinner and other signature events the weekend of May 2 through May 4, 2003, it is appropriate that we recognize them today for their many contributions to fine wine and fine dining in California's Napa Valley. f CONGRATULATIONS TO EMPLOY- EES OF SERENITY HOUSE OF GARY, INDIANA HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sincerity and enthusiasm that I congratu-late the employees of Serenity House of Gary, Inc. as they celebrate 25 years of assisting those in the Gary, Indiana community as they recover from alcohol and drug addiction. These devoted individuals will commemorate their Silver Anniversary at a banquet to be held on April 26, 2003. Serenity House of Gary, Inc. is a transitional facility that nurtures residents as they recover from the mental, physical, and spiritual effects of alcohol and drug addiction, as well as pro-viding employment counseling and referrals to ensure that the reintegration into the commu-nity is successful for both the patient and those in the surrounding area. The employees at Serenity House are committed to supporting addicts and their families through every step of the recovery process. By promoting each individual's talents and skills, these employees teach all those committed to recovering to de-velop meaningful, productive lives without the reliance upon narcotics and alcohol. Mr. Speaker, Serenity House opened in Au- gust 1980 to fulfill the need for a residential treatment facility in Lake County, Indiana. It provides a supportive environment for patients to recover from their addiction as they simulta-neously learn important life skills, such as ob-taining and maintaining both employment and housing in order to enrich the quality of their lives. The employees are trained to counsel and assist those who are recovering from de-pendency, and are therefore able to create a positive atmosphere in which the patients are prepared to enjoy the benefits of their suc-cess. The physical and emotional suffering caused by addiction affects not only the indi-vidual, but also hovers like a storm cloud over all those who have a vested interest in his or her well-being. Serenity House provides a safe haven for those who wish to recover from their dependency but are unable to do so on their own. It is within these walls that those who are looking for the opportunity to improve their lives can find solace. Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the employees of Serenity House of Gary, Inc. for 25 years of service to the residents of Lake County, Indiana. Through their efforts, many in the Northwest Indiana community have had the opportunity to enhance their lives and recover from a de-bilitating illness. It is this compassion and commitment to their fellow man that makes Northwest Indiana a great community, and I am honored to represent these outstanding in-dividuals in Congress. f IN HONOR OF JAMES WHITLEY, JR. HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KUNINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of Metroparks Rangers Chief James Whitley Jr., on the occasion of his recent retirement from service with the Cleveland Metroparks. Raised in Cleveland, Chief Whitley grad- uated from John Hay High School in 1976. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy shortly thereafter. While stationed in England, Chief Whitley earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Following four years of exemplary service to his country, he came home to Cleveland where he worked as a caseworker for Cuya-hoga County. In that capacity, Chief Whitley helped troubled veterans obtain shelter, food and benefits. In 1982, Chief Whitley began his service as a police officer with the City of Cleveland Heights. His outstanding work and personal dedication to helping others was clearly re-jected throughout his tenure of service. He rose quickly through the department ranks and was promoted to Commander of the Traffic Bureau in 1990. Significantly and historically, Chief Whitley broke through racial barriers by becoming the first African-American Sergeant within the Cleveland Heights Police Depart-ment, which paved the way for other men and women to follow. As Chief of the Metroparks Ranger, Chief Whitley's vision and leadership brought new life to the Ranger Special Units and was a sig-nificant force behind the newly constructed headquarters operations facilities, opening this fall. A tireless supporter of continued edu-cation, Chief Whitley was a strong advocate for post-secondary education for rangers and staff. Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honor, admiration, gratitude and recognition of Chief Ranger James of our country and on behalf of the citizens of our Cleveland commu-nity have served to lift the spirits Whitley, Jr. Chief Whitley's exceptional work ethic, law en-forcement expertise and commendable service on behalf and the lives of countless individuals and families and we extend our best wishes throughout his future endeavors. f IN HONOR OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 182nd Anniversary of Greek Inde-pendence Day. On March 25, 1821, the peo-ple of Greece began their quest for freedom from the Ottoman Turks, and we commemo-rate their resolve and their country's enduring independence. The birth of democracy in Greece ushered in one of the true golden ages of Western Civ-ilization, and the democratic ideals of ancient Greece provided an inspiration and foundation for American democracy. The peoples of Greece and the United States enjoy a rich friendship based on our common devotion to the ideals of freedom and democracy. Our na-tion continues to strive for high standards of equality and justice championed by Greek phi-losophy; and, in shaping their new democracy, the Greeks used the Declaration of Independ-ence as a guide. The celebration of Greek Independence Day provides a chance for Americans and Greeks alike to reflect on and celebrate a common history that shares the same principles of free-dom and democracy. The Greek Independence Day parade con- tinued its grand tradition this year, marking the 65th annual parade along Fifth Avenue in New York City. I praise the efforts of the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater New York for making such a celebration of Greek Independ-ence possible. This annual tradition provides a chance for Greeks and Americans to celebrate Greek culture and to continue the great part-nership between our peoples and cultures. The commemoration of the Independence of Greece is an important reminder of the con-tributions of Greece to democracy in America and worldwide. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Greek Independence Day and to pay tribute to the shared traditions of Greek and American democracy. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, Remarks E841 May 1, 2003 RECOGNIZING BROTHER TIMOTHY DIENER FOR HIS OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF NAPA COUNTY HON. MIKE THOMPSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Brother Timothy Diener for his outstanding commit-ment to serving the Napa Valley community in my home state of California. June 2003 will mark the 75th anniversary (diamond jubilee) of Brother Timothy's entry into the De La Salle Christian Brothers. Brother Timothy, a lifelong Catholic and the son of German immigrants, was born in 1910 in New Jersey. In 1918 his family moved to Los Angeles, where he graduated from Cathe-dral High School. He joined the Christian Brothers in 1928 and made two significant dis-coveries, wine and teaching. At the age of 25, Brother Timothy became heavily involved in the new Christian Brothers winery. Officially his title was ''wine chemist'' but it was common to find him performing such additional duties as digging ditches, being the hose dragger, scrubbing the tank, driving the trucks and operating the cement mixer. Half a century of hard work and excel-lence have since passed and today Brother Timothy is considered a pioneer in the Napa Valley wine industry and is treasured as a master vintner. Much like the spectacular wine he makes, Brother Timothy gets better with age. Though he turns 93 in November, Brother Timothy maintains an enthusiasm for life and a deep dedication to serving others. Not surprisingly, he continues to serve the cause of Christian Brothers' education as an honorary founding member of the Lasallian Education Fund. He uses his position to assist the underserved youth of our community. Mr. Speaker, Brother Timothy represents much more than Napa's wine roots or our communities commitment to promoting edu-cation. Quite simply, Brother Timothy rep-resents the heart of the Napa Valley. His life has been a legacy of hard work, faith and pas-sionate living. For all of these reasons and countless more, it is most appropriate that we honor Brother Timothy Diener at this time and congratulate him on 75 years with the De La Salle Christian Brothers. f CONGRATULATIONS TO NORTHWEST INDIANA EDUCATORS HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I wish to con-gratulate an exceptional group of Northwest Indiana educators. The Indiana State Teach-er's Association will present these outstanding individuals with the 2002-2003 Crystal Apple Award for excellence in education during a banquet on Wednesday, May 7, 2003 in Schererville, Indiana. This year's recipients are: Darlene M. Vassil, Linda Johnson, Estelle Becke, Judith Thayer, Renee Kouris, James Crist, and Sherry Peters. Darlene Vassil is a 22-year veteran of art education, and she effectively uses this wealth of experience to enrich the lives of her stu- dents. She was awarded a grant from the Indi-ana Department of Education to develop an electronic portfolio program so that her stu-dents can learn to enhance creativity through technology. Darlene's enthusiasm and dedica-tion for her work led to her involvement in the Fine Arts and Music Education (FAME) organi-zation. She was instrumental in the organiza-tion of the Northwest Indiana FAME Festivals Imaginarium for the past two years, and has been responsible for various art displays from other cultures being brought to her community. Linda Johnson has served in the Hanover Community School Corporation for 28 years, and her dedication and professionalism is un-surpassed. She has taught students at various grade levels throughout the elementary and in-termediate system. She currently teaches fifth grade at Lincoln Elementary and will retire after the school year is completed. Known for her intelligence and wisdom, Linda is a source of advice for both her students and her peers. Her devotion and humor will be greatly missed. Estelle Becke began her career as an ele- mentary school teacher in the Highland school system, and currently teaches seventh grade geography. She is a bold, strong, and loyal person who has a passion for both her subject area and her craft. Estelle has sponsored her school's Geography Bee, and has also em-ceed the school-wide event. She has spent her career teaching her students tolerance for those from diverse cultures and backgrounds. Judith Thayer has dedicated 30 of her 34 12 years of teaching to the Lake Central School Corporation. She currently teaches fourth grade at Kolling Elementary School in St. John, Indiana. Her efforts and excellence in the classroom have undoubtedly contributed to the status of Kolling as one of Indiana's Four Star Schools. Although Judith has a principal's certificate, she chooses to be in the classroom because of her love for the students. Renee Kouris has touched the lives not only of her theater students, but also the lives of those who watch their performances. Her compassion for her students and her desire to include every student in her productions has made Renee one of the most popular teachers at Munster High School. Last year, her theater class participated in a state-wide competition and placed second for the original work that they wrote, produced, and presented. Her abil-ity to challenge students and faculty while re-maining humorous, compassionate, and sin-cere makes her an excellent choice for the 2002-2003 Crystal Apple Award. James Crist is known for his ability to con- nect with students in a way that few other teachers are able to duplicate. He directs the Pupils Reached by Individual Direct Education (PRIDE) program, which reaches out to stu-dents who have difficulty adapting to standard teaching methods. He teaches them to take pride in themselves and their work. James promotes fairness, acceptance, and stability to students who otherwise would have given up on their education. His adaptability to meet the needs of his students is remarkable, and we are deeply indebted to him for his dedication to his pupils. Sherry Peters uses her work ethic, dedica- tion, and creative spirit to improve her teach-ing methods and effectiveness. She does not simply rely on her lesson plans from previous years, but she constantly updates her mate-rials and evaluates her methods in an attempt to reach her pupils. She has the ability to un-derstand her students and connect with them in the classroom, and she uses this ability to take them far beyond their previous limitations. She uses creative strategies to enrich the lives of her students, and the seniors at Lowell High School have elected her the Most Influential Teacher on many occasions. Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these tremendous educators as they accept the 2002-2003 Crystal Apple Award from the Indiana State Teacher's Asso-ciation. Their tireless dedication to enriching the minds of today's youth is invaluable, and I am proud to represent these outstanding teachers in Congress. f IN HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF MIKE REINERI HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and remembrance of Mr. Mike Reineri\u2014family man, friend, and outstanding radio per-sonality. Mr. Reineri had a long and distinguished ca- reer within the broadcasting industry. He was sworn into the Radio & Television Broad-casting Hall of Fame in November of 2001, and throughout his career, he served in every aspect of broadcasting in cities across the country. Mr. Reineri's first major appearance on radio was in 1959 with WFVG in North Caro-lina. He stayed there for about a year and soon moved to WKIK, where he did a rock-n-roll show from 7-I1 pm at a remote studio at the Piggy-Park Drive-In in Raleigh. His highly entertaining style of broadcasting drew crowds from across the Carolinas. Besides his natural ability to entertain, Mr. Reineri also possessed a kind and generous heart. While broadcasting in Cleveland, he created and promoted the very successful ''Shoes for Kids'' program that provides under-privileged and homeless children with foot-wear. This annual campaign grows stronger every year, and continues to assist Cleve-land's neediest children. Wherever he's lived, Mr. Reineri always sought to be of service to others. He was deeply dedicated and civically active in Miami. For more than two decades, Mr. Reineri served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Boys and Girls Club of Miami and was awarded the Service to Youth Award and Service Bar. In 1991 he was awarded the Easter Seals Man of the Year Award in Miami and the Miami Power Squadron Award for Outstanding Contribution to Safe Boating. Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honor and recognition of Mr. Mike Reineri. I extend my sincerest condolences to his fam-ily and friends, especially to wife Barbara. Mr. Reineri's exceptional broadcasting talents and achievements will be known for generations to come. Moreover, his exceptional sense of kindness and compassion for others\u2014through word and deed\u2014will live on forever. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May Remarks E842 May 1, 2003 HONORING ROBERT B. HILLE HON. STEVEN R. ROTHMAN OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. ROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend of mine and of the Bergen County community, Robert B. Hille, who is about to become the 105th President of the Bergen County Bar Association. Robert Hille and I began our careers together as young lawyers in the Bergen County Bar As-sociation. It was there that I got to see first-hand what a remarkable person Robert Hille is. He has been and continues to be an ex-traordinarily gifted attorney and loving hus-band of Leslie and father of Erin and Tara. Throughout the course of his career, Robert Hille has handled himself in a highly profes-sional and dignified manner that has won him the great admiration and respect of his peers. His election as the 105th Bergen County Bar Association President is a reflection of the high esteem that not only I have for him, but that everyone in the Bergen County legal com-munity has for him. Robert Hille is a man who strives to do what is right and just in his profession. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to him and his family on his election as President of this most pres-tigious organization, I wish him the very best. f SUPPORT FOR H.R. 832, PERMA- NENT PARTNERS IMMIGRATION ACT HON. BRAD SHERMAN OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 832, the Permanent Partners Immigration Act would allow US citizens and lawful permanent resi-dents, who are in a permanent partnership, to sponsor their partner for immigration purposes in the same way that opposite-sex spouses now can. This proposal would also hold these partners to the same legal commitments of a legal marriage, in that if a person is found to have entered into a fraudulent permanent part-nership for the purpose of obtaining a visa for another person, they will be subject to the same five year maximum imprisonment, or $250,000 maximum fine, or both. According to the Human Rights Campaign, this legislation would affect the status of thou-sands of couples who currently are separated or risk permanent separation from the ones they love. Fourteen countries\u2014including Bel-gium, Canada, Denmark, France, Israel, the United Kingdom and South Africa\u2014recognize same sex partnerships for purposes of immi-gration. I have co-sponsored H.R. 832 because I strongly believe in its purposes and I am con-fident that its text will be fine tuned as it goes through the legislative process. I called upon the Congressional leadership to begin that process.HONORING NINE NEW MEMBERS OF THE INDIANA FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy and enthusiasm that I wish to con-gratulate the nine new members of the Indiana Football Hall of Fame.

HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and remembrance of Edward John VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, E843 May 1, 2003 Wojniak, Sr.\u2014Beloved family man, World War II veteran, community leader, and friend and mentor to many. Mr. Wojniak was born in 1919 in the St. Hyacinth area of Cleveland. As a young boy, he moved with his family to West Virginia where his father found work as a coal miner. Tragically, in 1935, Mr. Wojniak's father died in a mining accident. His family remained in West Virginia for a few years. After Mr. Wojniak graduated from high school, his family relocated to Pittsburgh. Soon after, World War II broke out. Mr. Wojniak enlisted in the U.S. Army 815 Engineers Corps, and fought in Italy and Northern Africa. He returned to Cleveland after the war, and enrolled in college at West-ern Reserve University. In 1951, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and in 1954, he graduated with a Master of Science degree in Social Administration. During college, he met and married Jennie Pogroszewski. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Wojniak raised four children. His life revolved around family, com-munity, faith and heritage. His professional life was dedicated to helping others. For more than a quarter century, Mr. Wojniak worked on behalf of our elderly at the State of Ohio De-partment of Aging. His deep affection for his Cleveland community and his Polish heritage were clearly reflected through his civic involve-ment and volunteer spirit. Mr. Wojniak worked diligently to secure an official proclamation to name the Broadway-Forman area of Slavic Village as ''Solidarity Square. '' Throughout his adult life, Mr. Wojniak was highly active in vet-erans' groups and Polish fraternal organiza-tions, including the Polish National Alliance and the Polish American Congress.

LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask that the following Proclamation by the Miami-Dade County Office of the Mayor and the Board of County Commissioners be included in the R ECORD. Whereas: As the Apostle of the Cuban Inde- pendence Jose Marti once said: ''Liberty is very expensive and it is necessary either to resign oneself to live without it or to decide to pay its price;'' and Whereas: Realizing that Cubans are per- secuted and exiled in their own land, de-prived of their most elemental rights, fired from their jobs, subjected to a cruel and sys-tematic hate campaign, and suffering defa-mation towards them and their families, the thousands of men and women, that for years have confronted with civic activism that tyr- anny, deserve the admiration and support of all; and Whereas: On Monday, May 13, 2002, coin- ciding with the 71st Anniversary of Pedro Luis Boitel's birthday, a Cuban murdered by the Castro regimen, a group of Cuban exile institutions have agreed to declare May 13th, ''International Support for the Cuban Oppo-sition Day,'' and Whereas: The efforts of these Cuban orga- nizations are not only against the Fidel Cas-tro dictatorship, but against all forms of op-pression anywhere on earth, because the de-fense of human rights does not know bound-aries of any particular nation, thus the rep-resentatives of these organizations invite Cubans, inside and outside the island, as well as those sympathetic to this worth cause, to join this noble effort; and Whereas: It is fitting and proper that offi- cial acknowledgement be given to the orga-nizers, and participants of these plethora of organizations, and wish them complete suc-cess in their quest for a Cuba with liberty and justice for all; Now Therefore: Be It Resolved, That I, Alex Penelas, Mayor of Miami-Dade County, Florida, On Behalf Of The Board of County Commissioners And This Community, do hereby proclaim Monday, May 13, 2002, as International Support for the Cuban Opposi-tion Day. In Observance Thereof: I call upon the good people of Miami-Dade County to join me in recognizing the importance of this endeavor aimed to obtain the most laudable aspira-tions of the human race\u2014to live in freedom. f IN RECOGNITION OF 55 YEARS OF ISRAELI INDEPENDENCE HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge that on May 7, 2003 the State of Israel will be celebrating its independence and fifty five years of statehood. Since its founding in 1948, Israel has served as a staunch ally on behalf of America's vital interests in the Middle East and internationally. Mr. Speaker, being that the citizens of the United States and Israel maintain a deeply rooted friendship based upon a commonality of interests and shared core ideals, including a dedication to democracy and individual free-doms, I ask that we rise up in recognition of Israel's independence. I would also like to recognize the special sister relationship that the State of New Jersey has forged with the State of Israel, through the New Jersey-Israel Commission. Israel has re-peatedly proven itself as a valued partner in trade and mutual cultural exchange, and has earned the support of New Jersey's citizens. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to rec- ognize a special group of constituents from the 6th District of New Jersey who will be showing their support for this unique relation-ship by ''Walking For Israel'' on May 4th. I ask that my colleagues to join me in commending the Jewish Federation of Greater Middlesex County for sponsoring such an event. It is my hope that America's citizens will mark this oc-casion and demonstrate their support for the US-Israeli relationship with similar events across the country.HONORING FATHER EVAGORAS CONSTANTINIDES HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sincerity and enthusiasm that I wish to congratulate Father Evagoras Constantinides for his numerous contributions to the citizens of Northwest Indiana. Father Constantinides has been a fixture of the community since 1969, and he will be honored at a dinner pre-sented by Friends of Hospice on Friday, May 2, 2003. Mr. Speaker, Father Constantinides was born in Lapithos, Cyprus in 1918 and was educated in his village through his second year of high school, where he graduated with the Gold Medal Award for academic excel-lence. He entered Athens College in 1932, where he was accepted on a yearly scholar-ship with the school's science section. Father Constantinides had no trouble maintaining his scholarship for six years, and he graduated with honors while receiving the Delta Public Speaking Prize and the English Language Prize. This dedication and commitment to his studies exemplifies the hard work on which Father Constantinides prides himself. After finishing his collegiate studies in Greece, Father Constantinides journeyed across the world to America to continue his studies and broaden his experiences. In 1938, he enrolled at Fenn College, which is now Cleveland State University, to study civil engi-neering. During his four years at the Univer-sity, he served as a Greek teacher and as the Hellenic Board of Education Secretary for the Greek Orthodox Community of the Annun-ciation of Cleveland, Ohio. Although he en-joyed his time in Cleveland, his final year was interrupted by World War II. As a British sub-ject, Father Constantinides entered the Cana-dian Army as a private in the fall of 1942. After completing his basic training, he was en-rolled in the officer training program, from which he graduated as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Engineer Corps with proficiency in explosives, mines, and demolitions. His outstanding ability as a military officer, coupled with his excellent intellect, allowed Father Constantinides the opportunity to work for the United States Cen-tral Intelligence Group translating Japanese documents and the Greek Constitution into English. After returning to the United States following his discharge in 1947, Father Constantinides began extensively studying theology, and on March 11, 1956 he was ordained into the priesthood. He was appointed pastor of the SS. Constantine and Helen parish in Gary on September 1, 1969, and his gracious pres-ence has been felt throughout Northwest Indi-ana since his arrival. In 1971, Father Constantinides was instrumental in the con-struction of the Hellenic Cultural Center in Merrillville. His efforts also led to the design and construction of the SS. Constantine and Helen Cathedral, one of the ten largest Ortho-dox churches in the Americas, in 1975. It was during this time that Father Constantinides be-came deeply involved in the work of Hospice of the Calumet Area. In addition to the many contributions within his own parish, Father Constantinides has VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E844 May 1, 2003 dedicated his talents to improving the commu- nity, the Nation, and the world. During his 26-year tenure at SS. Constantine and Helen, he trained ten assistants who are now serving the Greek Orthodox Church with distinction. He was honored with the office of Protopresbyter in 1972, and he served as the Treasurer and member of the National Presbyters Council from 1970-1974, and again from 1980-1982. He received the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America Service Award and Gold Cross in 1976 for his struggles and lobbying activities for the liberation of invaded Cyprus, a cause he continues to pursue. Fa-ther Constantinides offered his wisdom and his faith in various countries, including Russia, Kenya, Uganda, and India. He has also au-thored four Sunday school books for children, and has translated six Orthodox Service books from Greek to English. Since his retirement in June 1995, Father Constantinides has devoted his time to the Or-thodox Christian Mission Center, as well as writing, lecturing, and substituting at churches in the Chicago Diocese. In September and October 2002, he traveled to Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador at the behest of His Eminence Metropolitan Taraslos of Buenos Aires to per-form missionary work. Father Constantinides also devotes much of his time to his loving wife, Maria, and their four children. Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in thanking Father Evagoras Constantinides for his contributions to the citizens of Northwest Indiana, and to citizens of countries through-out the world. His love for his fellow man is an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to rep-resent him in Congress. f A TRIBUTE TO TEMPLE SINAI OF GLENDALE, CA HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Temple Sinai in Glendale, California. This week, Temple Sinai celebrates its 75th Anniversary, marking the extraordinary history of the synagogue and its congregation. Temple Sinai was incorporated under Cali- fornia State Law on June 22, 1928, as the Sinai Community Center. At that time, the fledgling congregation consisted of fewer than a dozen Jewish families and met in the Ma-sonic Hall located above the Ralph's Grocery Store at the corner of Orange and Broadway in Glendale. Using various venues for its func-tions until 1939, the congregation found its first permanent home at 425 West Windsor Road. Ten years later, the congregation con-structed the first segment of its current home at 1212 North Pacific Avenue, and it has since grown both in physical plant and congrega-tional census. Today the congregation has 300 member families\u2014including mine\u2014of all ages and backgrounds, serving Jews who live in Glen-dale, Burbank, Los Angeles, La Canada, La Crescenta, Pasadena, South Pasadena, San Marino, and Thousand Oaks. There are 240 students in the combined Religious and He-brew Schools. A larger cadre of volunteers manages the many opportunities for involve-ment in the community, from ritual and reli- gious services to advisory and policy-making bodies. The goals of the congregation embody the values of Judaism and its continuity. The con-gregation strengthens Judaism and Jewish values within and among the members of the local Jewish community, provides strength and support to members of the community who ex-perience tragedy and grief in their lives, cele-brates with members of the community the joyous occasions of their families, provides leadership experiences for Jews in the com-munity so that they can undertake leadership of the synagogue in the future, and educates non-Jews as to the norms and traditions of Ju-daism. I am proud to be able to recognize Temple Sinai for its 75 years of offering a place of sol-emn and joyous worship to the people of Glendale and the nearby foothill communities. My heartfelt ''Mazel Tov'' on this milestone. Today, Temple Sinai exemplifies the role con-gregations of every faith have within commu-nities as a refuge for all who come to worship together regardless of differences. I ask all Members to join me in congratulating Temple Sinai for their 75 years of remarkable achieve-ment and to wish Temple Sinai all the best as your congregation grows from strength to strength. f PROPOSAL SEEKS TO CURTAIL IDENTITY THEFT HON. GERALD D. KLECZKA OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KLECZKA. Mr. Speaker, for the fourth consecutive session of Congress, I am intro-ducing the Personal Information Privacy Act (PIPA), which would help restore individuals' control over the use of their Social Security numbers and personal information. Over the years, the Social Security number (SSN) has unfortunately become a de facto national identifier. SSNs are required to re-ceive a driver's license from every state, and many companies require consumers to pro-vide their SSN as a condition of doing busi-ness. This means that should one's SSN fall into the wrong hands, it can be used to steal one's identity, run up thousands of dollars of false charges in your name, and wreak havoc on your credit history. The issue of identity theft has grown to be the largest single complaint received by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and curbing the rampant use of the SSN\u2014''the key to identity theft''\u2014is paramount in reducing iden-tity theft and restoring citizens' ability to pro-tect their personal information. Under this legislation, PIPA, businesses would be prohibited from refusing to sell goods or services to individuals that do not want to provide their SSN. Furthermore, with-out written consent, one's SSN could not be used for commercial purposes or used as an identifier. Neither could information on prod-ucts or services bought by an individual and where they were purchased\u2014known as trans-action histories\u2014be sold to third parties. Lastly, individuals would be permitted to seek redress for violations of this measure in civil courts, with the statute of limitations be-ginning to toll three years after the offense was discovered. PIPA would also establish penalties for the use of Social Security num-bers without a consumer's consent of up to $25,000 for a single offense, and up to $500,000 for repeated violations. Any victim of identity theft could tell you the difficulty of restoring one's credit and good name. Identity theft is on the rise, and topped the FTC's consumer fraud list for the third year in a row. Unless action is taken to curb the widespread use of SSNs as identifiers or as a condition of doing business, this crime will continue to harm increasing numbers of our citizens. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this leg- islation, and give Americans the ability to bet-ter safeguard themselves from identity theft. f RECOGNITION OF MASSACHUSETTS STATE TROOPER SCOTT M CDON- ALD HON. JOHN W. OLVER OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call your attention to the story of a citizen of the First Congressional District of Massachusetts, State Trooper Scott McDonald. Recently, the Mas-sachusetts State Police awarded Scott a Medal of Lifesaving, an honor bestowed upon Troopers who undertake significant actions in the saving of another life. During patrol on August 4, 2002, Trooper McDonald responded to a motor vehicle acci-dent in the town of Deerfield. He arrived at the scene to find a truck overturned on the road. The driver was unconscious, without a pulse and not breathing. Immediately, Scott adminis-tered CPR on the accident victim. While per-forming resuscitation, a passing motorist stopped, identified herself as a doctor and said she would pronounce the victim dead. However, Trooper McDonald continued life-saving efforts. Amazingly, the driver was ulti-mately revived and flown to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield. Mr. Speaker, Trooper McDonald is a fine example of the Commonwealth's outstanding first responder community. Troopers like Scott are especially important in the First Congres-sional District, as many of the towns rely on the State Police for their emergency and law enforcement needs. I join the Massachusetts State Police, the City of Holyoke, and Scott's family and friends in honoring Massachusetts State Trooper Scott McDonald. f TRIBUTE TO FRED LEVY HON. SAM FARR OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Fred Levy, an extremely gift-ed educator who dedicated much of his life to expanding horizons for his students. Mr. Levy, an instructor at Cabrillo College for over 30 years, passed away April 9, 2003, at the age of 69. A valued teacher, husband and father, all who knew him respected Fred for his pas-sion and sincerity. Mr. Levy is survived by his VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, E845 May 1, 2003 wife, Robley Levy; three children Rebecca, Barnaby, and Elizabeth; and six grandchildren. Mr. Levy was born in 1934 in Cairo, Egypt, where his father was working as a cor-respondent for the New York Times. At the age of 7, Sadie Miller, a family friend took him under her wing and fled Egypt to escape im-peding Nazi troops. They went to great lengths to avoid the Nazis and eventually trav-eled up the coast of South America and the United States until they reached New York. Fred's parents arrived shortly thereafter, and the family remained in the city until Fred grad-uated from Amherst College in 1955. Mr. Levy went on to serve in the United States Army, retiring only to pursue a master's degree in poetry at Stanford University. Mr. Levy was appointed to the Cabrillo Col- lege faculty in 1963 as an instructor in both English and speech. Immediately deemed an integral part of the staff, Fred became a much loved teacher that students would seek out for advice and support. Fred was a proactive edu-cator and successfully introduced new aca-demic programs to Cabrillo with the intentions of increasing the variety of subject matter pre-sented in the classroom. Colleagues marveled at his ability to turn shy first-year students into confident university bound scholars through these programs along with his engaging lec-tures. Not only was Fred passionate about teaching, he also enjoyed acting and directing in Cabrillo College's theater production com-pany. Those who knew Fred best noted that he was also a Shakespeare zealot and fre-quently organized trips to Oregon for the Shakespeare Festival. Fred retired after a long and successful career in 1995. Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my condo- lences to Robley and the Levy family during these difficult times. His legacy as a devoted teacher and scholar will blossom as his stu-dents apply the lessons taught in his class-room to succeed in life. Those who had the pleasure of sharing Fred's company have and will continue to benefit from his sincere appre-ciation of life and education. f UPON INTRODUCTION OF THE ES- SENTIAL AIR SERVICE ELIGI-BILITY FAIRNESS ACT OF 2003 HON. JOSEPH R. PITTS OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduced the Essential Air Service Eligibility Fairness Act of 2003, a bill to provide much needed fi-nancial relief to the Lancaster Airport and other airports throughout the United States that are adversely impacted by the existing law. Under current law, if an airport is located fewer than 70 highway miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport, the airport is in-eligible to receive a subsidy from the Essential Air Service Program. However, current law allows the Department of Transportation to determine whether or not a given airport meets the criteria for receiving the EAS subsidy. State and local officials are better able to determine the most commonly traveled routes in their communities. In my own Congressional District, the Lan- caster Airport has been affected by this de-bate. On March 21, 2003, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Department of Transpor-tation's decision to deny Lancaster Airport an EAS subsidy because Lancaster Airport was deemed to be located within 70 highway miles of Philadelphia Airport. The Lancaster Airport and my constituents were dismayed at this decision. The route that the Department of Transpor- tation used is not the most commonly used highway route and would take over three hours to drive. The most commonly traveled route is located 80 highway miles from Phila-delphia Airport, but takes only one and a half hours to drive. I am introducing this legislation today, to empower a Governor or a local Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) to determine eli-gibility for local EAS subsidies. Having worked with local MPOs in my dis- trict, I am confident that these determinations should be made at the state and local level. A Lancaster County rank seventh in the state for air service demand and generates over 876,000 annual originating air trips. Addi-tionally, these air travelers pay more than $20 million per year in aviation taxes. Lancaster County with over 11,000 busi- nesses and a population of over 472,000 needs and deserves commercial air service. This legislation will ensure that communities like Lancaster County continue to receive quality local air service. I urge Congress to support this legislation. f HONORING STAFF SERGEANT SCOTT SATHER, SERGEANT MI-CHAEL F. PEDERSON, SPE-CIALIST RICHARD A. GOWARD, AND PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JASON M. MEYER HON. DALE E. KILDEE OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KILDEE.

May their sacrifices to be remembered always. f HONORING CHATTANOOGA BAR ASSOCIATION HON. ZACH WAMP OF TENNESSEE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work of the Chattanooga Bar Asso-ciation in my hometown of Chattanooga, Ten-nessee and join them in celebrating their up-coming Law Day luncheon on May 7, 2003. In 1957, American Bar Association Presi- dent Charles S. Rhyne, a Washington, D.C. attorney, envisioned a special day for cele-brating our legal system and the freedoms we enjoy as Americans. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed a ''Law Day'' to strengthen our great heritage of lib-erty, justice, and equality under the law. In 1961, May 1st was designated by a joint reso-lution of Congress as the official date for cele-brating Law Day. On this Law Day 2003, we have the oppor- tunity to re-examine how we, as a nation, want our judiciary to function. At a time when par-tisanship and special interests try to shape a judiciary, we have the responsibility to reaffirm VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E846 May 1, 2003 our commitment to an independent third branch of government. This year on May 7th, the Chattanooga Bar Association will honor the legal community of Chattanooga, Tennessee with their annual Law Day luncheon. During the luncheon, the Chattanooga Bar Association will honor Judith P. Medearis with the 2003 ''Liberty Bell Award.'' This award, given to a person who is not in the legal profession, is one of the CBA's highest honors. The purpose of the ''Liberty Bell Award'' is to recognize community service that has strengthened the American system of freedom under law.

ACKERMAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to call to the attention of the House Mr. Edward J. McElroy, an extraordinary federal em-ployee\u2014a person who would typically be re-ferred to in this chamber as a bureaucrat. In-deed, he is one, the interim director of the De-partment of Justice's new Bureau of Immigra-tion and Customs Enforcement in New York. But in my community in New York, we don't think of him as a bureaucrat, or as a cog in the impersonal and vast machinery of the fed-eral government. In Queens, Ed McElroy is a hero. About 3 weeks ago I called him after discov- ering that a young man in my community, Mo-hammad Sarfaraz Hussain, was on the verge of being deported. Now eighteen, this young man came to New York from Pakistan when he was a seven year old little boy, to be with his mother as she died in the hospital. Only a few short years later, his father died of a heart attack leaving him an orphan. Despite these tragedies, Mohammad thrived in Queens. Living with his aunt and uncle, and with the support of his siblings and cousins, his school and his friends, Mohammad has grown to be the kind of young man all of us hope our society produces: decent, modest and responsible, a varsity basketball player with a crowd of friends and a bright future ahead of him. But in February, after reporting to immigra- tion officials in New York under the special registration program implemented after 9/11 to screen male aliens from high-risk states, Mo-hammad was told that he was in our country illegally and that our federal government would seek his deportation. He was supposed to ap-pear before a federal judge today. A terrible tragedy was unfolding, a young man, an orphan, who since he was in second grade had only known life in America, was only weeks away from being sent to Pakistan, where he had no family and knew no one. Mr. Speaker, this scenario is not what we had in mind when the special screening proce-dures were put in place. The new screening policy makes a lot of sense for the security of our nation, it made no sense when applied in this case. The most threatening thing about Mohammad Hussain is his jump shot. But the story has a happy ending Mr. Speaker because in New York, the federal government is lucky enough to have Ed McElroy making decisions about the enforce-ment of immigration laws. Instead of ducking his head, instead of hid- ing behind rules and regulations to avoid mak-ing a decision, Ed McElroy did the kind of job we all hope our federal employees will do. He investigated, he looked deeper, he performed due diligence, he protected the interests of the United States and most importantly, he did the right thing. After taking all the steps necessary to en- sure that America's interests were met first, Ed McElroy notified me that he had reviewed Mr. Hussain's case would exercise prosecu-torial discretion in not removing him from the United States. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot to be proud of in a case like this. There is, of course, Moham-mad Hussain, a young man like millions of others who has come to this country in tragic circumstances and has come to know, love and live the American dream. And, making the continuation of this Amer- ican story possible is a federal employee, a bureaucrat. A hero named Ed McElroy who understands that his responsibility as a guard-ian of our nation's borders and laws is not just the implementation of regulations, but the use of judgement in the pursuit of justice. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call the House's attention to the great job Ed McElroy has done, and I know the whole House will join me in thanking him for his service, which is a credit to the entire United States government.CONGRATULATIONS TO WEST AN- CHORAGE HIGH SCHOOL STU-DENTS HON. DON YOUNG OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the more than 1200 students from across the United States that traveled to Washington, D.C. this past weekend to com-pete in the national finals of the We the Peo-ple: The Citizen and the Constitution program. Administered by the Center for Civic Edu-cation and funded by the U.S. Department of Education, We the People is the most exten-sive educational program in the country devel-oped specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I am proud to announce that students from West Anchorage High School in Anchorage represented the state of Alaska in this national event. These young scholars have worked conscientiously to reach the national finals by participating at local and statewide competi-tions. As a result of their experience, they have gained a deep knowledge and under-standing of the fundamental principles and val-ues of our constitutional democracy. For the first time in the competition's history, a team from Alaska participated in the events' final round and finished the competition in 4th Place. The three-day We the People national com- petition is modeled after hearings in the United States Congress. The hearings consist of oral presentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on constitutional topics. The students are given an opportunity to dem-onstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant histor-ical and contemporary issues. Their testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges who probe the students' depth of un-derstanding and ability to apply their constitu-tional knowledge. The We the People program provides cur- ricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels. The curriculum not only enhances students' understanding of the institutions of American constitutional democ-racy, it also helps them identify the contem-porary relevance of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Critical thinking exercises, problem-solving activities, and cooperative learning techniques help develop participatory skills necessary for students to become active, re-sponsible citizens. Independent studies by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) revealed that students enrolled in the We the People program at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels ''significantly outperformed comparison students on every topic of the tests taken.'' Another study by Richard Brody at Stanford University discovered that students involved in the We the People program develop greater commitment to democratic principles and val-ues than do students using traditional text-books and approaches. I am proud to have the class from West An- chorage High School represent my home state of Alaska and I applaud their historic 4th Place finish. It is inspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental ideals and prin-ciples of our government, ideas that identify us VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E847 May 1, 2003 as a people and bind us together as a nation. It is important for future generations to under-stand these values and principles, which we hold as standards in our endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional democracy. I wish these young ''constitutional experts'' the best of luck in all of their future endeavors. f IMPROVING EDUCATION RESULTS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABIL-ITIES ACT OF 2003 SPEECH OF HON. MAX SANDLIN OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1350) to reauthor-ize the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-cation Act, and for other purposes: Mr. SANDLIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak regarding H.R. 1350, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It is with great regret that I feel compelled to vote against the IDEA reauthorization bill. I had looked forward to voting on a bill that fi-nally provides adequate resources for students with disabilities, their families, and teachers. I had looked forward to voting on a bill that would continue to protect the unique needs of children with disabilities. Unfortunately, the measure offered by the majority failed on both these counts and does a disservice to the teachers and the children that they serve. I am profoundly disappointed that once again our Congress has failed to live up to the funding promises of the original Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, passed in 1975. The original bill recognized our federal responsibility to help states provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities. While the original law promised to fund 40% of states' costs to educate these special needs children, Congress has never funded more than 18%. Without appropriate funds, schools are caught in a failing bal-ancing act, trying to provide adequate re-sources to students with disabilities while also meeting the needs of typical students. I know the rural schools in the First District of Texas simply cannot wait any longer for the relief they so badly need. We should have finally committed ourselves to fulfilling the promise of IDEA with mandatory funding for these stu-dents. Anything less is unacceptable. I am also deeply concerned regarding the discipline provisions in H.R. 1350 for children with disabilities. No one believes that teachers and principals should not have the right to dis-cipline students. However, this bill eliminates protections that children with disabilities de-serve in consideration of their limitations. Cur-rent law requires schools to determine wheth-er a student's actions were the result of a dis-ability before determining a punishment. This new bill does not do so and puts more stu-dents at risk for suspension or expulsion. It is important that we retain protections for the best interests of these children, and remember the challenges they endure. This IDEA bill also fails to protect families who feel their school system is not complying with their children's needs. Previously there was no statute of limitations on parents' rights to file grievances against the schools. This new bill requires that they do so within one year of the incident. Often times parents aren't aware of the rights that their children are enti-tled to under IDEA and do not fully understand what services would best suit their child. While we should discuss the need for closure on po-tential liability for schools, certainly parents should have more than one year to appeal their schools' decisions. My mother was a school teacher for 30 years and has well impressed upon me the challenges of teaching children with disabilities without the resources to back it up. I have talked with parents of special needs children at length about the struggles they face in get-ting their children the services they so badly need. Our parents and teachers desperately need our help and this bill fails to meet the mark. For these reasons, I cannot support the IDEA re-authorization bill, but will continue to fight in Congress to give our communities the educational resources they deserve. f TRIBUTE TO AIR FORCE LT. GENERAL ROGER D EKOK HON. JANE HARMAN OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life and career of my friend, Air Force Lt. General Roger DeKok. General DeKok died suddenly last week while on a business trip. My heartfelt condo-lences, and those of the many individuals in the South Bay he commanded and who were his friends, go to his wife, Carol, and family. I first met General DeKok when he assumed command in August 1996 of the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles Air Force Base in my district. SMC is the Air Force's pre-eminent procurement center for space-based systems, including the nation's sophisticated surveillance satellites and tech-nology to track and intercept enemy missiles. Commander of SMC for only two years, General DeKok excelled in motivating people. His loyalty, warmth and kind personality are virtues for which he will be remembered. Under his leadership, SMC continued its tradi-tion of excellence and continued to produce many of the high quality space-based systems necessary for the war fighter of the 21st cen-tury. General DeKok's activities and passion cen- tered on the frontiers of outer space. He served in numerous space plans and oper-ations positions, from detachment level to space policy work in the White House, and commanded two space wings. While serving at the Pentagon in 1983, he coordinated the Air Force Space Plan. During his assignment to the White House National Security Council, he helped develop and co-ordinate the U.S. National Space Policy that was signed by President Reagan in January 1988. Prior to assuming his last position as vice commander of Air Force Space Com-mand at Peterson AFB, he served as deputy chief of staff for plans and programs at Head-quarters U.S. Air Force, where he was respon-sible to the secretary of the Air Force and the chief of staff for planning, programming and manpower activities within the corporate Air Force. General DeKok retired from the Air Force in April 2002 after 34 years of service and joined TRW Inc., which was later acquired by Nor-throp Grumman Corp. At the time of his pass-ing, he was vice president and deputy general manager of Northrop Grumman's Command, Control & Intelligence Division. Roger DeKok deserves the thanks of a grateful nation. He will be sorely missed by his family, friends and the communities he served. f CONGRATULATING CHARTER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FOR THEIR ONGOING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION SPEECH OF HON. RON KIND OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 29, 2003 Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, as well as co-chair of National Charter School Week, I strongly support the H. Res. 204, leg-islation honoring National Charter Schools Week. Public schools are America's commitment to providing a high quality education for every child. I am dedicated to ensuring that all chil-dren have the opportunity to receive a quality education regardless of what public school they attend. This includes charter schools, which are models of successful education re-form and one of the fastest growing education innovations working to improve our public edu-cation. As a National Co-Chair of Charter Schools, I would like to take a minute to celebrate the first decade of Charter Schools in the United States. Traditionally, charter schools are inde-pendent public schools, designed and oper-ated by educators, parents, community mem-bers and others. Since the first charter school began operation in 1992 in St. Paul, Min-nesota, the number of charter schools has grown to nearly 2,700, serving 500,000 stu-dents around the country. I am proud to say that we currently have 128 charter schools operating across the state of Wisconsin. In my congressional district alone, we have 20 charter schools presently and that number grows each year. Just last week, I took the opportunity to visit the LaCrosseroads Charter School in my hometown of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and was impressed by all of the wonderful things that have been accomplished there in just the past several years. The interests, involvement and stewardship of these charter school students extend well beyond La Crosse and reach out beyond the borders of this country with their active participation in the Red Cross School Chest Program. For this program, LaCrosseroads students have been collecting school supplies for Red Cross distribution to children in other countries, who are unable to attend school because of war or natural disas-ters. Charter schools have consistently been at the forefront of my priority list, and I am pleased that Wisconsin is one of seven states with over 100 exceptional charter schools. I have consistently advocated for increased VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E848 May 1, 2003 funding for Charter Schools and supported the Charter School Facilities Financing Dem-onstration Program during consideration of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001. Mr. Speaker, I recognize that charter schools give parents options when deter-mining the best public school in which to enroll their children. Thus, we must ensure that all our students reach their highest academic po-tential, which may require attending a charter school that provides a model better suited to-wards an individual student's needs. f H.R. 1350, IMPROVING EDUCATION RESULTS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 2003 SPEECH OF HON. JAMES T. WALSH OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 Mr. WALSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1350, Improving Education Results for Children with Disabilities Act of 2003. More than two decades ago, the federal government imposed special education man-dates on states and local school districts. Ever since then, the federal government has strug-gled to fund those mandates. Our nation's special needs children require a special commitment. And I'm pleased that this Congress has met that commitment with this IDEA renewal and reauthorization bill. It is important to note that since 1996 when Republicans regained the majority of this body, overall federal IDEA funding to states and school districts has increased by 282.3%. From 1996 to 2003, IDEA spending has in-creased an average of 18.6% per year\u2014that's more than double the average annual in-creases from 1988 to 1995 when Democrats held the majority. This bill reauthorizes that renewed commit- ment that our party has brought to our nation's education policy. Not only is it Congress' re-sponsibility to financially support the provision of special education by local school districts, it is our duty to ensure that no child is left be-hind in America's classrooms. Today, with this legislation we reaffirm this important priority. In addition to renewing our continued com- mitment to special needs education funding, H.R. 1350 increases accountability and im-proves education results for children with dis-abilities by deemphasizing compliance with complicated rules, diverting that attention to delivering academic results. It ensures that parents of special needs children will receive report cards from schools showing academic progress indicators beginning in 2005, just as the No Child Left Behind reforms implemented such policies for mainstream students. H.R. 1350 reduces the Individualized Edu- cation Plan, or IEP, paperwork burden on dis-tricts and special education teachers, length-ening the required IEP filing from every one to three years, though these provisions in the bill are options for BOTH states and parents. If parents opt for an annual IEP, this package continues to guarantee that right. By amend-ing lengthy paperwork requirements, we en-sure that teachers will spend more of their time on instructing students and less on filing government forms. In addition, H.R. 1350 improves early inter- vention strategies to reduce overidentifying or even misidentifying students as those with special needs. This legislation will give flexi-bility to local districts to use a percentage of funds for pre-referral services. Finally, this legislation supports general edu- cation and special education teachers by pro-viding for appropriate professional develop-ment and encouraging innovative approaches to parental involvement and parental choice. Mr. Chairman, local school districts through- out my congressional district in New York State face uncertain fiscal times this coming budget year and, quite possibly, well into the near future. Funding instructional services for students with special needs is an enormous burden these districts bear. I urge my col-leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1350 to more fully share in this responsibility. f REGULATORY CERTAINTY HON. MARY BONO OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mrs. BONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on an issue of critical importance to our economy. Throughout the broadband debate over the past two years, we have all heard from car-riers of all shapes and sizes. They have very different business plans and different opinions on the way competition should proceed. The one common message from all of these dis-parate companies, however, is a strong and urgent call for regulatory certainty. Individual investors, Wall Street analysts and companies alike all demand it. I fear that the recent FCC action on the Tri- ennial Review threatens to exponentially in-crease regulatory uncertainty for the tele-communications sector. I fear lawsuits all across the country that will drag out resolution of these important issues for many years to come. Our world of digital packets of informa-tion traveling at the speed of light knows no geographic boundaries. However the resulting state-by-state patchwork of burdensome regu-lations threatens to pose yet another obstacle to getting reasonably priced broadband to our constituents. The old adage is true, you can't make ev- eryone happy, all of the time. But if we level the playing field and let the markets work, the smart people in these companies can at least develop business plans and investors can judge their strategy on the merits. These com-panies need some clear direction so they can plan their futures, adjust, adapt and deliver for their shareholders and consumers. Just ten short years ago we watched as the telecommunications sector drove the greatest economic expansion in the history of the world. The American people that are suffering through this depressed economy demand leadership. We must provide certainty and sta-bility to the telecommunications sector so that our markets can work and drive our economy to greatness once again.IN HONOR OF THE U.S. CHAMPION MOORPARK HIGH SCHOOL DE-CATHLON TEAM HON. ELTON GALLEGLY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. GALLEGLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec- ognize the Moorpark High School Academic Decathlon Team as the United States Aca-demic Decathlon Champions. This is the second time in five years that Moorpark High School's team has won this premiere scholastic contest. Prior to its win in 1999, no team from Ventura County, Cali-fornia, had even competed in the nationals. Team members Lindsay Hebert, Nathaniel Jones, Adam Abed, Paul Ideal, Kevin Randolf, Ashlee Scott, Grant Volk, Tracy Yagi and Max Geiger are now recognized as the best and the brightest in the country. They are the pride of their school, their community and their country. These youngsters won by literally dedicating their lives to the challenge. For nine months they put in up to 40 hours a week beyond their school days to study and hone their skills. They gave up weekends, vacations, part-time jobs and time with their families. Their hard work paid off. Last weekend, Moorpark scored 51,423 points out of a pos-sible 60,000 points to win the national title against 37 other teams from throughout the country. They brought home 15 gold, nine sil-ver and seven bronze medals. Their coach, Larry Jones, worked as hard, if not harder, than his students and is as deserv-ing of high praise. Coach Jones has said he will retire from the team after 12 years of lead-ing dozens of students to victory at the county, state and national level. He said the same thing after winning the 1999 championship, but this time he says he means it. At a minimum, he has earned some relaxation in the glow of a job well done\u2014again. I know my colleagues will join me in wishing him the best in what-ever his future brings. Mr. Speaker, I also know my colleagues will join me in applauding nine outstanding stu-dents who achieved a very prestigious goal\u2014Lindsay Hebert, Nathaniel Jones, Adam Abed, Paul Ideal, Kevin Randolf, Ashlee Scott, Grant Volk, Tracy Yagi and Max Geiger\u2014the U.S. champion Moorpark High School Academic Decathlon Team. f VOTER PROTECTION ACT HON. RON PAUL OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the Voter Protection Act. Unlike most so-called ''campaign reform'' proposals, the Voter Pro-tection Act enhances fundamental liberties and expands the exchange of political ideas. The Voter Fairness Act accomplishes this goal by lowering and standardizing the requirements for, and the time required to get, signatures to qualify a Federal candidate for the ballot. Many states have unfair rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for minor party and independent candidates to get on the bal-lot. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E849 May 1, 2003 I want to make 4 points about this bill. First, it is constitutional. Article I, section 4, explicitly authorizes the U.S. Congress to, ''At any time by law make or alter such regulations regard-ing the manner of holding elections.'' This is the authority that was used for the Voter Rights Act of 1965. The second point I would like to make is an issue of fairness. Because so many states re-quire independent candidates to collect an ex-cessive amount of signatures in a short period of time, many individuals are excluded from the ballot. For instance, there has not been one minor party candidate on the Georgia bal-lot since 1943, because of Georgia's overly strict ballot access requirements. This is un-fair. The Voter Protection Act corrects this. My third point addresses those who worry about overcrowding on the ballot. In fact, there have been statistical studies made of states that have minimal signature requirements and generous grants of time to collect the signa-tures. Instead of overcrowding, these states have an average of 3.3 candidates per ballot. The fourth point that I would like to make is that complying with ballot access rules drains resources from even those minor party can-didates able to comply with these onerous rules. This obviously limits the ability of minor party candidates to communicate their mes-sage and ideas to the general public. Perhaps the ballot access laws are one reason why voter turnout has been declining over the past few decades. After all, almost 42 percent of el-igible voters have either not registered to vote or registered as something other than Demo-crat or Republican. The Voter Protection Act is a constitutional way to reform campaign laws to increase voter participation by making the election process fairer and open to new candidates and ideas. I hope all my colleagues will join me in sup-porting this true campaign reform bill. f CONTINUING SUPPORT OF U.S. ARMED FORCES HON. JOE WILSON OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak- er, I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces, who continue to act with honor, courage, valor, and respect. Operation Iraqi Freedom was fought with precision and ended deci-sively. Through the sweat and blood of our troops a vicious dictator's regime has ended, the American people are safer, and an oppressed people have new hope for the future. These extraordinary men and women risked their lives for this noble cause, while many nations stood on the sidelines, once again proving that America is the symbol of liberty and freedom in the world. I encourage Americans to continue their support of our troops and their families, even long after the war no longer headlines on our nightly news. I commend radio host Mike Gal-lagher for doing his part, in organizing a ben-efit concert, featuring the Marshall Tucker Band, for military families in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and I hope others follow his lead. May Cod bless our troops and may Cod bless America. f IN RECOGNITION OF WORLD WAR I VETERAN AL ROSS HON. E. CLAY SHAW, JR. OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, today I bring sad news of the passing of an American hero, Mr. Al Ross of Palm Beach County, Florida at the age of 101. Al Ross was one of the last re-maining veterans of World War I. Al was a living legend in Palm Beach Coun- ty, who freely gave of his time to educate many generations of Americans on the true meaning of service to our nation and deep un-derstanding of the Pledge of Allegiance. In countless schools and public appearances around the county, he was a fiery champion for all veterans and a defender of the flag. Up until the very last moment that continued to be his mission. In 2002, fewer than 500 veterans of World War I remained and Al was the last known survivor in Palm Beach County and the Treas-ure Coast. Still wearing his 1918 Navy uni-form, I last saw him this past July 4th speak-ing to a Town of Palm Beach picnic cele-brating America. As always, he had something new to share with his audience, and this month was looking forward to again being a featured speaker at this year's Memorial Day services at the National Cemetery. We in Congress should remember Al Ross, along with his fellow soldiers and sailors from the Great War who are rapidly departing God's green earth which they ably defended with honor and dignity. Mr. Speaker, Al Ross, small in stature, big in heart will be missed. He lived to see our military go from trench warfare to laser guided missiles, from Verdun to Baghdad. Yet as Al Ross would say, our flag was still there bring-ing freedom and hope to people around the world. In Al's honor I close with his favorite, The Pledge of Allegiance, which he recited many hundreds of times and explained its meaning in his own colorful way. ''I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, in-divisible with liberty and justice for all.'' Mr. Speaker, I salute Al Ross on behalf of a grateful nation. f HONORING THE MEMORY OF BRIG. GEN. AUSTIN SHOFNER HON. BART GORDON OF TENNESSEE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the memory of a great American hero and warrior, Brig. Gen. Austin C. Shofner, who retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in 1959 to return back to his home of Shelbyville, Tennessee. At the time of his death in 1999, Gen. Shofner was the state's most decorated vet-eran, having survived the Bataan Death March during World War II. Not only did the tena-cious Marine survive this harrowing experi-ence, but he escaped his captors to report the atrocity to the rest of the world. Once he re-covered from the starvation and severe beat-ings inflicted on him during his captivity, he was given command of a battalion that fero-ciously fought on the western Pacific shores of Peleliu, where he was badly wounded. Refusing to be sidelined for long, Gen. Shofner recovered from his wounds and led another battalion of Marines that attacked the enemy on the island of Okinawa. He was only 28 years old at the end of World War II. Through the courageous actions of warriors like Gen. Shofner, the United States of Amer-ica has persevered against its enemies. We are once again facing uncertain times and an unconventional enemy, so it is appropriate that we remember our nation's past heroes. Their deeds and acts of bravery are an inspiration to America's current breed of fighting men and women who go in harm's way to protect us and the interests of this great nation. God bless the brave men and women who wear and have worn the uniforms of our Armed Forces. And God bless the sacrifices they have made and will continue to make to keep this country free. Brig. Gen. Austin Shofner made many sacrifices when his coun-try depended on him the most. He is the epit-ome of courage and honor and will forever be remembered as a true hero. f INTRODUCTION OF THE RUNAWAY, HOMELESS, AND MISSING CHIL-DREN PROTECTION ACT HON. PHIL GINGREY OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker Today I intro- duce the Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act. This legislation con-tains the reauthorization of both the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and the Missing Chil-dren's Assistance Act. This bill strengthens the programs and services authorized under these acts in order to better address the needs of the at-risk youth served. The changes that were made to the Run- away and Homeless Youth Act will allow for a larger percentage of the allocation to go to-ward Transitional Living Programs. This will help to meet the need that exists for these programs so older runaway and homeless youth can develop the skills and resources to promote their independence and prevent fu-ture dependency on social services. Addition-ally, youth who are participating in the Transi-tional Living Program who come to the end of their 18 month stay before they reach the age of 18 will now be able to receive an exception to stay in the Transitional Living Program until they are 18 years old. The bill clarifies that term ''group homes'' in the Transitional Living Program includes ''maternity group homes.'' These group homes operate currently and have been successful at providing child devel-opment, family budgeting, health and nutrition, and other skills to promote the parent's long-term economic independence in order to en-sure the well-being of the child. The Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E850 May 1, 2003 Act authorizes parts A (Basic Centers Pro- gram), B (Transitional Living Program), C (Na-tional Communications System), and D (Co-ordination, Training, Research, and Other Ac-tivities) at $105 million for fiscal year 2004 and at such sums for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 and authorizes part E (Street Outreach Program) at such sums for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. Additionally, the bill addresses the needs of missing, abducted, and sexually exploited chil-dren by reauthorizing the Missing Children's Assistance Act. This legislation increases the authorization level of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to mirror the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploi-tation of Child Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), and extends the authorization of the re-maining activities under the Act through 2008. The Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Chil-dren Protection Act also allows the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to coordinate the operation of a cyber tipline to provide online users an effective means of re-porting Internet-related child sexual exploi-tation in the areas of distribution of child por-nography, online enticement of children for sexual acts, and child prostitution. This piece of legislation has been worked out in a very bipartisan fashion and I am happy that we were able to come together to help address the needs of runaway, homeless, missing and exploited youth. These at-risk youth receive much needed services through these Acts and I urge my colleagues to sup-port this important piece of legislation. f HONORING MR. FRED LEWIS HON. HENRY J. HYDE OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to your attention today the exemplary work and most commendable public service of a fine and most outstanding music teacher, Mr. Fred Lewis. After 45 years as director of the Fenton High School Band located in Bensenville, Illinois, Mr. Fred Lewis is retiring in June of 2003. During his tenure, he has instructed over 2000 band members and conducted hundreds of community concerts. Since 1955 the band has toured every two years throughout the United States and Europe gaining national and international recognition. Mr. Lewis' final concert will be held on May 10, 2003. At that time, a scholarship fund will be established in Mr. Lewis' name at Fenton High School. Each year the Fred Lewis Schol-arship Fund Committee will provide a cash award to a graduating senior band member to be used for continuing music education. Also, the Fenton Auditorium will be renamed Lewis/Huffman Auditorium. I hope my colleagues will join me in hon- oring and offering congratulations to this out-standing teacher of 45 years for his selfless dedication to his students and to Fenton High School.TRIBUTE TO THE MARINES FROM THE 2ND BATTALION, 23RD MA-RINE REGIMENT, 4TH MARINE DIVISION HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Marines from the 2nd Bat-talion, 23rd Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Divi-sion, headquartered in Encino, CA and to their families who support them, give them strength, and struggle heroically to keep things going at home while they serve overseas. I am particularly pleased to join Major Gen- eral John J. McCarthy, Commanding General, 4th Marine Division, Judge Harry Pregerson and all of the family members of this Battalion in celebrating our own special ''Marine Family Day,'' an event which is planned both to pro-vide some recreation for the family members of our reservists and to honor the more than 900 members of this Marine Forces Reserve unit who served in Iraq, and especially those 38 who were wounded in action. Sadly, one Marine, Staff Sergeant James Cawley was killed in action during this conflict. Since the creation of the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marines in July 1942, the battalion has val-iantly fought in numerous campaigns from World War II where its members saw action at Iwo Jima and Saipan to Desert Shield, Oper-ation Desert Storm, and, of course, Operation Iraqi Freedom. They were deployed in Feb-ruary of this year, and have earned the dis-tinction of being the longest-serving reserve unit in theater. While this status has earned them honor and respect, it was gained at enormous sacrifice on the part of both them and their loved ones. Not only have these reservists risked their lives, many have taken steep pay cuts and put their careers on hold to do so. They have missed birthdays, holidays, and other impor-tant family events. These men and women are police officers, firemen, doctors, lawyers, ex-ecutives, and workers of every stripe and vari-ety; people who make up the fabric of our communities. They are our husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters and friends. They are patriots. I am proud that many of these reservists and their families live and work in my congres-sional district and I am honored to be cele-brating with them this Saturday. I ask my col-leagues to join with me in saluting the men, women, and families of the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division. f CELEBRATING POLISH CONSTITUTION DAY HON. RAHM EMANUEL OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in celebration of Polish Constitution Day, Satur-day, May 3rd. More than 111,000 people of Polish descent live in the Fifth Congressional District of Illinois. Amazingly, Chicago has more people of Polish descent than any other city except Warsaw, and I know they will all be reflecting on their proud heritage this Satur- day. Members of this body may not be aware of the Third of May Constitution, but passed on May 3, 1791, it was the second constitution in the world\u2014second only to the Constitution of the United States. It was the first in Europe. This important event in the history of Poland, indeed the history of the world, is too often overlooked. Recently, however, there has been a movement to resurrect the memory of this important event, and today I stand before you in honor of its significance. Slavic in origin, Poland has a tremendous history of more than a thousand years. During that time it has been invaded, occupied and liberated on numerous occasions. Yet, throughout a tumultuous history, Poland has remained uniquely Polish. Today Poland plays a vital role in Eastern Europe and is a friend to the United States. Like most of Europe, Poland began life as a feudal state. But it also has a rich demo-cratic history. In 1346 Casimir the Great es-tablished the first Polish legal code and in 1364 laid the foundation of Krakow University, providing two vital ingredients for democracy\u2014rule of law and an educated populace. In 1430, Poland established the ''Nieminem Captivabimus,'' similar to our Habeas Corpus. By 1493, Poland established a Parliament with two houses, a Senate of dignitaries, and the Sejm which consisted of elected representa-tives. Following 1505, Parliament's consent was required for all new laws. The Third of May Constitution represents the culmination of these democratic reforms. On May 3rd, 1791, the Sejm passed the Government Act, or what is today known as the Third of May Constitution. Embracing En-lightenment ideals like Rousseau's doctrine of national sovereignty and Montesquieu's con-cepts of a tripartite government, the Third of May Constitution demonstrates Poland's im-portant role in helping to establish the modern world. While the Government Act still retained some resemblances of Poland's feudal herit-age, it extended rights to citizens who pre-viously had little or no rights. Peasants, for ex-ample, were officially placed under the protec-tion of the ''law and government of the coun-try.'' Unfortunately, soon after enactment Rus-sia invaded Poland and the country was parti-tioned by Germany and Russia, abolishing the Constitution. Still, Poland can proudly look back on 1791 as a time when Poland helped establish modern democracy. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday I look forward to joining the people of my district, as well as those of Polish descent around the world, in celebrating the common bond of democracy. I hope the members of this body will join me in saluting this important day. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. MARK STEVEN KIRK OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, on April 30, 2003, I missed rollcall vote number 149, H. Res. 206, the rule for H.R. 1350 due to my service on active duty as a reserve naval officer. Had I been present I would have voted ''yea''. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May of Remarks E851 May 1, 2003 THE INDIVIDUAL TAX SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2003 HON. RICHARD E. NEAL OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, today I am intro- ducing ''The Individual Tax Simplification Act of 2003,'' and I invite all my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation, which is identical to legislation I filed last Congress. The tax code seems to get more and more complex each year, despite calls for simplifica-tion. Recently, the Joint Tax Committee deter-mined that taxpayers are increasingly relying on paid return preparers, up 27 percent over a decade. Over the same period, the reliance on computer software has jumped from 16 percent of returns filed to 46 percent. Tax code complexity leads not only to taxpayer frustration and confusion, but also increased costs. Tax code complexity also leads to dif-ficulties for the IRS in administering our tax laws fairly and consistently. The simplification bill that I have re-intro- duced will eliminate hundreds of lines from tax forms, schedules and worksheets. I believe that it is possible and preferable to accomplish simplification in a revenue neutral manner, and without moving money between economic income groups. While some may argue that there is no constituency for simplification, I would say that is certainly changing. One sur-vey found that two-thirds of taxpayers said the federal tax system is too complicated, up from barely 50 percent five years ago. The Individual Tax Simplification Act has three parts. The first is based on legislation I introduced in the last three Congresses re-garding nonrefundable personal credits. The second part simplifies the taxation of capital gains. The third part repeals two hidden mar-ginal tax rates on high-income individuals, and repeals the individual minimum tax. Title I\u2014Simplification Relating to Nonrefund- able Personal Credits In recent years, much tax relief has been given to taxpayers in the form of nonrefund-able credits, like the education credits. These credits are not usable against the alternative minimum tax. That means that more and more individuals will lose all or part of these credits, and will have to fill out the extremely com-plicated Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) form. Congress has recognized this problem by en-acting a short-term waiver of this exclusion. Congress has also permanently taken the child credit and the adoption credit out of the AMT. Now is the time to finish the job. The other problem with nonrefundable cred- its is that the phase-out provisions vary from credit to credit, causing unnecessary com-plexity. In addition, the same additional dollar of income can result in a reduction in more than one nonrefundable credit. It is fundamen-tally wrong to promise the American public tax relief, then take all or part of it away in a back-handed manner. This fundamentally flawed policy, enacted in 1997, will get worse each and every year as more American families find themselves to be AMT taxpayers simply be-cause of the impact of inflation, or because of their desire to take advantage of the tax relief we have promised them. Not only that, this sit-uation has gotten much worse since the pas-sage of the 2001 tax cuts. This bill addresses both concerns. First, it permanently waives the minimum tax limita-tions on all nonrefundable credits. Second, the bill creates a single phase-out range for the adoption credit, the child credit, and the edu- cation credits, replacing the current three phase-out ranges. Title II\u2014Simplification of Capital Gains Tax The second title of this bill substantially sim- plifies taxation of capital gains. Under current law, there are five different tax rates for long-term capital gains, and a complicated, 40-line tax form that must be endured. Moreover, this part of the tax code is already scheduled to get worse because additional rates will take affect under current law in 2006. The solution is clear. Replace this jumble of rates and forms with a simple 38 percent exclusion. Not only will this result in tremendous simplifica-tion, but more than 97 percent of individuals would be eligible for modest capital gains tax reductions. Title III\u2014Repeal of Certain Hidden Marginal Rate Increases, and of the Individual Min-imum Tax The third title of the bill repeals the hidden marginal rate increases in current law, and re-peals the individual minimum tax. For many taxpayers, discovery of the Personal Exemp-tions Phaseout (PEP) and the ''Pease,'' which limits itemized deductions, can be both con-fusing and disappointing. Under current law, itemized deductions are gradually reduced by 3 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) above approximately $139,000, or by 80 percent of the otherwise allowable itemized deductions for individuals exceeding $139,000 AGI, whichever is lower. This is known as the Pease provision. In addi-tion, personal exemptions are gradually phased out for incomes between approxi-mately $139,000 and $262,000. This is known as the PEP. If we did not hide the effect of these provisions of current law, more people would know that these provisions result in hid-den marginal rate increases. Current law has a hidden marginal rate increase, which gets worse as families grow larger. The 2001 tax cuts as enacted provide for gradual phase-out of both of these limitations in 2006, but then the repeal is subject to a sunset. This bill would immediately eliminate both. The second part of this title is a complete repeal of the individual AMT. The original in-tent of the AMT was to make sure that wealthy individuals did not overuse certain tax benefits and unfairly reduce their tax burden. Unfortunately, it no longer accomplishes that goal. Since the AMT is not adjusted for infla-tion, more and more middle income taxpayers are falling into the AMT. In fact, a recent Tax Policy Center report showed that by the end of the decade, the AMT will hit 97 percent of all families with two children earning between $75,000 and $100,000. This is not what was intended, especially when you consider that what pushes taxpayers into the AMT now, more often than not, are state and local in-come and property taxes, personal exemp-tions, and the nonrefundable credits. The Na-tional Taxpayer Advocate has called for the repeal of the AMT, finding that the AMT cal-culation adds another 12 hours of preparation time for a taxpayer. Certainly, this is not what Congress was trying to accomplish when the AMT was passed. My suggestion is to repeal it for individuals, and substitute a simple tax on adjusted gross income. The current hidden tax is dropped, and is paid for with an explicit tax on the same individuals. They get simplification, and we convert a deceptive practice into an open one. This bill gives the Secretary of the Treasury the ability to set the rate so that this bill would be revenue neutral over ten years. The thresh-old amount, chosen to mimic the reality of cur-rent law, would be $120,000, and $150,000 in the cases of a joint return. Conclusion This bill provides fairly dramatic simplifica- tion of the individual tax system. It eliminates up to 200 lines on tax forms, schedules and worksheets. It is basically revenue neutral, so it can be accomplished during a year when there is no budget surplus to fund tax cuts. It does not attempt to shift money between in-come groups. The general philosophy behind the bill is that those who benefit from tax sim-plification of the current code should offset any revenue loss involved. With only one-third of individuals actually willing to fill out their own forms, it is time for Congress to act. Unfortunately, the reality is that no one wants to pay for simplification no matter how much they support the goal. Here is my suggestion. I am introducing this legisla-tion to continue the discussion I began during the 106th Congress. I am pleased that this Administration has talked about the need for tax simplification. I am also pleased that since I began this effort, the Joint Committee on Taxation and other Members of Congress have joined the debate. I look forward to work-ing with all interested parties in this simplifica-tion effort. f IMPROVING EDUCATION RESULTS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABIL-ITIES ACT OF 2003 SPEECH OF HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN OF RHODE ISLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 30, 2003 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1350) to reauthor-ize the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-cation Act, and for other purposes: Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1350, reauthorizing legis-lation for the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-cation Act. The reauthorization of IDEA is crit-ical to the educational outcomes of millions of students with disabilities for years to come. I am sorely disappointed that H.R. 1350 rep-resents a lack of commitment to fulfilling the promise of IDEA by failing to fund the law, and even proposes changes undermining the very philosophy of IDEA. IDEA was enacted with the clear intention of eliminating discrimination against students with disabilities by promising a free and appropriate education to children with disabilities. Even with the increases in IDEA funding over the last several years, the federal government has never lived up to its share of this promise, which was intended to be 40 percent of the cost of special education services. These re-cent increases touted on the floor of the House have only added up to 18 percent\u2014hardly significant in a time of state budget cri-ses. As schools are forced to dip into their VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E852 May 1, 2003 general education budgets to make up for the shortfall in special education funding, all of America's students are losing out\u2014and those with disabilities are being left behind. Every year, access to education for students with disabilities is subjected to the federal ap-propriations process\u2014and every year, it comes up short. I am dismayed that H.R. 1350 fails to provide for mandatory funding, and outraged that the leadership allowed for 14 amendments to be offered on this bill but denied my colleagues and me the opportunity to vote on two proposed amendments that would have guaranteed children with disabil-ities and their families the access to necessary resources for their education. Further, H.R. 1350 makes significant sub- stantive changes counter to the philosophy of IDEA. One of many alarming changes is the elimination of a key civil rights protection pro-viding safeguards for students with disabilities in instances where behavior problems may be a manifestation of their disability. Currently, IDEA sets up a structure for initial assess-ments and intervention plans, so that disrup-tive or problematic behavior can be avoided or mitigated. In instances where students with disabilities do violate a school code, IDEA cur-rently requires administrators to determine if the offending behavior is a manifestation of a student's disability. If that is the case, then the student, teachers and parents can return to the original behavior plan and find a way to work together to avoid further problems. If that is not the case, the student can then be sub-jected to the same penalties as a non-disabled student would. I believe the current disciplinary review process is fair and in the best interest of all students. Even with these protections, stu-dents with disabilities are over-represented among students who are expelled. Yet, H.R. 1350 proposes to eliminate the provisions that require both consideration of a child's disability and use of functional behavioral assessments and intervention plans\u2014denying students the safeguards that assure them access to edu-cational services and placing them at signifi-cantly greater risk. I have also heard a strong sentiment against the proposed changes in the Individ-ualized Education Program (IEP) from my con-stituents, and parents and educators across the country. H.R. 1350 contains a provision to eliminate the requirement of short-term bench-marks, resulting in a negative impact on the effective collaboration between home and schools providing appropriate education and related services to students with disabilities. Measuring student progress against short-term objectives is needed to ensure that student evaluations are regular and based on multiple criteria. 1 hear stories of students who have achieved the goals set in their one-year IEP in less than that time\u2014this is something that should be acknowledged, celebrated and en-couraged\u2014not overlooked. Any steps toward imposing a three-year IEP are steps toward overlooking the progress made in the collabo-rations that are essential to IDEA. The reauthorizing legislation also fails to recognize a shortage of qualified personnel that has hampered the full implementation of IDEA for 25 years. H.R. 1350 eliminates lan-guage that sets standards for special edu-cation service providers. In the No Child Left Behind Act, Congress made it clear that every child should have a highly qualified teacher, yet H.R. 1350 removes the highest require- ment provision\u2014at a time when high stand-ards were never more important. Every con-tentious issue related to IDEA\u2014discipline, dis-proportionate representation of minorities, over-identification of students referred to spe-cial education\u2014could be better addressed by ensuring an adequate supply of appropriately trained and highly qualified personnel. Ulti-mately, highly trained professionals make all the difference in providing an appropriate edu-cation for any student\u2014students with disabil-ities are no different. I urge my colleagues to only support legisla- tion that preserves the spirit and meaning of IDEA. I am disappointed that the reauthorizing legislation we are here to vote on today fails to live up to that standard, and I encourage my colleagues to vote against H.R. 1350. f HONORING LANCE MICHAEL ARCHBOLD FOR EARNING THE RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Lance Michael Archbold, a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 134, and in earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Lance has been very active with his troop, participating in such scout activities as Camp Geiger, Camp Bartle, Camp Jayhawk, High Adventures hiking in Colorado, floating down Buffalo River and Current River, biking 225 miles of the Katy Trail in Missouri, and Junior Leader Corp for Webelos Day Camp. Over the nine years he has been involved in scouting, he has earned numerous merit badges. Addi-tionally, Lance has held several leadership po-sitions, serving as scribe, den chief, patrol leader, assistant patrol leader, outdoor pro-gram manager, co-captain and captain. Lance also has been honored for his numerous scouting achievements with such awards as the Arrow of Light Award, Ordeal Member of the Order of the Arrow, Foxman in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, the On My Honor Award, and the Duty to God Award. For his Eagle Scout project, Lance helped the Independence visitors center for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints with their annual Christmas tree display for the community. He built stands for each tree they had on display so the trees would not tip over. The organization has used them for two years now. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Lance Michael Archbold for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.REINTRODUCTION OF THE VET- ERANS HOUSING FAIRNESS ACT HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce legislation that allows vet-erans to use their guaranteed VA loans to pur-chase co-operative housing units. FHA and other government agencies already have pro-grams to give loans for co-operative residen-tial units, and most banks accept co-operative shares as collateral. The Department of Vet-erans Affairs should do the same. For many veterans who live in communities where co-operative housing is common or where the cost of houses and condominiums can be high, a co-operative residential unit is an af-fordable alternative. f FARMERS INSURANCE GROUP'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY HON. EDWARD R. ROYCE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Farmers Insurance Group's 75th Anniversary and Diamond Jubilee, which it celebrated on March 28, 2003. This year com-memorates the company's three-quarters of a century of serving tens-of-millions of policy-holders and customers across the country. Founded in 1928 in Los Angeles by Thomas E. Leavey and John C. Tyler, true entre-preneurs and philanthropists, Farmers has grown into one of the largest and most suc-cessful insurance companies in America. Nationally, Farmers Insurance employs nearly 20,000 individuals and has an insur-ance agent and district manager force of more than 15,000 strong. In California, Farmers is the largest state-based insurer and employs over 6,000 individuals and has in excess of 4,000 exclusive agents and district managers. These employees, agents and district man-agers are a valuable financial and insurance resource for their communities. They are also leaders in volunteer service. Over the years, Farmers Insurance Group's employees, agents and district managers have volun-teered their time, personal finances and raised millions of dollars for local, state and national philanthropies and charities. Today, Farmers Insurance remains com- mitted to community service and providing ex-cellence in financial advice and security. Throughout the last 75 years Farmers Insur-ance Group has emerged as the third largest property and casualty insurer in the country. It is my hope that the company will continue to make great strides forward and will remain a leader in the personal and commercial lines and life insurance industries. As a Representative from California, where Farmers Insurance Group's home office is lo-cated, I am proud to congratulate all employ-ees, agents and district managers on a suc-cessful 75 years of service to their commu-nities. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May Remarks E853 May 1, 2003 THOMASINA E. JORDAN INDIAN TRIBES OF VIRGINIA FEDERAL RECOGNITION ACT HON. JAMES P. MORAN OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, today I am joined by my fellow Virginians Reps. Jo Ann Davis, Tom Davis, Bobby Scott, and Ed-ward Schrock and Rep. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii in introducing the ''Thomasina E. Jor-dan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recogni-tion Act.'' This legislation will grant federal recognition to six Indian tribes in Virginia: the Chicka-hominy Tribe, Chickahominy Indian Tribe Eastern Division, the Upper Mattaponi, the Rappahannock Tribe, the Monacan Tribe, and the Nansemond Tribe. As we approach the 400th anniversary of the first permanent European settlement in North America, we are long overdue in recog-nizing the direct descendants of the native Americans, who met these settlers. We must acknowledge these historic tribes and the sig-nificance of their heritage. Together, the men and women of these tribes represent a long neglected part of our nation's history. Like much of our early history as a nation, the Virginia tribes were subdued, pushed off their land, and, up through much of the 20th Century, denied full rights as U.S. citizens. Despite their devastating loss of land and pop-ulation, the Virginia Indians successfully over-came years of racial discrimination that denied them equal opportunities to pursue their edu-cation and preserve their cultural identity. That story of survival doesn't encompass decades, it spans centuries of racial hostility and coer-cive state and state-sanctioned actions. Unlike most tribes that resisted encroachment and obtained federal recognition when they signed peace treaties with the federal government, Virginia's six tribes signed their peace treaties with the Kings of England. Most notable among these was the Treaty of 1677 between these tribes and Charles the II. In more recent times, this racial hostility cul- minated with the enactment and brutal en-forcement of Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924. This act empowered zealots, like Walter Plecker, a state official, to destroy records and reclassify in Orwellian fashion all non-whites as ''colored.'' To call yourself a ''Native Amer-ican'' in Virginia was to risk a jail sentence of up to one year. Married couples were denied marriage certificates or even unable to obtain the release of their newborn child from a hos-pital until they changed their ethnicity on the state record to read ''colored,'' not ''Native American.'' For much of the 20th Century ad-mission to public schools education was de-nied. These and other indignities are part of a shameful legacy experienced in our lifetime. More to the point, this legacy has also com- plicated these tribes' quest for federal recogni-tion, making it difficult to furnish corroborating state and official documents. It wasn't until 1997 when then Governor George Allen signed legislation directing state agencies to correct state records that had deliberately been altered to list Virginia Indians on official state documents as ''colored.'' Federal recognition would provide what the government has long denied, legal protections and financial obligations, including certain so- cial services and benefits the federal govern-ment provides the 562-recognized tribes. I know that the gambling issue may be at the forefront of some people's concerns. In re-sponse to this concern, I have worked to close any potential legal loopholes in this legislation to ensure that the state could prevent casino-type gaming by the tribes. Having maintained a close relationship with many of the members of these tribes, I believe they are sincere in their claims that gambling is inconsistent with their values. This position is already borne out by the fact that none of the tribes today en-gage in bingo gambling despite the fact that they have all established non-profit organiza-tions that are permitted under Virginia law to operate bingo games despite compelling finan-cial needs that revenues from bingo could ad-dress. The real issue for the tribes is one of rec- ognition and the long overdue need for the federal government to affirm their identity as Native Americans. Coupled with this affirma-tion is an opportunity for the tribes to establish a more equitable relationship with the state and secure federal financial assistance for the tribes' social services, health care and housing needs. Many of their older members face the prospect of retiring without pensions and health benefits that most Americans take for granted. I urge my colleagues to support this legisla- tion. f LATINO YOUTH LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE HON. LINDA T. SA\u00b4NCHEZ OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Ms. LINDA SA \u00b4NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, on May 9th and 10th of this year, the Latino Youth Leadership Institute (LYLI) will hold its 2nd Annual Latino Youth Leadership Conference and Awards Dinner. The initial inspiration to establish LYLI came out of the participation of students, young pro-fessionals and community leaders in the an-nual United States Hispanic Leadership Con-ference (USHLC). In the spring of 1999, after receiving information about the USHLC, a small group of community leaders made a commitment to send a delegation from Orange County to the conference in Chicago. The group succeeded in raising enough money to send the largest delegation from the furthest location to the USHLC. More importantly, they have continued to send a delegation of stu-dents each year. Early in 2001, a group of USHLC Alumni began a series of meetings to explore the pos-sibility of organizing a youth leadership con-ference in 2002 and to discuss the feasibility of establishing a nonprofit organization. LYLI was created to pursue its mission of increas-ing civic participation, promoting higher edu-cation, and cultivating a new generation of leaders to meet today's challenges and tomor-row's expectations. LYLI was formally incor-porated as a 501 (C) 3 organization in Decem-ber of 2001. The establishment of LYLI evolved gradually over a three-year period of time and would not have occurred without the perseverance of numerous volunteers and the support of elected officials, corporations, gov- ernment entities, labor unions, and other com-munity organizations. The year 2002 was a historic one for LYLI. After years of thinking, planning, and meeting, LYLI organized its very first Latino Youth Leadership Conference and Awards Dinner. Over 1,000 high school and college students attended the Latino Youth Rally and Job Fair. As a result of this conference, some of the students volunteered and registered over 700 new voters. This year over 2,000 high school and college students from throughout South-ern California are expected to participate in the Latino Youth Leadership Conference. Although LYLI's success can be attributed to many contributors, supporters, and volun-teers, two individuals deserve special recogni-tion for their willingness to involve themselves completely in the creation, growth, and devel-opment of the Latino Youth Leadership Insti-tute. As CoFounders of LYLI, President Ignacio ''Nash'' Orozco and Vice-President Bob Martinez have worked passionately and tirelessly to build an organization that would be able to motivate, inspire and train a new generation of Latino youth to realize their full potential as leaders. Because of the commitment and dedication demonstrated by Mr. Orozco and Mr. Mar-tinez, thousands of Latino Youth have already benefited from the work of LYLI, and thou-sands more are likely to be part of LYLI's most promising future. I salute the determina-tion of both Mr. Orozco and Mr. Martinez to stay the course and oversee the trans-formation of their vision of what could be to having a real, living, functioning organization capable of shaping the dreams and aspira-tions of our nation's youth. f THE MEDICARE TELEHEALTH VALIDATION ACT OF 2003 HON. DOUG OSE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. OSE. Mr. Speaker, health care costs in- crease annually. 40 million Americans cur-rently go uninsured. 38 million Americans de-pend on Medicare for their health care. With these challenges before us, Congress must act to provide the most comprehensive and cost effective health care services available. For this reason, I am reintroducing the Medi-care Telehealth Validation Act of 2003. I firmly believe that telemedicine is the best preventative medicine. The techniques and consultative efficiency provided by telehealth services reduce costs by diagnosing diseases and disorders before they progress. By ex-panding Medicare reimbursement for tele-health technology, we will be cutting illnesses off at the pass, and reducing overall costs. Furthermore, telemedicine can meet the needs of underserved populations. According to researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 80 physi-cians per 100,000 persons in most rural areas in 1998, compared with 308.5 physicians per 100,000 in urban areas and 223.5 physicians per 100,000 persons in the suburbs. The youth death rate from all causes was 58.5 per 100,000 persons in most rural areas from 1996 to 1998, compared with 44.5 per VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E854 May 1, 2003 100,000 persons in urban areas and 35.4 per 100,000 in suburban areas. With such a dis-parity in quality of care between those with ac-cess to medical care and those without, Con-gress must act to expand the use of telehealth technology before preventable illnesses be-come life-threatening diseases. The Medicare Telehealth Validation Act pro- vides $40 million for development of telehealth networks for rural communities. These net-works enable underserved populations access to the same diagnostic and consultative care that urban residents have come to expect. These networks link health care professionals in their offices to patients and colleagues from across the street or from across the globe. In addition to providing critical medical con- sultation to underserved and rural constitu-ents, this legislation provides telehealth tech-nology to inpatient services, increases the cat-egories of eligible participants to increase ac-cess to telehealth technologies, and it seeks to reduce the barriers for access to telehealth technologies by increasing multi-state licens-ing. Moreover, this legislation will expand Store and Forward technology and revolu-tionize radiology. X-rays and slides can be shared with specialists quickly and confiden-tially. Diagnosis and treatment will be better, faster, and less expensive. I am a firm believer that preventative medi- cine is the best medicine. I encourage my col-leagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. f DEDICATED TO PROVIDING QUAL- ITY HEALTH CARE\u2014A TRIBUTE TO BETTY JEAN KERR HON. WM. LACY CLAY OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Betty Jean Kerr, as 2003 marks her 25th year of service as C.E.O. of People's Health Centers (PHC) in St. Louis. Kerr has been passionately devoted to providing quality health care to the medically underserved and uninsured. Strongly believing that everyone deserves quality health care, Kerr has dedi-cated her tenure with PHC to ensuring that primary care and prevention services are effi-ciently provided at these community health centers, regardless of a patient's socio-economic status. Kerr's extraordinary leadership is exempli- fied by the strong foundation she has laid and the recognized growth within PHC. PHC was a three-year-old free clinic with only one loca-tion when Kerr became CEO. Under her guid-ance, she has been essentially instrumental in making PHC a sprawling community of apart-ments for the elderly, housing for persons with disabilities, social security services, primary health care, dental services, a pharmacy, af-fordable homes, and small businesses. Kerr has been remarkably persistent in reaching beyond traditional methods of making quality health care services accessible to ev-eryone. In an effort to provide increased ac-cess to health in conjunction with health cen-ter locations, she has created school-based sites. Her staff is in all St. Louis Public middle schools, three high schools, private schools, and soon to be in the large school districts in North County. In addition to developing sustained partner- ships with patients to manage improving their health, Kerr has maintained and required a high level of expectations for health care prac-titioners serving minority populations in low-in-come neighborhoods throughout St. Louis. Setting high standards and goals for PHC, she continues to work with the board on strategic planning decisions that will reduce health dis-parities within St. Louis. Mr. Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Betty Jean Kerr today before Con-gress. This dynamic woman strongly believes that every citizen has the right to a long and healthy life. In addition to her steadfast com-mitment to guaranteeing accessible primary care and preventative health care services, Kerr has a vision of expanding the number of health care center locations throughout the St. Louis community. It is with great honor that I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Betty Jean Kerr. f MAY 1ST ANNUAL DAY OF OB- SERVANCE FOR COMMEMO-RATING OUR VICTORY IN THE COLD WAR HON. DENNIS MOORE OF KANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, the Governors of Kansas and Wisconsin have proclaimed May 1 as their annual day of observance for com-memorating our victory in the Cold War. In a very real sense, the victory of the west- ern allies was also a victory for the oppressed peoples of the Soviet bloc, and liberation for the Russian people, who are now friends and allies of the United States. May 1 was the tra-ditional day of celebration for Communists worldwide, and displays of military might. It is fitting that May 1 now become a day of cele-bration of liberty for free peoples everywhere, and for remembrance of the sacrifices that made the downfall of Communism a reality. These state proclamations were in response to efforts by the Cold War Veterans Associa-tion, which has its headquarters in the State of Kansas, and of which I am proud to be a member. The Cold War was a long struggle, less dra- matic than traditional wars, which ended with battles for cities, dropping of bombs, and for-mal surrenders. The Cold War ended over a period of several years, but as both President George W. Bush and Secretary Donald Rums-feld said, ''It was a war, and we won.'' The resolute opposition to the Communist Empire took many forms, and cost many lives of American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and ma-rines. It will be years before the casualty count is complete, but it is real, whether the losses were at sea, over Soviet or east European air-space, in shoot-downs over international wa-ters, or along the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ). May 1 is the anniversary of the shoot-down of Francis Gary Powers' U-2 in 1960, and the beginning of his captivity in the U.S.S.R. The month of May saw other losses, and some small but shining victories. May was the month in 1949 that the Soviets ended their blockade of West Berlin, after the U.S. Air Force and the British Royal Air Force supplied the besieged city with food and fuel for almost a year, costing the lives of 68 Allied servicemen and 9 Germans. Attacks on U.S. aircraft in the month of May included one in 1955, in which 2 Chinese Communist soldiers were shot down over international waters, an attack on U.S. reconnaissance aircraft over the U.S.S.R. (1954), and over international waters near the Kamchatka Peninsula (1953), shoot-downs over East Germany (1953, 1960, 1964), and by North Koreans (1963, 1974). U.S. military officers assassinated in May in-cluded 2 in Iran (1975) and one in El Salvador (1983). An attack in May 1967 by North Kore-ans on a U.S. Army barracks left 2 Americans dead and 17 wounded. Two separate terrorist attacks in May 1972 by the Red Army Faction in West Germany left 4 U.S. soldiers dead and 18 wounded. A terrorist attack in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in May 1982 killed one crewman and wounded 3 others from the U.S.S. Pensa-cola (LSD-38). Casualties at sea in May in-cluded the entire crew of 99 aboard the U.S. nuclear submarine Scorpion, which was lost at sea in 1968. May 1954 saw the U.S.S. Bennington (CV-20) damaged by an explosion and fire in the Atlantic, killing 103 and injuring 201. In May of 1981, an EA6B Prowler crashed during landing aboard the carrier U.S.S. Nimitz (CVA-68) in the Atlantic, with 14 killed and 48 injured. In May 1987, 37 sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark were killed and 21 wounded by an Iraqi Exocet missile. In May 1975, after our involvement in Vietnam and Cambodia had ended, our troops had to res-cue the U.S.S. Mayaguez and its crew from the Khmer Rouge, again at a cost of lives of our sailors and marines. And the list goes on. During the Cold War, over 40 U.S. aircraft were shot down, and others were lost during operational missions. Shooting incidents on the ground, along the Iron Curtain in Europe and the Bamboo Curtain in Asia often made the morning reports, but seldom the morning papers. Our atomic veterans participated in a large number of nuclear weapons tests; many of them exposed to ionizing radiation, with tragic consequences in later life. There were many successful missions. Many long nights of faithful and vigilant serv-ice, on the frontiers of freedom, on polar ice, submerged, flying airborne alerts and recon-naissance. Staying combat-ready in the Fulda Gap of Germany. Keeping watch on the Ko-rean DMZ. Standing watch in stormy seas. Maintaining the defenses of the continental United States. Constantly improving the com-bat capability of the United States through re-search and development. So on May 1, I salute the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who served in the Cold War, and especially those who paid the ultimate price. We refuse to allow their bravery to go unheralded in the name of ''po-litical correctness.'' We also salute the free-dom fighters who stood up to tyranny on the streets of Poland (1956, 1981), East Germany (1953), Czechoslovakia (1968), Hungary (1956), Romania (1989), and Afghanistan (1979-88). Their victory and ours are com-memorated on each May 1 from this year for-ward. I now ask our National Government and other state governors to proclaim this day of observance, with appropriate ceremonies and recognition. I also ask President Bush to cre-ate the Cold War Victory Medal by executive order, for award to all who served in the VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E855 May 1, 2003 Armed Forces and civilian intelligence agen- cies during this period. We owe them nothing less. f HONORING AND REMEMBERING OUR TROOPS HON. JIM DeMINT OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. DEMINT. Mr. Speaker, today we are here to honor and remember our troops\u2014the young, brave Americans who recently fought to save a nation from enslavement. Answering the call of our great nation, young men and women are putting on a uniform, serving our military, and making enormous sacrifices. As American fighting men and women, they are helping write the history of the 21st century with bold strokes of courage. Like their parents and grandparents, our troops are having their characters tested. This time it is by sweltering heat, blinding sand-storms, and enemies that hid behind women and children. But they quickly won a victory, not just for a nation, but for a vision\u2014a vision of freedom and individual dignity. As a result, their heroic efforts will help preserve peace around the world and extend freedom and human dignity to even more people. And when their service in Iraq is over, they will return home to a proud and grateful Na-tion. Their humility will pass off praise with the words ''just doing my job,'' while they think about their brothers and sisters who didn't come home. This is why America is so great. And through all their efforts our world con-tinues to be shaped by American courage, power, and wisdom; and reverberates with American ideals. Still, our troop's victories in Iraq do not come without a price. The United States has lost some of its best citizens. Tonight we rec-ognize one of those fallen Marines, Private Nolen Ryan Hutchings. A graduate of Boiling Springs High School, Ryan taught those around him what it meant to be an American, and his willingness to serve inspired others to become Marines. There is one story where he felt the need to honor a former classmate's deceased father who had retired from the military. Ryan trav-eled to several Marine bases to find a frame to hold a U.S. flag and then got in full dress uniform and presented the flag to the family. Without a doubt, Ryan's sacrifice will enrich the history of the Marine Corps, and places such as An Nasiriyah will be added to the list of hallowed ground like Belleau Wood, Iwo Jima, and the Chosin Resovior. At the same time, his dedication to his community, to his fellow Marines, and to his country provide us with a shining example. His strength, honor, sacrifice, devotion, and courage show us the path we must follow. As Ronald Reagan once said, ''some people won-der all their lives if they made a difference''\u2014the Hutchings family will never have to wonder about Ryan.CONGRATULATING RABBI HENRY COHEN HON. JOSEPH M. HOEFFEL OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. HOEFFEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Henry Cohen of Montgomery Coun-ty, Pennsylvania, who is celebrating the 50th anniversary of his ordination in the rabbinate. Henry Cohen was born in 1927 in Houston, Texas into a family of reform rabbis. Rabbi Cohen has been involved with and contributed to Jewish education for his entire career. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Texas as an English major and attending graduate classes in the English Department of the University of Chicago, he entered Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1947. After being ordained in 1953, he served as an Army chaplain at Camp Polk, Louisiana, in Korea and at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio. In 1955, he became assistant rabbi at Tem- ple Beth-El in Great Neck, New York. In 1958 Henry became the spiritual leader of Sinai Temple in Illinois. At the university of Illinois he received a Master of Arts Degree in the Philosophy of Education and wrote a study en-titled, ''The Idea of God in Jewish Education.'' He also completed a study, ''Jewish Life and Thought in the Academic Community,'' which was included in Marshall Sklare's The Jew in American Society. Continuing in education he taught a course in Judaism at St. Joseph's College during the 1970's. Rabbi Cohen has been teaching introduction to Judaism classes and has completed a research project for the Jewish Outreach Institute designed to discover what actually happens in the families of inter-faith married couples who, at the time of their wedding, made a commitment to give their children a Jewish education. He developed a ''Beliefs and Values Survey for Interfaith Cou-ples'' to enable them to clarify the similarities and differences of their religious and moral be-liefs. In 1964, Rabbi Cohen became the rabbi of Beth David Reform Congregation in Philadel-phia. There he initiated a bi-cultural Black-Jewish nursery school and was chairman of the Jewish Coalition for Peace. Rabbi Cohen wrote two books: Justice, Justice: A Jewish View of the Black Revolution and Why Juda-ism?\u2014A Search for Meaning In Jewish Iden-tity. He has visited the Middle East to gain a new perspective on the Arabs and Israelis. In 1986 Rabbi Cohen, and his wife Edna, visited the Soviet Union where they met the parents of Beth David's Cantor, Lilia Kazansky, and began a successful campaign to fight for their release. The couple gained their freedom in 1987. Rabbi Cohen also encouraged the for-mation of Chavurah Lahayyim, to support Central American refugees fleeing persecu-tion. Rabbi Cohen helped form the Interfaith Hospitality Network of the Main Line which helps the homeless by providing meals and care in synagogues and churches. Rabbi Cohen is an honorary board member of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Philadelphia and received the Sylvia K. Cohen award for work in inter-group rela-tions. He has been married to Edna for 45 years with two daughters, Shelley and Lisa. I am grateful to Rabbi Cohen for his 50 years of service to the Jewish Community and the Philadelphia region as a whole. f IN HONOR OF ARMY SPECIALIST THOMAS ARTHUR FOLEY III HON. JOHN S. TANNER OF TENNESSEE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of a fine American, a young husband and father from Dresden, Tennessee, who gave his life serving our Nation in Oper-ation Iraqi Freedom. SPC. Thomas Arthur Foley III, 23, served with the 2nd Battalion of the 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment of the 101st Airborne Divi-sion of the United States Army. On the 14th of April, he and a fellow soldier were killed outside Baghdad. Tommy leaves behind a wife of a year and a half, Paulette, and a seven-month-old son, Logan, who reside at Fort Campbell Army Base on the Tennessee-Kentucky border. Tommy's stepfather and mother, Brian and Emily Penick Darden, reside in Dresden. His father and stepmother, Thomas and Angela Foley Jr., live in Montgomery, Kansas. He has a sister, Rebecca Barrington of Martin, Ten-nessee, and two brothers\u2014David, who lives in Dresden, and Sean, who lives in Kansas. Tommy's brother David has also been serv- ing in Iraq and was able to return to Ten-nessee last week to see his brother buried with full military honors in Martin, Tennessee. Family members and friends say Tommy was a man who loved life. He bravely gave that life to help make this world a better place for his son Logan and indeed for us all. Mr. Speaker, please join Tommy's friends, family and me as we honor his memory and thank him for his heroic service to our country. f A TRIBUTE TO FRANCES F. LEE\u2014 EDUCATOR, LEADER, ACTIVIST HON. TOM LANTOS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Frances F. Lee, a remarkable woman who has devoted her life to community service and social progress. Her contributions\u2014as an edu-cator, nonprofit leader, and principled activ-ist\u2014merit our admiration. Ms. Lee recently announced her retirement as Vice Chancellor of Instruction at the City College of San Francisco (CCSF), a distin-guished institution that is one of the largest community colleges in the world. As a former educator, I can only imagine the challenges she faced in enhancing CCSF's academic stature and helping thousands of Bay Area men and women to realize their educational dreams. Ms. Lee's reputation for achievement reflects her success in these endeavors. As a resolution of the San Francisco Board of Su-pervisors recently noted: ''Frances F. Lee served with dignity, distinction and grace and VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E856 May 1, 2003 won universal respect and admiration of fac- ulty, staff, students, administrators and com-munity leaders.'' Mr. Speaker, I share this view wholeheartedly. Frances Lee's contributions to the CCSF community make up only one part of her ex-traordinary forty-year legacy to the City of San Francisco. A dedicated social worker, she acted as Executive Director of the Chinese Newcomers Service Center for more than a decade, where she used her talents to edu-cate America's newest residents about our language and society. Ms. Lee has also been a civil rights champion in the Bay Area, serv-ing on the Board of Directors of Chinese for Affirmative Action for the past 19 years and fighting to open the doors of America's schools and businesses to all Americans, re-gardless of race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. The causes and organizations to which Frances Lee has devoted herself mirror the breadth of her passion. From the Center for Southeast Asian Refugees to the San Fran-cisco Bilingual Vocational Training Program, her commitment to the Bay Area community has enriched our lives. Mr. Speaker, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors has declared May 9th as ''Frances Lee Day'' in the City and County of San Francisco. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the achievements of this out-standing woman, and in congratulating her on her retirement. f A TRIBUTE TO MS. CONNIE MITCH- ELL, WINNER OF DELAWARE'S HOME-BASED BUSINESS ADVO-CATE AWARD HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Connie Mitchell\u2014winner of the Delaware Home-Based Business Advocate Award. Ms. Mitchell earned this honor through her work as President of Mitchell Business Services. As you know, advocates for small and home-based business have always been ex-tremely important to the economic vitality of each State and to our national economy. Home-based businesses provide opportunities for millions of people to earn a living and pro-vide financial stability for their families. Through her work, Connie has distinguished herself and many other home-based business advocates in Delaware's small business com-munity. Throughout my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's home-based businesses to be amongst the very best in the country, and recognition of Ms. Mitchell further confirms my belief. Connie Mitchell's accomplishments and in- novative leadership in the community have placed Mitchell Business Services and many other home-based businesses in a position to rise above and meet the challenges of the fu-ture; I commend her on her receipt of this award and I look forward to Ms. Mitchell's con-tinued success.A TRIBUTE TO RYAN GERMAN, WINNER OF THE DELAWARE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR AWARD HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ryan German, owner of Caffe Gelato in Newark, Delaware and winner of the Delaware Young Entrepreneur award. Mr. German established Caffe Gelato in Downtown Newark during his senior year as a business student at the University of Dela-ware. It has since turned into one of the most popular eateries in the city thanks to the ef-forts, dedication and creativity of its owner, Mr. German. Throughout my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's small businesses amongst the very best in the coun-try. Mr. German's recognition further confirms my belief. As you know, small businesses have always been extremely important to the economic vi-tality of each State and to our national econ-omy. Small businesses account for the major-ity of all new jobs being created daily, and provide opportunities for millions of people to earn a living and provide financial stability for their families. Through his work, Ryan has dis-tinguished himself as an outstanding leader in the small business community. Ryan German's accomplishments and entre- preneurial skills have placed Caffe Gelato in a position to rise above and meet the challenges of the future; I commend him on his receipt of this award and I look forward to Mr. German's continued success. f IN RECOGNITION OF SUNIL AGHI HON. HILDA L. SOLIS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to re- member and honor the life of my friend, Mr. Sunil ''Sunny'' Aghi, who recently passed away. Sunny's colleagues and the community will always remember his activism, dynamism and deep sense of commitment to the democratic principles. He believed passionately in the democratic process and worked to support that process. As a leader of the Indo American community, he brought issues of importance to the community to the forefront of the polit-ical debate. Sunny's leadership inspired other Indian Americans to become engaged and civically involved. Sunny also fought diligently to bridge the di- vide between the United States and India. He sought to promote a positive relationship be-tween India and the United States through an open, honest and productive dialogue between the two nations. Mr. Aghi's dedication to serving the commu- nity was unrivaled and his passing has left a void. I am deeply saddened by his sudden passing and join his family, friends, col-leagues, and the Indian American community in mourning his death. Today I rise to ask Congress to pay tribute to Sunny's energy, passion and dedication. f CENTRAL NEW JERSEY HONORS THE JEWISH FEDERATION OF GREATER MIDDLESEX COUNTY, THE U.S.-ISRAEL RELATIONSHIP AND FIFTY-FIVE YEARS OF ISRAELI STATEHOOD HON. RUSH D. HOLT OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in rec- ognition of the Jewish Federation of Greater Middlesex County whose members will dem-onstrate their support for the U.S.-Israel rela-tionship on May 4, 2003 with a Middlesex County community wide ''Walk for Israel'' in Johnson Park, Highland Park, New Jersey. I applaud the members of the Jewish Federa-tion not only for their commitment to Israel, but for the service they provide to the less fortu-nate members of our Central New Jersey community. Their heartfelt work to improve the lives of others regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity is a testament to their humanity and we are proud to have them here in New Jer-sey. I also rise today to recognize the strong U.S.-Israel relationship and to celebrate the 55th year of Israeli Statehood. Since it was founded in 1948 and with prompt U.S. rec-ognition, Israel has stood firm as an ally of the United States and its interests in the Middle East. Our citizens maintain a deeply rooted friendship based upon common interests, a shared commitment to democracy, individual freedoms, and a rejection of extremism and terrorism. New Jerseyans have a special relationship with Israel. We have a special sister state re-lationship with the State of Israel through the New Jersey-Israel Commission. Israel, as a valued partner in trade and cultural exchange, receives the continued support of our citizens. Since 1948, the State of Israel has com- mitted itself to living in harmony and mutual respect with its neighbors and to arriving at a peaceful solution to the conflict with the Pal-estinians. For most of the last three years, however, Israelis and Palestinians have found themselves in a violent and crippling deteriora-tion of relations. Thousands have died in hor-rible violence that has torn through the hearts of both the Israeli and Palestinian commu-nities. With the introduction of the so-called ''Road- map'' yesterday by President Bush, I hope we are at a renewed moment of hope. The people of New Jersey believe that the future security of Israel depends upon bringing end to ter-rorism, bloodshed, and human suffering and to establishing a just, permanent peace with the Palestinians. I rise today in recognition of the Jewish Fed- eration of Greater Middlesex County, the spe-cial U.S.-Israel relationship, and to celebrate 55 years of Israeli independence. Let us com-mit ourselves to work together with Israel so that she will enjoy her next 55 years at peace with her neighbors. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, E857 May 1, 2003 HONORING CHRISTOPHER STER- LING BRENNECKE FOR EARNING THE RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT HON.

Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Christopher Sterling Brennecke, a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leader-ship by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1082, and in earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Christopher has been very active with his troop, participating in such scout activities as the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation for 7 years and the Philmont Scout Ranch. Over the 11 years he has been involved in scouting, he has earned 31 merit badges. Additionally, Christopher has held several leadership posi-tions, serving as quartermaster, historian, scribe, librarian, patrol leader, assistant patrol leader and senior patrol leader. Christopher also has been honored for his numerous scouting achievments with such awards as the Arrow of Light Award, the God and Country Award and Warrior in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say. For his Eagle Scout project, Christopher landscaped around the front of the Buckner Elementary School as well as the courtyard. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Christopher Sterling Brennecke for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout. f A TRIBUTE TO SAM CALAGIONE, PRESIDENT OF DOGFISH HEAD BREWERY HON.

Throughout my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's small businesses amongst the very best in the coun-try. Mr. Calagione's recognition further con-firms my belief. As you know, small businesses have always been extremely important to the economic vi-tality of each State and to our national econ-omy. Small businesses account for the major-ity of all new jobs being created daily, and provide opportunities for millions of people to earn a living and provide financial stability for their families.

ALLEN BARNETT, RECOGNIZED FOR DELAWARE ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Allen Barnett\u2014President and CEO of AstroPower. A position which has earned him recognition in Delaware for his En-trepreneurial success. Dr. Barnett has established one of the larg- est and fastest growing independent solar electric power companies in the world. Dr. Allen Barnett's creative, insightful and nec-essary foray into sustainable energy is not only beneficial to the entire population for eco-logical reasons but also for its economic stim-ulus. Throughout my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's cutting edge entrepreneurs amongst the very best in the country. Dr. Allen Barnett's recognition fur-ther confirms my belief. Dr. Barnett's accomplishments and innova- tive leadership in the community have placed AstroPower in a position to rise above and meet the challenges of the future; I commend him on his receipt of this award and I look for-ward to Dr. Barnett's continued success. f RECOGNIZING HAROLD O. JOHANSON HON. HILDA L. SOLIS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec- ognize the numerous contributions of Mr. Har-old O. Johanson on the occasion of his recent retirement as City Manager of El Monte, CA. A long time resident of El Monte, Mr. Johanson has dedicated his life to serving the city. He began his career with the city of El Monte as a Planning Intern in 1967. Three years later, he became an official employee of the city as an Assistant Planner. He quickly rose through the city ranks and over the years has held several positions including Planning Director, Director of Community Services, and City Manager. Over the course of this impressive career, Mr. Johanson dramatically changed the land-scape of the city. Some of his greatest accom-plishments were overseeing the establishment of the El Monte Aquatic Center, the Santa Fe Plaza Redevelopment Project, three First Time Home Buyer Programs, and numerous com-mercial centers that brought much needed revenue to the city. The city flourished under Mr. Johanson's strategic and watchful leader-ship. As the current Treasurer for the San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club and Secretary of the Downtown El Monte Business Association Board of Directors, and member of the Kiwanis Club, he has always been active in the community outside his work. While many will miss his presence in city hall, I know he will continue to work with the community. On April 24, 2003, the city of El Monte thanked Mr. Johanson for his years of com-mitted work. I also would like to thank Mr. Johanson and recognize his dedicated service to the community of El Monte. f CENTRAL NEW JERSEY CELE- BRATES MEGAN BOYLE FOR HER RECEIPT OF THE CORE OF THE ARC ANNUAL DISTINGTUSIHED CITIZEN AWARD HON. RUSH D. HOLT OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Megan Boyle for her volunteer service. She has been chosen by CORE of the ARC, a coalition of local social service agencies, law enforcement officials, educators and commu-nity activists, that seeks out and honors youth who have voluntarily given outstanding service to those with disabilities in the school commu-nity. She is a senior at East Brunswick High School and she has worked actively as a vol-unteer for the Sayerville Association for Brain Injured Children for three and one half years. Megan's aunt introduced her to the Associa- tion for Brain Injured Children and after partici-pating in the Saturday program two or three times, she was committed. She volunteers each Saturday helping with art, board games, exercise, sports and other activities. Her com-mitment expanded to summer camp with the Association over the past three summers. Megan has displayed a variety of talents working with both autistic children and children with Down's syndrome. She has helped the children progress in the areas of learning skills and socialization skills. Her success and con-fidence gained her a promotion at the summer camp. Her new responsibility put her in the leadership position of being in charge of seven counselors and twenty children for six weeks. It is only through the generosity of time and spirit of individuals like Megan that our com-munity can meet the needs of those with dis-abilities. It is not often that someone as young as Megan is so willing to share of her time and expertise. She tells us she is richer for this dedication to improving the lives of others. Clearly the individuals she has befriended and served are also better off. I ask that all the members join me in con- gratulating Megan Boyle as a recipient of the CORE of the ARC's Annual Distinguished Cit-izen Award. f HONORING KYLE ALAN BRENNECKE FOR EARNING THE RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. GRAVES.

For his Eagle Scout Project, Kyle painted the playground at the Buckner Elementary School in Buckner, Missouri. Additionally, Kyle painted two four squares, basketball lanes and playground signs. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Kyle Alan Brennecke for his ac-complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout. f A TRIBUTE TO DONA ZACZKIEWICZ, THE DELAWARE WOMEN IN BUSINESS ADVOCATE OF THE YEAR HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dona Zaczkiewicz, winner of Delaware Women in Business Advocate of the Year Award. She is given this honor as presi-dent of Dona Z Consulting. As you know, advocates for women in busi- ness have always been extremely important to the economic vitality of each State and to our national economy. Small businesses account for the majority of all new jobs being created daily, and provide opportunities for millions of people to earn a living and provide financial stability for their families. Through her work, Dona has distinguished herself and many other women business owners in Delaware's small business community. Through out my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's women owned businesses to be amongst the very best in the Country, and recognition of Ms. Zaczkiewicz further confirms my belief. Dona Zaczkiewicz's accomplishments and innovative leadership in the business commu-nity have placed Dona Z Consulting in a posi-tion to rise above and meet the challenges of the future; I commend her on her receipt of this award and I look forward to Ms. Zaczkiewicz's continued success. f A TRIBUTE TO MR. MARK LUPPI, WINNER OF THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION AND DELAWARE FINAN-CIAL SERVICE ADVOCATE AWARD HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Mark Luppi\u2014winner of the Mid-Atlantic and Delaware Financial Service Advocate Award. Mr. Luppi earned this rec-ognition through his work as Senior Vice President of Citizens Bank. Mr. Luppi focuses his advocacy efforts on growth and small business leadership. In just a short time after expanding into Delaware, Citizens Bank financed 59 loans to Delaware small businesses. As you know, advocates for small business have always been extremely important to the economic vitality of each State and to our national economy. Small businesses account for the majority of all new jobs being created daily, and provide opportu-nities for millions of people to earn a living and provide financial stability for their families. Throughout my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's small businesses to be amongst the very best in the Country. Recognition of Mr. Luppi further con-firms my belief. Mr. Luppi's accomplishments and innovative leadership in the community have placed Citi-zens Bank and many small businesses in a position to rise above and meet the challenges of the future; I commend him on his receipt of this award and I look forward to Mr. Luppi's continued success. f RECOGNIZING ALFRED HERRERA HON. HILDA L. SOLIS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec- ognize a great educator with a humble and caring heart, Mr. Alfred Herrera, for his com-mitment to students. Mr. Herrera has a remarkable record help- ing underrepresented, first generation, and low-income students gain access to a college education. As the Director of UCLA's Commu-nity College Partnership Program, Mr. Herrera understands the importance of reaching out to students in community colleges who face many challenges in their pursuit of a four-year college education. He prepares students with the information and counsel that will allow them to make a successful transition from a community college to a four-year university and provides guidance for future opportunities. Mr. Herrera's commitment to students and their academic success is unwavering; he goes far and beyond the call of duty to ensure access and opportunity for students. He has played a significant role in nurturing and pro-viding a highly accelerated learning environ-ment for students of diverse backgrounds. But his commitment to educational opportu- nities for all students is exemplified by his work in promoting the passage and implemen-tation of AB540, a California law that allows undocumented students an opportunity to par-ticipate in California's public higher education institutes by allowing them to pay in-state tui-tion rates. I am honored to call him my dear friend. I commend him for his vision and dedication to create and extend learning opportunities for those least able to access it.NATIONAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE WEEK HON. HENRY E. BROWN, JR. OFSOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Speak- er, I stand today to recognize the tremendous contribution landscape architects make to the scenic beauty of the United States. Last week marked National Landscape Architecture Week. I would like to thank the industry and the American Society of Landscape Architects for all they do to improve our beautiful country. Landscape architects play a special role in creating the places in which we live, work, and play. They are dedicated to promoting the careful stewardship, planning, and artful de-sign of our cultural and natural environments. The work of landscape architects reflects the variety and breadth of the profession, from the design of residential and commercial develop-ments, office building sites, and public parks, to public sector comprehensive planning, envi-ronmental planning, and town planning. Though National Landscape Architects Week has passed, I urge all Americans to consider and recognize the many contributions made by landscape architects. f BUDD AND SYLVIA MIZDAIL CELE- BRATE 50TH WEDDING ANNIVER-SARY HON. PAUL E. KANJORSKI OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. KANJORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the attention of the House of Rep-resentatives to the 50th wedding anniversary of my friends Budd and Sylvia Mizdail of Mocanaqua, Pennsylvania. Their family and friends will honor them with a party on May 3, 2003, at St. Mary's Church in Mocanaqua, the same church where they were married on May 2, 1953. They are the proud parents of two children: John, of Emmaus; and Brenda, of Plymouth Meeting; and the proud grandparents of four grandchildren. Both of the Mizdails have given generously of their time over the years to their church, in-cluding running the church picnics for several years. They are retired from the Borden plant in Berwick, where he worked as a laboratory technician and she worked as a secretary. She is the Democratic chairwoman for the Second District in Luzerne County and a 20-year member of the Greater Nanticoke Area School Board. She has been president of the school board for approximately 10 years and is secretary of the Luzerne Intermediate Unit 18 board, of which she has been a member for 11 years. She also continues to be in-volved with the Conyngham Township Demo-cratic Committee, of which she is a past chair. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call to the at- tention of the House of Representatives the 50th wedding anniversary of Budd and Sylvia Mizdail, and I wish them and their family all the best. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E859 May 1, 2003 A TRIBUTE TO MS. OLAKUNLE OLUDINA, A WINNER OF THE DELAWARE MINORITY BUSINESS ADVOCATE AWARD HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Olakunle Oludina, winner of the Delaware Minority Business Advocate Award. Ms. Oludina earned this honor through her work at the YMCA of New Castle County. As you know, advocates for minorities in business have always been extremely impor-tant to the economic vitality of each State and to our national economy. In her work, Olakunle Oludina develops and implements training and education programs for entre-preneurs, thus helping to energize Delaware's small business community. Throughout my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's minority run organizations to be amongst the very best in the country, and recognition of Ms. Oludina further confirms my belief. Olakunle Oludina's accomplishments and in- novative leadership in the community have placed the YMCA of New Castle County in a position to rise above and meet the challenges of the future; I commend her on her receipt of this award and I look forward to Ms. Oludina's continued success. f RECOGNIZING TAIWAN FOR ITS HANDLING OF SARS HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog- nize Taiwan for its efforts in effectively ad-dressing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syn-drome (SARS). Taiwan has done an admi-rable job of dealing with this new, global, and fatal disease. Taiwan's response to SARS has far out- paced many of its neighbors in that region of the world. It has been forthright about the problem and has worked with the international community to stem the spread of this deadly disease. Quoting Dr. Scott Dowell, Director of the International Emerging Infections Program in Thailand, Center for Disease and Control and Prevention, ''the health authorities in Taiwan were taking unprecedented measures to re-spond to the outbreak, and we thought that they were doing a very good job. . . . They were quite capable in doing that in Taiwan, and we were encouraged by the lack of trans-mission to healthcare workers during the first weeks we were there.'' Even more remarkable is that Taiwan has responded so effectively to this global problem without being a member of the World Health Organization (WHO). Because of its lack of statehood, Taiwan, home to nearly 24 million people, has been denied membership status in the organization. This made it even more difficult for health experts to gather important information about SARS on the island and highlights the need for Taiwan to receive ob-server status at the WHO. In a relatively short period of time, SARS has shown that it knows no borders. When in-fecting people, this disease does not stop at man-made borders. Thus, I would call on the World Health Organization and its members to grant observer status to Taiwan so that they can be properly integrated into the global health network. The SARS outbreak is a stark reminder of the importance of working with the entire international community in finding solu-tions to global problems like the spread of dis-ease. Failing to do so prolongs the problem and puts more people at risk. Mr. Speaker, the leaders of Taiwan have worked hard on their own and with the inter-national community to detect and treat SARS. As such, its leaders are worthy of receiving our recognition today. f CONGRATULATIONS TO STEGALL FAMILY IN CORINTH, TX HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my sincere congratulations to the Stegall Family in Corinth, Texas and their en-tire staff at the American Eagle Harley-David-son/Buell Dealership. They celebrate one year of successful sales and customer service in the Denton County area with a team of dedi-cated and diligent employees. The community of motorcyclist enthusiasts in North Texas are also to be commended for supporting local businesses, contributing to the success of American Eagle. This devel-oping relationship not only benefits the motor-cycle industry, it also cultivates the economy of Denton County, which continues to develop with the expansion of commerce across North Texas. Once more, I articulate my best wishes to American Eagle. May their efforts continue to be rewarded. f ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH HON. DAVID WU OF OREGON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise on this first day of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month to honor our Nation's Asian Pacific American community. This month marks the 25th year that our nation has rightly recognized and celebrated the many contributions and achievements of Asian Pacific Americans. Mr. Speaker, America draws its strength from its tremendous diversity. The Asian Pa-cific American community is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States with over 12.5 million people. We have greatly en-riched the American landscape, and I am hon-ored to take part in Asian Pacific American Heritage Month by celebrating the many achievements of APAs in American history. Asian Pacific Americans have made tremen- dous advances in countless fields such as, politics, medicine, technology, business, music, literature, film, athletics, and agri-culture. APAs helped build the Trans- continental Railroad and develop the Internet, and APAs have served honorably to defend the United States in times of armed conflict, from the Civil War through today. And, as I speak today, an Asian Pacific American astro-naut, Edward Lu, is stationed aboard the Inter-national Space Station. As Chair of the Con-gressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I am proud to recognize these achievements. The Asian Pacific American community has made these achievements despite the obsta-cles of past discriminatory laws, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Alien Law Act of 1920, and the forced internment of Jap-anese Americans during World War II. Like so many other segments of America, the APA community has thrived in the face of opposi-tion. While Asian Pacific Americans as a whole have flourished in the United States, there are still challenges facing certain segments of the APA community today. Many immigrants, refu-gees, and particular ethnic groups, including Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders, are still working to achieve the American dream. We must not forget those who are struggling to overcome obstacles, including language and cultural barriers, as well as the discrimina-tion that still exists today. Mr. Speaker, the Asian Pacific American community is itself a diverse group of people with distinct languages and cultures. There-fore, I cannot stress enough the importance of improving our data collection on APAs. Today, Government data tends to lump various Asian Pacific Americans together in a single cat-egory. Better data will allow us to recognize the diversity and distinct cultures of the many communities that make up the Asian Pacific American community as a whole. This knowl-edge will allow the United States to better ad-dress the different needs of what is a very di-verse community; so that all Americans have the same opportunity to attain the American dream. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to en- courage Congress and the American people to spend the month of May learning about the legacy, culture, rich traditions, and achieve-ments of the Asian Pacific American Commu-nity. f A TRIBUTE TO MS. SALLY HAW- KINS, WINNER OF THE DELA-WARE SMALL BUSINESS JOUR-NALIST AWARD HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Sally Hawkins- winner of the Delaware Small Business Journalist Award. Ms. Hawkins earned this honor through her work as owner and President of the WILM-AM radio station. As you know, small businesses have always been extremely important to the economic vi-tality of each State and to our national econ-omy. Small businesses account for the major-ity of all new jobs being created daily, and provide opportunities for millions of people to earn a living and provide financial stability for their families. Through her work, Sally has dis-tinguished herself as an outstanding leader in small business and journalism. VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E860 May 1, 2003 Through out my years in public service I have consistently counted Delaware's small businesses and Delaware's journalists to be amongst the very best in the Country. Rec-ognition of Ms. Hawkins further confirms my belief. Sally Hawkins' accomplishments and inno- vative leadership in the community have placed WILM in a position to rise above and meet the challenges of the future; I commend her on her receipt of this award and I look for-ward to Ms. Hawkins' continued success. f JOHN KLUGE HON. VERNON J. EHLERS OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John W. Kluge for his constant and unwavering support for the Library of Con-gress. Mr. Kluge is the greatest individual bene- factor in the history of the Library of Congress. He came to this country as a young boy from Germany, with virtually nothing but a china Dresden Horse\u2014which he still has. From these humble origins, and through hard work, he received a full scholarship to Colum-bia University. After service in the United States Army during World War II, he went on in the business world to create a vast media empire which he converted into a great engine of philanthropy, supporting many educational programs, aimed in particular toward helping minorities. Mr. Kluge is the founding chairman of the James Madison Council, the Library of Congress's private sector philanthropic organi-zation, where he has inspired many others to join in support of the Library and its programs. Through his generosity, John Kluge helped the Library of Congress bridge the gap into its third century by enabling it to invest heavily in technologies that bring the vast collections of the Library to people all over the world. Thanks to an endowment from Mr. Kluge, the Library of Congress established the John W. Kluge Center, which brings some of the world's best minds\u2014the Kluge Scholars\u2014into residence to use the rich resources of the Li-brary and interact with national policy makers. The Kluge Center also accommodates Kluge post-doctoral Fellows who are pursuing inter-disciplinary and cross-cultural subjects using the Library's rich and diverse collections. The first million dollar John W. Kluge Prize in the Human Sciences will be awarded this fall for lifetime achievement in the humanities. The work and the generosity of spirit of this great American will live on for generations. For years to come, individuals will be able to at-tend college on a John W. Kluge Scholarship who might otherwise be unable to afford it. Countless future national leaders will benefit from the intellectual stimulation that this man has made possible through his work at the Li-brary of Congress. He is a man who has made a difference. During a lifetime of philan-thropic activity and quiet assistance for those in need, John W. Kluge has touched countless lives and truly deserves the recognition of this body.2003 ONCOLOGY NURSING DAY AND MONTH HON. SUE WILKINS MYRICK OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mrs. MYRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to oncology nurses. May is the ninth annual Oncology Nursing Day and Month. The celebration kicks off on Thursday, May 1, 2003, on Oncology Nursing Day, dur-ing the opening ceremonies of the Oncology Nursing Society's 28th Annual Congress in Denver, CO, and continues until May 31, 2003. Oncology Nursing Month recognizes on-cology nurses, educates the public about on-cology nursing, provides an opportunity for special educational events for oncology nurses, and celebrates the accomplishments of oncology nurses. The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), the largest professional oncology group in the United States composed of more than 30,000 nurses and other health professionals, exists to promote excellence in oncology nursing and the provision of quality care to those individ-uals affected by cancer. As part of its mission, the Society honors and maintains nursing's historical and essential commitment to advo-cacy for the public good. ONS was founded in 1975, and held its first Annual Congress in 1976. Since the Society was established, 218 local chapters have been formed to provide a network for education and peer support at the community level. In my state of North Carolina there are more than 939 oncology nurses and health profes-sionals that care for individuals with cancer and their families. In addition, North Carolina has 6 local Oncology Nursing Society chapters located in the areas of Charlotte\u2014my district\u2014Wilmington, Canton, Greenville, Durham, and Trinity. Over the last ten years, the setting where treatment for cancer is provided has changed dramatically. An estimated 80 percent of all Americans receive cancer care in community settings including cancer centers, physicians' offices, and hospital outpatient departments. Treatment regimens are as complex, if not more so, than regimens given in the inpatient setting a few short years ago. Oncology nurses are on the front-lines of the provision of quality cancer care for individuals with can-cer. Nurses are involved in the care of a can-cer patient from the beginning through the end of treatment. Oncology nurses are the front-line providers of care by administering chemo-therapy, managing patient therapies and side-effects, working with insurance companies to ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment, provide counseling to patients and family members, in addition to many other daily acts on behalf of cancer patients. With an increasing number of people with cancer needing high quality health care cou-pled with an inadequate nursing workforce, our nation could quickly face a cancer care crisis of serious proportion, with limited access to quality cancer care, particularly in tradition-ally underserved areas. Without an adequate supply of nurses there will not be enough qualified oncology nurses to provide the qual-ity cancer care to a growing population of peo-ple in need. I was proud to support the pas-sage of the ''Nurse Reinvestment Act'' in the 107th Congress. This important piece of legis- lation expanded and implemented programs at HRSA to address the multiple problems con-tributing to the nationwide nursing shortage, including the decline in nursing student enroll-ments, shortage of faculty, and dissatisfaction with nurse workplace environments. Mr. Speaker, I plan to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Nurse Reinvestment Act re-ceives funding during the FY 2004 appropria-tions process. I commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all of its hard work to prevent and reduce suffering from cancer and to improve the lives of those 1.3 million Americans who will be di-agnosed with cancer in 2003. I wish the On-cology Nursing Society the best of luck in its endeavors and urge all Americans to support its important efforts. f TRIBUTE TO THE DENVER AREA LABOR FEDERATION HON. DIANA DeGETTE OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the impressive history and notable accomplishments of an exceptional organiza-tion in the 1st Congressional District of Colo-rado. It is both fitting and proper that we rec-ognize this outstanding organization for its civic leadership and record of extraordinary service benefiting the working men and women of the Denver area. It is to commend this remarkable organization that I rise to honor the Denver Area Labor Federation (DALF) on the occasion of its 120th Anniver-sary. While the Denver Area Labor Federation has weathered great adversity and tremen-dous change over the last century, it has al-ways remained in the vanguard for economic and social justice. In the many struggles for dignity in the workplace, the labor movement in the Denver area continues to be a vital force for the rights of workers, for a living wage, a safe workplace, good benefits and for the continued well being of working families. Since its founding in 1882, DALF has led the way in forging strong alliances within the local labor movement, with the AFL-CIO, and with numerous community organizations including the Colorado Progressive Coalition, Jobs with Justice and the Colorado Coalition for Immi-grant Rights. It has provided leadership for local unions in organizing drives, strikes and contract campaigns. It has conducted numer-ous trainings and education programs for Metro Area union members on common sense economics, organizing, political activism and community engagement. It has formed the Front Range Economic Strategy Center to en-able working people to command the expertise and resources needed to hold local govern-ments accountable for the development of af-fordable housing, secure health care, and the creation of jobs of sufficient quality to support families. It comes as no surprise that DALF was honored by the National AFL-CIO Con-vention for ''moving the fastest and the far-thest on the road to becoming a Union City'' and that its political program is recognized na-tionwide for its innovation and success. Working people built our communities and our nation and it is the sacrifices of the men VerDate Jan 31 2003 06:18 May 02, of Remarks E861 May 1, 2003 and women of the member locals of the Den- ver Area Labor Federation, past and present, to whom we owe a great debt of gratitude. Many of us in this country forget how far we've come. There was a time when funda-mental decency and equity for working people were not a part of our shared values\u2014a time when collective bargaining, workplace safety, minimum wage and benefits were not part of our common experience. For many of us in our community, decent working conditions and the basic employment benefits needed to sub-sist in our society are still out of reach. I am deeply appreciative of the invaluable work that the Denver Area Labor Federation and its member locals continue to do to advance the cause of a livable wage, worker rights and protections and to promote decent health care. DALF has made a tremendous impact on our community and implicit in its success has been the fundamental recognition that good wages, job security and quality health care builds a healthy and prosperous community. Please join me in commending the Denver Area Labor Federation. It is the strong leader-ship that this organization exhibits on a daily basis that continually enhances our lives and builds a better future for all Americans.CONGRATULATING FORT BENNING ON RECEIVING THE ARMY COM-MUNICATIONS OF EXCELLENCE CHIEF OF STAFF AWARD HON. MAC COLLINS OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 1, 2003 Mr. COLLINS. Mr. Speaker, I have been a Member of Congress for ten full years, going on my eleventh year now. Since 1993, when I was elected, the ''Home of the Infantry,'' Fort Benning has consistently been selected as the best installation in the nation, and a few times as best in the world. As a politician, something inside me wants to take credit for that, but as a statesman, I re-alize that it has been the fine leadership of people like Major General Paul Eaton and Colonel Joe Torres and those who have pre-ceded them who are really responsible for the outstanding performance of Fort Benning. As a major power projection platform for the Army, Benning serves a very transitional com-munity of soldiers. With our war in Iraq and Af-ghanistan, more than 7,000 Fort Benning troops are stationed overseas. Obviously, this kind of deployment leaves a hole. Additionally, several thousand more soldiers from other bases have passed through Benning's gates to receive specialized training before deploy-ing to the field. This has placed a great deal of demand on the services offered. But, in spite of all of these challenges, Fort Benning has been recognized again this year as one of the top 10 military installations in the world with the Communities of Excellence Chief of Staff Award. Competing on the Train-ing and Doctrine Command level, Benning has demonstrated a better, more efficient, faster way to provide outstanding service to the com-munity which calls Fort Benning home. Additionally, Fort Benning is an integral part of the tri-community, Columbus, GA, Phenix City, AL, and Fort Benning. The military and the civilian communities strive to mutually sup-port one another and each community com-pliments the others. This is the result of tire-less effort by the military, the community lead-ers of Columbus, and Phenix City. Their effort has paid off and I am glad to see it recognized with this award. Fort Benning, while it has a proud legacy as the foremost training center of the Army, is only a patch of Earth and some buildings. It is the people who work there that make it an outstanding example of military efficiency and service. It is the dedication of those people and the leadership of its commanders which drive the level of excellence higher each year. The consistent performance of Fort Benning reflects well on the Army and demonstrates why Fort Benning is a shining example of the Army being all it can be. I congratulate Major General Eaton and his fine staff on receiving this award and thank them for their service to America and to the community which makes Benning its home.
