[1] The Pfizer and Oxford (AstraZeneca/Vaxzevria) vaccines have been available since early 2021 in Australia. Mode rna has been available in the second half of 2021. Novavax has been available since early 2022. [1] Most COVID -19 vaccines will need 2 do ses to be effective: Pfizer 3 -6 weeks apart (paediatric Pfizer to be given 8 weeks apart) , AstraZeneca 4 -12 weeks apart, Moderna at least 4 weeks apart , Novavax at least 3 weeks apart . [2][3] Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine [1]: o Is an mRNA vaccine - a small amount of the virus' genes are used to make the vaccine, this does NOT mean it can change your DNA and you can't get the disease from this o It is hard to transport/store (requires -70\u00b0C) and is produced overseas. o Currently avail able as a third dose for people aged over 16 years [4] Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine [1]: o Viral vector vaccine - the virus' genes are inserted into a harmless chimpanzee virus (adenovirus). This viral vector has been modified so that it cannot replicate (NOT a live virus) and humans can't get sick from it. o It is easy to store (at 2 -8\u00b0C), is pr oduced in Melbourne and we will have more doses available Moderna [1] : COVID -19 Vaccine s Supplement (Version 9), written 22/01/21 by DS, updated 25/02/22 by TD, SB Page 2 of 10 o Also an mRNA vaccine (similar to Pfizer) and thus has similar storage and transport requirements o Currently available as a third dose for people aged over 18 years [4] Novavax vaccine [1] o Protein -based vaccine (uses fragments of virus protein) o Your immune system cells recognise the spike protein as a threat and builds an immune response o Novavax does not contain any live virus and you cannot get COVID -19 from it o Currently available as a first and second dose for people aged over 18 years [5] [1] Australian Government, vaccines/novavax do we know if COVID -19 vaccines are safe? At the time of writing this, over 10 billion doses have been administered worldwide [6] COVID -19 vaccines were tested in large rigorous clinical trials to specifically check for safety [ 7] This was tested in people of different ages, races, ethnicities and in people with underlying medical conditions. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) continues to thoroughly monitor COVID -19 vaccine safety and quality [ 6] [6] Our World children? How do we protect our children who can't get vaccinated yet? [ 8][9] Children and COVID -19 vaccines COVID -19 Vaccine s Supplement (Version 9), written 22/01/21 by DS, updated 25/02/22 by TD, SB Page 3 of 10 o COVID -19 vaccines have been approved for children over the age of 5 years old. o Safety information fo r vaccines for children under 5 is still being assessed, and therefore vaccines aren't available in this age group yet. Protecting children from COVID -19 infection o Children generally don't get too unwell with COVID -19 infection, but vaccination is still important as it can reduce tran smission of the virus to more vulnerable members of the community. o Having adults (family members, teachers etc) vaccinated is the best way to protect children, especially those who are currently ineligible for vaccinations. o Continuing to encourage standa rd precautions is also important, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, and social distancing. See our COVID -19 and Children Topic Template for more on this topic For more information on COVID -19 vaccination in children: [8] Do they affect fertility? Pregnancy [10][11] o Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RANZCOG) has recommended Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to be given at any stage of pregnancy as it is deemed to be safe. o Global evidence shows that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are safe for pregnant women. o The risks of developing COVID -19 infection in pregnancy results in: An increased risk of severe illness from COVID -19 Higher rates of ICU admissions and needing a ventilator. Higher risk that the baby may be born prematurely. o Pregnant women are therefore a priority group for COVID -19 vaccination. o There is no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage or risk to the baby with mRNA vaccines during pregnancy. Fertility [12] o There is no evidence that COVID -19 vaccines affect fertility o Studies have found that COVID -19 vaccines do not affect the eggs or the final outcome of couples undergoing IVF o In men who were vaccinated, there were no decreases in sperm count or quality compared to men who were unvaccinated. See our COVID -19 Pregnancy and Fertility Supplement for more on this topic COVID -19 Vaccine s Supplement (Version 9), written 22/01/21 by DS, updated 25/02/22 by TD, SB Page 4 of 10 For more information on COVID -19 vaccines, pregnancy and fertility: [10] Royal Australian and New -and-fertility.pdf Are vaccines safe in people who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised? [13][14] People who have underlying medical conditions or who are immunocompromised are considered at high risk of severe COVID -19 infection. These groups are therefore priority groups in getting the vaccine. The vaccines available are NOT live vaccines, and there fore cannot cause infection. Therefore the safety of the vaccine is the same as for the rest of the population. People should be encouraged to have discussions with their GPs or specialists if they have any specific concerns. [13] Australian are the the vaccine? [1 5] Some COVID -19 vaccines may be more reactogenic than other vaccines. These include common side effects such as fever, flu like symptoms and sore arm, which usually self -resolve and only last a few days. Explain that side effects are a sign that the immune system is working The vaccine cannot give someone COVID -19. The vaccines have been associated with an extremely rare risk of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a rare side effect of any vaccine or medicine and can be treated with adrenaline. To monitor this, all individuals receiving any COVID -19 vaccine are required to wait for 15 -30 minutes following administration of the vaccine to monitor for development of symptoms. The AstraZeneca/Vaxzevria vaccine has a rare side effect of blood clots [1 6]. This risk is low in people over the age of 60, and it is the preferred vaccine in this age group. For people under the age of 60, the vaccine is still available and effective, however it does require a discussion with a GP in order to assess the risks and benefits for the individual [1 6]. COVID -19 Vaccine s Supplement (Version 9), written 22/01/21 by DS, updated 25/02/22 by TD, SB Page 5 of 10 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) have a rare side effect of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle or the tissue surrounding the heart). [16] As with most side effects, the risks of developing myocarditis and pericarditis from COVID -19 infection are su bstantially higher. [1 7] This rare side effect from the vaccine is more commonly seen in males under 30 years of age, and more commonly after the second dose. Most people recover quickly, and long term follow up is ongoing. [1 so quickly? [1 8] Normally vaccines take 10-20 years to make and each development phase (pre - clinical/animal and phases 1 -3) occurs in succession, with gaps between: o Phase 1: dozens of participants - checks for safety and side effects o Phase 2: Hundreds of participants - checks safety and immune response o Phase 3: Thousands of participants (for COVID most trials include 30 -50 thousand people) - checks for safety and effectiveness Also, it usually takes a long time to recruit and due to low comm unity transmission, it takes a long time to check for efficacy. These vaccines were developed in about 1 year and there are multiple reasons why this can be done - while still keeping all the safety checks in place: o The studies (Phase 1 -3) are done in over lap, nothing has been skipped . o There has been huge investment in research and development. o There has been significant collaboration globally between scientists/ countries/ governments/drug companies etc Unfortunately, COVID is widespread, so trials can qui ckly assess vaccine efficacy. (If no one is getting the disease, it's hard to check efficacy). [18] National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, trials for all COVID -19 vaccines currently availa ble for use in Australia show high effectiveness at preventing people from getting severe illness and hospitalisation from COVID -19 infection There is emerging evidence to suggest that vaccines have a significant impact in reducing transmission of COVID -19 infection. COVID -19 Vaccine s Supplement (Version 9), written 22/01/21 by DS, updated 25/02/22 by TD, SB Page 6 of 10 [19] National Centre for [ 20] New variants have emerged since the pandemic began, and community case numbers have increased significantly . Things are quickly changing since the emergen ce of the Omicron variant, and we are still gathering evidence to assess the effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccination. Early data shows that third doses increase protection against infection with the Omicron variant. Benefits include reducing the risk of symptomatic infection, severe illness and death. Do I need a third dose? [20] Evidence shows that third doses are safe and are now recommended for Australians over the age of 16 years old. Evidence shows that immunity from either COVID -19 vaccines or previous COVID -19 infection reduces over time. The third dose increases immunity to by reducing spread of the virus, reduces severe illness and death from COVID -19. Anyone aged 16 years and over who has received two doses of an approved COVID -19 vaccine should receive a third dose 3 months after their second dose. A person will be considered 'overdue' if a third dose has not been received within 6 months of their seco nd dose [21]. In people over 18 years, b oth Pfizer and Moderna are recommended for use as a third dose , regardless of the vaccine type used in the primary course. AstraZeneca is also available if you cannot have Pfizer, or if you've previously had 2x do ses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Pfizer third dose vaccinations have been approved for adolescents aged 16 and 17 years who have already received two primary vaccinations [22]. It is too early to know whether third doses will be recommended for children under 16 years. [20] Australian -19 infection should I get vaccinated? [23] People can be vaccina ted once they have recovered from their acute illness. People can defer vaccination for up to 4 months after infection. However, it is recommended people get vaccinated as soon as possible due to the increased risk of being reinfected with the Omicron variant if people were previously infected with the Delta variant. COVID -19 Vaccine s Supplement (Version 9), written 22/01/21 by DS, updated 25/02/22 by TD, SB Page 7 of 10 People who are at high risk of getting exposed to COVID -19 in their workplaces, or are at high risk of getting severe illness with COVID -19 re -infection are recommended to get vaccinated as soon as they have recovered from their acute illnes s. People with ongoing COVID -19 symptoms beyond 4 months after the initial infection can be vaccinated. Please discuss this with your GP. [23] infection should my child get vaccinated? [2 4] Some health experts suggest delaying vaccination until one month after children have been infected with COVID -19. This allows them to recover from their acute illness and reduces the risk of side effects. [24] Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, 2022 https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/how -long -should -children -wait-to-be-vaccinated - aft Is vaccination mandatory? Each state has differing advice on whether vaccines are mandatory. These decisions have been made by governments, and volunteers are not expected to justify this or go into detailed discussion about this. If asked, an example wa y to address this is: o \"These decisions are made by government officials, and I am not able to comment on their justifications. However, we do recognise that a high vaccination rate is better for the community, as higher vaccination rates protect both vacc inated individuals and others who cannot be vaccinated.\" Who is eligible? [2 5-27] Anyone aged 5 -11 years old is eligible for paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine has been approved as an alternative vaccine for children aged 6 -11 years. Pfizer remains the only vaccination available for children who are 5 years old. There are currently no vaccines licensed for children aged 4 years and under. Anyone aged over 12 years is eligible to receive Pfizer and Moderna vacc ines Anyone aged over 18 years old can receive the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccine s The vaccines are free and available for everyone, even those without a Medicare card.

The vaccines are available and free, even for those who don't have Medicare Side effects are common with all vaccinations. Please speak to your doctor if you have any questions relating to your own health. Tips for responding to vaccine concerns: Please be sensitive and open to listening and responding to questions and concerns. This is important for building trust. These vaccines are new and all questions are valid. If a person has concerns or questions, this doesn't necessarily mean they won't accept a COVID -19 vaccine. Sometim es people simply want answers to their questions from a healthcare professional. Healthcare providers are one of the most trusted sources for vaccine information. If you don't know an answer be honest, some information about these vaccines will not be avai lable yet.
