The following foods or food ingredients may contain alpha-gal. This is not a list of all products or ingredients that may contain alpha-gal. Mammalian meat (such as beef, pork, lamb, venison, rabbit, etc.) can contain high amounts of alpha-gal. - Certain cuts of meat may contain more alpha-gal than others. For example, organ meat of mammals, including liver, lung, heart, kidneys, intestines (tripe), sweetbreads, scrapple, and Rocky Mountain or prairie oysters generally contain high amounts of alpha-gal. - Food products that contain milk and milk products typically contain alpha-gal. - Many patients with AGS can tolerate milk products. - Cow's milk is the only alpha-gal containing ingredient classified as a major food allergen.
