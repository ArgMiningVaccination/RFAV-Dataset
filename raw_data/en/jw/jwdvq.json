He was given painless vaccination during 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 months because my doctor said it provides immunization against 13 viresus though he left the choice for me and my husband. We opted painless. But now many people are making us worry by saying it painless is not effective for babies, me and my husband are under pressure. Kindly help us to know, does this painless vaccinatuon protect the baby well??? Thanks a lot Answers (2) Like the answers? Consult privately with the doctor of your choice There are few research that says painless vaccines if given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks have lesser immune response ( lesser protection) than painful once. As per standard guidelines initial vaccines should be painful one and subsequently painless can be given. Don't worry there are lot many parents and physicians who still give painless vaccines to their kids. These reports are from western world where diphtheria and pertussis is coming back in adulthood. The effect of same in Indian scenario is still not clearly understood. Next Steps Next DPT vaccination will be at 16-24 months and then Tdap at 5 and 10 year.

If that was the case why would your doctor recommend it in the first place or why would these vaccines even be available? The vaccine that you have mentioned is probably Prevenar, which provides protection against 13 subtypes of Pneumococcal bacteria. That is always painless. There is no painful vaccine against Pneumococcal bacteria. Disclaimer : The content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
