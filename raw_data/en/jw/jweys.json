The RLS Model contains supporting materials to conduct three types of assessment: Preceptor evaluation of resident's attainment of goals and objectives Resident's self -evaluation of his or her attainment of goals and objectives Resident's evaluation of the preceptor and learning experience Assessment of resident performance, both by preceptors and by the resident him/herself is directly linked to the model's goals and o bjectives. An established set of criteria for measuring the quality of performance on each objective is explained in the model. The RLS model provides various forms to help in the assessment of both the resident and prece ptor: Preceptor Evaluations of Resident : Summative Evaluation (required ): Primary evaluative tool for judging overall resident achievement of the goals and objectives assigned to the preceptor's learning experience. Performed by the preceptor at the end of the rotation using the 4 clinic al teaching roles . This evaluation will be conducted verbally with the resident and written in Pharmacademic. Midpoint Evaluation : a verbal midpoint evaluation will be completed by the preceptor at the halfway mark through the rotation. The preceptor wil l discuss how the resident is progressing through the rotation and what they need to improve upon in order to meet the goals and objectives for the learning experience. Snapshot Evaluation (optional ): criteria -based checklist for evaluating resident perfo rmance on each of the objectives in the RLS Model. A snapshot evaluation is used to evaluate one specific performance of the targeted objective by the resident. The criteria- based checklists provide written feedback to help residents improve their perform ance and are designed as a supplement to routine verbal feedback for communicating the specifics of evaluation during the course of a learning experience. Quarterly Longitudinal Evaluation (required) : The Pharmacy Residency Director shall meet with the re sident quarterly. Prior to these meetings, the resident will complete the Quarterly Residency Plan. The purpose of these quarterly evaluations is to review the written evaluations of the resident' s performance, review the residents' evaluations of precep tors, review and modify the customized plan for the next quarter, review any ongoing projects such a s the residency project or lectures, and revise the residency plan, if necessary. The resident and the Residency Program Director and preceptors if appropri ate will discuss the resident's educational progress and performance as they relate to the residency's goals and objectives. If any issues with the resident's progress are identified at the quarterly evaluation, meetings may occur more frequently.

This self -assessment identifies areas of strength and weakness for the resident and helps develop action plans for learning experiences throughout the Residency year. Th e Self-Assessment provides the resident with a tool for continual self -assessment and establishes benchmarks to measure personal & professional success. This assessment plan is evaluat ed and updated with the Residency Program Director on a quarterly basis. Resident's Self -Assessment Summative Evaluation (required) : Using the summative evaluation form for the specific learning experience, the resident self -evaluates his/her performance d uring the rotation. The evaluation form is compared to the completed evaluation of the preceptor. The residents should be reminded to constantly evaluate himself and herself throughout the residency year. Resident Evaluation of Preceptor (required) : Performed by the resident to evaluate the quality of his or her preceptor's performance at the end of the learning experience. Resident Evaluation of Learning Experience (required) : Performed by the resident to evaluate the quality of the learning experience and effectiveness of the learning activities the end of the learning experience. The resident self -assessment, learning experience, and preceptor evaluations are due on the Monday following the final day of the rotation. The preceptor of the rotation is responsible for ensuring that the evaluations are completed and co - signed in a timely fashion. These reports are reviewed by the Residency Program Director to assure timely submission and that effective detail has been included . Compliance with the Evaluation Policy Residents and Preceptors must comply with the evaluation policy. This is essential for the advancement of the resident and the residency program. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action by the RPD Feedback on perfo rmance, given by the preceptor or the resident, should be constructive, honest, collegial, and tactful. The goal is to improve performance. It is more constructive to suggest how something should be done rather than just pointing out a problem and not of fering a solution. Feedback should be - 30 - honest and without fear of reprisal. Stating that an unsatisfactory situation is good does not improve the situation and only provides positive feedback for it to continue. Evaluations should be done with tact and s ensitivity.

The Residency Program Director is the Chair of this Committee. Prior to each meeting the Residency Program Director develops an agenda for the meeting. If any resident have any suggestions throughout the year for improvement to the residency, he / she should bring these to the Residency Prog ram Director so that a discussion of the potential improvement can be added to the committee's agenda. During the fourth quarter, the Residency Program Director and the Director of Pharmacy will elicit feedback from the residents for the purpose of making improvements to the program. This is typically completed prior to the f ormal exit interview to allow the Program Director to begin planning for the next year's program. A more formal exit interview evaluation process occurs at the end of June and gives t he resident an opportunity to provide feedback about suggested changes to the curriculum as well as to evaluate whether his or her goals as stated in the residency plan have been met , to evaluate the program and Program Director, and to perform self -reflec tion about the most important things that were learned during training. The June meeting of the Residency Advisory Committee will focus on a discussion and critique of the previous year's program . The committee will review suggestions for changes for the upcoming year. The current residents may be asked to attend this meeting , depending upon the feedback given through the exit interviews . The Residency Program Director and members of the Residency Advisory Committee will take this feedback to plan, impleme nt, and evaluate each change recommended. The 1 st Quarter Meeting of the Residency Advisory Committee will focus on reviewing plans for the upcoming year including rotation scheduling, curricular changes based upon ASHP requirements, electives, project id eas, and any changes occurring at the clinical sites. The RAC will perform an annual review of the ASHP Standards and Learning Objectives to assure that the program remains within compliance of these standards in order to maintain accreditation. - 32 - ROTATIONS - 33 - AMBULATORY CARE Stony Brook University World Trade Center Health and Wellness Rotation Address: 500 Commack Road, Suite 160, Commack, NY 11725 Required Description of Practice Area: The PGY1 Pharmacy Ambulatory Care rotation at the Stony Brook World Trade Health and Wellness Program (WTC) is a 4 -week elective experience that exposes residents to ambulatory care practice in a clinic that serves 9/11 responders.

It is made up of four Registered Pharmacy areas : the Main Hospital Pharmacy , the OR Sa tellite Pharmacy , the Out-Patient Ambulatory Surgery Satellite Pharmacy , and t he Out -Patient Cancer Center/MART Satellite Pharmacy . There are over 130 professional staff members who uphold the Pharmacy's mission, vision, and goals. They keep the University Hospital Pharmacy Department operating around the clock in order to deliver world class service and care. Role of the Pharmacist in the Practice Area: The fundamental purpose of pharmaceutical services is to ensure the safe and appropriate use of medicati ons. Our core philosophy is that pharmacists practicing in academic institutions such as SBUH are expected to make meaningful contributions to patient care, education, community service, and research. Optimal pharmaceutical care can be defined as the iden tification, resolution, and prevention of drug -related problems that affect positive patient outcomes. We believe that this is best provided through a team approach that effectively integrates the knowledge and skills of the pharmacist with those of other health care professionals. Responsibilities of the Resident Pharmacist include learning all of the different stations of the main pharmacy operations prior to the start of their clinical rotations ; as well as attend regular meetings that will help orient them to the longitudinal expectations of their entire residency . Expectations of Residents: Residents are expected to act in a professional manner each day and to come to work ready to learn. A calendar of assigned locations will be provided for the re sident on the first day of their rotation, expected hours are either 6am to 2:30pm, or 7am to 3:30pm, based upon the resident's assignment that day. The resident must d emonstrate an overall understanding of general pharmacy systems including: Centralized and decentralized medication distribution systems: The electronic Medication Administration Record The Pharmacy information system The Computerized Prescriber Order Entry System (CPOE) Other technology within the pharmacy Interpret physician's orders Profiling drug orders for new admissions and previously admitted patients - 77 - The patient medication profile Reviewing Pharmacy Patient Drug Profiles and demonstrating an ability to identify and resolve drug therapy related problems (i.e. drug -drug interactions and drug diet interactions) Summarizing the cassette exchange/delivery system and times for each patient unit Understand the procedures surrounding unit based distribution cabinets. The appropriately procedure for following up on problematic medication orders. Describe the process for documenting pharmacist's interventions.

Develop and institute a PGY2 Residency in an area of specialty, such as Critical Care 2. Organize an enduring Stony Brook Pharmacy run s ymposium which would be an all day ACPE accredited learning programs offering 5 - 6 CE credits. This program will be theme oriented and all talks will be devoted to a particular area such as the pharmacologic advances in oncology, cardiology, anticoagulation etc. 3. Organize a yearly retreat that will be open to all hospital pharmacies in Suffolk and Nassau counties of Long Island that have residency programs. The purpose of this symposium would be to network all reside ncy programs on Long Island and the event would focus on the operational requirements involved in supporting ASHP residency programs. Invited speakers could be enlisted from either well- established existing programs and/ or ASHP personnel that are resp onsib le for residency programs. 4. Develop a process in which the pharmacy residents are integrated into the discharge planning of patients and will be responsible for the education of patents regarding their discharge medications. - 103 - PHARMACADEMIC: A GUIDE FOR RESIDENTS PharmAcademic is a web -based software tool that is used us to manage the evaluations and record -keeping associated with residency programs accredited by ASHP (American Society of Health -System Pharmacists). Your residency is based on g oals and objectives as set forth by the Residency Learning System (RLS). PharmAcademic is a tool that is based on the RLS and helps your residency program meet the standards for accreditation.

Preceptors and RPDs can delete evaluation tasks. If there is something on your task list that you do not think should be there, please contact your preceptor or RPD first. EVALUA TIONS There are multiple types of evaluations in PharmAcademic . Summative evaluations are used to evaluate the goals and objectives for learning experiences (which are often referred to as rotations). The resident will receive a summative self -evaluatio n and the preceptor(s) will receive a summative evaluation to complete. Snapshot evaluations are used to evaluate criteria associated with one of the objectives. Like summative evaluations, there is a snapshot self -evaluation completed by the resident and a snapshot completed by the preceptor(s). Snapshots are only available for PGY1 Pharmacy programs. Learning experience evaluations are completed by the resident to evaluate the learning experience. Preceptor evaluations are completed by the resident to evaluate the preceptors. One preceptor evaluation is created for each preceptor associated with the learning experience. Custom evaluations are created by PharmAcademic users. They may be completed by residents and/or preceptors/RPDs. After an evaluation is complete, it is routed for co -signatures. Evaluations completed by the resident are co -signed by the preceptor, and then co -signed by the RPD. Evaluations completed by the preceptor are co -signed by the resident, and then co -signed by the RPD.

They can do it using \"manage tasks and evaluations\" in the preceptor menu. - 105 - PGY-1 Pharmacy Residency Program Policies & Procedures Stony Brook University Hospital Department of Pharmacy - 106 - ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES FOR THE PGY-1 RESIDENCY PROGRAM Licensure: Applicants must be licensed to practice pharmacy, or eligible to become licensed to practice pharmacy in the State of New York. Residents entering the program who are not yet licensed to practice Pharmacy in the State of New York MUST apply for a Limited (Intern) Permit before starting the residency. Application for this permit and other licensing information can be obtained on the web at http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/pharm/pharmlic.htm Residency candidates MUST have successfully completed all requirements for licensure in Ne w York State by October 1st of the residency year. In the event that the resident fails to obtain licensure by October 1 st the RPD and the Residency Advisory Committee may allow the resident to remain in his/her position under the conditions that the res ident would be mandated to make up the time between the date of actual licensure at the end of his/her residency. Because of funding issues it should be noted that there is a possibility that the resident may have to be placed on a volunteer status while he/she makes up this time. A written agreement will be signed by the resident and RPD to confirm the planned extension. If these terms are not met, this may result in termination of the resident from the residency program. Duty Hours: Purpose: To es tablish an institutional policy regarding duty hours for all pharmacy residents training programs within Stony Brook University Hospital (SBUH). Duty hours are defined as all hours spent on scheduled clinical and academic activities, regardless of setting , related to the pharmacy residency program that are required to meet the educational goals and objectives of the program. , o i.e., patient care (both inpatient and outpatient), administrative duties , staffing requirements, the provision for transfer of pat ient care, time spent in- house during call activities, and scheduled academic activities such as conferences. o Duty hours do not include reading , studying, and academic preparation time spent away from the duty site. Travel time to and from conferences an d hours that are not scheduled by the RPD or a preceptor also do not count as duty hours. - 107 - Moonlighting at an alternate site is not recommended. The resident should use his/her discretion before performing moonlighting hours. The resident's priority is t o the residency program. If residency performance is negatively affected, the resident may be asked to terminate moonlighting hours. Maximum Duty Period Length: Duty hours must be limited to 80 hours per week, averaged over a 4 - week period, inclusive of all in- house call activities and all moonlighting. Residents must have a minimum of one day in seven days free of duty (when averaged over four weeks). At- home call cannot be assigned on these free days. Duty periods of PGY -1 residents must not exceed 1 6 hours in duration. There must be a minimum of 8 hours between shifts. Shifts may include day, evening, nights, and weekends. All residents are expected to work their scheduled hours to successfully complete the program. Reporting Duty Hours: Resident s must track their duty hours at the end of each month in Pharmacademic. A form will automatically populate in their to -do list at the end of the month for the resident to complete. - 108 - LEAVE POLICIES Weekend Coverage All PGY1 residents will work one we ekend every 21 days or approximately one weekend per month. If the resident is unable to work a day on the weekend that they are scheduled, they may illicit the assistance of their co-residents for a switch. However, if coverage cannot be found , the resi dent must work the weekend days that were originally scheduled. Weekday Hours A typical work week is on the day shift, Monday through Friday. However, since this is a 24-hour facility, evening and night shifts may also be required. Residents are require d to fulfill all the activities and hours of the rotation they are scheduled for. Expected hours will be defined by the preceptor at the beginning of each rotation. Sick Time Sick time is allowed and is governed by the rules and regulations of SBUH . When ill, residents must contact the Program Director and preceptor via phone or email, as well as the Supervisor on duty by calling the main pharmacy line: 631-444-2680. Extended Sick Leave Extended sick leave is sick leave that exceeds the amount of sick leave the resident is entitled to, as defined by UUP. Extended leave may be granted to any resident for good cause. Human Resources must be consulted in addition to the RPD in order to determine eligibility for this type of leave. If a resident requests extended leave and is granted such, he/she must make up this time at the end of his/her residency in order to the fulfill the requirements of the residency. It should be noted that due to the funding structure of the residency program it is very likely that funding will not be available for the resident while the resident makes up this lost time. - 109 - RESIDENT DISCIPLINARY , REMEDIATION , & DISMISSAL POLICIES Residents are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times and to fo llow all relevant SBUH and Residency Program policies. Disciplinary and/or Remediation action will be taken if a resident: Does not follow policies and procedures of SBUH, Department of Pharmacy, or Residency Program Does not present him/herself in a professional manner Does not earn satisfactory progress on any of the residency goals or objectives Does not make adequate progress towards the completion of residency requirements (e.g. project, manuscript, CE presentations, seminar) Demonstrates gross negligence Disciplinary Action and/or Remediation Policy and Procedure If a resident fails to make satisfactory advancement in any aspect of the residency program, the following disciplinary steps shall be taken: 1. Early Identification: If a resident ap pears to be struggling in specific areas continuously across rotations, these concerns should be brought to the RPD. The RPD will assess the resident's evaluations on PharmAcademic and any verbal or written feedback from the preceptor(s). The RPD will address any longitudinal deficits in the resident's Quarterly Evaluation. If the concerning behaviors continue on the rotation following the Quarterly Evaluation, then the RPD will give the resident a verbal warning and have a discussion to assist in any barriers to learning that the resident may be experiencing. 2. First Remediation: If satisfactory improvement is not seen within 2 weeks, the RPD will meet with the resident, and the resident will be given a written warning. This document will identify spec ific learning objectives and/or behaviors that require attention and improvement by the resident, as well as an action plan for when and how these deficiencies will be addressed. The document will be signed by the resident and the RPD and kept into their personnel file by the Residency Program Director. A remediation plan will then be created by the RAC to address the resident's deficiencies. The remediation plan will include: Specific objectives or general areas for improvement the team has identified a s problematic An appropriate solution or measurable outcome. This will include goals for monitoring progress. Dates to reach these outlined goals Follow -up steps to take if goals are not achieved within the designated time frame. 3. Second Remediation: If satisfactory improvement is not seen during the first remediation (2 -4 weeks), the resident will meet with the RPD and receive a second written warning. A second remediation plan will be created at this time, at which if goals and objectives are not me t by the end of the designated - 110 - timeframe (about 4 weeks), the resident will be given a Final Written Warning and will be subject for dismissal. During the second remediation, the resident may be asked to give up non- required activities, as deemed appropri ate by the RPD and RAC. 4. If the RPD and RAC determine that the resident will not complete the residency program in the normal time frame, a plan to adequately complete the requirements shall be presented and reviewed by the Residency Program Director. No action shall be taken against the resident until the Director of Pharmacy reviews the report and recommendations concerning any action. If the Director of Pharmacy feels that the action recommended by the RPD is appropriate, the action will be implemented. When and if dismissal is recommended by the Residency Program Director, the Director of Pharmacy and the Residency Advisory Committeewill have a meeting to discuss the final decision, which may include termination. Termination is the final step of the disciplinary process and documentation will clearly reflect that prior progressive corrective action has failed to produce an acceptable change in the employee's behavior and/or performance as per UUP regulations. Termination action must be approved through Human Resources prior to meeting with the employee. 5. All disciplinary actions will be documented in PharmAcademic as well as their SBUH employee records. - 111 - APPLICATION PROCESS All candidates for the PGY1 residency program at Stony Brook University Hospital must participate in the ASHP Residency Matching Program.
