The published literature was systematically reviewed to identify TND studies that estimated the change in vaccine effectiveness (VE) with respect to time since vaccination. Fourteen studies were identified through the literature search as meeting eligibility criteria. Meta-analyses were performed to compare VE 15-90 days after vaccination to VE 91-180 days after vaccination. A significant decline in VE was observed for influenza virus subtype A/H3 (change in VE, 33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 57 to 12) and type B (change in VE, 19; 95% CI, 33 to 6). VE declined for influenza virus subtype A/H1, but this difference was not statistically significant (change in VE 8; 95% CI, 27 to 21). A multivariable mixed-effects meta-regression model indicated that the change VE was associated with the proportion of study participants who were cases and the proportion who were vaccinated controls (P < .05). This could reflect biological effects such as (1) mismatch between the vaccine received and the circulating strains (among cases), (2) herd immunity (among controls), or (3) the reduced power of individual TND studies in the later parts of an influenza outbreak. Exploration of new influenza vaccination strategies must be a priority for influenza control, particularly in tropical countries with year-round influenza virus activity. The protection against influenza virus infection provided by the current methods of vaccination is imperfect. Inactivated influenza vaccines primarily induce an antibody response to the surface hemagglutinin (HA) antigen, and HA antibody titers are typically measured by the hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody (HIA) assay [ [1](javascript:;)]. For vaccine licensure, an HIA threshold of 1:40 is conventionally considered seroprotective but confers only approximately 50% protection against infection [ [2](javascript:;)]. Antibody titers decay following their peak at the time of seroconversion, 2-4 weeks after vaccination [ [3](javascript:;)]. The rate of this decline is uncertain and is likely to depend on characteristics of the individual, such as age and comorbidities, their influenza virus infection and vaccination history, and the immunogenicity of individual strains. In older adults, a meta-analysis of HIA persistence after vaccination suggested titers decline significantly from seroconversion to 180 days after vaccination [ [4](javascript:;)]. By 360 days, titers further declined and were not significantly different from those before vaccination. An important question is if this waning immunity also translates into reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE). The duration of VE will help determine the optimal time to vaccinate, as vaccinating too early may substantially reduce protection later in the season if VE wanes too quickly. This issue is of even more relevance in the tropics and subtropics, where multiple influenza outbreaks may occur every year and interepidemic transmission and year-round influenza activity are frequently described [ [5](javascript:;)]. Vaccination guidelines in the tropics currently recommend annual influenza vaccination, However, these recommendations are based on extrapolating from studies of influenza epidemiology, and prospective studies have not been performed to determine if they represent the best vaccination strategy [ [6](javascript:;)]. The implications of this epidemiology for out-of-season travelers from temperate to tropical climates has also not been established [ [7](javascript:;)]. Randomized clinical trials that assess the duration of influenza vaccine efficacy as the primary end point have not been conducted. Similar to antibody titers, recent data from a number of test-negative design (TND) case-control studies have suggested that, following a peak at seroconversion, VE declines significantly [ [8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;)]. The case TND study has become the preferred method for assessing VE in observational studies. With this study design, individuals presenting to a healthcare facility with an influenza- like illness are prospectively enrolled. Vaccination status is compared between study participants with a confirmed influenza virus infection (ie, test-positive cases) and those whose influenza screen has a negative result (ie, test-negative controls). Matching cases and controls in this way reduces the problem inherent in other observational study designs, where differences in health-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals is an important confounding factor [ [10](javascript:;)]. Like any observational study, this method has limitations, and these may affect the validity of any observed decline in VE. We sought to identify all published TND studies that analyzed the effectiveness of influenza vaccine, stratified by time since vaccination, to provide summary estimates of the magnitude of any change in VE, assess the influence of study characteristics on this change, and review the quality of the evidence. METHODS An abbreviated study protocol is available from the National Institute for Health Research International prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42017071890) [ [11](javascript:;)]. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses checklist for reporting of systematic review was followed [ [12](javascript:;)]. Search Strategy and Study Selection Search Strategy A search strategy was developed using the PICOST (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, situation, and type of study) framework, as follows. The population was composed of individuals presenting with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) who were tested for influenza infection. No restriction was placed on population age, sex, or ethnicity; on the place of residence (eg, community or long-term care facility); or on the presence of particular comorbidities. The intervention consisted of seasonal influenza vaccination in the 12 months preceding study enrollment, using any licensed influenza vaccine type (eg, live attenuated, inactivated trivalent, or quadrivalent, and standard dose, high dose, or adjuvanted). The odds of vaccination among cases with confirmed influenza infection were compared to the odds among controls with a negative influenza test were calculated. The outcome, VE, was analyzed by time since vaccination, adjusted for measured confounders between cases and controls. No situational restriction was placed on the country in which the study was performed or on the type of healthcare facility (outpatient or inpatient). Only TND case-control studies were included. Databases, Search Construct, and Screening A publication date limit of 2005 was chosen, to reflect the year when TND methods were first published [ [10](javascript:;)]. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify relevant literature, using the following search construct, limited to studies indexed as published in English and reported in humans: (1) title: (influenza or flu) and vaccin*, AND (2) any field: (effectiveness or VE), NOT (3) title: haemophilus or avian. Reference lists of all included publications were screened. After removal of duplicates, a 3-stage screening process was used: review the title first, the abstract second, and, when possible, the full text third. Screening was performed by 2 independent reviewers (B. Y. and S. S.), with discrepancies resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (M. C.). Data Collection Data were extracted using a standardized template. Data collected included all adjusted VE estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), demographic characteristics of study participants, and study characteristics. Verification of entered data was performed by an independent re-collection of data from the source publication. Further systematic search for gray or unpublished literature was not performed. Corresponding authors were contacted for clarification of data when necessary, including VE estimates when only graphical data were available. Synthesis of Results Meta-analyses were conducted according to the following influenza virus types and subtypes: A(H1), A(H3), and B. The reported VE estimate and 95% CIs, adjusted for confounders, were converted to an odds ratio (OR), calculated as [1 VE]/100. The standard error was calculated from the natural log-transformed values of the OR 95% confidence intervals. For pragmatic reasons when using a log scale, a VE estimate of 100 was recorded as 99.5. Outcome data were grouped for the meta-analysis by best fit to sequential 3-month periods after vaccination (15-90, 91-180, 181-270, and 271-360 days). For studies that reported VE as a continuous rather than categorical variable, midpoint estimates from these periods were used. ORs were aggregated by inverse-variance weighting. A random-effects model was used to reflect the assumption that the effects being estimated in the different studies were not identical. Variability of outcomes between studies was assessed using the heterogeneity statistic, I2. No subgroup analyses were planned during protocol development. Possible publication bias was assessed by examination of funnel plots. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence for each outcome [ [13](javascript:;)]. The difference in VE (VE) between periods was calculated, and the CI for this difference was estimated using bootstrapping. Bootstrapped estimates were based on inferring the sample distribution of VEs from each study, using the standard error estimated from reported CIs, with 100000 resamplings [ [14](javascript:;)]. Median VE and the 2.5% and 97.5% centiles were recorded as estimates of CIs. The distribution of VE was modeled using the normal distribution to estimate a mean and standard deviation. These values were used as the unit of analysis for a mixed-effects meta-analytic regression model of study characteristics, with between-study variance estimated using restricted maximum likelihood estimators. When data were incomplete, missing values were omitted, rather than imputed. Influenza virus subtype/type were analyzed using dummy variables. A multivariable model of all variables with a P value < .1 in the univariate analysis was constructed and refined by backward elimination. Corrections for multiple testing were not performed. Meta-analyses were calculated using RevMan v5.3 [ [15](javascript:;)]. All other analyses were performed using R, version 3.4.1 and the metafor package [ [16](javascript:;), [17](javascript:;)]. Statistical significance was assumed with a 2-sided of 0.05. RESULTS Database searches were performed on 17 July 2017. This identified 1614 unique citations for further screening ( [Figure 1](javascript:;)). All studies identified for full-text review but subsequently excluded were accessed and either did not have a TND or did not include time since vaccination in their analysis.

Most studies (11 of 14) were conducted in either Europe or the United States, with 1 from Kenya, 1 from Thailand, and 1 from Australia. Data covered influenza seasons from 2009 to 2016. Four studies were from the 2011-2012 northern hemisphere winter, when the decline in VE with time since vaccination was first described. The single-season studies from Europe were conducted as part of the (Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe) project, with common study designs and definitions. Some of the cases and controls from these single-season studies, are expected to have been included in the multiseason study by Kissling et al [ [8](javascript:;)], although this is a much larger data set involving additional years and countries. Two of the studies conducted in the Spanish 2011-2012 winter have partially overlapping data sets [ [21](javascript:;), [22](javascript:;)]. Most studies (11 of 14) enrolled participants only from primary care facilities. The proportion of influenza cases in children and younger adults varied considerably between studies, from 8% to 72%. One study was conducted only in children aged <10 years [ [19](javascript:;)]. Older adults comprised <20% of influenza cases in all but 2 studies [ [21](javascript:;), [24](javascript:;)]. The proportion of controls who had received influenza vaccination varied from 11% to 57%. Information regarding the type of influenza vaccine administered was generally not available. Studies used similar inclusion criteria to determine the presence of an acute respiratory illness, and all used molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction as the diagnostic test for influenza virus infection. All studies excluded influenza cases who were vaccinated within 14 days prior to onset of infection, and most only included subjects who presented within 7 days of symptom onset. All studies reported a VE that could be mapped to approximately 15-90 days and 91-180 days after vaccination. Two large, multiseason studies reported the VE with modeling of time from vaccination as a continuous rather than categorical variable. Most of the single-seasons studies did not have sufficient breadth of influenza virus infections to estimate VE for each seasonal influenza type and subtype of interest. Data were available for A(H3) in 11 of 14 studies; for B, in 6 of 14; and for A(H1), in 5 of 14. Only 3 studies explored VE >180 days following vaccination ( [Table 3](javascript:;)). Two of these studies were conducted in tropical countries (Thailand [ [18](javascript:;)] and Kenya [ [19](javascript:;)]) with year-round influenza virus activity. In 2 studies, the VE declined as the year progressed, and by year end, VE was not statistically significant. Katz et al [ [19](javascript:;)] reported a largely stable adjusted VE from days 15-90 to days 271-360. |Reference, Serotype .||Period 3 3- Period 1 .||VE (95% CI), Period 4- Period 1 .| |Postvaccination Days (95% CI) .||Postvaccination 3- Period 1 .||VE (95% CI), Period 4- Period 1 .| |Postvaccination Days (95% CI) .||Postvaccination Period spanned postvaccination days 15-90.

Meta-analysis Because of limited VE data from >180 days after vaccination, meta-analyses and estimates of VE were restricted to comparisons of data from 15-90 days and 91-180 days. Forest plots of VE converted to an OR and stratified by period and influenza virus type and subtype are presented in [Figure 2](javascript:;). A significant decline in VE from 15-90 days to 91-180 days was observed for A(H3) (VE, 33; 95% CI, 57 to 12) and B (VE, 19; 95% CI, 33 to 6). VE declined for A(H1), but this difference was not significant (VE, 8; 95% CI, 27; 21). VE estimates for both periods were markedly lower for A(H3), compared with B and A(H1) |15-90 d .| 877 (33 to A(H1)||5148 cases, 17 044 controls||5||Low||-8 78)||54 (43 |15-90 d .| 877 (33 to A(H1)||5148 cases, 17 044 controls||5||Low||-8 (-27 to 21)||62 (35 to 78)||54 (43 to 63)| Aggregate odds ratios from the meta-analysis in [Figure 2](javascript:;) were converted to VE values, stratified by influenza virus type/subtype and time since vaccination, with bootstrapped estimates used for VE.

Heterogeneity as assessed by I2 was generally low (0%-24%) apart from that for A(H3) 91-180 days after vaccination (I2 = 60%) days after vaccination (I2 = 82%). Heterogeneity was mainly attributable to high VE estimates, by Radin et al [ [20](javascript:;)] and Andrews et al [ [26](javascript:;)] for the A(H3) and A(H1) meta-analyses respectively. Excluding either study had little impact on the summary VE estimates ( [Supplementary Materials, Appendix 1](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/jid/217/5/10.1093_infdis_jix632/2/jix632_suppl_supplementary_data.docx?Expires=1697211928&Signature=zFPZBxr-xv2fOY5R-jpJBoVD5MamrhOpUF80FY4KIeW2dtvK-qwpJECy4v9vmCM0Vz2Wq83DV9djDw-5oJms0DkkCqsflP3bQeBotumIwZ-sdNoQrGbZuZWQidz7YjZholOJxFBPM3Gl4jwiSIj9wcdypnBwN9nqHT56VYf3t7thdciMjgSZKCGaSZnP-31L1n7BhxXFhjHypW14L2yWCC9hJKjH8UrnQ5KcjCdYXFrgo~2WsPV9M5PASuWIYZ8oBbldtgKMAguf~6b19VBZp1sfyY-cAoxjC6kSASS88wClO1MnNjVAiBRrb1WJQALKcr2OLboxduQCdkQEky13RA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)). Meta-regression The distribution of bootstrapped VE samples were negatively skewed, although the normal distribution provided a reasonable fit to derive estimates for a mean and standard deviation ( [Supplementary Materials, Appendix 2 and 3](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/jid/217/5/10.1093_infdis_jix632/2/jix632_suppl_supplementary_data.docx?Expires=1697211928&Signature=zFPZBxr-xv2fOY5R-jpJBoVD5MamrhOpUF80FY4KIeW2dtvK-qwpJECy4v9vmCM0Vz2Wq83DV9djDw-5oJms0DkkCqsflP3bQeBotumIwZ-sdNoQrGbZuZWQidz7YjZholOJxFBPM3Gl4jwiSIj9wcdypnBwN9nqHT56VYf3t7thdciMjgSZKCGaSZnP-31L1n7BhxXFhjHypW14L2yWCC9hJKjH8UrnQ5KcjCdYXFrgo~2WsPV9M5PASuWIYZ8oBbldtgKMAguf~6b19VBZp1sfyY-cAoxjC6kSASS88wClO1MnNjVAiBRrb1WJQALKcr2OLboxduQCdkQEky13RA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)). The univariate meta-regression model identified the proportion of vaccinated controls and percentage of cases as statistically significantly correlated with VE ( [Table 5](javascript:;)). Surprisingly, influenza virus subtype/type was not significantly associated with VE. Data were complete for all variables except the presence of chronic diseases (for which there were 3 missing data points). |Variable .||Univariable Analysis .||Multivariable Model .| total between-study multivariable model: R2 = standard error; VE, effectiveness. |Variable total between-study multivariable model: R2 = 42.96%. Abbreviations: SE, standard error; VE, vaccine effectiveness. The percentage of recruited study participants identified as influenza cases and the percentage of controls who were vaccinated were retained in the multivariable model. A lower proportion of vaccinated controls and a higher percentage of cases were associated with larger declines in VE with time since vaccination (ie, a negative VE). Publication Bias Because of the small number of studies, funnels plots were only interpretable for A(H3). No evidence of publication bias was found from inspection of the plot for A(H3) at 91-180 days, with studies approximately symmetrically distributed about the OR summary estimate ( [Supplementary Materials, Appendix 4](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/jid/217/5/10.1093_infdis_jix632/2/jix632_suppl_supplementary_data.docx?Expires=1697211928&Signature=zFPZBxr-xv2fOY5R-jpJBoVD5MamrhOpUF80FY4KIeW2dtvK-qwpJECy4v9vmCM0Vz2Wq83DV9djDw-5oJms0DkkCqsflP3bQeBotumIwZ-sdNoQrGbZuZWQidz7YjZholOJxFBPM3Gl4jwiSIj9wcdypnBwN9nqHT56VYf3t7thdciMjgSZKCGaSZnP-31L1n7BhxXFhjHypW14L2yWCC9hJKjH8UrnQ5KcjCdYXFrgo~2WsPV9M5PASuWIYZ8oBbldtgKMAguf~6b19VBZp1sfyY-cAoxjC6kSASS88wClO1MnNjVAiBRrb1WJQALKcr2OLboxduQCdkQEky13RA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)). The plot for A/H3 days 15-90 was similar, except for Radin et al [ [20](javascript:;)], which formed an outlier. This study was one of only two for which A/H3 VE was significant from day 91-180, and was previously identified as contributing significant heterogeneity. GRADE Assessment At baseline, the certainty of evidence derived from a review of TND studies was assessed as low, owing to their observational nature. With a large effect size and no serious other issues, the certainty for a decline in VE against A(H3) in the first 6 months after vaccination was upgraded to moderate ( [Table 4](javascript:;)). For A(H1) and B, the certainty of VE estimates remained low. Evidence for a further decline in VE 6-12 months after vaccination were assessed to be very low because of the limited available data. DISCUSSION The review and meta-analysis found consistent evidence of a significant decline in VE within the first 180 days following influenza vaccination. The decline was observed to be more pronounced for A(H3) and B as compared to A(H1). The magnitude of the observed decline in VE has important implications for the logistics of influenza vaccination campaigns in temperate and tropical climates. Evidence from other sources generally corroborate the findings of this review. A randomized controlled trial comparing an inactivated versus a live-attenuated influenza vaccine in adults aged 18-49 years was reanalyzed using a time-varying efficacy approach [ [30](javascript:;)]. Immediately following vaccination, efficacy was close to 100%, but it declined to approximately 50% after 12 weeks. A TND study performed over the 2008-2009 northern hemisphere winter season was reanalyzed, and a significantly increased risk for subtype A(H3) infection with time since vaccination in older adults (age, >75 years) and young children (age, <2 years) was found [ [31](javascript:;)]. The adjusted odds for infection increased by 1.3 or 1.2, respectively, per 2-week interval. This study was not included in the systematic review, because VE was not calculated. Antibody persistence following influenza vaccination\u2014the likely corollary to any decline in VE\u2014is not measured in TND studies. As antibodies to influenza vaccine components wane faster in older than younger adults, VE would also be expected to decline faster [ [3](javascript:;)]. This was observed in the 2 studies that recruited a significant proportion of older adults [ [21](javascript:;), [24](javascript:;)]. Failure to identify older age as a risk factor for a decline in VE in most of the studies reviewed and in our regression model of VE may reflect a lack of statistical power. Because VE in general is lower in older compared with younger adults, the absolute VE decline in older adults will also be numerically smaller [ [32](javascript:;)]. A related question, as yet unstudied, is whether symptomology or the probability of severe disease changes as VE declines [ [33](javascript:;)]. Limited evidence was uncovered in the review to quantitatively estimate how VE changes >180 days after vaccination. With the extent of the decline seen in the first 6 months for A(H3) and B, sustained year-round protection following vaccination is unlikely. Improved vaccines have the potential for significant public health impact in this region, but have been little studied. For example, vaccines with a higher antigen dose, with a recombinant antigen, or with adjuvants have been developed for older adults and might offer superior year-round VE as compared to the standard inactivated vaccine [ [34](javascript:;), [35](javascript:;)]. However, while these vaccines have better short-term immunogenicity than standard inactivated vaccine, few long-term antibody persistence data are available [ [36-38](javascript:;)]. In the studies included in this review, the influence of vaccine type on VE and time since vaccination was not documented. As an alternative to new vaccines, increasing the frequency of vaccination may improve VE. A second dose of influenza vaccine, administered at least 4 weeks after the first, is recommended for immunologically naive young children [ [39](javascript:;)]. Repeat vaccine administration after 1-3 months in other populations such as immunocompromised adults has serological benefit, although the clinical impact is unknown [ [40](javascript:;)]. Vaccinating every 6 months in the tropics is attractive because of the simplicity, low cost, and safety profile of the standard dose inactivated vaccine, and it reflects the semiannual update to the recommended vaccine strain composition by the World Health Organization. The serological outcomes of a semiannual vaccination strategy in older adults are currently being studied in a clinical trial, with results expected in 2018 [ [41](javascript:;)]. While the observed decline in VE may reflect waning immunity, an alternative explanation is the emergence of influenza strain escape variants mismatched to those included in the vaccine as the season progresses. Several studies assessed the phylogenetics of circulating strains, mainly for A(H3) in the 2011-2012 northern hemisphere winter. No significant change in the proportion of mismatched viruses as the season progressed was identified, suggesting this was unlikely to explain the apparent decline in VE entirely. However, the rate of new strains emerging between seasons may explain differences in the VE decline, which is faster for A(H3) strains, compared with A(H1) and B strains [ [42](javascript:;)]. Correspondingly, the smaller observed decline in A(H1) VE may reflect the homogeneity of the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) strain across the period of the study, with repeated vaccination (or infections) boosting strain-specific protection. Other reasons for the apparent change in VE were explored in the meta-regression. VE change with time since vaccination was negatively correlated with the proportion of influenza cases among study participants and positively correlated with the proportion of vaccinated controls. This may reflect issues with study power, as VE estimates have a negative skew, which increases as VE approaches 0, and CIs widen. Reflecting this, CIs for VE were almost twice as wide for estimates 91-180 days after vaccination, compared with those 15-90 days after vaccination. Beyond issues with study power, a higher proportion of vaccinated controls could indicate settings with significant herd immunity effects at the household or even community level. This potentially protects unvaccinated individuals and thus reduces apparent VE and might also protect individuals who had decreased immunity later in the season. The higher percentage of cases to controls may indicate more influenza virus activity in seasons associated with an imperfect match between circulating and vaccine strains. We postulate that, when an imperfect match occurs, protection earlier in the season might still be mediated by less specific antibodies, level of which would decline rapidly after vaccination, leading to substantially poorer protection later in the season than with a well-matched vaccine. As observational studies, a number of assumptions are made with the TND design, which also limit interpretation of the meta-analysis [ [43](javascript:;)]. For example, TND studies rely on a similar probability of non-influenza virus infections among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. It has been proposed that influenza vaccination may increase the risk of a respiratory tract infection to a virus other than influenza virus, resulting in an overestimation of VE [ [44](javascript:;)]. Rather than a waning of protection against infection, the observed decline in VE may reflect a waning in this viral interference. Confounding would also occur if earlier receipt of vaccination before the main influenza season occurred among individuals at higher risk of influenza virus infection. Further TND studies are unlikely to be able to overcome this confounding. Other limitations of this systematic review include potentially missed studies or inaccurate data transcription. Heterogeneity in study methods may also limit the reliability of summary estimates for VE. Most significantly in terms of outcome data, we used point estimates of VE from 2 large studies in the meta-analysis, while the other studies included in the review assessed time since vaccination as a categorical variable, with varying cut offs. The effect of partially overlapping data sets was not adjusted for, although exclusion of studies by both Kissling et al [ [8](javascript:;)] and Ferdinands et al [ [9](javascript:;)] had little impact on summary estimates of VE. Combining TND studies from different seasons, while generally accepted, ignores potentially important differences in VE against influenza strains. Data were also not evenly available across the years, which may have biased findings. Finally, the meta-regression must be interpreted with caution. While VE is a clinically meaningful variable, it is not the primary outcome for included studies, and the reliability of its estimates uncertain. In conclusion, this study found evidence to support the assertion that VE against A(H3) and B declines significantly in the 6 months following vaccination. Further studies with alternative methods would be helpful to confirm this finding. Additional areas to explore include confirming the influence of age on VE decline and exploring the potential benefits of newer vaccines. Notes Acknowledgments. We thank J. Ferdinands, M.
