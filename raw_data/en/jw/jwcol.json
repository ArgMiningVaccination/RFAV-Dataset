Energy Crystals can hold up to 100,000 EUs. When first crafted, they have no charge and before use they must first be charged in an [MFE Unit](/wiki/MFE_Unit), Usage Notes Unlike [RE Batteries](/wiki/RE_Battery), Energy Crystals cannot be stacked no matter how much power they have, where as uncharged batteries can be stacked. Important: When you use a partially or fully charged Energy Crystal, it will completely lose its charge when used to create a [HV Transformer](/wiki/HV_Transformer) or a MFE Unit. When used to create a [Lapotron Crystal](/wiki/Lapotron_Crystal) or [Mining Laser](/wiki/Mining_Laser), the created item will be charged according to the Energy Crystal's original charge. For example: using 2 fully charged Energy Crystals in the creation of a [Mining Laser](/wiki/Mining_Laser) will result in a fully charged [Mining Laser](/wiki/Mining_Laser). Powering Machines: The energy crystal doesn't charge many of the machines, but, oddly enough, it does power "}
