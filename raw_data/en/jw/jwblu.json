On November 5, 2019, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to continue CPRIT's work and invest an additional $3 billion for finding and funding the best cancer research and prevention opportunities in the state. CPRIT is now a $6 billion, 20-year initiative - the largest state cancer research investment in the history of the United States and the second largest cancer research and prevention program in the world.", "sitename": null, "date": "2023-02-15", "cleaned_text": "(AUSTIN) The governing board of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) took a major step forward in the fight against cancer by approving over $90 million in new cancer research and prevention grants at its quarterly meeting near the Texas Capitol on Wednesday. The slate of forty projects from across Texas fund a wide range of innovative research and prevention efforts at major research hubs like Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston, but also invests in rapidly developing cancer research programs in El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley. \"Today's grants are an illustration of how CPRIT is fulfilling the original promise made to Texans at our founding,\" said CPRIT CEO Wayne Roberts. \"From recruitment and prevention grants to boosting the development of cancer research in critical areas of Texas, today's awards strengthen Texas's position as a national leader in cancer research.\" The Oversight Committee awarded $18 million in Texas Regional Excellence in Cancer (TREC) awards to The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) in McAllen, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, and Texas A&M University System Health Science Center in Bryan. CPRIT established the TREC award to strengthen cancer research at institutions located far away from the major research hubs in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. A $6 million grant to UTRGV (RP230419) will support the South Texas Center of Excellence in Cancer Research, the first CPRIT-supported cancer research center in the region. The Center's focus is reducing cancer health disparities in the border region, which has the nation's highest cancer incidence and mortality rate and, consequently, bears a disproportionate share of the cancer burden. \"In supporting the regional expansion of research efforts through our TREC awards,\" said Roberts, \"CPRIT made a strong statement today that whether the institution is located in Houston or El Paso, Dallas or McAllen, all areas of Texas contribute to making the Lone Star State a national leader in the fight against cancer.\" The board also approved almost $7 million in grants focused primarily on fighting cancer in children and adolescents. CPRIT has invested over $364 million in childhood and adolescent cancer research - proportionally more than 3 times the national commitment. For example, today CPRIT awarded Dr. Melanie Bernhart and Baylor College of Medicine a $1.4 million grant (RP230026) to improve treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. Latino children are more likely to be diagnosed with ALL, and unfortunately are also more likely to have severe side effects from the medicines used to treat this cancer. This grant will examine the disparity in these side effects for Latino children with the goal of new treatments to improve survival and increase quality of life. The Oversight Committee also approved five new recruitment grants totaling approximately $18 million to continue to bring the best and brightest cancer researchers to Texas from around the country. The CPRIT Scholars program has awarded $819 million since 2009 to bring 288 stellar cancer investigators to Texas from all over the country - and in the case of today's award, the globe. CPRIT awarded a $2 million grant to Houston Methodist Research Institute to bring Dr. Ewan McRae from Cambridge University, England to Texas. Dr. McRae is an accomplished young scientist focused on RNA biology, a new frontier in cancer research. The Prevention Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Childhood Cancers also presented their annual report at the meeting. The CPRIT Oversight Committee also recognized Kassidy Buth, representing Travis County Emergency Service District 12, which created a \"Fired Up For A Cure\" T-shirt to raise money for CPRIT and cancer research. After processing, the video of the meeting will be available here: [http://meeting.cprit.texas.gov](http://meeting.cprit.texas.gov/) For post-meeting interviews with CPRIT leadership, Oversight Committee members or other participants, please contact Mark Loeffler at 737.212.3753 or 512.517.8669. ABOUT CPRIT The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) was created by the Texas Legislature and approved by a statewide vote in 2007 to lead the Lone Star State's fight against cancer. In 2019, Texas voters again voted overwhelmingly to support CPRIT with an additional $3 billion for a total $6 billion investment in cancer research and prevention. To date, the agency has awarded over $3 billion in grants to Texas research institutions and organizations through its academic research, prevention, and product development research programs. CPRIT has also recruited more than 288 distinguished researchers to Texas, supported the establishment, expansion, or relocation of 51 companies to Texas, and supported more than 8.2 million prevention services reaching all 254 counties in Texas. The Oversight Committee is composed of appointees from the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House and meets at least once every quarter to set the priorities for the agency as well as vote on proposed, peer-reviewed cancer research and prevention grants to institutions throughout the state. # # # CPRIT RECRUITMENT AWARDS FEBRUARY 15, 2023 Sorted by Institution (* denotes prevention grant) BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE RP230026 Melanie Bernhardt Baylor College of Medicine $1,392,407 Identifying Clinical Methotrexate Toxicity Phenotypes Across Phases of Pediatric Leukemia Therapy RP230120 Pavel Sumazin Baylor College of Medicine $1,371,733 Clonal with hepatocellular College of Medicine $2,000,000 Harnessing Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress to Overcome Resistance Immune-cold Cancer RP230391 Maksim Mamonkin Baylor College of Medicine $1,050,000 Understanding and improving CAR T-cell therapy of T-ALL and LBL TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY RP230345 Wenshe Liu Texas A&M University $1,050,000 The Development of Reversible Chemogenetic Switches for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Texas A&M University System Health Science Center RP230063 Robert Tsai Texas A&M University System Health Science Center $2,000,000 Whole Genome DNA Methylation Markers for Tracking and Predicting Advanced Liver Fibrosis as a Precursor of Liver Cancer in NAFLD RP230204 Kenneth Ramos Texas A&M University System Health Science Center $5,998,422 Gene - environment - lifestyle interactions in cancer Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso RP230420 Rajkumar Lakshmanaswamy Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso $6,000,000 Impacting Cancer Outcomes in Hispanics (ICOHN) houston Methodist RR230015 Ewan McRae The Methodist Hospital Research Institute $1,999,977 Recruitment of First-Time, Tenure-Track Faculty Members The University of Texas at Austin RP230334 Seongmin Lee The University of Texas at Austin $1,050,000 Elucidating the mutagenesis mechanism of BRAF in melanoma The University of Texas at Dallas RR230018 Rudi Fasan The University of Texas at Dallas $6,000,000 Recruitment of Established Investigators The University of Texas at San Antonio RP230360 Douglas Frantz The University of Texas at San Antonio $1,049,128 Rational design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified taccalonolide analogs for the treatment of cancer The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston PP230018* Belinda Reininger The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston $999,254 Implementation and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Multilevel Lifestyle Intervention for Underserved/Rural Populations in South Texas: Tu Salud \u00a1Si Cuenta!
