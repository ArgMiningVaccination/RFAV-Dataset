QDT - 1 vi Overview - 1 NSF FY 2019 Budget Request to Congress The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (Public Law 81- 507) sets forth our mission: \"To promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense...\" The FY 2019 Budget Request for the National Science Foundation reflects the Administration's commitment to NSF's role in strengthening the Nation's economy, national security, and global leadership, while also restraining non-defense spending across the gover nment . NSF funds the basic research that advances cybersecurity , infrastructure, manufacturing, and military technology, and sustains American preeminence in innovation. NSF also makes critical investments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education that prepare the Nation's future -focused workforce. NSF investments have led to research that has yielded 2 31 Nobel prizes. Notable among these many outstanding investments is the Laser Interferometer Gravitati onal Wave Observatory, where gravitational waves have been detected following black hole mergers and most recently, a merger of two neutron- stars. NSF is the only federal agency dedicated to funding basic non-biomedical research across all areas of scien ce and engineering . NSF is also committed to the development of a future- focused science and engineering workforce that draws on the talents of all Americans. The reach of the agency's investments is broad. I t is these investments tha t have helped sustain the U.S. role as a global leader in innovation since 1950. NSF investments drive economic growth, increase prosperity, and create jobs for the Nation and all Americans. Investments in basic and early -stage research create a foundation for breakthroughs tha t advance national security and preserve global leadership. The complex global and domestic challenges facing the Nation today will require NSF investments. NSF continues to increase agency efficiency and effectiveness, by improving the stewardship of multi-user facilities, seeding innovative, forward thinking convergent ideas to propel human knowledge forward into new realms, and developing additional and stronger public -private partnerships. Scientific infrastructure has long been a cornerstone of NSF -funded research across the Nation. In FY 2019, NSF will make a strong commitment to agency supported research infrastructure. NSF will invest in the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science project, a necessity for maintaining U.S. scientific and geopolitical eminence across the continent of Antarctica . The agency will begin support for Mid- scale Research Infrastructure , an effort that will address a gap between existing research instrumentation and existing large facility funding; making more science possible while engaging more people in the pursuit of knowledge . Using funds in the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account, NSF will fund the construction of two Regional Class Research Vessels, pivotal components in the modernization of the academic research fleet that helps scientists to understand numerous coastal processes. Complementing NSF's commitment to infrastructure is the agency's constant pursuit of innovation. In FY 2019, NSF will invest in its 10 Big Ideas , research agendas that identify areas at the frontiers of science and engineering which promise to be among the most transformative in the coming decades. NSF will also initiate two Convergence Accelerators, which are new organizational structures that will leverage resources across the agency to supp ort the most innovative science . NSF's support for the Big Ideas and the Convergence Accelerators reflects the agency's ongoing commitment to being on the cutting -edge, while supporting the fundamental research in all areas of science that has advanced the Nation since the agency's founding. Collaboration and convergence are required across NSF in order to achieve the agency's mission Overview Overview - 2 and support the maximum number of researchers. No longer is any one research directorate at NSF the sole NSF funder of science in a given field . Science and engineering today requires innovative approaches to leveraging resources across all fields of science. Federal investment in basic research and the STEM workforce, led by NSF, is vital to the Nation's continued global leadership . Other nations continue to increase their support of research, development, and STEM education, as they innovate in next -generation technologies. China and the E uropean U nion have invested significa ntly in quantum technology, and continue to invest billions of dollars in artificial intelligence research with an eye to a future of global leadership in these areas. There is unprecedented global competition for highly skilled, technical workers who wil l lead tomorrow's innovations. Continued U.S. support for basic research has never been more vital for the Nation and for the world. NSF is essential to advancing American leadership in science and technology. NSF investments in all 50 states of the Union and all U.S. territories have resulted in both short - and long - term innovation and the robust creation of jobs. Over 50 percent of America's economic growth of the past 50 years is attributable to technological innovation. This innovation depends on signi ficant investment in basic research. NSF had a role in the development of the Internet, 3- D printing, cell phones, and in responding to national an d international crises, including the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Hurricane Katrina, and more recently , Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. NSF awarded $5.30 million in 59 grants after recent natural disasters to quickly mobilize resources to aid in relief efforts, to helping understand how to better protect human lives, infrastructure, and resources during these crises. These awards helped scientists understand how to best respond to disasters in the future and how to provide immediate assistance when people needed it most . NSF investments in disaster research have advanced understanding of the paths of tropical cyclones, improved water decontamination, deployed underwater rescue robots, and helped to understand the long -term psychological and emotional effects of disasters. After hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit, r esearchers quickly used the NSF-funded Stampede2 supercomputer to create useful computer models that showed the likely depth and location of water in different regions, which helped first responders navigate flooded areas and allowed them to reach those most in need of assistance. Other researchers are studying the short - and long -term effects of extreme flooding in urban areas to understand the sp read of diseases after floods. Finally, NSF remains committed to investing in the basic research that helps the U.S. military both on and off the battlefield. This includes innovative military technologies to support those on the front lines . Years of NSF -funded research helped create the Worldwide- Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, which has helped the militar y predict where conflict is likely to break out, and how to best mitigate a potential crisis. NSF funding developed Hemogrip, a biopolymer foam that expands in a wound to minimize blood loss and save lives on the battlefield. NSF investments also work to improve the lives of veterans as they readjust to civilian life . NSF -funded research has created better prosthetics and improved screening and treatment of post- traumatic stress disorder, depression, and other issues afflicting America's veteran s. NSF's FY 2019 Budget Request , level to FY 2017 Enacted. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 3 NSF's 10 Big Ideas In 2019, NSF will support 10 Big Ideas, which are bold ideas that identify areas for future , long -term investment at the frontiers of science and engineering. With its broad portfolio of investments, NSF is uniquely suited to advance this set of cutting- edge research agendas and processes that will require collaborations with industry, private foundations, other agencies, science academies and societies, and universi ties and other education institutions. The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities to position our Nation at the frontiers \u2014indeed to define the frontiers \u2014of global science and engineering leadership and to invest in fundamental research that advances America's economic competitiveness and security. About the Big Ideas Six of the Big Ideas focus on research, building on a foundation made possible by earlier investments in fundamental research. Four of the Big Ideas focus on process, and address NSF practices that could be altered or enhanced to capture the best research and to welcome new members to the Nation's science and engineering community. Research Big Ideas: 1. Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st-Century Science and Engineering (HDR) \u2014Engaging NSF's research community in the pursuit of fundamental research in data science and engineering, the development of a cohesive, federated, national -scale approach to research data infrastructure, and the development of a 21st-century data- capable workforce. 2. The Future of Work at the Human Technology Frontier (FW -HTF) \u2014Catalyzing interdisciplinary science and engineering research to understand and build the human -technology relationship; design new technologie s to augment human performance; illuminate the emerging socio -technological landscape; and foster lifelong and pervasive learning with technology. 3. Windows on the Universe (WoU): The Era of Multi- messenger Astrophysics\u2014 Using powerful new syntheses of observational approaches to provide unique insights into the nature and behavior of matter and energy and to answer some of the most profound questions before humankind. 4. The Quantum Leap (QL): Leading the Next Quantum Rev olution \u2014Exploiting quantum mechanics to observe, manipulate, and control the behavior of particles and energy at atomic and subatomic scales; and developing next -generation quantum -enabled science and technology for sensing, information processing, communicating, and computing. 5. Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL): Predicting Phenotype \u2014Elucidating the sets of rules that predict an organism's observable characteristics, i.e., its phenotype. 6. Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) \u2014Establishing an observing network of mobile and fixed platforms and tools across the Arctic to document and understand the Arctic's rapid biological, physical, chemical, and social changes. Overview Overview - 4 Process Big Ideas: 7. NS F INCLUDES \u2014Transforming education and career pathways to help broaden participation in science and engineering. 8. Growing Convergence Research at NSF (GCR) \u2014Merging ideas, approaches, tools, and technologies from widely diverse fields of science and engineering to stimulate discovery and innovation. 9. Mid-scale Research Infrastructure \u2014Developing an agile process for funding experimental research capabilities in the mid -scale range, spanning the midscale gap in research infrastructure between the $4 million cap on NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program and the $70 million lower bound for projects supported by NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account. This is a \"sweet spot \" for science and engineering that has been challenging to fund through traditional NSF programs. 10. NSF 2026 Fund\u2014Stimulating and seeding investments in bold foundational research questions that are large in scope, innovative in character, originate outside of any particular NSF directorate, and may require a long -term commitment. This Big Idea is framed around the year 2026, providing an opportunity for transformative research to mark the Nation's 250 th anniversary. Big I deas Stewardship Funding Model The fundamental research underlying the Big Ideas has been supported through many NSF programs for a number of years, a nd in some cases, for decades. The FY 2019 Budget Request to Congress will accelerate NSF's progress on the Big Ideas through the following funding models: Research Big Ideas . An investment of $30.0 million is requested for each of the six research Big Ideas, for a total investment of $180.0 million. These investments are in addition to the significant investments already being made by individual NSF directorates and offices in these areas. This additional investment for each of the Big Ideas will support convergent research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries of individual NSF directorates and offices. T he research directions for a Big Idea will be overseen and managed collaboratively by the multi- directorate/office leadership of the corresponding Big Idea. Budget management and reporting will be the responsibility of the directorate to which the $30.0 million is assigned for a given Big Idea, with the multi-directorate/office leadership providing oversight. Process Big Ideas . The pro cess Big Ideas are also emphasized in this Budget Request: NSF INCLUDES will be funded at $20.0 million. The program will establish the NSF INCLUDES Alliances, as NSF begins to move the NSF INCLUDES program to national -scale collaborations; NSF 2026 will i nitiate mechanisms to catalyze new research areas that may become future research Big Ideas; GCR will support research programs that transcend two or more of the research Big Ideas, as NSF continues to break down barriers; An increased investment in mid -scale research infrastructure will be used to continue to span the midscale gap noted above. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 5 Agency Reform The landscape in which NSF executes its mission is constantly evolving. Today's research questions are increasingly interdisciplinary in nature, requiring new levels and forms of scientific and engineering collaboration. At the same time, the Nation is addressing pressing challenges, including maintaining the security of cyber systems and physical infrastructure, building resiliency to disasters, improving Americans' health and quality of life, educating and inspiring the next- generation workforce, and growing American jobs and economic productivity. To continue to achieve its mission, NSF must therefore adapt to this evolving environment. In support of this adaptation, and in alignment with NSF's history of continued organizational improvement and the Administration's government -wide agency reform activities, NSF will focus reforms in five areas in FY 2019: Convergence Accelerators. These are new organizational structures that represent an evolution from how funding for research has been organized at the agency. The Convergence Accelerators will be time -limited structural entities intended to leverage external partnerships to facilitate co nvergent and translational activities in areas of national importance. An investment of $60.0 million in FY 2019 will support two Convergence Accelerators pursuant to two of NSF's Big Ideas for Future Investment: HDR and FW-HTF. These Big Ideas were selected for the initial Convergence Accelerators because of their readiness for converge nt and translational research. The $60.0 million investment by NSF is expected to catalyze an additional $40.0 million in investment by external partners, including the priv ate sector, other federal agencies, and international funders. The Convergence Accelerators will be launched through NSF's Office of Integrative Activities. As noted, the funding for the Convergence Accelerators will be separate from, and in addition to, the funding for the Big Ideas . The HDR and FW -HTF Convergence Accelerators will complement HDR and FW-HTF investments by NSF directorates and offices in existing, as well as new NSF programs, that are aligned with the goals of the HDR and FW -HTF Big Ideas. These programs have laid the foundations for the HDR and FW -HTF Convergence Accelerators, and will continue to be managed by NSF's directorates and offices. By continuing, and expanding, these foundational investments, NSF will be able to enhance meaning ful progress in the corresponding areas . The results of these foundational investments will in turn feed the convergent and translational activities of the Convergence Accelerators, key to the success of the overall HDR and FW- HTF Big Ideas. Make information technology (IT) work for us. For NSF to continue funding cutting -edge science and engineering, leading -edge IT solutions that can adapt easily and quickly are essential. NSF will work to ensure that IT tools enhance employee productivity a nd satisfaction by enabling access, through easy -to- use interfaces, to readily available, reliable, and fully integrated data to support decision making. For example, NSF will continue efforts started under its Proposal Management Efficiency (PME) activity to automate proposal processing and improve mission- critical systems in ways that reduce workload, increase operational efficiency, and serve our clients more effectively. In FY 2019, NSF will invest an additional $4.0 million in adoption of automated, intelligent tools that enable evolution of NSF's business processes, including its core business process of merit review; and accelerated modernization of NSF's IT infrastructure via adoption of cloud offerings, consolidated computing platforms, software -defined network infrastructure, and automated change management processes to improve overall resilience of NSF's systems. Overview Overview - 6 Align NSF's workforce and work. As the Nation's research enterprise evolves and NSF's proposal volume grows, the agency's workforce s tands to benefit from enhanced capabilities that advance day -to- day business processes and enable the best service to the scientific community. In parallel with the IT - enabled business process improvements described above, NSF will optimize the alignment o f staffing and position descriptions with the changing landscape. NSF will maintain its already lean workforce through continuous improvements in personnel training and utilization, and through effective performance management. Expand public and private partnerships. Private industry, foundations, and non- profits, together with other federal agencies and international funding organizations, bring additional expertise, resources, and capacity to NSF -funded research, which can accelerate discovery and translation of research to products and services that benefit society and grow the American economy. NSF will improve efficiencies in developing, implementing, and managing partnerships that maximize the scientific, economic, and societal impacts of its investments. In particular, NSF will revise policies to enhance partnership development, including implementing new and innovative models with external organizations in science and engineering areas ripe for leverage. NSF will also explore additional partnerships with the private sector, philanthropies, and other federal agencies. Streamline, standardize, and simplify programs and processes. Many NSF business processes are managed and executed locally within the agency's directorates and offices, posing efficiency and collaboration challenges. NSF will revise policies and business processes to increase standardization across NSF organizations and eliminate unnecessary complexity. There are significant opportunities for improvement relating to the merit review proce ss, NSF's core business process, and expanded use of shared services for business operations. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 7 Other Priorities In FY 2019, NSF will make investments that support the basic research that advances human knowledge and make tomorrow's innovations possible. Additional investments will improve infrastructure in Antarctica, continue to protect the Nation's cyber assets, and improve artificial intelligence . In FY 2019, NSF expects that 91 percent of the annual budget will be used to fund research and education grants and research infrastructure in the science and education communities. Basic research forms the core of NSF's work and has led to discoveries and innovations that have been awarded Nobel Prizes, and changed humankind's conception of the universe and known world. In FY 2019, NSF expects to invest $ 4.92 billion dollars, or 66 percent of NSF's total budget , in basic research . Basic research is resp onsible for advancing our knowledge of the universe, as well as innovations like high speed internet, nanotechnology, and advances in robotics that require understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the physical world . NSF funds basic research in al l of the agency's directorates, and continues to fund research that transcends a single discipline. The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) construction project is funded at $103.70 million in FY 2019. Antarctica makes up nearly nine percent of the continental mass of Earth's surface. NSF manages all U.S. activities as a single, integrated program, making Antarctic research possible for scientists supported by NSF and other U.S. agencies. Funding this infrastructure improvement pr oject will protect U.S. interests on the continent. This will initiate modernization of major facilities at the aging McMurdo Station, so that anticipated science support needs are met for the next three to five decades. AIMS will enable faster, more streamlined logistical and science support by co- locating or consolidating warehousing, skilled trades work, and field science support where field projects are prepared for movement into the field, into four connected, enclosed buildings. AIMS will also provide necessary utilities to support these facilities. The total project cost is estimated to be $355 million, funded through the Research and Related Activities account. Cybersecurity research ($160.55 million) protects and preserves the growing societal and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring preservation of individual privacy as well as usability. NSF -funded research will lead to advances in the scientific foundations underlying cybersecurity, including better understanding of the root causes of current threats and novel countermeasures to protect against them . It will also accelerate the meaningful transition to practice of cybersecurity tools and infrastructure, which will impact commercial produ cts and policies in the long term , in alignment with the recent Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. NSF has long supported fundamental research on artificial intelligence (AI) , or the study of computers and software capable of intelligent behavior. Today, NSF -funded AI research spans many sub- areas and includes both theoretical research and its application leading to integration of new capabilities into demonstrable systems and d evices. A key goal is to understand how AI -based technolog ies will interface with humans. For example, NSF -funded work is advancing foundational techniques such as machine learning and neural networks, as well as domain areas including reasoning and repres entation, speech and language understanding, vision, computational neuroscience, robotics, and human augmentation. These advances, in turn , further education through intelligent tutoring systems, increase worker productivity with cognitive and physical aids, improve health with more accurate diagnosis and prediction, and enhance highway safety through assistive controls and forthcoming autonomous vehicles. Overview Overview - 8 FY 2019 NSF-Wide Investments NSF continues to bring together researchers from all fields of science and engineering to address today's cross -disciplinary questions and challenges through Foundation- wide activities. In FY 201 9, NSF will support four continuing cross -Foundation investments. Amount Percent Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS)$55.79 - $16.40 -$39.39 -70.6% NSF Innovation Corps (I- Corps ) 29.85 30.00 0.15 0.5% Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace - -20.4%FY 2019 Funding 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestChange Over FY 2017 Actual Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) ($16.40 million) aims to understand, design, and model the interconnected food, energy, and water system through an interdisciplinary research effort tha t incorporates all areas of science and engineering and addresses the natural, social, and human-built factors involved. INFEWS is the first program to study the interconnected food- energy -water nexus. This program is driven by pressing needs and challenges, such as growing U.S. and global populations, changes in land use, and increasing geographic and seasonal variability in precipitation patterns, all of which are placing an ever -increasing stress on these critical resources. NSF, through INFEWS, is uniquely poised to focus not only on the fundamental science and engineering questions at this nexus, but to train the next generation of researchers in this interdisciplinary area. As part of a planned decrease in activities, support for INFEWS -related research is being migrated to the Big Ideas and programs across NSF. NSF began identifying key investments explicitly as part of the INFEWS initiative in FY 2016 and will continue as planned through FY 2020. In FY 2019 ENG, GEO, IA and OISE will continue w ith dedicated investment, and for other directorates funding for the INFEWS emphases will continue as part of the research core investment. NSF Innovation Corps (I -Corps) ($30.0 m illion) improves NSF -funded researchers' access to resources that can assis t in bridging the gap between discoveries and technologies, helping to transfer knowledge to downstream technological applications and use at scale. In FY 2019, NSF will continue to support I -Corps Nodes and I -Corps Sites to further build, utilize, and sustain a national innovation ecosystem that helps researchers effectively identify viable market opportunities and augments the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit the Nation. NSF will also continue to support I -Corps Teams w ho are provided access to the experiential entrepreneurial education and mentoring to determine the readiness to commercialize technologies resulting from NSF -funded research. The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) ($129.0 million) investment aims t o build the knowledge base in cybersecurity that enables discovery, learning, and innovation, and leads to a more secure and trustworthy cyberspace. Through a focus on long -term, foundational research, SaTC will develop the scientific foundations for cyber security research for years to come. SaTC also focuses on the training of the next generation cybersecurity workforce, especially for government. This program aligns NSF's cybersecurity investments with the national cybersecurity strategy. While the agency 's investment in SaTC will decrease slightly ( -5.5 percent ), NSF will maintain its investments in cybersecurity research FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 9 across all related core and crosscutting programs. Understanding the Brain (UtB) ($127.20 million) encompasses ongoing cognitive science and neuroscience research and NSF's contributions to the ongoing Brain Research through Advancing Innovation and Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. The goal of UtB is to enable scientific understanding of the full complexity of the brain, in action and in context. There remains much to discover to attain a comprehensive understanding of the general principles underlying how cognition and behavior relate to the brain's structural organization and dynamic act ivities; how brain, behavior, and environment interact; and how the brain can recover from lost functionality. Investments that address critical research questions relevant to UtB are also central to the Big Ideas activities. NSF consolidated ongoing investments in cognitive science, neuroscience, and the BRAIN initiative in FY 2014 and the targeted UtB effort will continue as planned through FY 2020. BIO maintains it s commitment at the FY 2017 level, and all of the other directorates involved are cont inuing with reduced commitments in FY 2019 as the key areas are re- aligned into the research core as well as Big Ideas such as URoL, HDR, and FW- HTF . Overview Overview - 10 Education and STEM Workforce NSF's education and STEM workforce investment, centered in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), funds activities that support students, teachers, faculty , researchers, and the public. The EHR investment in core STEM education research is critical to building the Nation's knowledge base for strategic and imp actful STEM learning. NSF's investments for FY 2019 focus on the following priorities: The CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SF S) program ($55.0 million) supports cybersecurity education and research at higher education institutions. SFS also focuses on workforce development by increasing the number of qualified students entering the fields of information assurance and cybersecurity , which enhances the capacity of the U.S. higher education enterprise to continue to produce professionals in these fields to secure the Nation's cyberinfrastructure. FY 2019 activities will include engaging first - and second -year undergraduate students, with a focus on veterans. Computer Science for All (CSforAll) ($ 20.0 million) will build on ongoing efforts to enable rigorous and engaging computer science education in schools across the Nation , to prepare the STEM workforce of the future . Funds will support the development of prototype instructional materials, scalable and sustainable professional development models, approaches to preservice preparation for computer science teachers, teacher resources, and the research to study their impact . CSforAll ai ms to provide high school teachers with the preparation, professional development, and ongoing support that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses and to give preK -8 teachers the instructional materials and preparation they need to integrate computer science and computational thinking into their teaching. The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) ($102.50 million) initiative supports the development of the STEM and STEM -capable workforce by investing in the improvement of undergraduat e STEM education, with a focus on attracting and retaining students and on degree completion. The initiative funds the development and implementation and the related research and assessment of effectiveness. Through the Advanced Technological Education ( ATE) ($66.0 million) program, NSF is able to reach technicians in undergraduate programs preparing for the high -technology fields that drive our Nation's economy. The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) ($270.72 million) recognizes students with high potential in STEM research and innovation and provides support for them to pursue research across all science and engineering disciplines. GRF P fellows may participate in Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GR OW), which provides opportunities to conduct research with international partner countries and organizations, and Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP), which provides professional development through research internships at federal agencies. In FY 2 019, NSF will support 1,500 new fellows. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 11 Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction The FY 2019 Request includes funding to continue construction o f the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope , the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope , and the construction of two Regional Class Research Vessels. The total request to continue construction o f both projects, as well as to fully fund oversight costs, is $94.95 million. FY $182.80 $94.65MREFC Account Funding, by Project (Dollars in Millions) The construction of Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) ($16.13 million) will enable the study of magneto -hydrodynamic phenomena in the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. It will enable scientists to study these phenomena at unprecedented spatial, temporal, and wavelength resolutions . These phenomena are associated with what is generally known as space weather, which severely impact the Nation's infrastructure. FY 2019 will be the final year of funding in an 11-year funding profile. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) ($48.82 million) will be an 8 -meter -class wide- field optical telescope capable of carrying out surveys of the entire sky. It will collect nearly 40 terabytes of multi -color imaging data every night to produce the deepest, widest -field sky image ever. It will also issue alerts for moving and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. FY 2019 will be year six of its nine -year construction funding profile. The Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV) ($28.70 million) project will fund construction of two ships. This project is a major component in the plan for modernizing the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. The RCRV will provide scientific infrastructure that enable s increase d understanding of: the potential impacts of geohazards, such as storm surges and tsunamis; transportation and recreation ; natural resource identification and extraction; and fisheries and aquaculture, among many other topics. Overview Overview - 12 Organizational Excellence NSF seeks to integrate mission, vision, and core values to efficiently and effectively execute NSF's activities and provide the flexibility and agility required for all aspects of its operations. This goal incorporates a culture of continuous improvement t o ensure effective, inclusive, and accountable programs and merit review processes that provide the greatest value for taxpayer dollars. The portfolio of activities included in Organizational Excellence addresses the agency's operations and administrative functions, which underpin NSF's programmatic activities. Staffing In FY 2019, NSF will work towards full utilization of its allocations of 1,442 FTE for federal staff and 168 FTE for staff hired under the I ntergovernmental Personnel Act. The Foundation r ecognizes that maintaining staffing levels is vital to effectively and efficiently achieving its mission. FY 2019 Summary NSF's FY 2019 funding request for Organizational Excellence is $485 .88 million, a decrease of $ 42.43 million , or 8 .0 percent, below the FY 2017 Actual. The major reduction is in the Agency Operations and Award Management account as a result of the completion of the construction of, and relocation to, NSF's new headquarters building in Alexandria, Virginia and the lower cost of rent and utilities at the new building. Overall, Information Technology costs are relatively flat to FY 2017, and NSF will preserve secure, reliable information technology operations and continue to modernize the IT infrastructure and systems to th e greatest extent funding allows. Within the Organizational Excellence portfolio in FY 2019, NSF will initiate operational reforms in four areas as discussed in the Agency Reform section of the Overview. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 13 2018-2022 Strategic Plan and Performance Integ ral to this submission is the NSF Strategic Plan for FY 2018 -2022: Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation. The goals and strategies outlined in the plan build on lessons learned from NSF's past successes and continue to uphold NSF's mission \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense.\" The Plan is built around three Strategic Goals: Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning . The first part o f NSF's mission is \"to promote the progress of science.\" By expanding human knowledge, NSF -funded researchers provide the Nation with the capability to maintain scientific, technological, and economic leadership in a competitive world. A dvance the capabili ty of the Nation to meet current and future challenges . This goal flows from the latter part of the NSF mission statement: \"to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare ; t o secure the national defense ; and for other purposes.\" NSF uses a variety of approaches to promote impact -driven, use -inspired research. Innovation is a key capability for the Nation, and NSF's investments foster innovation across a broad range of topics relevant to technological and economic competitiveness. E nhance NSF's perf ormance of its mission . Effectively fulfilling NSF's mission requires blending strong scientific leadership with robust organizational leadership. Both are characterized by vision and flexibility. This goal structure enables NSF to link its investments to longer -term outcomes. To bridge the gap between these strategic goals and measurable outputs, the Strategic Plan establishes a set of O bjectives supporting each Strategic G oal. Agency Priority Goal: Expand Public and Private Partnerships NSF has set an Agency Priority Goal for completion by the end of FY 2019: \"Expand public and private partnerships to enhance the impact of NSF's investments and contribute to American economic competitiveness and security.\" By September 30, 2019, NSF's number of partnerships and/or award actions with other federal agencies, private industry, and foundations/philanthropies will grow by five percent, relative to the FY 2017 baseline, to make available infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources to the U.S. scientific and engineering research and education enterprise. Performance Plan NSF embraces the use of goals to drive performance improvements. For FY 2019, NSF has set performance goals to strategically monitor and oversee progress being made toward its larger aims, as well as progress towards agency reform. NSF also assesses progress through an annual process of strategic reviews of the objectives in its Strategic Plan. In FY 2019, in addition to goals monitoring the four aspects of reform described in the next section, NSF will monitor the following longstanding goals: Ensure that Key Program Investments Are on Track: Ensure that key FY 2019 NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track. Ensure that Infrastructure Investments Are on Track: Ensur e program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Overview Overview - 14 Make Timely Award Decisions: Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding in a timely manner. Foster a Culture of In clusion: Foster a culture of inclusion through management efforts resulting in leadership that is committed, knowledgeable, and accountable. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 15 Lower -Priority Program Activities NSF's FY 2019 Request follows a thorough examination of programs and investments across NSF to determine where the potential exists for more innovative investments. This Request includes four proposed terminations, totaling $302.03 million. Cyber -enabled Materials, Manufacturing, and Smart Systems (CEMMSS) (-$296.25 million) was established in FY 2013 to integrate several science and en gineering activities across NSF \u2014breakthrough materials, advanced manufacturing, and smart systems, including robotic, cyber -physical , and autonomous systems. CEMMSS- funded research advanced m aterials with unique properties and functionality through the integration of theory, experiments, simulations, and data analytics . Further, using advanced manufacturing strategies, new materials were fashioned into objects, structures, and systems integrat ed with computational intelligence, thereby transforming static systems, processes, and edifices into adaptive, pervasive smart systems. CEMMSS will sunset in FY 2019 as it has achieved its programmatic goals. NSF will continue to develop several comprehensive, integrated programs across CEMMSS focus areas, such as cyber -manufacturing, advanced materials, and smart systems, including robotics, cyber -physical, and autonomous systems. These investments will encourage new cross- disciplinary connections and act ivities, resulting in novel discoveries and innovations with transformative societal and economic impacts. BIO Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) (-$2.32 million) The BIO directorate 's DDIG program supported awards in selected areas of the biological sciences. These grants provide partial support of doctoral dissertation research for improvement beyond the already existing project. The grants cover costs for doctoral candidates to participate in scientific meetings, to conduct research in speci alized facilities or field settings, and to expand an existing body of dissertation research. Following a process of internal review and discussion regarding available resources, both the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal System s will no longer accept DDIG proposals. This decision was necessary because of increasing workload and changes in division priorities. This change is consistent with decisions made by other divisions in BIO, which have not participated in the DDIG competit ion for more than a decade. East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes for U.S. Graduate Students (EAPSI) (-$960,000) The EAPSI program, established in 1990, provided support to introduce U.S. students to research in science and engineering in the East Asia- Pacific region and fostered student -initiated professional relationships to facilitate future collaboration. EAPSI will be terminated in FY 2019 because it will have met its stated objectives. Furthermore, beginning in FY 2015, OISE shifted emphasis from small -scale to larger -scale catalytic activities. OISE will continue to focus on funding projects that are larger -scale with greater impacts, and will adapt the best practices from the EAPSI program in future funding opportunities. Information Technology S upport Related to NSF Headquarters Relocation (-$2.50 million) This program achieved its stated goal in support of the NSF headquarters relocation support and stabilization in first quarter of FY 2018. Therefore, no additional funding is needed. Overview Overview - 16 NSF by the Numbers NSF by t he Numbers: In FY 2019, NSF expects to evaluate approximately 50,600 proposals through a competitive merit review process and make approximately 11,100 new competitive awar ds, 8,400 of which will be new research grants and the remaind er will be contracts and cooperative agreements. The number of new research grants decreases by roughly seven percent from previous levels, in keeping with the overall change in total NSF funding. This process involves approximately 250,000 proposal reviews, engaging on the order of 34,000 members of the science and engineering community participating as panelists and proposal reviewers. In a given year, NSF awards reach over 1,800 colleges, universities, and other public and private institu tions in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In FY 2019, NSF support is expected to reach approximately 354,850 researchers, postdoctoral fellows, trainees, teachers, and students. The chart on the right shows the distribution of NSF's obligations by institution type and funding mechanism. While the data are based on FY 2017, it is expected that the relative sh ares in FY 2019 will be similar . As shown on the graph, 95 percent of NSF's FY 2017 projects were funded using grants or cooperat ive agreements. NSF grants are either standard or continuing awards. That is, the award is made during one fiscal year for the full amount of the award, or made over several years in increments. Cooperative agreements are used when the project requires sub stantial agency involvement during the project performance period (e.g., research cent ers, multi -user facilities. ). Contracts are used to acquire products, services, and studies (e.g., program evaluations) required primarily for NSF or other government use . Most NSF awards are to academic institutions. As shown in the chart, 7 8 percent of support for research and education programs ($5,558 million) was to colleges (including two -year and community colleges), universities, and academic consortia. Private industry, including small businesses, accounted for 13 percent ($951 million), and support to F ederally Funded Research and D evelopment Centers (FFRDCs) accounted for three percent ($222 million). Other recipients included federal, state, and local governments; nonprofit organizations; and international organizations. A small number of awards fund research in collaboration with other countrie s, which adds value to the U.S. scientific enterprise and maintains U.S. leadership in the global scientific enterprise. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 17 The chart on the left presents a high - level, agency -wide estimate of fundi ng rates, or proposal \"success,\" as a comparison of the n umber of competitive proposals, new awards, and funding rate between FY 2017, FY 2018, and FY 2019. This indicator is useful in gauging the relative impact of diff erent funding levels. In FY 2019, NSF expects to make approximately 11,100 new awards, which corresponds to a funding rate of about 22 percent . Overview Overview - 18 Organization and Role in the Federal Research Enterprise NSF's comprehensive and flexible support of meritorious projects enables the Foundation to identify and foster both fundamental and transformative discoveries and broader impacts within and among fields of inquiry. NSF has the latitude to support emerging fields, high -risk ideas, interdisciplinary collaborations, and research that pushes\u2014 and creates \u2014the very frontiers of knowledge. In these ways, NSF's discoveries inspire the American public \u2014and the world. NSF's organization represents the major science and engineering fields, including: biological sciences; computer and information science and engineering; engineering; geosciences ; mathematical and physical sciences; and social, behavioral, and economic sciences. NSF also carries out specific responsibilities for education and human resources, integrative activities, and international science and engineering. The 25- member National Science Board approves the overall policies of the Foundation. NSF's annual budget represents approximately 27 percent of the total federal budget for basic research conducted at U.S. colleges and universities, and this share increases to approximately 60 percent when medical research supported by the National Institutes of Health is excluded. In many science and engineering fields , NSF is the primary source of federal academic support. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 19 H ighlights F or over 60 years, NSF has invested in fundamental research and education to fulfill its mission of promoting the progress of science and engineering. In doing so, NSF -supported research has connected the discovery and advancement of knowledge with the potential societal, economic, and educational benefits that are critical for continued U.S. prosperity. Below are a few examples of the important advances that NSF funding enables. U ltrasensitive detector for physics and medicine NS F-funded research to discover fundamental particles and forces has led to a new tool with applications including brain research, diagnosis of abnormal heart rhythms, and pre -surgical imaging. Originally built to precisely measure very faint magnetic fields for basic physics experiments, the ultrasensitive detector, called an atomic spin magnetometer, has validated fundamental theories about the symmetry of space. Furthermore, the device's ability to sense magnetic fields 1,000 times weaker than those in the human brain made it a candidate for additional appl ications in medicine and neuroscience. Two startup companies, TwinLeaf Precision Sensors and QuSpin, are advancing the technology for commercial use. N ew research detects Alzheimer's disease markers in nonhuman primates NS F-funded researchers discovered proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease -believed to be unique to humans -in a sample of brains of aged chimpanzees. It has been suggested that humans are uniquely susceptible to Alzheimer's, potentially because of genetic differences from other primates, changes to the human brain during evolution, and longer lifespans. Understanding these differences can provid e key insights into identify ing the causes of Alzheimer's and working towards a cure. The identification in the aged chimpanzees of amyloid beta and tau lesions, hallmarks of Alzheimer's diagnosis, is a significant advancement in understanding the brain and Alzheimer's. Novel magnetic sensors can speed diagnosis of heart, brain, and fetal conditions. Credit: iStock.com/Pitju Amyloid beta plaques in the brain of a 58- year-old female chimpanzee.

Earlier this year, a quadriplegic man experienced the sense of touch again through a robotic arm connected to a brain- computer interface (BCI) implanted in his head that allowed him to \"feel\" pressure on the robotic hand. The blueprint for the BCI -robotic arm system came from NSF -funded basic research that examined the neural activity of monkeys as they manipulated objects. The advancement is paving the way for future touch- sensitive prosthetics. VLA reveals distant galaxy's magnetic field Wit h the help of a gigantic cosmic lens, astronomers have measured the magnetic field of a galaxy nearly five billion light- years away. The achievement is giving them important new clues about a problem at the frontiers of cosmology\u2014the nature and origin of the magnetic fields th at play an important role in how galaxies develop over time. The scientists used NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to study a star-forming galaxy that lies directly between a more -distant quasar and Earth. The galaxy's gravity serves as a giant l ens, splitting the quasar's image into two separate images as seen from Earth. The radio waves coming from this quasar, nearly 8 billion light- years away, are preferentially aligned, or polarized. This discovery provides an important clue about how galacti c magnetic fields are formed and evolve over time. A man manipulates a robotic arm via a computer chip in his brain.

Additional Processing: Robert Gendler FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 21 H ighlights D evelopment of online visualization tool adopted by Census Bureau T he U.S. Census Bureau's Census Explorer is an online, interactive mapping tool that enables members of the media and public to visualize census data at the state, county and neighborhood levels. The web- based platform is built on a data visualizatio n tool, called Social Explorer, developed by an NSF-funded researcher to help undergraduate sociology students studying demography better visualize U.S. census data. Census Explorer users can create maps on a range of data, including median household incom e and home ownership rate. Within the first few months of the tool's launch, more than 100,000 users had created four million data maps. E ight ways the National Science Foundation supports our troops S ince we were founded, securing the national defense has been a key part of the NSF mission. In recent years, we have lived up to that responsibility by funding research on building a stronger bulletproof vest, countering violent extremism, creating better GPS technology and improving prosthetics with brain- computer interface. Our support has also gone towards minimizing blood loss in battle wounds, helping military veterans with PTSD, detecting explosives and predicting conflict. NSF is proud of the role it plays in keeping American soldiers safe and military technology on the cutting -edge. Under graduate sociology students use Social Explorer to visualize census data.

Quantum memory stores information in a similar fashion to the way traditional compute r memory does, but on individual quantum particles \u2014in this case, photons of light. This method takes advantage of the peculiar features of quantum mechanics to store data more efficiently and securely. The use of individual photons to store and transmit da ta has long been a goal of engineers and physicists because of the potential to carry information reliably and securely. Because photons lack charge and mass, they can be transmitted across a fiber optic network with minimal interactions with other particl es. Saf er winter driving with snowflake imaging Fa lling snow makes winter driving a challenge. Transportation planners, road crews and emergency managers can now estimate real -time accumulations with active imaging from multi- angle snowflake cameras (MASC). NSF-funded research led to the development of MASC, which images snowflakes down to the diameter of a human hair and simultaneously m easures how fast they fall. These data have been critical for verifying snowfall predictions and winter precipitation algorithms for weather radars. A high -speed, three-camera system reveals formation of an ice pellet.

These indicators are useful in gauging the relative impact of different funding levels. Statistics for Competitive Awards : Competitive awards encompass the universe of NSF new activity in a given year. Examples include research grants, cooperative agreements, equipment, fellowships, and conferences. Statistics for Research Grant Awards: Research Grant Awards are a sub -set of competitive awards. They are limited to research projects and exclude other categories of awards such as those for cooperative agreements, equipment, fellowships, and conferences. The Number of Proposals is based on several factors, including past actual activity, planned competitions, and research trends within the various disciplinary communities. External factors, such as the state of the national economy and other sources of funding, also play a part. The Number of Awards is also based on several factors, including estimated funding and expected proposal pool. The Funding Rate is the number of awards made during a year as a percentage of total proposals competitively reviewed. This indicates the probability of receiving an award when submitting proposals to NSF. Annualized Award Size shows the annual level of research grant awards provided to awardees by dividing the total dollars of each award by the number of years over which it extends. Average Duration is the length of awards in years.

2019 Request change over FY 2017 Actual Broadening participation infuses science and engineering excellence into varied individual, institutional, and geographic networks and provides for the discovery and nurturing of talent wherever it may be found. Additionally, NSF defines broadening participation in terms of individuals from underrepresented groups (i.e., women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with di sabilities) as well as institutions (i.e., women's colleges, minority -serving institutions, and institutions primarily serving persons with disabilities) and geographic areas (i.e., rural, urban and EPSCoR jurisdictions) that do not participate in NSF rese arch programs at rates comparable to others. 1 NSF has taken a variety of approaches to broaden participation across its many programs. While broadening participation is included in the NSF review criteria, some program announcements and solicitations go beyond the standard criteria to include program -relevant suggestions and/or specific requirements for promoting diversity and inclusion. Investments range from capacity building, research centers, partnerships, and alliances to the use of co- funding or supplements to existing awards in the core research programs. NSF's broadening participation portfolio can be divided into three categories: (1) Focused, (2) Emphases, and (3) Geographic Diversity. The following sections define each of these categories and pr ovide a list of the programs and activities with their respective funding levels that comprise each. 1Broadening Participation at the National Science Foundation: A Framework for Action , www.nsf.gov/od/broadeningparticipation FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Summary Tables - 15 Focused Programs Focused Programs have broadening participation as an explicit goal of the program and are included at 100 percent of their funding.

Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV) funding is no longer included on this line as MREFC construction began in FY 2017. 2The funding change for AST Portfolio Review is due to the timing of contracts engaged to meet legal requirements of portfolio review activities (e.g., National Historic Preservation Act, National Environmental Policy Act). 3The FY 2017 budget of $340,000 reflects only the incremental support necessary to enable the potential transition of managing institutions associated with the competition for a new operation and management award of the OOI. FY 2017 operations and maintenance were funded in a prior year. 4Other Facilities includes ongoing MPS support for the Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering (CHRNS). 5 Construction, Acquisition, and Commissioning are for implementation support provided through the MREFC account. MREFC funding is included for NEON and RCRV FY in FY and LSST are included. 6Construction, Acquisition, and Commissioning are for implementation support provided through the R&RA account. R&RA funding is included for AIMS in FY 2019. 7Development and Design includes funding for potential next generation multi-user facilities. This line reflects funding for RCRV in FY 2017 ($2.11 million) and Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) in FY 2017 and FY 2019 ($2.97 million and $370,000, respectively). Also included is funding for a potential High-Lumosity Large Hadron Collider (LHL-HC) Upgrade million and $6.30 million, respectively). 8Initial Operations and Maintenance During Construction are Research and Related Activities (R&RA) funds for these purposes while MREFC construction is ongoing. Funding is included for FY 2017 and FY 2019 for NEON ($50.26 million and $52.0 million, respectively) and DKIST ($13.50 million and $18.50 million, respectively), and for LSST in FY 2019 ($500,000). 9Funding for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) includes operations and maintenance support for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 10Other AST Facilities: This section captures funding for the Green Bank Observatory and the Long Baseline Observatory (formerly VLBA). Support beyond FY 2018 is currently undecided, so funding for FY 2019 is notional. 11National Solar Observatory (NSO) totals presented do not include $11.50 million in FY 2017 and $16.50 in FY 2019 for operations and maintenance support for the DKIST facility construction project.

With this solicitation, the National Science Foundation (NSF) focuses on researcher -practitioner partnerships (RPPs) that foster the research and development needed to bring CS/CT to all schools. Specifically, this solicitation aims to provide high school teachers with the preparation, professional development and ongoing support that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses, and K -8 teachers with the instructional materials and preparation they need to integrate CS/CT into their teac hing.\" Metrics The program's first deadline for proposals was February 28, 2017. NSF convened merit review panels in April 2017, and the program made its first cohort of 34 two- to four -year awards by the end of FY 2017. Short- , mid -, and longer- term met rics for success were developed and reported upon, as follows: Short- term metrics will focus on ensuring that the program is making awards in the four areas outlined in the law and that the awards address the goal of broadening participation in computer sc ience. One indicator of broadening participation is the diversity of the populations targeted in the awards. Mid-term metrics will include the extent to which funded projects are achieving goals as measured by the progress reported in NSF's required annua l and final project reports. Longer- term (beyond five years) metrics will include an evaluation of the outcomes of the program, which are based on the program aims as described in the program solicitation and the well -aligned requirements of Public Law 114- 329. Program staff are working with the Evaluation and Monitoring Group in the NSF Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Evaluation and Assessment Capability within the NSF Office of Integrative Activities to develop (1) a set of specific longer- term metrics and (2) a program evaluation plan for measuring the collective success of the CSforAll: RPP projects on these longer -term metrics. Report on the Success of the Program as Measured by the Short -Term Metrics Below is a summary of the CSf orAll: RPP projects that were funded in FY 2017 pursuant to NSF 17-525: 15 awards address subsection and (b)(2) B; and 13 awards address subsection (b)(2) C. In addition, the program also supported four awards for conferences (workshops), and two awards for backbone organizations. Finally, all awards except those supporting backbone organizations identified at least one underrepresented or underserved group, as outlined in the table below, to address subsection (b)(2) D. (Note: some awards serve more than one underrepresented group and thus the numbers of awards in the table below total to more than 34.)

Specifically, the report itemizes (1) a description of the program strategy and objectives; (2) a description of the awards made in the previous fiscal year including (A) the total amount made available, by state, under EPSCoR; (B) the total amount of agency funding made available to all institutions and entities within each EPSCo R state; (C) the efforts and accomplishments to more fully integrate the EPSCoR states in major agency activities and initiatives; (D) the percentage of EPSCoR reviewers from EPSCoR states; (E) the number of programs or large collaborator awards involving a partners hip of organizations and institutions from EPSCoR and non- EPSCoR states; and (3) an analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiveness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 years. Introduction EPSCoR utilizes three investment strategies in pursuit of its goal to strengthen research capacity and competitiveness in eligible jurisdictions. These investment strategies are: (1) Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards that support physical, human, and cyberinfrastructure development; (2) Co- Funding in partnership with NSF directorates and offices that support individual investigators and groups within EPSCoR jurisdictions; and (3) Outreach activities and workshops that bring EPSCoR jurisdiction investigators together with program staff from across the Foundation to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering aligned with NSF strategic priorities and with jurisdictional science and technology goals. EPSCo R Strategies a nd Objectives (Sec. 103(d)(1)). EPSCoR's strategies and objectives in FY 2017 remained the same as those described in the FY 2016 report. Specifically, the mission of EPSCoR is \"to advance excellence in science and engineering research and education in order to achieve sustainable increases in research, education, and training capacity and competitiveness that will enable EPSCoR jurisdictions to have increased engagement in areas supported by the NSF.\" Thus, EPSCoR's goals are: To catalyze th e development of research capabilities and the creation of new knowledge that expands jurisdictions' contributions to scientific discovery, innovation, learning, and knowledge -based prosperity. To establish sustainable Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education, training, and professional development pathways that advance jurisdiction -identified research areas, NSF focus areas, and workforce development. To broaden direct participation of diverse individuals, institutions, and organizations in the project's science and engineering research and education initiatives. To effect sustainable engagement of project participants and partners, the jurisdiction, the national research community, and the general public through data -sharing, communication, outreach, and NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 8 dissemination. To impact research, education, and economic development beyond the project at academic, government, and private sector levels. NSF Funding Made Available, by jurisdiction , . In invested a total of $ 162.80 million in support of its programmatic activities. Of this, $135.75 million (83.4 percent) was directed to RII, $24.92 million (15. 3 percent) to co -funding, and $2.13 million (1.3 percent) to outreach activities and works hops.

The table below details NSF investments in EPSCoR jurisdictions including research support funding, education and human resources, and major research equipment. EPSCoR Jurisdiction NSF Funding AK $46.33 AL 51.16 AR Available to All EPSCoR Jurisdictions (Dollars in Millions) Integration of EPSCoR Jurisdictions in Major Activities and Initiatives of the Foundation (Sec. 103 (d)(2)(C)). All EPSCoR programmatic activities target integration and assimilation of EPSCoR jurisdictions into the research and education programs of the Foundation's disciplinary directorates. RII awards promote the coordination and integration of recipient jurisdictions into major NSF programmatic activities. Additionally, EPSCoR consults and engages NSF disciplinary program officers (PO s) in merit review processes and post -award evaluations, such as site visits and reverse site visits (RSVs). Site visits and RSVs are intended to provide additional project oversight by allowing jurisdictions to report on the progress of their RII projects in relation to th eir stated goals and the programmatic terms and conditions. Disciplinary NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 10 POs assist in the identification of reviewers, serve as site visit and RSV observers, and provide knowledge about the ongoing activities within the directorate that could be leveraged to sustain RII efforts after the performance period of the EPSCoR award. National, regional, and jurisdictional meetings of the EPSCoR community facilitate interactions with NSF leadership to learn about the Foundation's strategic priorities and funding opportunities. Participation by EPSCoR researchers and educators in the merit review process across all disciplinary domains of the Foundation, in Committees of Visitors (COV) activities, in external advisory (Federal Advisory Committee Act) committees, and in disciplinary workshops that shape new activities is also vital to this integration. Outreach to EPSCoR jurisdictions by NSF staff promotes integration of the EPSCoR community into mainstream NSF programs, as does co -funding of awards with the disciplinary programs of the Foundation. There is also an effort to promote in -reach, whereby EPSCoR facilitates opportunities for researchers and educators from EPSCoR jurisdictions to meet with NSF staff at the Foundation's headquarters. In these meetings, th e EPSCoR participants are provided with information on NSF strategic priorities and funding opportunities. In FY 2017, EPSCoR staff facilitated approximately 24 in- reach meetings. In FY 2017, EPSCoR staff promote d engagement of the EPSCoR community in NSF and other national activities. Examples are: Maintained efforts to better communicate the EPSCoR success story by continuing its communication workshop, Becoming an EPSCoR Champion, which targets RII Track -1 researchers and encourages them to specifically emphasize successful outcomes of their EPSCoR research. This workshop series helps researchers cultivate communication skills through disciplined, systematic messaging to convey an influential, economically- framed message that effectively signals the value of EPSCoR's activities. It seeks to enhance abilities to deliver the jurisdiction's scientific messages effectively, charismatically, and successfully. Encouraged EPSCoR -supported faculty to participate in NSF co mmittee and review panels across NSF (e.g., COVs, site visits, and merit review panels). Continued the RII Track -2: Focused EPSCoR Collaborations builds interjurisdictional collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in scientific focus areas consistent with NSF priorities. In addition, these awards have a particular focus on the development of early career/junior faculty. In FY 2017, proposals were invited on the topic of understanding the relationship between genome and phenome, aligned with the NSF Big Idea of Understanding the Rules of Life, and eight awards were made. Launched a new solicitation track, RII Track -4 EPSCoR Research Fellows, which provides opportunities for early career researchers to further develop their individual research potential through extended collaborative visits to the N ation's premier private, governmental, or academic research centers. Proposals in all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF were invited and 30 awards were made. EPSCoR Reviewers (Sec. 103(d)(2)(D)). Demographics of all reviewers who evaluated EPSCoR proposals or the program in FY 2017 are as follows: of the 150 reviewers, 21 percent were underrepresented minorities, 41 percent were female, 15 percent were from EPSCoR jurisdictions, 28 percent were new reviewers for NSF, and three percent were new reviewers from EPSCoR jurisdictions. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Authorizations - 11 EPSCoR Collaborations and Pa rtnerships (Sec. 103(d)(2)(E)). All RII awards involv e collaborations among scientists and engineers in EPSCoR jurisdictions. Additionally, RII awards require institutional collaborations, which are defined as collaborations between researchers at a RII awardee or sub -awardee and those at institutions not re ceiving any RII funds. In FY 2017, there were 780 collaborations within EPSCoR jurisdictions; 597 institutional collaborations and non- EPSCoR jurisdictions; and 118 collaborations between institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions and in foreign countries. These collaborative efforts highlight the vast network of institutional involvement among EPSCoR jurisdictions and their partners in RII projects. Among the 136 awards co -funded by EPSCoR in FY 2017, 66 involved collaborative research between multiple institutions. Of those 66 collaborative awards, 33 were collaborations between investigators from institutions in EPSCoR and non- EPSCoR jurisdictions. An analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiveness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 fiscal years (Sec. 103(d)(3)). Eligibility to participate in NSF EPSCoR programmatic activities is based upon the jurisdictions ' demonstrated ability to obtain NSF research funds. Currently, a jurisdiction is eligible to participate in EPSCoR programs if its level of NSF research support is equal to or less than 0.75 percent of the total NSF research and related activities budget averaged over the most recent three-year period. Given EPSCoR's aim to stimulate research that is fully competitive in NSF's disciplinary and multidisciplinary research programs, increases in the ability to capture NSF research funds serve as a proxy for ga ins in research competitiveness. As in FY 2016, Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee, and Utah exceeded the 0.75 percent threshold and these jurisdictions continued to be ineligible to compete in new RII competitions in FY 2017. Additionally, Iowa, Tennessee, and Uta h exceeded the threshold for three or more consecutive years and were no longer EPSCoR- eligible for co -funding or outreach in FY 2017. Figure 1 (below) shows the average amount of NSF research funds by cohort for the initial five years (hatched bars) and the most recent five years (solid bars) of their participation in the NSF EPSCoR Program. A cohort is defined as the group of states or jurisdictions that entered the EPSCoR program within a given fiscal year. For example, the 1980 cohort consists of the i nitial five states that qualified for EPSCoR: Arkansas, Maine, Montana, South Carolina, and West Virginia. For this summary, the 2000+ cohort consists of jurisdictions that entered EPSCoR in FY 2000 or later and are still EPSCoR -eligible: Alaska, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Former EPSCoR jurisdictions Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee, and Utah are excluded because they were no longer EPSCoR -eligible in FY 2017. Each cohort shows an increase in competitiveness over the periods of participation. For example, the 1980 cohort shows a 98 percent increase in NSF research funding over the past 37 years of EPSCoR activity. The 1985 cohort (Alabama, Kentucky, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Vermont, and Wyoming) demonstrates a 66 percent increase during its 32 years of participation in EPSCoR. The 1987 cohort (Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota) shows a 92 percent increase over the past 30 years, while the 1992 cohort (Kansas and Nebraska) has an 84 percent increase in competitiveness over its 25 years of EPSCoR involvement. Jurisdictions participating in EPSCoR since FY 2000 entered into the program at a higher level of NSF research funding than the previous cohorts. For the 2000+ cohort, there has been a small, yet demonstrable 17 percent increase in research funding. The data for each jurisdiction NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 12 is provided in the table immediately after the figure. Figure 1.

This information elucidates the gains in academic research quality over time, as defined by publications, leveraged grants, and patents. For publications, primary support is defined as research that is directly funded by EPSCoR and partial support is defined as use of equipment or facilities funded by EPSCoR. The number and valuation of grants awarded encompass all federal, private industry, and private foundation awards across the U.S. in a given fiscal year for all EPSCoR jurisdictions.

Additionally, NSF EPSCoR is working with NSF's Office of Integrative Activities, Evaluation and Assessment Capabil ity section to develop a cohesive evaluation framework for the program. This evaluation will address the legislative objective of increasing the research competitiveness of jurisdictions receiving EPSCoR funding. The evaluation is informed by the findings and recommendations from the EPSCoR retrospective evaluation completed by the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) in 2012. Part of this effort involves an evaluation contract that will (1) develop a flexible framework to explore, define, and mea sure research competitiveness in relation to the unique jurisdictional contexts and (2) use evidence of jurisdictional progress toward research competitiveness over time for strategic program improvement.

This basic research enables discoveries that ultimately achieve significant downstream impact through collaboration with ot her scientific disciplines and applicat ion of science to improve quality of life. The span of investigation is reflected in a variety of specific interests, including Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL) , the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON ), and Understanding the Brain (UtB) . A commitment to integrate research and education, broaden participation, and promote international partnerships is integral to all activities across the d irectorate. In FY 2019, research that aligns with the comprehensive BIO framework, URoL , will continue. Gaining an understanding of the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype in plants, animals, and microbes across scales of size, time, and place is a grand challenge not easily achieved. Support for early investigators to ensure adequate numbers of researchers prepared to tackle these difficult and complex questions is critical to success and requires a long -term investment. U.S. academic research in the biological sciences depends on NSF funding; BIO considers this role essential to the promotion of vibrant and innovative fundamental biological research at U.S. universities and colleges. Broad support for biology is necessary to produce knowledge relevant to national needs in food, health, energy, and environment. Additionally, support for biological research will continue a stream of economic innovations that contribute to American livelihoods, as demonstrated by progress in areas such as biofuels, biorenewable chemicals, and nanotechnology. BIO increasingly supports projects that address comprehensive questions involving multiple types of data acquisition and levels of analysis. These projects are becoming larger and more collaborative both within the biological sciences and with other fundamental disci plines. Because of its broad mission, NSF is one of the few agencies where support for such integration across disciplines is possible. FY 2019 priorities for BIO include: URoL: First introduced in FY 2017, support for URoL will continue in FY 2019, emphasizing research areas such as the genotype to phenotype challenge, plant - and animal -organismal interactions, and developing biological theory as a framework for the rules of life. Quantitative approaches that integrate the mathematical and physical sciences, computer science, and engineering to advance basic biological understanding will continue to be encouraged. Directorate for Biological Sciences BIO - 2 NEON: With the construction of NEON scheduled to complete in fall 2018, BIO will assume responsibility for full operations and maintenance (O&M) and oversight funding, in FY 2019. NEON O&M funding is included in the budget for the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI ). Support for NEON -science is a priority investment across BIO and designed to achieve the promise of this major new facility and its exciting capabilities. For more information on NEON, see the MREFC chapter. U tB, including the BRAIN Initiative: This cross -agency priority will continue in FY 2019.

Program Evaluations In FY 2012, the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) conducted a program evaluation feasibility study for SaTC. This feas ibility study provided methods for examining baseline portfolio investments and identifying metrics to measure progress toward program goals. It was part of a broader effort to develop a plan for a future impact assessment. STPI identified baseline evaluation metrics in FY 2013 - FY 2015, and completed the evaluation feasibility study in FY 2016. CISE, together with the NSF Evaluation and Assessment Capability (EAC), funded a program evaluation of SaTC in FY 2016; that program evaluation is currently underway. Evaluation is a key part of CISE's education programs. All K -12 computer science education projects managed by CISE include rigorous research and evaluation plans designed to guide project progress and measure project impacts. CISE also tasked ST PI to conduct an evaluation feasibility study for STEM+C Partnerships , and the Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) to develop a program evaluation instrument for legacy K-12 computer science education projects. The first program evaluation of these pr ojects is currently underway. Reports In 2008, CISE funded the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) within the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine t o study the IT innovation ecosystem and to assess the long -term economic impacts of CISE investments. The result ing report, Assessing the Impacts of Changes in the Information Technology R&D Ecosystem,2 published in 2009, includes an in-depth articulation of the creation of almost 20 IT industries since 1965 valued at a minimum of a billion dollars each. To update this study, CISE funded CSTB to identify recent IT industries that have reached the billion- dollar mark; develop a brief report that highlights the updated figures; and summarize results- to-date of IT research, including the nature and successes of U.S. research partnerships among government, industry, and universities, and the economic payoffs of these research 2www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12174 Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 6 investments. The National Academies published the resulting report, Continuing Innovation in Info rmation Technology , in 2012.3 A more recent CSTB study, Continuing Innovation in Information Technology: A Workshop (described below), employed this report's framework. In FY 2012, a CSTB study , The Future of Computing Performance: Game Over or Next Level?,4 t ogether with a white paper from the CISE -funded Computing Community Consortium (CCC), 21st Century Computer Architecture,5 outlined the need for advances in computer architecture research , leading to the development of the Exploiting Parallelism and Scalability (XPS) program in FY 2013. In FY 2019, CISE will continue to invest in advanced computer architecture research through the Scalable Parallelism in the Extreme (SPX) program, leveraging past investments in XPS, as part of NSCI. In FY 2013, the CCC collected community white papers articulating the potential needs and payoff for additional investments in mid -scale infrastructure for computing research ;6 this led to the development of the NSFFutureCloud program , which began in FY 2014 and entered a second phase in FY 2017 . In FY 2019, CISE will continue to invest in NSFFutureCloud. Since FY 2014, the CCC has led several additional community visioning efforts that have the potential to influ ence CISE programs in FY 2019: Computing Visions 2025 :7 inspired the computing community to envision future trends and opportunities in computing research. Two workshops were held under this initiative: Interacting with Computers All Around Us , and The New Making Renaissance: Programmable Matter and Things. Toward a Science of Autonomy for Physical Systems :8 offered a series of white papers framing th e c hallenges and opportunities associated with a future of autonomous physical systems across a range of domains including health care, transportation, and disaster response. These white papers have the potential to influence CISE investments in CPS and NRI-2.0. A New Age of Computing and the Brain: brought together computer and information scientists an d e ngine ers and brain scientists to explore opportunities and connections at the intersection of computer and information science and brain science.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 13 APPENDIX A - HIGH -PERFORMANCE COMPUTING PORTFOLIO Petascale Computing $0.36 - $32.48 Innovative HPC Program 29.91 - 30.00 Extreme - $64.88FY 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestHigh Performance Computing Funding (Dollars in Millions) For nearly four decades, NSF has been a recognized leader in enabling the innovative use and broad availability of a cohesive and powerful High -Performance Computing (HPC) ecosystem to accelerate fundamental science and engineering. NSF aims to sustain Ame rica's leadership in the research, development, and broad deployment of existing as well as new HPC technologies and skills\u2014and aims to do so in part through leadership of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) jointly with the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE), and in concert with other participating federal agencies and the private sector. Key NSF foci include fundamental discoveries to support future generations of advanced computing; research and cyberinfrastructure promoting cohesive platforms and interoperability for large -scale data analytics as well as modeling and simulation; and support for a comprehensive advanced computing ecosystem for science and engineering research. These foci include an emphasis on a holistic approach to America's science and engineering computational infrastructure, spanning both human and technical dimensions. The overall NSF HPC strategy and program portfolio receives guidance and input from the Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastruct ure (ACCI); Assistant Directors (AD) Council, which includes ADs and Office Heads from the various NSF research directorates and offices; and cross -directorate working group for NSCI. In 2013, OAC supported a two- year National Academies' study to further i nform the implementation of its HPC strategy in the 2017 to 2020 timeframe; the final report, Future Directions for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S. Science and Engineering in 2017-2020, was published in 2016. 17 In 2017, OAC funded a st udy of best practices for collaborations between academic or federally-funded HPC centers and industry. Leadership -Class Computing Description A key and integrated component of NSF's current HPC ecosystem investment is its support of a leadership - class HPC resource called Blue Waters. As one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world and one of the fastest supercomputers deployed on a unive rsity campus, Blue Waters is based at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The Blue Waters system became operational in December 2012, and the archival storage availability cam e online in March 2013. It is operated by NCSA and includes the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computing (GLCPC) as a partner. Since becoming operational in FY 2013, Blue Waters has allowed researchers to tackle much larger and more complex research challenges than ever before possible across and within disciplines as diverse as biology, astronomy, engineering, materials science, and the geosciences. Examples of transformational 17www.nap.edu/catalog/21886/future -directions -for-nsf-advanced -computing -infrastructure-to -support and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 14 research enabled by Blue Waters include: biophysicist Klaus Schulten and his team at UIUC used experimental data combined with simulations on Blue Waters to discover the precise chemical structure of the hard- shell capsid encasing the HIV virus (with funding from NIH) ;18 a public -private collaboration among multiple federal agencies, universities, and companies brought together data, expertise, and the unique capabilities of Blue Waters to create the first -ever publicly- available, high -resolution elevation maps of the Arctic ; 19 and ExxonMobil geoscientists and NCSA demonstrated a massive parallel reservoir simulation that ran thousands of times faster than typical oil and gas industry reservoir simulations, in turn allowing faster, more cost-effective, and environmentally-responsible decisions. 20 The br oader impacts of Blue Waters include provisioning unique infrastructure for research and education; extensive efforts accelerating education and training in the use of HPC in science and engineering; training in petascale computing techniques; promoting an exchange of information bet ween academia and industry about the applications of petascale computing; and broadening participation in computational science and engineering, in part through NCSA's Girls Engaged in Mathematics and Science (GEMS) program, which is designed to encourage middle- school girls to consider mathematics - and science- oriented careers. Current Status Following system testing and acceptance in December 2012, and acceptance of the NCSA archival system in March 2013, the Blue Waters project entered a five -year operations phase. The acquisition and deployment award provided support for the first six months of operations. A separate award to UIUC in FY 2013 provided support for the remaining operational phase, from FY 2014 through mid- FY 2018. This award was granted a no -cost extension in FY 2016 that runs through mid-FY 2019. Educat ion and outreach projects are ongoing; they target pre -college, undergraduate, graduate, and post - graduate students. The Blue Waters project also sponsors workshops, conferences, summer schools, and seminars. The project includes industry partnership activities as well. The Indus try Partners in Petascale Engagement (IPIPE) program provides industry partners across a wide range of market sectors (e.g., health, energy, advanced manufacturing) with expertise as well as a first look at the technological and scientific developments tha t flow from the petascale program. Despit e the success of the Blue Waters supercomputer, the system is reaching its natural obsolescence, and will complete its operational cycle in March 2019, when the no -cost extension for the operations and maintenance award ends. With the extension of the operational end date of Blue Waters to 2019, the system will have run for roughly two years longer than the typical lifetime for a system of this type. In ant icipation of the operational end date of Blue Waters, in FY 2017, NSF issued a competitive solicitation21 for the first phase (Phase 1) of a two- phase plan to deploy a new leadership- class HPC system. The Phase 1 system is expected to be two to three times more powerful in application performance than Blue Waters. In FY 2018, NSF expects to award approximately $60 million for the system acquisition. The operations and maintenance phase of the leadership HPC system is expected to commence in FY 2019 and last for five years under a separate award. When fully deployed, the Phase 1 system is expected to broadly extend new large- scale HPC benefits across the academic landscape, including support for previously unattainable research advances in large- scale modeling and simulation; use of robust data analytics at unprecede nted scales for research; and use of HPC in dynamic workflows combining large -scale computation with big data streaming. In addition to the operations and maintenance award, a related 18https://news.illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/204804 19http://nga.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=cf2fba21df7540fb981f8836f2a97e25 20www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/exxonmobil_sets_record_on_ncsas_blue_waters_supercomputer 21www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17558/nsf17558.htm FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 15 FY 2019 award to the Phase 1 awardee is anticipated to fund a Conceptual Design in anticipation of a future Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction for Phase 2 of the leadership- class HPC system. The continuing investments in the HPC program are guided by input from many stakeholder groups. These include the ACCI ; AD Council; NSF program staff spanning the Foundation's directorates and offices; the cross -directorate NSCI working group; and the National Academies' study section mentioned above. Additionally, international activities to accelerate investments in leadership -class computing, particularly in Europe and Asia, are providing additional urgency and importance for this investment strategy to maintain the Nation's global leadership role in science and engineering. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by Blue Waters Blue Waters is enabling investigators across the country to conduct innovative research not otherwise possible due to demanding technical requirements . Over its lifetime, the Blue Waters project has enabled more than 700 project teams, with the largest allocation awards made through the highly competitive NSF Petascale Computing Resource Allocations (PRAC) program. The research topics the PRAC program supports include: complex biological behavior in fluctuating environments; electronic properties of strongly correlated systems; properties of hydrogen and hydrogen- helium mixtures in astrophysically- relevant conditions; electronic and magnetic structures of transition metal compounds; molecular dynamics responsible for the properties of liquid water; and propagation of seismic energy through a detailed structural model of Southern California together with prediction of ground motion and modeling of the response of buildings and other structures. Other allocations address testing hypotheses about the role of cloud processes and ocean mesoscale eddy mixing; formation of the first galaxies; turbulent stellar hydrodynamics; binary black hole and neutron star systems as sources of gamma ray bursts; and other intense radia tion phenomena, contagion, and particle physics. To date, there have been more than 200 education, outreach, and training projects engaging over 3,700 individuals at over 160 institutions, including 41 institutions in Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdictions and 14 Minority -Serving Institutions. Management and Oversight The Blue Waters project is overseen by OAC's program directors and NSF Division of Grants and Agreement (DGA) staff who receive strategic advice fro m the AD Council. Advice from the NSF Office of General Counsel (OGC) is also sought as necessary. The National Science Board (NSB) receives updates on any major change in risk assessment, which is reviewed annually by an external panel. Risks identified during the operational phase of the project include system security, power costs, and performance/reliability/usability due to large system scale. The plan for a phased approach to support a next -generation, leadership -class HPC system was discussed with the NSB in advance of the issuance of the FY 2017 solicitation. Innovative HPC Program Description The Innovative HPC program funds nationally- available HPC capabilities that, in aggregate, are technically diverse, reflecting changing and growing use of data -intensive computation in both the research and education processes. At the same time, they are intended to enable discoveries at a computational scale beyond the reach of an individual or regional academic institution. There is a direct relationship between the Innovative HPC program and the eXtreme Digital (XD) program, as described below. Deployed systems serve as a cohesive set of allocable resources within the XD Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 16 integrated services infrastructure. Innovative HPC awards are generally made as two p arts: an acquisition /development and deployment award that may be the result of a competitive or a renewal proposal; and a separate award for operations and maintenance following deployment. When an award is made, the awardee institution issues sub -awards to vendors and/or other organizations for acquisitions and services as necessary. Expenditures are contingent on successful completion of deployment milestones. Beginning with the FY 2011 Innovative HPC program solicitation, High Performance System Acquisition: Enhancing the Petascale Computing Environment for Science and Engineering, 22 a more sustained approach for the largest HPC services was initiated in response to community input. This approach recognizes the value and sustained institutional commitment required for building and reta ining staff skilled in interdisciplinary computational and data science by allowing, at the discretion of NSF, a longer time horizon of eight to 10 years for a single institutional awardee. This timeline begins with a competitively awarded acquisition but allows for the possibility of a renewal acquisition award four years after the original award. In addition to the acquisition awards, there are accompanying operations and maintenance awards following deployment. Current Status Four additional resources, Comet, Bridges, Jetstream, and Wrangler, commenced operations in FY 2015 and FY 2016. In FY 2017, Stampede 2, the largest of the currently active Innovative HPC resources, commenced operation. Deployed in FY 2015, Wrangler is the most powerful data analys is system allocated in XD, with 10 petabytes (PB) of replicated, secure, high -performance data storage. This innovative system consists of 3,000 embedded processing cores for data analysis; 120 Intel Haswell- based servers for data access and embedded analy tics; and a large- scale flash storage tier for analytics, with bandwidth of one terabyte per second (TB/s) and 275 million Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS). Wrangler provides flexible support for a wide range of software stacks, including Hadoop and relational data. Support for ongoing Wrangler operations and maintenance is provided to the University of Texas at Austin through FY 2020 at a level of approximately 20 percent of the initial acquisition cost per annum, consistent with the level specifi ed in the FY 2013 Innovative HPC program solicitation. 23 Comet also came online in FY 2015 at the University of California, San Diego. It supports research interests and priorities requiring large, high -throughput workloads, which in turn prompt massive amounts of computation but at moderate scalability. Notably, as a resource responsive to the \"long tail of science,\" Comet is particularly well -suited for the large -scale computational needs of research community portals such as Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research as well as distributed workflows such as those required by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory. Comet's heterogeneous configuration supports not only complex simulations but also advanced analytics and visualization of outputs. As a result of its role in machine learning, visualization, and advanced analytics, supplemental funding was provided to increase the graphics processing units component of Comet in FY 2017. Comet is also planned to remain operational through FY 2020. Bridges came online in FY 2016 at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University. Bridges provides an innovative and groundbreaking HPC and data analytics system integrating advanced memory technologies to empower new communities. It brings desktop convenience to HPC, connecting to campuses, and intuitively integrating data- intensive workflows to increase the scientific output of a large community of scientific and engineering researchers that has not traditionally used HPC resources. Bridges extends HPC's impact to EPSCoR jurisdictions and Minority -Serving 22www.nsf.gov/pubs/2011/nsf11511/nsf11511.htm 23www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13528/nsf13528.htm FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 17 Institutions, raising the level of computational awareness at four -year colleges, and promoting computational thinking in high-schools. Jetstream also came online in FY 2016 at Indiana University. Jetstream is a cloud- based platform that incorporates the best elements of commercial cloud computing resources with some of the best software for solving important scientific problems. Jetstream enables new modes of shari ng data and computational analysis, allowing for increased scientific reproducibility and enabling American scientists and engineers to make new discoveries that are important to understanding the world around us, thereby improving the quality of life for all Americans and promoting America's competitive standing in the world. The Stampede project at the University of Texas at Austin delivered a new system for allocation of NSF XD cyberinfrastructure services in January 2013 and continued to operate throug h December 2017. The resources and accompanying services targeted science and engineering researchers using both advanced computational methods and emerging data -intensive approaches. The system boosted XD resources to nearly twice their previous capacity and provided researchers with early access to Intel Many Integrated Core processors, which were accepted in August 2013. It operated as the \"backbone\" for the XD environment, enabling more than 5,000 researchers and annually supporting more than 1,000 comp utationally intensive research projects across the Nation. In FY 2016, NSF awarded Stampede2: The Next Generation of Petascale Computing for Science and Engineering to the University of Texas at Austin following a rigorous merit review, enabling the acqui sition, development, and deployment of \"Stampede2\" as a successor resource to Stampede. When fully operational, Stampede2 will serve as the primary national resource (i.e., the \"workhorse\") for thousands of American academic researchers, complement other national HPC resources, and provide capabilities beyond the reach of individual campuses and regional resources, including support for multiscale modeling, simulation, and data -intensive research. Stampede2 is being deployed into production operation throug h three phases: Knights Landing many -core nodes are already deployed, demonstrating increased performance at lower power rates; the highly complementary SkyLake processors, which are responsive to data-intensive computing, are in early operations and will fully deploy as a peak 18-petaflop system in FY 2018; and the final deployment phase, also in FY 2018, will introduce persistent memory to the previously -deployed Skylake processors to significantly enhance overall system performance. Stampede2 will serve the high -end, open science community through FY 2021. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by Innovative HPC Innovative HPC is enabling new, world- leading, and transformative advances across the breadth of science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engineering by underrepresented groups. It is enabling new collaborations across public and private sectors to advance American security and economic competitiveness. These advances are enabled by providing researchers and educators with usable access to world -leading computational resources, expertise, and services beyond those typically available on most campuses, including the interfaces, consulting support, and training necessary to facilitate their use. This program is central to America achieving the full potential of complementary investments by NSF, other federal agencies, and academic institutions. Management and Oversight OAC's program direc tors provide direct oversight during both the acquisition as well as operations and maintenance awards. Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors. Each Innovative HPC program award is managed under a cooperative agreement. Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones prior to NSF authorization of spending. Progress Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 18 is assessed with the aid of annual external reviews. Each project has a project management plan. Each cooperative agreement includes the management structure, milestones, spending authorization levels, and review schedule. Any activity of this nature, and at this scale, comes with a certain element of risk. The review process, conducted prior to award, ana lyzes the risks as presented in the proposal and identifies any additional risks that should be considered. The award process requires that risks be identified and analyzed, and that a mitigation plan be created and followed. One of the activities of the periodic NSF external reviews, conducted by an external panel of experts, is to revisit and assess the risk situation and make recommendations as deemed necessary. Typically, project risks are substantially reduced subsequent to deployment. Thus, pacing of acquisitions and deployments allows balance in overall portfolio risk for the Innovative HPC program. Milestone- driven reviews occur during the acquisition award, typically with an external review prior to deployment. Annual reviews, conducted by an exter nal panel of expert reviewers and managed by OAC program directors, are performed during the operational phase of each project. Extreme Digital (XD) Program Description The XD program adds value to the Innovative HPC program by coordinating the HPC resources and services, providing advanced assistance to the user community, and broadening participation. The XD program's shared services model for coherently and efficiently delivering to researchers both access and expertise to diverse, dynamic, and distri buted resources is a cornerstone of America's HPC ecosystem. Enabling the connection between individual campuses and national resources is an essential aspect of the HPC ecosystem. XD enables and supports leading -edge scientific discovery and promotes science and technology education. The program encourages innovation in the design and implementation of an effective, efficient, increasingly virtualized approach to the provision of high- end digital services, while ensuring that the infrastructure continues to deliver high -quality access for the many researchers and educators who use it in their work. XD shared services consist of several interrelated parts: allocation of resources to computational and data research projects; advanced user assistance; training, education, and outreach; architecture and operation of an integrated digital services infrastructure; metrics services; and overall coordination. The XD Metrics Service (XMS) is a separate award, while all other services constitute the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project. These elements are designed and implemented in a way that is clearly tied to the requirements of the science and engineering research community, using a flexible methodology that permits the architecture to evolve in response to changing community needs and that presents individual users with a common environment regardless of where the resources or researchers are located. Current Status Two awards are currently active within the XD program: XSEDE and XMS. The smaller XMS award was made in FY 2015 to the University at Buffalo - The State University of New York. This award provides metrics services allowing measurement of key operational data for both resources and services. The XSEDE award to UIUC was renewed in September 2016, continuing the prior XSEDE award for another five- year period. There are 18 XSEDE partners engaged via subawards to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (Nationa l Institute for Computational Sciences), Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center), University of Texas at Austin (Texas Advanced Computing Center), University of California, San Diego (San Diego Supercomput ing Center), University of Chicago, Indiana FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 19 University, Purdue University, Shodor Education Foundation, Ohio Supercomputer Center, Southeastern Universities Research Association, Cornell University, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Georgia Institute of Technology, Oklahoma State University, University of Georgia, Oklahoma University, University of Southern California, and University of Arkansas. XSEDE has annual external reviews at NSF. The first external review of the renewed project took p lace in June 2017. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by XD XD services enable transformative advances in science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engineering to underrepresented groups. These advances are accomplished by providing researchers and educators with coherent and highly usable access to extreme- scale digital resources beyond those typically available on most campuses, together wi th the interfaces, consulting, advanced user support, and training necessary to facilitate their use. XD provides HPC services; and enables researchers to efficiently manipulate, analyze, visualize, and share extremely large amounts of distributed digital information from simulations, sensors, and experiments. XD's XSEDE project delivers tools and services that not only link users to national facilities, but also enable scientific collaborations of geographically distributed teams. In doing so, it facilit ates dynamic access to digital resources and experimental testbeds within and across university campuses, as well as government laboratories. The XSEDE project includes outreach and training critical to reducing the barriers to the use of advanced digital systems by the research and education communities, thereby promoting enhanced productivity. XD's XMS project develops analysis tools and collects operational data from XD projects such as XSEDE and the Innovative HPC resources. The immediate users of the se methods and tools are the providers of NSF-supported HPC resources and services. However, both tools and data are publicly available and used by other projects such as Blue Waters and individual universities. Management and Oversight OAC's program directors oversee the XD projects. XSEDE has an external advisory board, a user board, and a service provider forum to ensure that all stakeholders can provide project input. OAC oversight of the XSEDE project includes participation in weekly teleconferenc es with senior XSEDE personnel and in quarterly project -wide staff meetings. Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors. Each XD award is managed under a cooperative agreement. Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones prior to processing of grant increments. Each project has a detailed management plan in place. Each cooperative agreement includes the management structure, milestones, spending levels over time, and review schedule. While XD is operational in nature, the virtual organizations of the XSEDE project and the services of all XD projects are innovative and thus bear inherent risks. The projects maintain risk registers that are reviewed periodically by external panels and by the cognizant program directors. Annual reviews for XSEDE and mid -project reviews for XMS are conducted by external panels of expert reviewers and managed by OAC program directors.

In FY 2015, NSF funded the National Academ ies of Science, Engineering , and Medicine (the National Academies) to study The Future of Center -Based, Multidisciplinary Engineering Research. This topic arose from discussions the National Academies held on the future of NSF's center - based, multidisciplinary engineering research. To help inform the study, the National Academies held a public symposium on April 6, 2016, and published a proceedings.1 The study report ,2 delivered May 2, 2017, articulates a vision for the future of NSF -supported center -scale, multidisciplinary engineering research, which ENG is carefully analyzing for the path ahead. A new solicitation for the next generation of ERCs is expected in FY 2018. A study of the feasi bility of performing rigorous impact evaluation of the I -Corps Teams program was completed in FY 2014. Based on the feasibility study, NSF initiated a rigo rous evaluation of the I-Corps Teams program in FY 2016. A report will be available in FY 2018. During FY 2017, ENG developed an evaluation framework that identifies outcomes to be monitored across directorate programs. The framework, developed by participants from all ENG divisions, has four areas of activity: (1) research, (2) human capital development and partnerships, (3) centers and networks, and (4) construction of physical, virtual, and cyber infrastructure. The directorate expects to use this framework to develop an outcome monitoring system for all programs using internal Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR) data, external data sets (patents and bibliometric data), and potentially a common survey. The design of this evaluation framework eliminates the need for individual longitudinal outcome monitoring systems (e.g., for the Emerging Front iers in Research and Innovation program ). In FY 2016, IIP collected data for the PFI: Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) and PFI: Building Innovation Capacity (BIC) programs based on their theories of action . In FY 2017, ENG finalized a report for the longitudinal outcomes of the PFI: AIR program to date. A report for the PFI: BIC program is being finalized. The PFI program was restructured , and the FY 2018 PFI solicitation reflects the changes. Workshops and Reports In FY 2017, to further open pathways into engineering, EEC provided support for \"A Workshop to Finalize the Planning for a National Pilot of an advanced placement course in Engineering,\" held at the University of Maryland College Park , October 12-13, 2017. The three workshop goals were to r eview and revise the draft curriculum framework for the AP in Engineering course; define the role organizations play in the pilot ; and d evelop t raining objectives for the pilot teachers. In FY 2018, EEC will continue work ing with partner universities and high schools to refine and gain approval for the AP curriculum and professional development program for teachers, in preparation for pilot activities. In FY 2017, ENG (CBET and EFMA) and BIO co- funded a workshop on \"T he S ubterranean Macroscope: Sensor networks for understanding, modeling, and managing soil processes ,\" held November 1 -2, 2017, at the University of Chicago. The workshop goal was to create a vision and framework for how such a subterranean sensor network could be built across different geographical scales, with sensors that will generate dense, useful data that will inform soil science, plant science, and modeling efforts. These efforts, in turn, would lead to the next level of understanding of the physical, chemical , and biological nature of soil and its impact on plant science and food security. Th e workshop 1A Vision for the Future of Center -Based Multidisciplinary Engineering -vision -for-center -based - engineering -research FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress ENG - 5 included diverse scientists and engineers and representatives from industry and the small business community. The workshop is expected to generate cross -directorate research opportunities advancing measurement system capabilities for soil biological, chemical, and physical components over space and time and to contribute to several of NSF 's 10 Big Ideas. In FY 2017, CMMI supported a workshop on \" Disrupting Illicit Supply Networks: New Applications of Operations Research and Data Analytics to End Modern Slavery ,\" held in Washington, D .C., on December 1 -2, 2017. The workshop brought together operations researchers, computer scientists, social scientists, business researchers, geographers, social service agency representatives, and federal agencies to increase understanding of both the nature, and t he challenges to disruption, of illicit supply chains. This is informing creation of a potential research initiative within the CMMI Operations Engineering program. In FY 2016, CBET, EFMA and others co-funded a three -year study on Grand Challenges in Envir onmental Engineering by the National Academies .3 The study will identify high- priority challenges for environmental engineering and science for the next several decades. The three planned public workshops associated with the study were held May 4 -5, 2017; September 5, 2017; and January 11, 2018. The report, expected in FY 2018, will shape the growth of university departments, inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists to address the most pressing global environmental challenges, and improve the training of environmental engineers and scientists to better meet these challenges. It will also help inform NSF program directors of emerging areas for research. In FY 2016, CBET funded a workshop on Challenges and Solutions for Integrated Management of Environmental, Health, and Community Impact Data Pertaining to the Oil and Gas Industry that was held in Arlington, Va., during March 7 -8, 2016. Such a framework must integrate heterogeneous, structured and unstructured data into an inter -operable and explorable system, one that can be re- purposed by researchers and other stakeholders in order to transfer knowledge between industry, land- use managers, government officials, and t he general public. The workshop and its 2017 report4 have provided insights to NSF in numerous research domains and for efforts in data and cyberinfrastructure as well as the NSF Big Idea on Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st Century Science and Engineering. In FY 2015, EFMA funded the Exploring Innovation Frontiers Initiative (EIFI), a two -year, national public- private effort to shape and strengthen future U.S. innovation and competitiveness led by the Council on Competitiveness. Diverse leaders from academia, industry, and government have participated in a series of regional d ialogues during 2015-2016: at the Georgia Institute of Technology on June 9, 2015; the University of California Riverside on November 23, 2015, and at Texas A&M University on November 15, 2016. A fourth and final regional dialogue was held in June 2017 at Washington University in St. Louis. Summaries of the EIFI workshops and the final report5, published in 2017, will help inform NSF and the community of actionable, interdisciplinary frameworks for next - generation business and research innovation models. Committees of Visitors (COV s) In 2017, no C OV meetings were held. In 2018, COVs will review ECCS and EFMA . In 2019, COVs will review CBET and CMMI.

In FY 2019, the division will make strategic investments in multidisciplinary res earch areas , international activities, education, diversity, and human resource development. The results of these investments will assist in ensuring that the U.S. has a well -educated and diverse workforce in the geosciences and in related technical fields such as resource exploration. Research at the Food -Energy-Water nexus will result in understanding interactions across the FEW nexus, how it is likely to affect our world, and how we can proactively plan for its consequences. In FY 2019, GEO , in partners hip with all of the NSF research directorates and offices, will advance the NNA Big Idea by investing ICER funds to support convergent activities that transcend the traditional disciplinary boundaries of individual NSF directorates and offices. These activ ities will enable pursuit of fundamental research in the Arctic . While budget manag ement and reporting for this investment wi ll be the responsibility of GEO , the convergent activities will be overseen and managed collaboratively by the multi- directorate/of fice NNA leadership team. In general, 48 percent of the ICER portfolio is availa ble for new research grants and 52 percent is available for continuing grants.

MPS - 1 DIRECTORATE FOR MATH EMATICAL AND $1,345,320,000 PHYSICAL SCIENCES (MPS) -$17,110,000 / -1.3% Amount Percent Astronomical Sciences (AST) $252.05 2019 RequestChange over FY 2017 Actual About MPS MPS serves the Nation by supporting fundamental discoveries at the forefront of science. These discoveries form a tapestry of knowledge and innovation that transforms the future. Research in the disciplines supported by MPS has led to advances that are used for a wide variety of applications; examples i nclude laser technology, navigation using the Global Positioning System, materials fundamental to integrated circuits, and algorithms used for advanced cybersecurity. The FY 2019 Budget Request for MPS supports a collection of vigorous disciplinary and mul tidisciplinary research programs that foster discovery and cultivate the technical workforce. Awards funded by MPS provide the foundations of basic research in astronomical sciences, chemistry, materials research, mathematical sciences, and physics that ex plore the frontiers of science. The programs in MPS span the range from individual investigator awards to large, multi -user facilities. The science spans an enormous range as well: from the smallest objects and shortest times ever studied to distances and times that are the size and age of the universe. Individual investigators and small teams receive most awards, but centers, institutes, and multi- user facilities are all integral to MPS -funded research. MPS continues to participate in NSF -wide investments and multi -directorate activities, particularly ones that connect to the fundamental research at the heart of its mission. These multi -directorate activities include growing MPS foundational research for several of the Big Ideas that are discussed elsewher e in this document. Programs in the MPS divisions respond to special intellectual opportunities and reflect careful choices to provide the greatest return on the research investment. Identifying these opportunities involves the community, through the MPS Advisory Committee and through groups chartered to identify prospects, for revolutionary science in particular areas. Input from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) is critical for prioritization; two rec ent examples are New Worlds, New Horizons: A Midterm Assessment (delivered in August 2016) and Frontiers of Materials Research: A Decadal Survey (scheduled for completion in FY 2018). Facilities that enable unique science that would be impossible without the special resources of a shared, multi- user environment are integral to our mission. Some of these facilities are observatories for photons, neutrinos, or gravitational waves. Others provide unique resources such as the largest controlled magnetic fields in the world or beams of rare isotopes. Stewardship of the MPS facilities portfolio and the balance among the different awards programs are critical issues that also engender extensive community Directorate for Ma thematical and Physical Sciences MPS - 2 consultation. MPS continues assessing the future of differen t facilities and fostering collaborations for those facilities. In partnership with other research directorates and offices, MPS will participate in building the foundation for the Big Ideas described previously. In particular, FY 2019 investments will ad vance the work of several of the Research Big Ideas, including Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi -Messenger Astrophysics (WoU) ; The Quantum Leap: Leading the Next Quantum Revolution (QL); Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st-Century Science and E ngineering (HDR); Understanding the Rules of Life: Predicting Phenotype (URoL); and T he Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier (FW- HTF). In FY 2019, MPS will invest OMA funds to advance QL and WoU Big Ideas. These convergent activities will enab le pursuit of fundamental research in quantum enabled sciences and technologies and multi - messenger astrophysics. By exploiting quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and squeezing, the QL activities will develop the foundations for and enable quantum computing, quantum sensors, quantum communications, quantum simulators, and other inherently quantum technologies, enhancing the social sciences and informing discussions on the social impacts of quantum innovation. The WoU activities will brin g together fundamental research in electromagnetic waves, high -energy particles and gravitational waves ; advance the study of the universe ; and grow the N ation's multi- messenger astrophysics, engineering and data science workforce. While budget management and reporting for these investments will be the responsibility of MPS, the convergent activities will be overseen and managed collaboratively by the multi -directorate/office QL and WoU leadership teams. MPS provides about 49 percent of the federal funding for basic research at academic institutions in the mathematical and physical sciences.

The Windows activities will bring together fundamental research in electromagnetic waves, high -energy particles and gravitational waves, advance the study of the universe and grow the nation's multi -messenger astrophysics, engineering and data science workforce. While budget management and reporting for these investments will be the responsibility of MPS, the convergent activities will be overseen and managed collaboratively by the multi -directorate/office QL and WoU leadership teams. OMA will also support division investments in HDR, URoL, and FW- HTF. OMA's practice is to commit funds using only the current fiscal year budget and to limit commitments to outyear support. For this reason, nearly 48 percent of the OMA portfolio is available to support new research grants. Approximately 39 percent of the OMA portfolio is used to support multidisciplinary research grants within MPS, with the remaining 61 percent being used to support research an d education activities of interest to MPS but led by non- MPS directorates.

In the Arctic, NSF helps coordinate research planning as directed by the Arctic Research Policy Act of 1984, and the NSF Director chairs the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) created for this purpose. In the Antarctic, per Presidential Memorandum 6646, NSF manages all U.S. activities as a single, integrated program, making Antarctic research possible for scientists supported by NSF and by other U.S. agencies. The latter include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad ministration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Smithsonian Institution, and the Department of Energy. The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) research activity supported by NSF also supports leadership by the U.S. Department of State in the governan ce of the continent and Southern Ocean under the aegis of the Antarctic Treaty System. OPP supports investments in research and education and provides support for research infrastructure, such as permanent stations and temporary field camps in the Antarct ic and the Arctic. OPP's FY 2019 Budget Request is influenced by three key priorities: (1) supporting critical facilities that enable frontier research in the Earth's polar regions; (2) maintaining strong disciplinary programs that provide a base for our investments in cross- disciplinary system science programs and; (3) maintaining U.S. research community activities in polar system science. As part of priority one, OPP will start the construction phase of the multi - year Antarctic Infrastructure Modernizatio n for Science (AIMS) project. OPP will also prioritize investment in two of the Big Ideas: Navigating the New Arctic where OPP leads NSF efforts, and Windows on the Universe where OPP invests in underpinning activities. All of t hese priorities reflect oppo rtunities for Office of Polar Programs OPP - 2 fundamental scientific discovery uniquely possible in polar regions, as well as studies to investigate the cause s and future trajectory of environmental and ecosystem changes now being observed at the poles that could impact global systems. T his work will implement the Foundation's lead -agency role in facilitating the Nation's investment in polar science. In addition to shared cross -directorate basic research objectives, OPP investments will be guided by recent sponsored studies to identify priority areas and ensure effective polar research programs: For the Arctic, IARPC 's Arctic Research Plan: FY 2017- 20211, and the World Meteorological Organization's Year of Polar Prediction Implementation Plan2 inform science investment priorities. Efforts to build an integrated research capacity to address the potential opportunities and challenges of Arctic change for the Nation's security and economics and well -being of Arctic residents will continue. For the Antarctic, the 2015 N ational Research Council report A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research3 inform science investment priorities. Specifically, in 2018, OPP initiate d support of a five -year deep -field program to study the Thwaites Glacier r egion that wa s the highest priority in that study.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress OPP - 5 ANTARCTIC INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION F OR SCIENCE (AIMS) $103,700,000 FY Requirements for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science Project (Dollars in Millions) The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernizatio n for Science (AIMS) construction project is initiated in FY 2019 with an investment of $103.70 million. This amount is the first year in a multi -year funding profile with an estimated total project cost of $3 54.95 million. In accordance with NSF's No Cost Overrun policy, NSF is currently planning within the estimated Total Project Cost ( TPC) following the Preliminary Design Review. NSF will finalize the total project cost and the associated scope, schedule, and funding profile at time of award; benefiting from both the Final Design Review and the Independent Cost Estimate. FY 2019 funds will be used to complete the designs of all construction components, begin the site preparation work for the backbone utilities and the initial buildings , such as the Vehi cle and Equipment Operations Center, and procure the first phases of construction materials. The construction of the remaining buildings that comprise AIMS (descriptions provided below), will be supported by funding in s ubsequent fiscal years. The AIMS Project is currently anticipated to take approximately 8 to 10 years to complete; a further refined schedule will be developed as part of the final design phase. The total cost of the AIMS construction project will be funded within the R&RA account. The AIMS project will replace major facilities at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, one of three stations that comprise the U.S. presence in Antarctica, to meet anticipated science support requirements for the next thirty -five to fifty years. The project will help ensure enduring U.S. leadership and influence in this strategic region . It will also support critical scientific research and capabilities such as nuclear test detection , earthquake monitoring, and real -time weather data ingestion for global forecasting. McMurdo Station's main purpose is to support both near - and deep- field science in Antarctica including activities at Amundsen -Scott South Pole Station. AIMS will enable faster, more streamlined logistical and science support by co -locating or consolidating warehousing, skilled trades work, and field science support where field projects are prepared for movement into the field, into four connected enclosed buildings. AIMS will also provide necessary up-graded utilities to support these facilities. The AIMS scope described below was determined to be the most efficient and cost -effective combination of work packages in support of science operations at McMurdo. Baseline History In 2011, the Office of Science Technology and Policy and NSF convened a Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) to evaluate the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) logistical enterprise. The BRP was asked to conduct a review to discern any discrepancies with future science support needs, to identify opportunities for increased efficiencies, and to propose corr ective actions that address the scientific opportunities articulated by an earlier 2011 National Research Council report entitled Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The BRP report made numerous recommendations regarding maintaining and enhancing the U.S.'s world -class science program in Antarctica. The report offered 84 implementing actions that target three areas: (1) efficient and cost -effective support of science, (2) maintaining high standards of safety, and Office of Polar Programs OPP - 6 (3) flexibility of support infrastructure and logistics to facilitate evolving science areas in the future. NSF responded to the BRP report by immediately addressing issues of safety, implementing operational efficiencies which resulted in immediate return on investment, and developing long-term plans for each of the three year -round U.S. stations; Palmer, Amundsen- Scott South Pole and McMurdo. The AIMS project is a pivotal component of the McMurdo Station Master Plan with a specific focus on the primary core functions of this critical logistics hub. The scope of AIMS includes: 1) Core Facility, including: a. Central Services Facility: mission command and control, food service, warehousing, and materials handling, b. Continuity of Operations and Emergency Facilities: fire station, medical clinic, emergency berthing, and recreation, c. Field Science Support Facility, d. Station Operating Support facility: industrial trades shops and supplies/materials, and 2) Utilities: domestic and firefighting water, power, waste water, heating distribution, IT, and communications, 3) Vehicle and equipment operations center (VEOC), and 4) A permanent lodging facility that will also be utilized to accommodate the increased workforce required for AIMS construction.

Management and Oversight AIMS will be accomplished under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) via an existing contract to Leidos Innovation Corporation as the current Antarctic Support Contractor. OPP will provide technical oversight an d the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) will provide contract oversight. Although funded through the R&RA account, not the MREFC account, AIMS is considered a major facility under the definitions contained in the 2017 American Innovati on and Competitiveness Act (AICA). Therefore, all of NSF's current oversight requirements will apply, including project management assistance and oversight from the Large Facilities Office (LFO), with due consideration of award through a FAR - based contract . Under an interagency agreement, the Defense Contract Management Agency negotiates, manages, and audits Leidos' forward pricing rate agreements and associated business systems in place for monitoring and ensuring effective performance. Routine oversight activities include, but are not limited to: Integrated master scheduling and project management oversight; Monthly program management reviews; Earned value management on discrete projects; Configuration and change review boards for cost and scope control management; Contractor performance management; and Internal controls for finance and property management, including A-123 compliance. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific provided expert engineering advice during the design phase of the projec t. NSF intends to continue to use the services of a third -party expert for engineering advice during the construction phase of AIMS. Leidos will initiate the acquisition process by performing market research leading to a request for qualifications for construction. All steps of the acquisition process will be subject to review by NSF and appropriation of funds. Prior to an award for construction, the AIMS project will complete a Final Design Review, which is anticipated to be held in fall 2018. Office of Polar Programs OPP - 8 The AIMS project will entail a combination of design/bid/build (DBB) and design/build (DB) subcontracts. General contractors asked to submit proposals will be pre -qualified, and a single general contractor is expected to complete all four projects under a firm fixed price or an alternative contract type that the government deems appropriate for the particular activity. NSF will take an active role in overseeing all efforts to ensure the government's interests are achieved. Reviews Conceptual Design Review (CDR): CDR was conducted March 31- April 2, 2015. The NSF program staff concurred with the external panel's conclusion that the project execution plan and technical design package met, and in some cases exceeded, the requirements of the Conceptual Design Phase. Prelim inary Design Review (PDR): PDR was conducted December 5 -8, 2016. The external panel found that the project execution plan and the technical design package were both well -developed for the PDR phase and recommended that the project was ready to proceed to t he Final Design Phase. Following NSF deliberations, the National Science Board passed a resolution (NSB -2017- 20) authorizing NSF to include AIMS in a future budget request. Final Design Review (FDR): FDR is anticipated in the fall of 2018 to ensure that anticipated project costs remain realistic and that no unforeseen events have arisen prior to awarding the sub -contract in mid FY 2019. The NSF will ensure an independent cost estimate is conducted during FY 2018. Following Board authorization, the project transitioned from the PDR milestone into the final design phase. Project Status Leidos has begun pre -acquisition tasks required for the FDR milestone review, including market research and an industry day presentation in August 2017. Designs for all components of AIMS have been completed to an appropriate level for the purpose of preparing the request for qualifications . Cost and Schedule FY 2019 funds will be used to complete the designs of all construction components, begin the site preparation work for the backbone utilities and the initial buildings such as the Vehicle and Equipment Operations Center, and procure the first phases of construction materials. Construction of the core facility will be supported by funding in the s ubsequent fiscal years. The phasing plan allows for managed impact on science support during construction, as well as continuity of operations in the event that subsequent funding is disrupted. Each successive phase must be fully funded to start and finish that phase so that if subsequent project funding is disrupted, the station will remain fully capable for USAP operations . The AIMS Project is currently anticipated to take approximately 8 to 10 years to complete; a further refined schedule will be developed as part of the final design phase. Risks Construction phasing milestones are timed such that confidence in relevant aspects of project readiness is assessed at appropriate intervals. Scope management options have been identified to ensure that the project proceeds only if it ca n be shown that continued investment is warranted, or that the project phase can be executed successfully. Before each phase begins, sufficient funding must be secured to ensure that that phase can be successfully completed. Should the required funding not be secured, the NSF may elect to postpone the phase or cancel the program altogether. This off -ramp assessment is critical to ensure that the station is able to meet ongoing and future science support requirements. Existing structures cannot be demolished unless the funding to construct the functional replacement is secured. Leidos developed a bottom -up cost estimate for AIMS by integrating the construction cost estimate from their cost estimating consultant and coupled it with Leidos' estimate of logistics and support costs. The consultant estimators were retained for the construction cost estimate because of their extensive experience FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress OPP - 9 estimating commercial construction globally. Leidos has the most extensive understanding of ancillary costs to support construction in Antarctica. The cost estimating and risk analysis methodology and documentation were verified for compliance with the Government Accountability Office Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide by an independent cost assessment conducted by a priva te contractor under contract through LFO. The cost estimate includes a provision for inflation of 2.5 percent per year through 2026. The risk register used to develop the contingency budget is associated with known project risks: primarily events and factors that affect labor and material costs as well as construction support considerations such as the station capacity for the required number of personnel and findings related to site conditions. It also accounts for logistical risks such as accommodating critical supplies that miss the annual cargo vessel that then must be delivered through costlier means. In addition, the contingency budget also accounts for schedule risk associated with weather or other events that can create materials, equipment, and labor shortages due to delivery delays. For ex ample, if manufacturers miss the deadline for the annual supply ship, premium air freight costs will be incurred to get supplies to McMurdo on time. Weather poses the greatest known risk to the schedule. A primary risk mitigation tool is the design/build contract mechanism itself where the contracted firm is able to make tradeoffs within the awarded budget that do not adversely affect the final outcome. Finally, a time-phased, science -prioritized scope management plan has also been developed to identify scope that may be removed to stay within the total project cost without affecting the overall project's objectives, as well as accommodating opportunities that may arise if risk s are not fully realized. Future Operations Costs Implementing AIMS will provid e a material reduction of the cost to maintain and operate McMurdo station including an estimated $3.50 million in fuel and $2.40 million in labor per year (based on current costs). Fuel savings of about 340,000 gallons per year will be possible due to gre ater energy efficiency of the consolidated station made possible with AIMS. Labor savings will accrue mainly through the efficiency of consolidated warehousing (with 90 percent reduction of exterior storage), co- locating work areas, and lowering residence time of science projects, also made possible by AIMS.

This re quest highlights NSF's continuing emphasis on building capacity across the research and education enterprise . About IA The activities supported by IA expand NSF's capacity for discovery and innovation through the formation of new ideas and concepts , experimentation, and assessment. IA has five main goals: To strengthen the alignment of NSF's activities with its mission; To enhance NSF's ability to solicit, review, award, and manage a portfolio of frontier projects ; To develop high -performance analytics and tools that reveal new insights into NSF's award portfolio and inform policies and practi ces; To advance research infrastructure that will enable discovery across U .S. academic institutions ; and To promote an inclusive national STEM enterprise that supports the development of STEM talent. Integrative Activities IA - 2 FY 2019 Activities Convergence Accelerators NSF is initiating a new organizational structure approach called Convergence Accelerators to align its processes and operations with contemporary science and engineering research and education. The first two Convergence Accelerators will accelerate research advances for the Future of Work at the Human - Technology Frontier (FW- HTF) and Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st -Century Science and Engineering (HDR) Big Ideas by facilitating convergent and translational activities in FW- HTF and HDR , especially through creati on and leveraging of external partnerships. These Convergence Accelerators will complement HDR and FW- HTF research investments by engaging NSF directorates and offices in existing and new NSF programs that are aligned with the goals of the HDR and FW -HTF Big Ideas. Convergence Acce lerator: The Future of Work at the Human- Technology Frontier (FW -HTF): To promote global leadership in work productivity and quality, the FW -HTF Convergence Accelerator aims to speed up the progress of discovery and innovation at the nexus of humans, technology, and work. It is critical that emerging technologies, like artificial intelligence and robotics, augment human performance and benefit society. It is important to address the new skills that will be needed to work with new technologies in new industries and sectors in order to enable workers to migrate from old to new jobs. Partnerships with other federal agencies, industry, foundations, and international organizations will support translational aspects of convergence research, prototyping in workplace testbeds, and living laboratories, as well as promote needs -based, technology- mediated job training and retraining. Convergence Accelerator: Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21 st-Century Science and Engineering (HDR) : Access to the next level of discovery relies on translating complex data from observations, experiments, and simulations into knowledge and eventual action. Individuals, scientific and social communities, industry, and the Nation will benefit from new data- rich capabilities, infrastructure, and services. The HDR Convergence Accelerator will surface a series of real -world, data -driven challenges requiring partnerships with other federal agencies, private industry, and international organizations to achieve maximum impact. For example, the HDR Convergence Accelerator will expand ongoing partnerships with cloud computing vendors and establish new partnerships to gain access to the most cutting -edge hardware on which the research community can develop new algorithms and solve complex problems. It will jumpstart partnerships with other federal agencies, private industry, and non- profits to gain access to interesting data and serious data challenges on which multi -disciplinary and multi- sector \"tiger teams\" can work to make significant advances in the near and medium terms. It will lead a change in the form and nature of collaborations required to deepen and strengthen the preparation of the next - generation workforce that effectively engages with data. Achieving these goals will position the United States as a global leader in data-driven discovery and innovation. Evaluation and Assessment Capability (E AC) EAC supports agency -wide program evaluations ; improvements in data quality, and access to data and data analytics tools ; and activities that inform organizational learning in the performance of NSF programs, policies, and day- to-day operations. A detailed discussion of EAC related and co- led activities is found later in the Program Monitoring and Evaluation section of this narrative. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress IA - 3 EPSCoR EPSCOR funding in FY 2019 will catalyze key research themes, including national research priorities within and among EPSCoR jurisdictions that engender knowledge creation, broaden participation in science and engineering, and strengthen the research opportunities available to early career faculty. GRFP GRFP invests in the STEM human capital necessary to ensure the Nation's leadership in advancing discovery and innovation in science and engineering. GRFP selects, recognizes, and financially supports graduate students with demonstrated high potential for excellence in STEM and in their chosen careers. Applications are welcome from students in all STEM disciplines supported by NSF and in STEM interdisciplinary areas, including STEM education. Fellows have opportunities for international research through Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW) and federal i nternships through Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP). IA provides 50 percent of NSF's funding for GRFP, with the remainder provided by EHR. For additional information on GRFP, see the discussion on Major Investments in STEM Graduate Education narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. Growing Convergence Research (GCR) The GCR activity answers extremely challenging, transdisciplinary research questions raised by specific compelling problems. The unifying characteristics of these problems are that: (a) if successfully answered, they are likely to have a large impact, either on fundamental understanding in science and engineering or on our ability to meet pressing societal challenges, or both; and (b) they require the integration of knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. The GCR investment engages communities to identify the most promising convergence research areas, incubates efforts to tackle these through exploratory funding, and supports those that demonstrate t he potential for significant progress with longer -term funding. In addition to supporting science and engineering research, GCR aims to grow the next generation of convergence researchers. The potential impact of GCR transcends specific research areas as i t empowers the scientific enterprise to quickly and effectively adapt and respond to the rapidly changing national and global scientific and technological landscapes. Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Excellence in Research (HBCU -EiR) HBCU -EiR: The HBCU -EiR program focuses on improving the research capacity and competitiveness of HBCUs by providing additional support for research at thes e institutions. IA co-funds HBCU -EiR awards with NSF's science and engineering was initiated in FY 2017 . HBCU -EiR was formally announced with a track in the HBCU -Undergraduate Program solicitation and a first set of awards will be made in FY 2018. Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) INSPIRE: In FY 2017, this pilot activity ended and a new funding mechanism encompassing el ements of INSPIRE was developed , Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE). The RAISE mechanism supports bold, potentially transformative interdisciplinary research that transcends the scope of any individual program . RAISE guidelines a re published in the NSF Proposal and Award Policy Procedures Guide and the funding mechanism is available to any researcher conducting transformational, interdisciplinary research in fields that NSF supports. Dedicated IA co - funding has been eliminated. E ach directorate will support bold, potentially tra nsformative interdisciplinary research through the RAISE mechanism, coordinating with other directorates, as necessary. Integrative Activities IA - 4 Major R esearch Instrumentation (MRI) The MRI program catalyzes new knowledge and dis coveries by empowering the Nation's scientists and engineers with state-of-the- art research instrumentation. The MRI program supports instrument acquisition or development, across all fields of NSF -supported research . It supports research -intensive learnin g environments that promote the development of a diverse workforce, and it facilitates academic and private sector partnerships. Mid-scale Research Infrastructure (Mid -scale) NSF's science and engineering activities rely increasingly on infrastructure th at is div erse in space, cost, and implemen tation time . Many important research questions require instrumentation and other infrastructure that fall in the gap between the scope of the MRI program and the level of activities supported by the MREFC account. To address this gap and to create opportunities for essential science, the Mid-scale program will invest in instrumentation and other infrastructure projects that require between $4 million and $70 million in NSF- funding. The types of project supported will span the range from expensive but relatively straightforward acquisitions, such as certain types of cyberinfrastructure, to complex one-of-a- kind instruments that require significant design and development phases prior to their implementation. Separate tracks within the Mid-scale program will fund acquisition, design/development, and implementation. When needed, both proposal review and post -award management will include appropriate design reviews involving external experts, with projects advanc ing to the implementation stage when they have demonstrated design readiness . The Mid-scale program will leverage national and international partnerships between NSF and other organizations , public and private, where appropriate to advance infrastructure f or basic research. NSF 2026 Fund The NSF 2026 Fund, in recognition and celebration of the Nation's 250th anniversary, will invest in bold research questions that are large in scope, innovative in character, originate outside any particular di rectorate, an d require a long- term commitment. Just as NSF recently developed its first set of Big Ideas, NSF 2026 will set up and sustain mechanisms that will engage the research community in surfacing the next set. Grand challenge initiatives that require an investment horizon of about 10 years will be identified through an \"Idea Machine,\" which includes broad community input through crowd sourcing, blue ribbon panels, ideas labs , and other mechanisms. Transcending established scientific structures and going beyond standard operating procedures, NSF 2026 intends to ensure continuous exploration at the frontiers of discovery and innovation. NSF 2026 will support portfolio analysis, synthesis, and evaluations of NSF as well as NSF's 10 Big Idea activities ($500,000); identifying grand challenge opportunities ($2.0 million); and high- risk, high -reward research activities ($4.0 million). NSF INCLUDES The goal of NSF INCLUDES is to develop a talented, innovative, and capable science and engineering workforce that reflects the diversity of the Nation . If the United States is to remain the world leader with respect to innovations and discoveries in STEM, it must identify and develop talent from all sector s of society to become tomorrow's STEM professionals. NSF INCLUDES, which began in FY 2016, is expected to continue through FY 2025. FY 2019 funding for NSF INCLUDES will be made through the EHR account. Planning and Policy Support (PPS) PPS supports select NSF -wide policy and planning activities . PPS supports annual agency awards for outstanding achievement in science and technology (the Vannevar Bush Award, Public Service Award, Alan T. Waterman Award, and National Medal of Science), and summer science internship programs that target STEM students from underrepresented groups. PPS invests in collaborations with the FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress IA - 5 National Academies, including the Government Univ ersity -Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR),1 and the Committee on Science, Engineering, Medicine, and Public Policy (CoSEMPuP).2 Beginning in FY 2019, PPS will support NSF's Proposal Management Efficiency (PME) activity , which moves from the Other Program Related Administration funding source of Organizational Excellence activities to the IA budget line in FY 2019. PME supports activities such as the NSF biennial survey of investigators and reviewers. Research Investment Communications (RIC) RIC is a leading -edge communications effort that is essential for public awareness and broa d support of science and engineering. RIC supports the creat ion of products and processes through traditional and social media platforms that communicate the impact s of NSF's investments in STEM for discovery, national security, and economic competitiveness to policy makers, the media, and the general public. Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships (STC) program Funding displayed on the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) funding line in the above table represents FY 2017 funding of REU supplements at STCs. The STC program supports innovative, potentially transformative, complex research and education projects that require large- scale, long- term awards. STCs engage the Nation's intellectual talent through partnerships among acade mia, industry, national laboratories, and government. These collaborations create synergies that enhance the training of the next generation of scientists, engineers, and educators; and the creation of job opportunities. STCs have impressive records of res earch achievements, especially because of their strong partnerships with industry. IA provides support for post -award management and oversight of the existing centers. Out-year commitments to centers with existing awards that extend through FY 2019 are funded by the relevant managing directorates. For additional information on STCs , see the discussion on NSF Centers narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. Science and Technology Policy Institutes (STPI) STPI is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) sponsored by NSF on behalf of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Science and Technology for America's Reinvestment: Measuring the Effect of Research on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Science (STAR METRICS) STAR METRICS was an interagency pilot activity that represent ed a new approach to developing information on how NSF and other federal Research and Development (R&D) in vestments affect the innovation ecosystem. Funding was eliminated in FY 2018, as this pilot activity had served its purpose. Program Monitoring and Evaluation Workshops and Reports: In FY 2017, IA funded a study of Reproducibility and Replicability in Science, to be conducted by the National Academies.3 The study report will describe examples of effective practices, identify gaps in knowledge, and consider the rol es of researchers, professional societies, journals, universities and other research institutions, and funders in advancing re producibility and replicatio n. The report will include recommendations for advancing reproducibility and replication in research. The study was requested IA - 6 by Congress in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017.4 Completion is anticipated in FY 2019. In FY 2016, IA co -funded a study on Sexual Harassment in the Scientific and Technical Workforce and its Effects on the Careers of Scientists, Engineers, and Medical Professionals. 5 This study will be conducted by the National Academies and is also funded by several other partners: the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and three private foundations . The study will examine sexual harassment in science, engineering, and medical programs on college and university campuses and the efficacy of institutional responses.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress IA - 9 ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE $160,000,000 COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR) -$2,800,000 / -1.7% Amount Percent 0.37 Funding (Dollars in Millions) ActualFY EPSCoR assists NSF in its statutory function \"to strengthen research and education is science and engineering throughout the United States and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education.\" EPSCoR seeks to advance excellence in science and engineering research and education to achieve sustainable increases in research, education, training capacity , and competitiveness that will enable EPSCoR jurisdictions to have increased engagement in the science and engineering supported by N SF. Based on FY 2017 funding, 14 percent of the EPSCoR portfolio was available for new research grants, and the remaining 86 percent supported research grants made in prior years. EPSCoR uses three strategic investment tools: Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards, Co - Funding, and Outreach/Workshops. Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) RII awards will continue to support development of physical, human, and cyber -based research infrastructure in EPSCoR jurisdictions with emphasis on colla borations among academic researchers, the private sector, and state and local governments to e ffect sustainable improvements in research infrastructure. These awards are designed to improve the research competitiveness of jurisdictions by strengthening the ir academic research infrastructure in areas of science and engineering supported by NSF and critical to the particular jurisdiction's science and technology initiatives. RII awards also invest in workforce development , increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM , enable broader regional and topical collaborations among jurisdictions, and facilitate the enhancement of discovery, learning, and economic development of EPSCoR jurisdictions. Co-Funding Co-Funding: EPSCoR co- invests with NSF directorates and offices on meritorious proposals from individual investigators, groups, and centers in EPSCoR juris dictions that are submitted to the Foundation's research and education programs, including crosscutting initiatives. Outreach and Workshops The Outreach and Workshops component of EPSCoR solicits requests for workshops, conferences, and other community- based activities designed to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering, and to share best practices in strategic pl anning, diversity, communication, and other capacity -building areas of importance to EPSCoR jurisdictions. EPSCoR also supports outreach travel that enables NSF staff from all directorates and offices to directly engage and inform the EPSCoR research commu nity about NSF opportunities, priorities, programs, and policies.

This research foundation has guided and shaped EHR's portfolio and priorities for more than 60 years. Although the EHR mission remains unchanged , the context in which th e mission is enacted changes. Each decade brings new challenges and opportunities. The progress of science and engineering depends on the education of discoverers \u2014the future leaders and innovators in science and engineering. These discover ers will become part of the STEM and STEM- related workforce, including public and private sector, academic, policy, research, and teaching occupations. The progress of science and engineering also depends on a public that values and participates in the STEM enterpr ise through formal and informal education, public participation in scientific research, and civic engagement. The opportunities made possible by federal investments in STEM must be provided effectively to, and draw from, the full and diverse talent pool of the Nation. The role of NSF, through EHR, within the federal government in supporting research on STEM education is unique. EHR programs fund crucial foundational, design and development, and implementation research that is made available to inform large investments at scale made by other agencies, organizations, and the private sector. The EHR research portfolio also supports a coherent suite of NSF -wide investments in undergraduate and graduate STEM education through strategic linkages with the discipl ine-specific needs of all NSF directorates and engagement in cross- directorate science and engineering initiatives. In addition, the EHR investments in preK -12 STEM education and informal STEM learning are focused, catalytic contributions that push the frontiers of effective learning and practice in those environments. Such work is foundational as a part of the national STEM education infrastructure.

DUE Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2017 ActualFY 2018 RequestFY 2019 RequestChange over FY 2017 Actual DUE Summary DUE supports excellence in undergraduate STEM education for all students. To accomplish this mission, DUE funds projects that design, develop, and implement high- quality educational experiences, as well as the scientific research needed to evaluate the effectiveness of those experiences. The resulting STEM learning environments integrate cutting -edge science and education research results to improve learning for all undergraduates. DUE investments promote improved teaching practices across the full range of U.S. higher education: community colleges, four -year colleges, comprehensive public institutions, and research universities, in cluding flagship, state -supported systems. In turn, improved STEM education opens multiple career pathways for undergraduates. For example, innovative educational programs at community colleges enable students to gain expertise in advanced technologies suc h as additive manufacturing, biotechnology, precision agriculture, nano- optics, or cybersecurity; this expertise can lead directly to employment in those sectors. At baccalaureate degree- granting institutions, STEM majors can pursue alternative teaching certification to enter the K -12 teaching workforce in high -need school districts. Overall, improvements in STEM education enhance student learning, which support s greater retention and degree attainment, broadening the pool of future STEM researchers, and he lping meet workforce needs for STEM - knowledgeable individuals . FY 2019 priorities for DUE include: Support and influence the nationwide movement to improve unde rgraduate STEM education through the creation and study of innovative learning environments for undergraduate STEM disciplinary and interdisciplinary learning. DUE also continues to be the main source of support across federal agencies for discipline -based educational research (DBER).2 DBER translates disciplinary expertise and evidence from the learning sciences into physical and virtual tools, technologies, a nd other learning experiences. It then uses research and development strategies to itera tively improve these products. Through these design -research cycles, DBER has the potential to improve STEM learning at scale. 2Singer, Nielsen, and Schweingruber. \"Discipline -based education research.\" Washington, NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 9 Focus on investments for improving mathematics learning and teaching, particularly in the first two years of college; improving data science learning; developing students' skills, work habits, and character as they gain STEM knowledge; and developing the next generation of researchers who will study STEM and undergraduate STEM education.

Increase the population of diverse, innovative STEM and STEM-knowledgeable workers . To this end, DUE will also focus on improving the preparation of future K -12 teachers and highly skilled technicians in advanced technology industries. In FY 2019, special attention will be placed on attracting proposals to IUSE: EHR led by investigators from minority -serving community colleges, as well as investigators from two - and four - year institutions with prior funding from HBCU -UP and TCUP. All DUE programs will emphasize research and development on increasing the success of low income and other underrepresented undergraduate groups in making the transition from two- year to four -year STEM degree programs. Directorate for Educatio n and Human Resources EHR - 10 H-B NONIMMIGRANT PET ITIONER FEES $100,000,000 In FY 2019, H- Nonimmigrant Petitioner Fees are projected to be $ 2018 EstimateFY 2019 RequestFY 2019 Request Change Over FY 2018 Estimate Beginning in FY 1999, Title IV of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (P.L. 105- 277) established an H -1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury for fees collected for each petition for alien nonimmigrant status. That law required that a prescribed percentage of funds in the account be made available to NSF for low -income scholarships; grants for mathematics, engineering, or science enrichment courses; and systemic reform activities. In FY 2005, Public Law 108- 447 reauthorized H -1B funding. NSF was provided with 40 percent of the total H -1B receipts collected. Thirty percent of H -1B receipts (75 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are to be used for a low -income scholarship program, Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM). Ten percent of receipts (25 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are designated for support of private -public partnerships in K -12 education through Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST). Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM). The S-STEM program began in 1999 under P.L. 105-277. Originally , the program was named Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) and supported grants for scholarships to academically -talented students with demonstrated financial need pursuing associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics. Grantee institutions awarded scholarships of up to $2,500 per year for two years to eligible students. The CSEMS activity continued under the Amer ican Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 106-313) with a prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts (22 percent) which totaled approximately 59.5 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF. P.L. 106- 313 also amended P.L. 105- 277 by increasing the maximum scholarship duration to four years and the annual stipend to $3,125. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447), the prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts available for the low -income scholarship program was increased to 30 pe rcent (approximately 75 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF). E ligibility for the scholarships was expanded from the original fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics to include \"other technology and science programs designated by the Director.\" The maximum annual scholarship award amount was raised from $3,125 to $10,000. Language also was added allowing NSF to use up to 50 percent of funds \"for undergraduate programs for curriculum development, professional and workforce development, and to advance technological education.\" As a result, the program was renamed in 2006 from CSEMS to S -STEM. Low-i ncome Scholarship Program: S -STEM. The S -STEM program provides institutions with funds for student scholarships to encourage and enable academically talented U.S. students demonstrating financial need to enter the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school following completion of an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in fields of science, technology, engineering, or FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 11 mathematics. The program emphasizes the importance of recruiting students to STEM disciplines, mentoring and supporting students through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workforce. Since its inception, the low -income scholarship program has received more than 6,500 proposals from all types of colleges and universities and has made 1,923 awards. In addition to scholarships, S- STEM awards also provide funding for student support activities featuring close involvement of faculty, student mentoring, academic support, curriculum development, and recognition of student accomplishment s. Such activities are importa nt in recruiting and retaining students in high -technology fields through graduation and into employment. In FY 2019, in addition to the long -standing scholarship support, all S -STEM projects will contribute to conduct research on interventions that affect associate or baccalaureate STEM degree attainment by academically talented U.S. students demonstrating financial need. Because S -STEM projects report much higher retention and graduation rates among their scholarship students than among other STEM majors, this research is important to understand this success so that effective practices can be used at scale. Approximately 90 awards are anticipated in FY 2019, with a continued emphasis on increasing involvement of community colleges, especially Hispanic -serving institutions. S -STEM activities in FY 2019 will leverage efforts in IUSE: EHR , LSAMP, and the HSI Program to enhance persistence of students. S -STEM will continue to be a partner in the NSF INCLUDES initiative. S -STEM programming and research also will align with NRT , with the goal of understanding and enhancing effective learning environments and pathways for students on the continuum from two- year to four -year to master 's and doctoral degrees. Private -Public Partnerships in K -12. Th e American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 106- 313) amended P.L. 105- 277 and changed the way petitioner fees were to be expended. P.L. 106-313 directed the remaining 40.5 perc ent of the total H-1B funding for NSF (15 percent of H -1B receipts) toward K -12 activities involving private -public partnerships in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, and mathematics and science teacher professional development. The ITEST program was developed as a partnership activity in K-12 to increase opportunities for students and teachers to learn about, experience, and use information technologies within the context of STEM, including information technology (IT) courses. In FY 2005, P.L. 108-447 reduced the prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts available for private -public partnerships in K - 12 to 10 percent (approximately 25 percent of the total H-1B funding for NSF). P rivate -Public Partnerships in K -12: ITEST. The ITEST program invests in K -12 activities that address the ongoing and growing need for STEM professionals and information technology workers in the U.S. and seeks solutions to help ensure the breadth and depth of the U.S. STEM workforce. ITEST funds activities for students and teachers that emphasize mathematics, science, and engineering careers, and emphasizes the importance of evaluation and research to understand the impact of such activities. The program supports the development, implementation, testing, and scale -up of models, STEM robotics projects, and research studies to improve the STEM workforce and build a student's capacity to participate in the STEM workforce. The solicitation places emphasis on capturing and establishing a reliable knowled ge base about the dispositions toward and knowledge about STEM workforce skills in U.S . students. Since its inception, the ITEST program has received 3,507 grant proposals and made 457 awards (including co- funded projects) that allow K-12 students and te achers to work closely with scientists, engineers, and other STEM professionals on extended research projects that promote awareness of STEM careers and interest in pursuing education pathways to those careers. Funded projects draw on a wide mix of local resources, including universities, industry, museums, science and technology centers, and school districts in order to identify the characteristics that attract a wide and diverse range of young Directorate for Educatio n and Human Resources EHR - 12 people to STEM careers, especially those students historically underrepresented in those careers . In FY 2019, ITEST will be a partner in the NSF INCLUDES initiative and will make approximately 2017 (Dollars in Millions) 1P.L. 108-447 directs that 10 percent of the H-1B Petitioner funds go tow ard K-12 activities involving private-publice partnerships in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, math and science teacher professional development, etc. Explanation of Carryover Within the H-1B no-year account, $96.86 million was carried over into FY 2018.

The future success of entire fields of research depends upon access to new generations of powerful research tools. Increasingly, these tools are large and complex and have a significant information technology or cyber -infrastructure component. To be considered for MREFC funding, NSF requires that a project represent an exceptional opportunity to enable research and education. The project should be transformative in nature, with the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding. The projects included in this budget request meet these criteria based on NSF and National Science Board review and approval. In FY 2019, NSF requests $94.65 million to continue constructio n of three ongoing projects : Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) , Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) , and Regional Class Research Research Vessels (RCRV) . For more information on each project, including the disposition of construction support for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), see the individual narratives later in this chapter. Since FY 2009, projects funded through the MREFC account have been subject to NSF's \"no cost overrun\" policy. As a result, NSF processes and procedures must assure the development of realistic and well - supported total project cost estimates for major research infrastructure such that approved budgets are sufficient to accomplish the scientific objectives. The current policy as published in NSF's Large F acilities Manual (LFM) requires that: (1) the total project cost estimate when exiting the preliminary design phase includes adequate contingency to cover foreseeable risks; (2) any cost increases not covered by contingency be accommodated first by reductions in scope, provided that the actual enacted funding levels have been consistent with the established annual cash flow requirements; and (3) if the project is approved to continue Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 2 and further scope reductions become too detrimental to science, then the f irst 10 percent of any cost increase must be covered by the sponsoring directorate through R&RA funding. This final step was required for NEON, as described in the individual narrative for the project. All projects funded through the MREFC account undergo periodic cost, schedule, and risk reviews as required by the LFM and the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements. NSF policies and reporting requirements are designed to ensure routine and reliable tracking of progress (including the use of Ea rned Value Management), project spending, and use of contingency, and that program and recipients each have sufficient oversight and management authority (respectively) to meet project objectives. Enhanced NSF Oversight NSF has greatly strengthened its oversight of major facility projects in recent years, with a number of those enhancements now codified in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) of 2017. One significant enhancement is holding a portion of budget contingency (up to 100 percent) and only allocating to the program for obligation to the project based on demonstrated need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carryover each year; however, future obligation is anticipated to manage project risks. Enhanced oversight of the construction stage now also includes mandatory incurred cost audits and independent cost estimates, as well as other audits and reviews based on NSF's annual major facility portfolio risk assessment. These efforts are conducted by NSF and are generally not attributable to a specific project at the time of budget formulation, nor are they part of the total project cost developed and managed by the recipient. To properly support and transparently account for these efforts, actual costs and future estimates for Enhanced Oversight are shown separately from project s in the MREFC account table. In FY 2017 and FY 2018, these activities are supported with funds recovered from projects completed in previous years. Appropriations Language For necessary expenses for the acquisition, construction, commissioning, and upgrading of major research equipment, facilities, and other such capital assets pursuant to the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 1861 et seq.), including author ized travel, $182,800,000 $94,650,000 to remain available until expended. Note. \u2014A full -year 2018 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, the budget assumes this account is op erating under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-56, as amended).

Inouye Solar Telescope is $16.13 million. This represents the final year in an 11 -year funding profile within a National Science Board approved not -to- exceed total project cost of $344.13 million . Completion of construction atop Haleakal on Maui, Hawai'i is planned for no later than June 2020. When completed, DKIST will be the world's most powerful solar observatory, poised to answer fundamental questions in solar physics by providing transformative improvements over current ground-based facilities. DKIST will enable the study of magnetic phenomena in the solar photosphe re, chromosphere, and corona. Determining the role of magnetic fields in the outer regions of the Sun is crucial to understanding the solar dynamo, solar variability, and solar activity including flares and coronal mass ejections. Solar activity can affect civil life on Earth through phenomena generally described as space weather , and may impact the terrestrial climate. The relevance of DKIST's science drivers was reaffirmed by the National Academy of Sciences 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey: New Worlds, New Horizons 1 as well as the 2012 Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey: A Science for a Technological Society .2 DKIST will play an important role in enhancing the \"fundamental understanding of space weather and its drivers,\" an objective called out in the National Space Weather Strategy and associated National Space Weather Action Plan3 both of which were released by the National Science and Technology Council on October 29, 2015. Prior YearsFY 2014 ActualFY 2015 ActualFY 2016 Funds for the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (Dollars in Millions) Baseline History Beginning in 2001, NSF provided funds to the National Solar Observatory (NSO) for an eight- year design and development program for DKIST and its initial complement of instruments through the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and through the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO). The current design, cost, schedule, and risk were scrutinized in an NSF -conducted Preliminary Design Review in October- November 2006. The original total project cost to NSF, $297.93 million, was set after a Final Design Review (FDR) in May 2009, which determined that the project was fully prepared to begin construction. The National Science Board (NSB) approved an award for this amount at the NSF Director's discretion, contingent upon completion of compliance with relevant environmental and cultural/historic statutes. In FY 2009, $153.0 million was appropriated to initiate construction. Funding was provided through a combina tion of the MREFC account ($7.0 million) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) account ($146.0 million). Given the timing of the receipt of budget authority and the complexity of project 1 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 2 www.nap.edu/search/?term=13060&x=0&y=0 3 www.hsdl.org/?view&did=789864 FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 5 contracting, the entire $153.0 million was carried over from FY 2009 and obligated in FY 2010. The environmental compliance requirements were completed on November 20, 2009, and the NSF Director signed the Record of Decision authorizing construction on December 3, 2009. The Hawai'i Board on Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) approved the project's application for a Co nservation District Use Permit (CDUP) on December 1, 2010. The Hawai'i BLNR approved a Habitat Conservation Plan, designed to protect and rehabilitate habitats o f the endangered Hawai'ian p etrel and Hawai'ian goose that could potentially be affected by the construction of DKIST. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service completed a formal consultation regarding the endangered Hawai'ian petrel in 2011. A contested case challenge to the 2010 CDUP issuance delay ed site construction until the BLNR rul ed in favor of the DKIST project and issued a new CDUP November 2012. Full access to the site atop Haleakal followed shortly thereafter. Site preparation and excav ation began November 30, 2012. The unexpected length of the delay associated with the environmental compliance process led to a reassessment of the project schedule and total project cost in 2012. An external panel of experts reviewed the revised baseline and increased the total project cost by approximately $46.20 million. The NSB also subseq uently considered and approved a revised total project cost of $344.13 million at their August 2013 meeting.

Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 6 The DKIST project is a collaboration of scientists and engineers at more than 20 U.S. and international organizati ons. Other partners include the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and international groups in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Some partnership activities include: The U.S. Air Force replaced the aluminizing chamber at their Advanced Electro-O ptical System telescope on Maui and sized it to accommodate the DKIST primary mirror. An Interagency Agreement for use of the Mirror Coating Facility (MCF) was signed by NSF and the U.S. Air Force in FY 2017. This eliminates the need to build a dedicated chamber for DKIST. Kiepenheuer- Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik (KIS; Freiburg, Germany) is constructing a narrow -band first - light instrument named the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) as an in -kind contribution. Queens University Belfast (Northern Ireland) is leading a consortium of institutions from the United Kingdom that will supply high -speed visible cameras to feed the DKIST instruments. Discussions of other possible contributions for second- generation instruments, algorithm development, coordinated observations, and student exchange are ongoing. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in AST working cooperatively with staff from MPS, the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management (BFA), the Office of the General Counsel, and the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs. Within BFA the Large Facilities Office (LFO) provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. Representatives from the above NSF offices comprise t he DKIST I ntegrated Project Team (IPT), which meets on a quarterly basis to discuss outstanding project issues. External Structure: NSO conducts the construction project. NSF funds NSO operations and maintenance (O&M) and DKIST design and construction via separate Cooperative Support Agreements (CSAs) beneath an overarching Cooperative A greement (CA) with the managing organization, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA). The DKIST CSA for construction runs through the end of FY 2019, and will be extended to cover the FY 2020 completion date . In 2015, the NSO CA and O&M CSA were renewed through the end of FY 2024 . This period covers the DKIST construction phase and the achievement of sustainable operations of the completed facility. The DKIST director is a senior NSO scientist who was a leader in the development of the science case and an expert in the field of solar adaptive optics, a critical technology for DKIST.

Several councils and working groups give input from the solar and space physics communities. R eviews Management, Cost, and Schedule reviews: DKIST scope, schedule, budget est imate, and risk -adjusted total project cost were scrutinized and validated at the Preliminary Design and Final Design Reviews. Earned Value Management (EVM) System Review: LFO and AST conducted a review of the DKIST project's EVM system, September 20 -22, 2016. The external reviewers verified the project's EVM system and conducted interviews with project management and individual cost account managers to validate the input estimates/data into the system. The evaluation team found that the EVM System has been effectively implemented and is being used to provide reliable project management information. The NSF formally accepted the project's EVM System in a notification dated February 22, 2017. Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Assessment: LFO engaged a contractor to perform an assessment of the DKIST project's processes and procedures for producing the software systems to be delivered at DKIST first light. The SQA assessment consisted of a document desk review followed by videoconference conducted July 10, 2017. The final report was received by NSF on October 3, 2017. The Executive Summary from the report states: \"The results of the SQA assessment found that the processes and procedures employed by the project are reasonable to produce quality software.\" The report findings and recommendations have been relayed to AURA, NSO and the DKIST Project. Independent Risk Assessment (IRA): LFO engaged a contractor to perform an independent assessment of the project's remaining risks as DKIST enters the critical integrati on, testing and commissioning (IT&C) stage of construction. The IRA consisted of a document desk review followed by an in -person meeting on September 21, 2017. The final report was received by NSF on December 11, 2017. The final report transmittal memo from the contractor states: \"We are pleased to report that the DKIST project has a mature risk management program that is well -positioned entering the Integration, Testing, and Commissioning (IT&C) phase. We found no critical areas that require corrective action.\" Programmatic Review: A comprehensive programmatic review of the DKIST MREFC construction project took place September 19 -21, 2017 in Boulder, CO . This external programmatic review focus ed on the IT&C phase of construction. T he final report was re ceived by NSF on October 27, 2017. The Executive Summary from the report states: \"The Panel found that the project is performing exceptionally well\", and that \" the Project is on track to complete the project within the project deadline and budget, and that the Project's science goals are attainable. \" P roject Status The DKIST project continues to make progress on construction at the summit of Haleakal on Maui, HI, while remaining in compliance with all local, state, and federal environmental and cultural requirements. The project continues to consult with various stakeholders on a regular basis including the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources, the Hawai'i Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Federal Aviatio n Administration, the National Park Service, and Native Hawai'ian cultural practitioners. Construction highlights : The project continues to work on interior fit and finish items for the enclosure (dome) and the support and operations building. Work conti nues on the critical facility thermal systems. In FY 2017 the primary mirror (M1) and the M1 cell assembly were transported to Maui from Arizona and Belgium, respectively. The M1 and the M1 cell assembly were successfully transported to the summit of Halea kal. In FY 2018 the M1 will be coated at the MCF and installed in the telescope support structure. The Coud\u00e9 rotator platform assembly inside the enclosure is completed. Site acceptance testing was Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 8 completed and the project is resolving punch- list items. Assembly of the Telescope Mount will be completed in FY 2018. Fabrication of the DKIST first-light instruments is continuing through FY 2018. I n FY 2019 the installation of the telescope structure and mechanical controls will be completed. By the end of FY 2019 the integration, testing, and commissioning of the M1 and the facility class instruments will be well underway. C ost and Schedule The original baseline not -to-exceed, risk -adjusted cost was established following FDR. As noted above, a revised pro ject baseline review was held in October 2012; NSB approved the new baseline in August 2013. Total project cost of $344.13 million is derived from ARRA ($146.0 million) and annual appropriations in the MREFC account ($198.13 million). A Monte Carlo analysi s of the risk -adjusted project end date at the time of the project re -baseline indicated June 10, 2020 at an 80 percent Confidence Level for successful completion. The project is currently on track for a FY 2020 end date. Ri sks Project management control, interface control, and change controls are in place. The project also maintains a risk register that is reviewed and updated on a monthly basis. T echnical : The majority of the remaining technical risk is very low as a result of the long design and development phase, with the exception of one first - light instrument: the VT F mentioned above. The cooperative support agreement between NSF and AURA identifies four facility -class instruments (not including the VTF) to be delivered by the DKIST project at the end of the MREFC construction phase. The project is on track to deliver those four instruments. The VTF is a fifth instrument and is an in-kind contribution from the German Kiepenheuer - Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik (KIS) being designed and developed through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between AURA and KIS ; therefore , the fabrication risks for this instrument remain with the German institute. KIS is currently on track to deliver a single -etalon version of the instrument to DKIST. The DKIST project and AURA continue to wor k with KIS to ensure that the instrument is delivered on schedule and on budget. E nvironmental and Cultural Compliance : AST, NSF's Office of the General Counsel, and the DKIST project have carefully worked through the applicable statutes, and a cultural monitor has been retained during construction. All re quired permits are in place and semi -annual consultations with a Native Hawai'ian working group continue. The two outstanding legal appeals with the potential to impact project construction were resolved in favor of the DKIST project. On October 6, 2016, t he Hawai'i Supreme Court ruled against the appellant in the two cases and upheld both the DKIST project's conservation district use permit (CDUP) and the University of Hawai'i Haleakal Observatory Management Plan. These decisions substantially reduced the risks to DKIST construction due to permitting issues.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 9 Environmental Health and Safety : NSO has a well -developed safety program engendered in the DKIST project. The DKIST project has developed a site safety plan and conducted a thorough construction readiness review in 2011 and conducts annual safety reviews. Operations Costs DKIST op erations are funded through R&RA . In FY 2019, the budget request of $18.50 million includes $16.50 million for DKIST operations and $2.0 million for cultural mitigation act ivities as agreed to during the compliance process. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 10 LARGE SYNOPTIC SURVE Y TELESCOPE (LSST) $48,820,000 The FY 2019 Budget Request for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is $48.82 million. This is the sixth year of support for a nine-year project that began in August 2014. The National Science Board approved not-to-exceed total project cost is $473.0 million for NSF's contribution to the project's the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (Dollars in Millions) LSST is located in Chile and, when completed, wi ll be an 8 -meter -class wide -field optical telescope designed to carry out surveys of nearly half of the sky. The initial 10 -year survey has a cadence enabling repeat observation of each survey field approximately twice weekly. The requirements for LSST were set by considering four key science areas: the physics of dark energy and dark matter a census of small bodies in the solar system, including potentially hazardous Near Earth Objects the structure and contents of the Milky Way galaxy the nature of transient astronomical objects on time scales ranging from seconds to years. By satisfying the requirements defined by these key investigations, the LSST survey will result in a comprehensive data set that will enable hundreds of fundamental astrophysical studies by the entire research community on these and other topics. Thus, LSST has the potential to advance every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to the large- scale structure of the Universe. Baseline History LSST is a joint NSF/Department of Energy (DOE) project to build an instrument that was ranked the top large ground-based astronomy project by the National Research Council 2010 Decadal Survey. 4 Prior to NSF's construction award, NSF, DOE, and private (non- federal) partn ers invested over $130.0 million in LSST -related work. About 70 percent supported design and development and about 30 percent, from the non- federal funding, supported casting and polishing of the innovative combined primary- tertiary mirror (M1M3), initial site preparation, and prototype detector creation and evaluation, all of which significantly reduced construction risk. NSF and DOE conducted a series of reviews in 2011 and 2012 to determine the project baseline, including the NSF Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a subsequent cost estimation review. Plans were kept up - to-date to synchronize the DOE and NSF funding profiles as reviews continued, leading to NSF's Final Design Review (FDR) in December 2013. NSF then carried out a detailed cost analysis pr ior to following through on its approval process and making an award in the last quarter of FY 2014. 4 http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_049810 FY 2019 NSF Budget Request Development $57.13 - - - - - - - - Operations & Maintenance - - - 0.50 3.10 7.50 14.30 in Millions) FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES 1 Concept & Development funding and Implementation funding are cumulative of all prior years; Operations & Maintenance funding reflects prior year actual obligations only.Prior Years1FY 2017 ActualFY 2018 Request L SST Science Plan The site at Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile was selected for LSST because of the excellent sky transparency and image quality (known as seeing), dark skies, small fraction of cloudy nights, and the geological characteristics that enable the rapid telescope motions required to carry out the LSST survey. LSST will collect nearly 40 terabytes of multi -color imaging data every night for 10 years, producing a long -lived dataset of considerable utility. It will produce the deepest, widest -field sky image ever, and issue aler ts for changing and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. Repeated deep imaging of every part of the accessible sky will turn up explosive events such as cataclysmic variable stars, supernovae, and the optical counterparts of X -ray flashes, as well as finding moving objects and better characterizing those already known. Estimates of LSST's ability to locate Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) have been refined by LSST Project members, as well as by external studies, including an independent Jet Propulsion Laboratory study supported by NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. Assuming other existing NEO efforts continue, at the end of LSST's 10- year prime mission, the catalog for objects larger than abou t 140 meters across should be about 75 percent complete for NEOs (about 80 percent $0$15$30$45$60$75$90$105 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024LSST Funding, by Stage (Dollars in Millions) Implementation (MREFC) Operations &Maintenance(R&RA)Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 12 for PHAs), approximately 15 percent more complete than without LSST. LSST data will be widely accessible, and discovery opportunities will be available to K -12 students as easily as to professional astronomers. An innovative citizen science program will involve people of all ages in LSST discoveries. More than half of the cost during operations is for data management, including user - friendly interfaces tailored for the different anticipated communities. The survey strategy makes the same dataset usable for almost all of the astronomy community as well as for educators and the general public. The primary data archive is planned to be located at the National Center for Supercom puting Applications in Illinois. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is han dled by a program officer in the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) working cooperatively with NSF staff from MPS, BFA, OGC, OLPA, and OISE. T he NSF prog ram officer works closely with counterparts in the DOE Office of High Energy Physics, who have oversight responsibility for the LSST camera sub -project. Inter -agency coordination is accomplished through weekly meetings of a joint oversight group and was formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding signed in July 2012. External Structure: The responsible awardee for LSST construction is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), a non- profit science management corporation con sisting of 44 U.S. institutional members and f our international affiliates. AURA works closely with the LSST Corporation (LSSTC), which initiated LSST development and remains responsible for privately raised funding. AURA and LSSTC established the LSST Pro ject Office as an AURA -managed center for construction; this office is overseen by the AURA Management Council for LSST. The LSST Project Director and the LSST Project Manager are experienced in large facility construction and operation and are appointed by AURA, with the approval of NSF and DOE. Reviews Technical Reviews: Reviews were conducted throughout the design and development phase, culminating in NSF's FDR in December 2013, with DOE involvement. All major sub- systems undergo regular system -level design reviews organized by the LSST Project Office with external participants. Management, Cost, and Schedule Reviews: Cost, schedule, and risk are also scrutinized by the technical reviews. During construction, NSF and DOE are holding regular joint progres s reviews. These include: Major reviews held by both NSF and DOE prior to the MREFC award found the Basis of Estimate documentation to be quite adequate, with small improvements requested. On May 7, 2014, the National Science Board (NSB) issued Resolution NSB -14-24, authorizing NSF management to proceed with the construction award, subject to the resolution of any substantive cost issues identified in the NSF review process. All cost issues were subsequently resolved , allowing the MREFC award to be issued in August 2014 The first annual construction review was originally scheduled for August -September 2015 but was deferred until February 2016. The review panel made several recommendations to improve project execution. To get back on schedule, the second progress review happened in August 2016 and was also successful, except that the Data Management (DM) systems were undergoing a major replan and could not be fully evaluated. A follow -up and su ccessful DM- focused review took place in July 2017, providing support for significant use of cost contingency. The latest joint agency progress review occurr ed in September 2017. In conjunction with the first progress review, NSF organized an Earned Value Management (EVM) validation review to consider both the adequacy of the system used for EVM, and the LSST Project staff's ability to use EVM tools and methods. The review made some minor recommendations, which were adopted. NSF formally accepted the LSST EVM system in January 2017. A follow -up EVM surveillance review coincided with the 2017 annual progress review. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 13 In January 2017, DOE and NSF held a joint external agency review of the project's plans for commissioning and transition to early operations. After DOE Critical Decision (CD) reviews, DOE issued CD -3a approval for long -lead procurements in July 2014, and CD -2 approval, including setting the not -to-exceed Total Project Cost for the DOE sub - project, on January 7, 2015. CD -3 review in early August 2015 was followed by formal approval for full DOE construction funding on August 27, 2015. Project Status NSF's construction award was issued on August 1, 2014. Use of cost contingency and task -to-task float kept the project on the most optimistic schedule possible until recently , when delays with the main mirror cell have led to use of 10 weeks overall schedule contingency. Despite weather delays caused by an unprecedented El Ni \u00f1o event, the primary telescope building and dome installation will be completed in mid-FY 2018 and ready for the installation of necessary equipment and for the arrival of the telescope mount assembly. During the bid process, the estimated cost of the La Serena base facility was found to be in error, and some techn ical risk was realized. NSF has issued approval for the contract, and the approximately $4.0 million increase will be covered by available contingency. NSF - and DOE -supported activities remain tightly coordinated, both at the project level and between agency program officers. Cost and Schedule A complete re -estimate of the project occurred prior to the NSF FDR. The FDR panel found the NSF Total Project Cost (TPC) of $473.0 million to be reasonable and justifiable, but they nevertheless recommended that the project introduce possible additional de-scoping options. NSF carried out further cost review prior to making the award . NSF policy changed from a probabilistic contingency estimation based on the Project Management Control System (PMCS) to requiring a joint cost and schedule Monte Carlo (MC) method. The LSST Project established the new MC method through their PMCS and showed that the computed TPC corresponds to a better than 90 percent chance that the final cost of the current construction scope will fall within the NSB - approved funding cap, and before the planned survey start date. This result was finalized in April 2015 and incorporated into the associated Cooperative Support Agreement. In addition to NSF's contribution, DOE's baseline for the camera w as fixed at $168.0 million by the CD- 3 approval mentioned above. C onstruction also include s approximately $39.0 million from non- federal sources, all of which has been expended. Risks Technical : Much of the technical risk was retired during design and development. Since full construction began, no new major risks have appeared, and small, realized risks have been mitigated by use of cost and schedule contingency, including float internal to sub- projects. The Data Management construction effort has been ide ntified as a risk and re -planning has been completed . Implementation of the recommendations of the July 2017 Data Management review , including the release of cost and schedule contingency, is currently underway. Environmental and Cultural Compliance : Environmental and cultural impact mitigation continues as planned with no unforeseen issues. Site: The possible site risk due to local geological anomalies, noted in previous requests, was realized during excavation. Since this risk was localized and anticipated, it was successfully handled. Site disruptions from geological events and extreme weather remain as possible risks with appropriate mitigation plans. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 14 Environmental Health and Safety : The LSST project has a full -time head of safety with experience in AURA operations, which has a long positive safety record in Chile. Both the summit and base sites have on-site safety supervisors employed by LSST to monitor contractor and project activities. All safety plans are fully compliant with applicable standar ds from U.S., Chilean, and participating institutions, and are updated regularly. External reviews have given the project high marks for its safety culture. P artnership Risk : Significant attention has been paid to partnership risk, and that risk has been mitigated by careful coordination and unified project structures. The LSST project director and deputy director oversee the entire project. A single project manager, agreed to by both NSF and DOE, manages the complete work breakdown structure elements. Budgetary management details are clearly set out between the project director, the project manager, the project's Change Control Board, the AURA Management Council for LSST, and the agency program officers, grants officers, and financial managers. Ope rations Costs Operation costs are funded within R &RA. The operations costs shown in the table immediately above are planning estimates based on the most recently available data. Although the FY 2019 R equest is less than previous estimates, the overall 10-year operations cost estimate to NSF remains unchanged at $310.0 million (then -year US dollars). The final full operations costs and the amount required from non -federal partners will be determined through a review, approval , and award process that began with the project submission of a formal proposal for LSST operations in August 2017 and w ill include a review by the National Science Board in 2018 before the final award is issued. I n their join t Memorandum of Understanding, NSF and DOE agreed to fund operations, increasing agency support and revising the operations plans, as appropriate. MPS/AST is planning to provide approximately half of the original estimated steady -state amount, as well as p re-operations support, with the DOE Office of High Energy Physics providing one quarter, plus installation and commissioning support additional to the project construction cost. The project team has already established firm agreements to fund about half of the remaining one quarter with contributions from non -federal entities. N egotiations continue with potential partners to find the remaining balance. Construction status on Cerro Pach\u00f3n, November 2017. Credit: LSST. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 15 THE NATIONAL ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NETW ORK (NEON) $0 No MREFC funds are requested for NEON in the FY 2019 Request . This narrative provides an update on the project's status. Construction funding totals an estimated $ 469.30 millio n, which includes the $35.51 million increase in the Total Project Cost (TPC) established in 2016 in conjunction with the change in the managing organization. The increase in the TPC has been funded via transfers of R&RA funds from BIO. Roughly 88 percent of the approved proje ct funds for construction have been spent, with Observatory capability at approximately 93 percent complete. Construction is expected to be complete by the fall of CY 2018. NEON operations and maintenance (O&M) will be funded through the R&RA account. Prior YearsFY 2012 ActualFY 2013 - - 469.30 Previous Profile - - - - - 20.00 15.51 - - 25.86 1 In June 2016, the National Science Board (NSB) approved an increase in NEON's Total Project Cost (TPC) from $433.79 million to $469.30 million. The $35.51 million increase was anticipated to be provided through transfers from the R&RA account to the MREFC account, at levels of $20.0 million in FY 2016 and up to $15.51 million in FY 2017. The full $20.0 million was transferred in FY 2016 but of the possible $15.51 million in FY 2017 funds, only $5.86 million was required and transferred from the R&RA account to the MREFC account. Appropriated and Requested MREFC Funds for the National Ecological Observatory Network (Dollars in Millions) The transfer from R&RA into MREFC so far has been less than the initial estimate of $35.5 1 million projected in FY 2016 because the project requirements, under the management of Battelle Memorial Institute, Inc. (Battelle) , have been below the estimated levels. Of the planned $35.51 million R&RA transfer amount, only $25.86 million has been transferred to the MREFC account in two installments, $20.0 million in FY 2016 and $5.86 million in FY 2017. Several factors have account ed for the $9.65 million reduction from the anticipated level for the transfer , including lower than anticipated environmental compliance costs and updates to the estimated -to-complete (ETC), based on information that was not available when the TPC was revised in June 2016. Project requirements are being closely monitored by NSF to determine if any of the remaining $9.65 million of the approved transfer amount will be needed to complete the project. Baseline History NEON consists of geographically distributed f ield and lab infrastructure networked into an integrated research platform for regional to continental scale ecological research. Cutting -edge sensor networks, instrumentation, observational sampling, natural history archive facilities, and remote sensing will be linked via the internet to computational, analytical, and modeling capabilities to create NEON's integrated infrastructure. In 2004, the National Research Council evaluated the original NEON design of loosely confederated observatories and recommended that it be reshaped into a single integrated platform for regional to continental scale ecological research. Congress appropriat ed initial funding in FY 2007. A Preliminary Design Review was completed in June 2009 and a Final Design Review (FDR) w as completed in November 2009. The FDR also included a formal construction baseline review and cost review; an additional baseline review was conducted in April 2011 prior to initiation of construction that confirmed the basel ine scope, cost, and schedule. Project planning continued until construction began in August 2011. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 16 Development $104.85 - - - - - - - - are cumulative of all prior years; Operations &Maintenance funding reflects prior year actual obligations only. 2 Funding for O&M is currently capped at $65.0 million per year for planning purposes, pending the results from an initial period of operations under Battelle's management. Future O&M requests will be based on a more thorough analysis of science capabilities and affordability. 3InFY2016, consistent with the revised TPC, $20.0 million ofFY2016 R&RA funding was $5.86 million of FY 2017 appropriated the MREFC account. 4Atotal of $14.21 million ofFY2017 MREFC funding was carried over into FY2018. Ofthis amount, $11.06 million will be obligated inFY 2018 tocomplete project construction requirements. The remaining $3.15 million is being held by NSF as management reserve and will only be obligated based on realized risks.Total Funding Requirements for NEON (Dollars in Millions) Prior Years1FY 2017 ActualFY 2018 RequestFY 2019 RequestESTIMATES 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024NEON Funding, by Stage (Dollars in Millions) Operations & Maintenance (R&RA) Implementation (MREFC) Note: $20.0 million in FY 2016 and million in FY 2017 was transferred from the R&RA account to the MREFC account for NEON Implementation. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 17 MREFC Project Plan NEON is the first research platform and the only national experimental facility specifically designed to collect consistent and standardized sensor and biological measurements across 81 sites nationwide. This was reduced from 106 sites following NSF's decision in FY 2015 to de -scope the project in order to prevent a potential $80.0 million cost overrun. Measu rements will enable basic research on complex phenomena driving ecological change and at the scales appropriate for studying many grand challenge questions in ecology. NEON allows researchers to expand the scale of their research to understand continental -scale dynamics affecting ecosystems. A NEON cyberinfrastructure gateway provides resources to support formal and informal public education and provide opportunities for citizens to participate in scientific investigations. NEON data are open- access via we b portals and available as soon as possible, once basic quality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied. NEON enables research on the impacts of climate and land use change, water use, and invasive species on the Nation's living ecosystems at temporal and spatial scales. NEON's unique statistically -determined, continental- scale design, with data products, data management, and standardization supports research on the dynamics of complex coupled systems needed for modeling and understanding rates of change on regional and continental scales. No other standalone system \u2014federal or private \u2014can provide the scientifically validated suite of data measurements that NEON will deliver . The scientific techniques, sensor data, and basic research knowledge gained through NEON will inform federal resource management decisions necessitated by climate and land use change, water use, and invasive species. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The NEON program is managed by the Division of Biological Inf rastructure (DBI) within BIO. Managing the NEON program in DBI helps foster its associations with other BIO facilities and infrastructure investments and its connections to broader biological and interdisciplinary science activities. Within BIO/DBI, a Science Advisor (working with division leadership) provides overall programmatic oversight for BIO's mid - and large -scale research infrastructure, while the day -to-day program management is done by dedicated cognizant program officers with assistance from a project manager experienced with other MREFC projects. The cognizant program officers for construction and operations coordinate the direct oversight of NEON construction, operations and maintenance, and science utilization. An NSF Integrated Project Team (I PT) chaired by the NEON program officers, with representatives from the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management which includes the Large Facility Office, the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, the Office of the Director, and program represen tatives from other NSF large facilities, helps ensure coordinated agency oversight to the project. The Office of the General Counsel provides ongoing technical advice on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance and NSF environmental policy a nd also has representation on the IPT. Additionally, NSF has initiated a forum for consultation with federal landowners at several NEON sites - the NEON Interagency Working Group (NIWG). External Structure: As of June 2016, the NEON project is managed by B attelle Memorial Institute, Inc. (Battelle), a non -profit, membership- governed corporation with extensive experience managing large research projects, government contracts, and related activities. R eviews Technical reviews: The NEON Observatory Design Rev iew (including site selection and deployment design) was successfully completed in February 2009. Environmental review: The NEPA environmental assessment was completed in November 2009. NSF signed a \"Finding of No Significant Impact\" in December 2009; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concurred with this finding, as well as with NSF's compliance with the Endangered Species Act. In Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 18 July 2011, the NSF Record of Decision was signed. NSF conducted a Readiness Review to assess Battelle's competence to assume m anagement of the NEON project in June of 2016. Construction, Cost, and Schedule reviews: In June 2015 the NEON, Inc. estimate to complete included a projected cost overrun of $80.0 million above the approved budget. A baseline Re- Scope Review was held in J uly 2015 to assess reductions in scope to bring the costs within the approved budget in accordance with NSF's \"No Cost Overrun\" policy. In July 2015, NSF directed NEON, Inc. to reduce the project scope and deliver revised project documents, construction schedule, and cost proposal to reflect the scope reduction. A revised proposal was submitted December 2015 which indicated the potential for an additional $19.0 million cost overrun and further schedule slip leading NSF to make its decision to transfer manag ement responsibility. An independent cost estimate (ICE) was obtained by NSF to support its internal cost analysis and award to the new managing organization. In June 2016 NSF conducted a site visit in order to review Battelle's readiness to assume full responsibility for the remaining construction and initial operations of the NEON Observatory. A Construction and Transition to Operations Review will be conducted in CY 2018. National Science Board (NSB) Review: The NSB reviewed and authorized NEON constru ction in May 2010 and authorized initial NEON Operations and Maintenance (O&M) in February 2013. In September 2015, it established an ad hoc Task Force on NEON Performance and Plans to review and monitor NSF's oversight of the project. In 2016, after review of a new construction cost proposal (including the ICE), Battelle's successful management of the project to -date, and the remaining project risks, the NSB authorized an increase in the total project cost from $433.7 9 million to $469.30 million. Management, Business, and Operations Reviews: NSF conducted a Business Systems Review and issued a final report in November 2011. An Operations Review of the project's operating plan and costs for the first three years of operations was held in January 2012. Beginning in May 2015, NSF conducted a series of site visits to work with NEON, Inc., on improving business systems including reporting capabilities, cost sufficiency and estimation, and supply chain issues including procurement and contracting. Delay s in construction have impacted rollout of operations by one year. With the transition to Battelle, an extension of the initial operations award is anticipated to allow the project to stabilize. An external review of an extension of the initial operations funding was held in February 2017 with an associated site visit in March 2017. A pre -award financial review of the cost proposal was conducted in FY 2017. An incurred cost review of the NEON, Inc. construction award will be conducted in FY 2019. Annual Operations Reviews will continue once construction is complete. P roject Status Ninety -three percent of the Observatory research capabilities have been achieved with one hundred percent capability planned to be completed by the fall of 2018. This includes construction for the remaining terrestrial locations and aquatic sites. In FY 2018, carryover MREFC funds will support completion of components of NEON's assignable assets . This includes completion of the third Airborne Operations Platform (AOP3) and the Mobile Deployment Platforms (MDPs) . Scope Management and De-scoping: Delays in permitting of selected sites, cyberinfrastructure development, and procurements signaled the potential for significant construction cost overruns. Estimates FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 19 received in June 2015 prompted NSF to assemble leaders from the science community to assess possible scoping strategies for maintaining the project with the approved budget in accordance with NSF's no cost overrun policy. A major objective of the meeting was to ensure the delivered Observatory would still enable the transformative regional to continental science as framed in the original NEON Science Strategy. This decision to de -scope was confirmed by the NSF/BIO Advisory Committee. De -scoping decisions were finali zed and implemented in late July 2015. In FY 2018, $65.0 million was requested from the R&RA account to support NEON's operations and maintenance. The initial operations award, to NEON, Inc., that began in FY 2014 was transferred to Battelle in June 2016. Following NSB authorization, NSF has awarded additional funding for three years, which will take operations into FY 2020, allowing Battelle time to identify project efficiencies, minimize costs, and maximize science delivery. Final costs for observatory O &M will be determined on the basis of these management efforts and analyses. Cost and Schedule The original projected length of the construction stage was six fiscal years, with six -months of schedule contingency included. Under Battelle's management, the planned project end date is now estimated as the fall of CY 2018 and the TPC has been re -established as described above. Roughly 88 percent of the approved project funds for construction have been spent, with Observatory capability at approximately 93 percent complete. Focused management by Battelle and oversight by NSF continues to be rigorously implemented in an effort to keep the project within budget and on schedule. Risks Technical : While the bulk of NEON's infrastructure and instrumentation will be \"commercial off -the- shelf,\" NEON's scientific and networking design required certain technological innovations for a small number of components. Consequently, BIO has provided R&RA funds for advanced research and development activities in the areas of sen sors, cyberinfrastructure, and remote sensing technology. These development activities are progressing and risks to schedule are being monitored. Technical risk is considered low at this point in construction. Deployment : Environmental assessment and permitting continues to have a n impact on schedule. Risk mitigation strategies include the direct contracting of the environmental assessments by NSF, the hiring of experienced, national firms by Battelle for engineering and permitting, and the identificat ion of alternative sites if primary sites still hold significant risk. All environmental compliance activities are actively underway and nearing resolution. Management : Management risk has been mitigated by NSF based on the decision to replace NEON, Inc. with Battelle. The transition to new management is an inherently risky proposition but was necessary in this case. Battelle continues to work closely with NSF oversight personnel to clearly communicate process, standards, timelines, costs, and expectations. Future Operations Costs NEON is the first research observatory that will maintain and operate in -situ instrumentation and conduct biological sampling in 20 domains (81 locations) including three airborne observatories, a central operating facility, and a cyberinfrastructure center. Field support will be provided to monitor the sensors, and receive, process, and archive data from all measurement systems. NEON operations include significant labor costs due to the manual processes still required for biologi cal sampling and data collection in some fields. NEON is reliant on sensors and cyberinfrastructure that have a defined lifecycle, so operations costs include scheduled replacement and refreshing of sensor, instrumentation, and cyberinfrastructure technology. Operations activities and associated costs will ramp up as sites are commissioned and the planned relocation of sites within domains is considered. Battelle is accelerating the transition of infrastructure to operations Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 20 whenever possible to appropriate ly manage construction costs. A three -year initial award for O&M began September 2014 to allow NEON, Inc. to explore opportunities for schedule and cost efficiencies and provide a basis for funding the full Observatory operations during out-years. This aw ard was transferred to Battelle in FY 2016. An extension of the initial operating period through FY 2019 under Battelle was authorized and awarded to allow the project to stabilize prior to re - competition. For FY 2019, O&M funding will be $65.0 million. NEON will be a collaborative research platform of geographically distributed infrastructure connected via the latest information technology. By combining in -situ sensing with remote sensing observations, NEON will address pressing environmental questions on r egional to continental scales. Credit: NSF.

How are the coastal and estuarine ocean and their ecosystems in fluenced by the global hydrologic cycle, land use, and upwelling from the deep ocean? 3. How have ocean biogeochemical and physical processes contributed to today's climate and its variability, and how will this system change over the next century? 4. What is th e role of biodiversity in the resilience of marine ecosystems and how will it be affected by natural and anthropogenic changes? 5. How different will marine food webs be at mid-century? In the next 100 years? 6. What are the processes that control the formation and evolution of ocean basins? 7. How can risk be better characterized and the ability to forecast geohazards like mega -earthquakes, tsunamis, undersea landslides, and volcanic eruptions be improved? 8. What is the geophysical, chemical, and biological character of the subseafloor environment and how does it affect global elemental cycles and understanding of the origin and evolution of life? Baseline History The RCRV project is a major component in the plan for modernizing the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF) . 6 In 2001, a report from the Federal Oceanographic Facilities Committee documented the need for Regional Class vessels. In 2004, NSF and the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) entered into an interagency agreement that resulted in two candidate designs fo r Regional Class ships. In 2007, the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report identified the need for NSF -built Regional Class vessels to meet future science demand. In 2009, another National Academies report, Science at Sea, described the desirable characteristics of a modern Regional Class vessel. These characteristics and other science community factors were considered by the review panel when the preferred NAVSEA design was later down- selected. In 2012, NSF issued a solicitation for the refreshed desig n and potential construction of RCRV. Oregon State University (OSU) was selected and received the award in 2013. Input from external review panels, the University -National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and the NAS Sea Change report, was received during the period 2013 to 2015 and informed the final decision to pursue construction.

The principal investigator for the award is the project manager (PM), who reports directly to the OSU Dean of the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences. The PM interacts directly with NSF and manages the RCRV administrative staff. The project scientist is a co- Principal Investigator on the award. The PM manages the core RCRV team including the risk manager, earned value management and schedule specialist, contracting officer, and OSU shipyard representative (SR). The SR in turn manages the naval architect and engineering contract and oversees the OSU shipyard staff, and marine science technical advisors. The RCRV Science Oversight Committee (SOC) with regional representation, multidisciplinary expertise, and independent science representatives conducting resear ch in mission areas supported by stakeholder federal agencies (e.g., NSF, Office of Naval Research, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be active through all project phases. The SOC provides guidance to the OSU RCRV project team th rough the PM and/or the NSF program officer. Reviews Proposal Review: In 2012, NSF issued Solicitation 12- 558, Construction of Regional Class Research Vessels, to select a lead institution for construction and ship operations . An NSF external review panel was convened to evaluate three proposals, and OSU was selected. Interim Design Review (IDR): Although an Interim Design Review was not required by NSF, OSU hosted its own IDR on July 23- 25, 2013, in Corvallis, OR. NSF program staff assessed the OSU projec t team performance and concluded the IDR followed closely the NSF requirements, and used the R/V Sikuliaq example, as appropriate, to craft the RCRV Project Execution Plan (PEP). Both the design and the PEP were well -developed at this pre -Conceptual Design Review phase; particularly the organizational structure, work breakdown structure (WBS), risk management, and configuration and contingency management. Conceptual Design Review (CDR): CDR was conducted December 3 -5, 2013, at NSF Headquarters in Arlington, VA. The NSF program staff concurred with the panel's conclusion that the Project Execution Plan and Technical Design Package met, and in some cases exceeded, the requirements of the Conceptual Design Phase. Preliminary Design Review (PDR): PDR was conduct ed August 5- 7, 2014, at NSF Headquarters. The panel found that the Project Execution Plan and the technical design package were both well-developed to support a future budget request and recommended that the project proceed to the Final Design Phase. Post-PDR Reconciliation: Following PDR, in response to the panel recommendations and NSF program staff direction, OSU incorporated modifications to the design and revised their estimated pro ject costs and schedule accordingly. The NSB was presented with the pos t-PDR Project baseline as the basis for their authorization to request funding for RCRV in future budget requests. Acquisition Strategy Review: A review of all aspects of the shipyard selection process was held in February 2016, at NSF. NSF directed OSU to make minor revisions to the Request for Proposals (RFP) based on the review. Interim Design Review: A second IDR was held by OSU in May 2016. Although not required, the value of the previous IDR for improvement to the technical package and the Project Execution Plan was sufficient that another IDR to prepare for FDR was warranted. The review was hosted by the RCRV Project Team in Corvallis, OR, and attended by NSF program staff as well as the RCRV SOC. The SOC provided minor technical improvements to the RCRV, which were incorporated into the RFP. Final Design Review (FDR): The FDR was held in December 2016 to ensure that anticipated project costs remained realistic and that no unforeseen events had arisen prior to the start of construction during FY 2017. Several members of the PDR panel also participated in the FDR. Like CDR and PDR, FDR was conducted in compliance with NSF's Large Facilities Manual. The FDR Panel recommended to NSF that the project was ready to advance to the Construction Stage. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 24 Project Status As stated above, NSF selected OSU as the lead institution. A cooperative agreement was awarded to encompass the entire project, including tests and trials. The project is divided into four distinct phases , each to be funded through separate cooperat ive support agreements, with award of each phase contingent upon successful completion of the prior phase. These phases are: Phase I: Project Refresh (Years one to three) Phase II: Shipyard Selection (Year four) Phase III: Construction (Years five through eight ) Phase IV: Transition to Operations (Years eight and nine) The project completed Phase II in CY 2017, during which bids for construction of RCRV were solicited and eva luated from U.S. shipyards. The Phase III construction award with OSU has been made . Total funding to OSU for RCRV through FY 2017 is $11.39 million in R&RA funds and $121 .88 million in MREFC funds. The remaining required funding for the construction of two ships is $105.0 million in FY 2018 and $28.70 in FY 2019 f or a total of $255.58 million in MREFC funding . Cost and Schedule The length of the project is projected to be eight fiscal years, including nine -months of schedule contingency. Funding for the construction of RCRV over FY 2017, FY 2018, and FY 2019 supports the shipyard contract structure . One significant enhancement to NSF oversight is holding a portion of budget contingency (up to 100 percent) and only allocating to the program, for obligation to the project, based on demonstrated need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carry over each year, however, future obligation is anticipated to manage project risks. Risks Technical : The following technical risks are among the principal risks that were identified and listed on OSU's project risk register. Planned mitigation strategies are included here with each identified risk. (1) Various situations may occur that could delay or add cost to OSU's management portion of the project. These include delayed appointments of key personnel , contracting issues, lack of management capacity due to optimistic planning, or misunderstanding of requirements. (2) Sonar sensors, science load handling systems, and other vessel sub -systems may also not perform as required. Contingency funds are includ ed to ensure performance capabilities are met, given that many warranties are not likely to be performance- based or be otherwise limited contractually with the shipyard. (3) Growth in weight and vertical center of gravity may require design changes in order to ensure vessel seaworthiness. This is a typical risk for ship construction (and research vessels in particular) that will require active management by OSU and the shipyard, as well as oversight by NSF, such that the ship can operate safely and effectiv ely. A science prioritized, time -phased de -scoping plan is in place (per NSF Large Facilities Manual, NSF17 -066) to minimize impact s to science capabilities in case contingency funds are insufficient to cover realized risks. Future Operations Costs Annual ship operations costs are well understood after several decades of experience with vessels of all types in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. OSU understands how to estimate future costs given their experience operating vessels similar to RCRV, such as R/V Wecoma and R/V Oceanus. OSU included an estimate for the first year of operations beginning in 2021 using reasonable assumptions for escalations through 2020. They also assumed a robust but reasonable operating schedule of 200 days per year. OSU estimates RCRV will cost $6.10 million to operate in its first year, resulting in a rate of $30,441 per day, including technician support. This is comparable to the operation of current similar vessels after applying the appropriate cost escalation factors for size and complexity. NSF supports approximately 70 percent of FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 25 the u se of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, which suggests RCRV is likely to cost NSF approximately $4.30 million in FY 2022, which is the first year the lead ship transitions into full operations in the ARF. A solicitation for operations of additional vessels beyond the first RCRV operated by OSU was released in January 2018. Artist's rendition of the RCRV as constructed.

As part of its Agency Reform Plan, NSF will initiate operational reforms in four areas in FY 2019: (1) make information technology work for us, (2) align NSF's workforce and work, (3) expand public and private partnerships, and (4) streamline, standardize, and simplify programs and processes. NSF will work to ensure that IT tools enhance employee productivity and satisfaction by enabling access to readily available, reliable, and fully integrated data that supports decision making. NSF will also invest an additional $4.0 million in IT modernization. NSF will optimize the align ment of staffing and position descriptions with the changing landscape. NSF will maintain its already lean workforce through continuous improvements in personnel training and utilization, and through effective performance management. NSF will improve efficiencies in developing, implementing, and managing partnerships that maximize the scientific, economic, and societal impacts of its investments. NSF will also revise policies and business processes to increase standardization across NSF organizations and eliminate unnecessary complexity. These Agency reforms will allow NSF to continue to achieve its mission within a constantly evolving landscape in alignment with NS F's history of continued organizational improvement, and the Administration's government -wide agency reform activities.

In addition to providing institutional memory for the Board, the Board Office staff provides both the resources and expertise for coordinating and conducting science and education policy analyses and development and implementing broad communication and outreach programs. Staff also advise the Board on legal aspects of its policies and activities and provides operational and administrative support that are essential for the Board to fulfill its mission. Other Operating Expenses The Board's Advisory and Assistance Services budget line includes some of the resources needed to produce policy reports such as Indicators . Over the past several years, the Board has heightened its efforts to increase the accessibility of Indicators and to facilitate the use of Indicators data in policy decisions and analysis through the creation of interactive digital products. (The next edition of Indicators is scheduled for delivery to Congress in January 2018.) In addition, some of the Board's reports require expert support from National Science Board NSB - 4 organizations such as the Science and Technology Policy Institute, a federally -funded research and development center supported by NSF. Other items in the Advisory and Assistance Services line support NSB document management, including maintenance of an electronic official records management system, which enables compliance with federal records requirements; th e efficient search, identification, and retrieval of relevant documents for reference and research purposes; the webcasting and archiving of all open Board meetings and transcription services; and a boar d management software, which facilitates effective and efficient NSB meetings. NSB's Travel and Transportation of Persons budget line primarily covers Board member travel costs to NSF headquarters for the Board's four annual meetings and a member -only ret reat, travel for invited speakers and participants in Board activities, and community engagement activities organized by the Board , such as listening sessions designed to improve responsiveness to the concerns and priorities of the S&E community. Most recently, the Board organized listening sessions in Louisiana to explore the challenges and opportunities with the Skilled Technical Workforce and with Women and Underrepresented Minorities in STEM. Past NSB listening sessions have led to significant policy recommendations, such as those included in the Board's Reducing Investigators' Administrative Workload for Federally Funded Research report. Also supported in this budget line is Board member trav el to site visits in support of NSB's oversight of NSF's large programs and facilities. The Communications, Supplies, and Equipment budget line funds the range of electronic purchases, upgrades and installations of equipment such as computers. The FY 2019 Budget Request will facilitate the continued thoughtful enhancement of the Board's efforts to strengthen the U.S. S&E enterprise through its policy and information- related activities. Specifically, the Request will support the NSB's continued engagement w ith stakeholders \u2014including Congress, the Administration, academia, the business community, and the general public \u2014to better understand their diverse needs. In turn, this will help the NSB (and NCSES) improve the usefulness of the resources it produces, ens uring that these stakeholders continue to have access to timely, comprehensible, and objective S&E data and policy guidance. OIG - 1 OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL (OIG) $15,345,000 +$248,000 / 1.6% The Appropriations Act that funds the National Science Foundation provides for a separate appropriation for NSF's Office of Inspector General (OIG). Accordingly, this FY 2019 Budget Request identifies the resources needed to support OIG, including amounts for personnel compensation and benefits (PC&B), contract services, training, travel, supplies, materials, and equipment. The FY 2019 Budget Request for OIG is $15.35 million, a n increase of $248,000 from the FY 2017 Actual of CRFY 2019 RequestOffice of Inspector General Funding (Dollars in Millions) Appropriations Language For necessary expenses of the Office of Inspector General as authorized by the Inspector General Act of 1978, $15,008,000 $15,345,000, of which $400,000 shall remain available until September Appropriation FY 2018 Annualized from FY 2018 Annualized CRObligations Actual/ Estimates(Dollars 2019 Summary StatementOffice of Inspector General Enacted/ RequestUnobligated Balance Available Start of YearUnobligated Balance Available End of YearAdjustments to Prior Year Accounts Explanation of Carryover Within the Office of Inspector General (OIG) two -year account, $392,372 was carried over into FY 2018. Office of the Inspector General Amount: $392,372 Reason: Funds are expected to be used to procure financia l and forensi c audit services. The selection of awards and institutions to be audited will require careful preparation and is subject to changing circumstances and new information that may require additional time to process. Obligation: Anticipated FY 2018 Quarter 4 Office of Inspector General OIG - 2 OIG Responsibilities In February 1989, the National Science Board established OIG pursuant to the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988. The statute confers on OIG the responsibility and authority to: Conduct and supervise audits of NSF programs and operations, including organizations that receive NSF funding; Conduct investigations of civil and criminal wrongdoing related to NSF programs and operations, including all entities and individuals that receive NSF funds; Evaluate allegations of research misconduct, such as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, related to NSF-funded research; Provide leadership, coordination, and policy recommendations for: Promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of NSF programs and operations, and Preventing and detecting fraud and abuse in NSF programs and operations; Keep both agency management and Congress fully and currently informed about problems, recommended corrective actions, and progress being made in improving the management and conduct of NSF programs, to include the issuance of a Semiannual Report to Congress. OIG performs audits of grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements funded by NSF's programs; and conducts audits and reviews of both internal agency progr ams and external organizations that receive NSF funding to ensure that financial, administrative, and programmatic activities are conducted economically, effectively, and in compliance with agency and federal requirements. OIG oversees the audit of NSF's annual financial statements, which are required for all NSF accounts and activities by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994. Audit work mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), and the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) is also performed annually. OIG also audits the systems used by NSF to prepare the financial statements. In addition, the office performs multi- disciplinary reviews \u2014involving auditors, attorneys, management analysts, investigators, scientists, and others as needed \u2014of financial, management, and program operations to identify broader problems and highlight best practices. OIG is vested with law enforcement authority a nd investigates possible wrongdoing by organizations and individuals who seek or receive NSF funds such as those who submit proposals to, receive awards from, conduct business with, or perform work for NSF. Allegations of research misconduct by NSF recipie nts are also investigated. OIG assesses the validity and seriousness of all the allegations it receives to determine whether or not to pursue legal or administrative action. When appropriate, the office refers the results of these investigations to the Dep artment of Justice or other authorities for criminal prosecution, civil litigation, or resolution via settlement agreements and institutional compliance plans. OIG refers some cases to NSF for administrative resolution and when indicated will recommend modifications to agency policies and procedures to ensure the integrity of NSF's business systems. OIG works closely with institutions on their internal research misconduct investigations and regularly engages in activities aimed at preventing and detecting f raud, waste, and abuse; and at raising the awareness of funded researchers, institutional administrators, and agency employees about OIG's role and NSF's rules and expectations. Because diverse skills, training, and experience are necessary to oversee NS F's many programs, the OIG staff includes scientists, attorneys, certified public accountants, criminal investigators, management analysts, evaluators, and information technology specialists. The subjects of investigations, audits, and other reviews are al so varied and may include: an individual grant recipient or institution; a broad program or functional area of NSF; or a project involving multiple disciplines or entities. In addition, the OIG utilizes FY 2019 NSF Bu dget Request to Congress OIG - 3 contractors to perform work when it is cost effective , or when it lacks the necessary expertise in -house, as in the case of the annual audit of the agency's financial statements and annual review of its compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA).

OIG's appropriation is just 0.2 percent of NSF's, and serves as a safeguard against waste, fraud, and abuse within the agency's 42,000 active awards worth more than $28.0 billion. Between FY 2013 and FY 2017, OIG has sustained an increase in its average cost per FTE of 19.4 percent, as personnel costs and benefits have increased more than expected, and professionals such as lawyers, investigators and CPAs have replaced administrative staff. The office strives to maintain a workforce of at least 68 -71 FTEs to carry out our most critical responsibilities. As our current workforce ages, new hires are critical to revitalizing our workforce and are carefully vetted for technical skills along with their potential to assume more senior management responsibilities as they progress. Currently, approximately 24 percent of our staff (mostly managers) are eligible to retire. Beyond its annual payment of dues, OIG has made outsized contributions to the Inspector General community and the government at large through its leadership in the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). The NSF Inspector General has served as the CIGIE Vice Chair since 2014, and as such helped lead the community as it supported the passage of the Inspector General Empowerment Act. NSF OIG has also played a leading role in founding and running two working groups aimed at raising awareness within the IG community about: preventing fraud within the SBIR/STTR programs; and using government -wide suspension and debarment as tools to deter and reduce instances of fraud, waste and abuse. In addition, NSF OIG led a working group with representatives from OIGs at over 20 grant -making agencies that provided valuable feedback to OMB as it worked to combine eight grant - related circulars into the Uniform Guidance. Economy and Efficiency of Operations . For context, in operating a lean, efficient organization, the NSF Office of Inspector General practices the principles it espouses in its reports. In recent years OIG has Office of Inspector General OIG - 4 reduced its senior leadership team from five to four, and devolved senior level administrative responsibilities to lower graded staff, saving $220,000 per year. The Assistant Inspector General for Investigations doubles as Chief Information Officer, saving yet another FTE. In addition, OIG streamlined its administrative unit, electing to re -allocate as many FTEs as possible to line staff that directly perform audits and investigations. Funding for \"upstream\" preventive activities, such as educating researchers about rules and requirements associated with federal grants, is reduced from previous years in order to ensure that adequate resources are available for more urgent audits and investigations that will have greater effect. Investments in equipment and technology upgrades (e.g., expansion of our data analytics capability for Audits and Investigations) are pursued only if a per suasive business case can be made. The Office of Audits (OA) and Office of Investigations (OI) have each recently reorganized themselves to better align their activities with their mission. For example, OA recently reduced the number of audit divisions fr om five to three, while OI streamlined the intake and handling of Hotline calls to respond more rapidly to information from whistleblowers and others. Both offices recently invested in new systems that automate many of the steps involved in the production and recordkeeping of their reviews and cases. This has significantly reduced the number of support staff and storage space (for paper records) needed in each office. They have also revised their respective operations manuals to implement work processes tha t improve efficiency and reduce errors in OIG final products. Other cost saving measures include: Outsourced OIG contracting services to the Department of Interior in order to maintain independence from the agency in the contracting arena (an area subject to oversight). Outsourcing this function was more cost effective than hiring a contracting officer. Eliminated two student positions that saved $80,000. Reorganized front office to increase the IG's capacity to focus on higher level strategic matters. Office of Counsel conducts thorough reviews of all reports and contracts to identify potential legal issues at the earliest possible time and prevent costly re -work and unintended consequences. Manage and track required professional training on -line through the use of a third party provider to reduce the cost of obtaining Continuing Professional Education credits. Expanded use of SharePoint collaborative platform to provide staff with one virtual location for most OIG information, and enable them to work more efficiently. Utilized high speed scanners to upload paper evidence thereby reducing time spent copying, handling, and storing voluminous files. Increased reliance on WebEx and other teleconferencing technologies to reduce travel costs. OIG's bottom line results demonstrate its effectiveness. In just the past two fiscal years, OA has issued 78 audit reports with over $16.0 million in questioned costs. During the same period, OI secured $16.60 million in investigative recoveries. Office of Audits (OA) . The Office of Audit conducts audits and reviews of NSF's finances and operations that are either mandated by statute or discretionary. Audit work required by statute has grown in recent years from auditing NSF's financial statements and compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), to reviewing compliance with new legislation, such as the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), and the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act). The universe of potential topics for discretionary audits is large, consisting of about 42,000 active awards worth $28.0 billion and all of NSF's internal programs and operations. Historically, the OA audit plan includes about 40 discretionary audits. FY 2019 NSF Bu dget Request to Congress OIG - 5 Much of our recent discretionary audit work has focused on NSF's construction and management of its large facilities. Since 2010, OIG has issued 59 reports containing more than 149 recommendations to improve NSF's use and management of cooperative agreements for the const ruction and operation of its high-dollar, high- risk research facilities. As a direct result of these reports, NSF has adopted new policies and procedures to strengthen its monitoring of large facilities. NSF frequently funds the development of large -scale, multiuser scientific facilities through federal assistance awards under cooperative agreements. As of July 2017, NSF supports a broad array of 23 major research facilities, which individually cost between $100.0 million and $500.0 million each to construc t. As of January 2017, NSF had 459 active cooperative agreements totaling nearly $8.0 billion. Twenty -two of these agreements are valued at over $50.0 million each and add up cumulatively to more than $4.40 billion over the lifecycle of the facilities. This audit work will help strengthen the Foundation's ability to ensure grant and procurement funds are not wasted by improper expenditures and mismanagement. Strong controls, as well as increased oversight by additional OIG staff, will help ensure NSF obt ains critical assets and services necessary to meet its missions in a declining budget environment. For example, construction is ongoing for the $469.0 million National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a continental -scale observation system for exam ining ecological change over time. Beginning in 2011, auditors identified serious flaws in NEON's proposed construction budget and issued three inadequacy memos along with an adverse opinion on the proposed budget. Within the proposal, OIG found $154.0 million in questioned and unsupported costs (approximately 36 percent of the total budget). Our concerns about NEON's finances were validated in June 2015 when NEON management informed NSF that the project was facing a potential cost overrun of $80.0 million. Similar issues surfaced during OIG's review of proposed costs for the $467.70 million Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). NSF generally spends significantly more on operating its facilities than it does on constructing them. NSF requested over $193.0 million for fiscal year 2017 to pay for four large facility construction projects. In contrast, NSF's operation and maintenance request for its existing large facilities for the same period was over $1.0 billion. We have recently initiated a review that focuses on the risk of commingling construction and operations funds. Ensuring that strong controls exist over the use of such funds is vital, as use of operations funds for construction work can hide cost overruns and deplete funding needed for the operati ons phase. OIG will also monitor the actions NSF takes in response to requirements in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, which mandates several important controls to be applied in the development of NSF's large facilities projects. OIG audit s have also led NSF to pay more attention to the amounts it pays scientists, engineers, and educators who come to NSF under Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) assignments. Individuals on IPA appointments remain employees of their home institutions. Thus , pay and benefits for IPAs are set by their home institutions and are not subject to limitations on federal pay and benefits. Additionally, in FY 2018 and beyond OIG will monitor the design, construction, and ongoing capital investment and support of NSF 's major initiative known as the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science, or AIMS. According to NSF, the AIMS project will ensure that McMurdo Station remains a viable platform for supporting Antarctic science for the next 35 to 50 years. This new major initiative, as well as ongoing support for the U.S. Antarctic Program, will be accomplished through a series of large contracts. Office of Investigations (OI) . The NSF Office of Investigations was vested with law enforcement authority by the Department of Justice in 2012. OI's staff of 21 line investigators are divided into three units and cover the entire spectrum of investigative functions. The Research Integrity/Admin Investigations (RIA) division is primarily responsible for investigating all egations of Research Misconduct (RM) and personnel misconduct within NSF. Staff from this unit also serve as our principal liaison to the research community, Office of Inspector General OIG - 6 through the conduct of organized outreach events, consultations on referred RM investigations, and participation in professional scientific associations and interagency RM working groups. Our Program Integrity (PI) division is primarily responsible for investigating allegations of civil and criminal wrongdoing. They also serve as our principal liaiso n to the federal OIG and law enforcement communities, as well as to federal and state prosecuting authorities. They perform this liaison through leadership of, and participation in, numerous formal and informal working groups and through direct outreach to particular elements of those communities. The Investigative Legal (IL) division works with both RIA and PI in the successful accomplishment of investigations, liaison activities, and outreach to both the government and science communities. IL is also responsible for liaison with formal and informal federal working groups assembled to craft, refine, and educate the IG community on the tools available to identify, deter, and remedy fraud against the government. Such working groups have focused on the Progr am Fraud Civil Remedies Act and Suspension & Debarment (a mechanism that prevents irresponsible parties from receiving federal funds). The work of OIG's Office of Investigations serves as an important deterrent to grant fraud and research misconduct. OI consistently contributes much more than its cost to the government's bottom line. Between FY 2009 and FY 2016, OI recovered almost $35.0 million for the government. In FY 2016 alone, our 21 line investigators recovered $8,926,748, an average of $441,966 per investigator, approximately three times their average salaries. OI's workload has increased in recent years due primarily to growth in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) cases. Our proactive efforts generated over 175 SBIR/STTR -related cases, while the number of awards has increased from 599 to 715 (an increase of almost 20 percent) over three years. Addressing OIG's \"prevent\" mission, OI has successfully partnered with NSF program managers to improve the processes and procedures surrounding the SBIR/STTR program in a manner that greatly reduces the opportunity to fraudulently abuse these important programs. Through its leadership of the SBIR Working Group, OI has also shared those opportunities for proc ess and policy improvements with other OIGs at SBIR- award making agencies. Despite its relatively small size, OI's activities consistently benefit the federal government far beyond NSF. The Assistant IG for Investigations (AIGI) has been Chair of the CIGI E AIGI Committee for the past two years. In that role, he plans and presides over quarterly meetings that gather AIGIs and IGs from all 73 agency OIGs. In addition, OI's staff have produced, and annually updates, a digest of successfully prosecuted grant f raud cases. This has been used by civil and criminal Assistant United States Attorneys across the country to facilitate prosecutions of individuals who have defrauded grant -funding agencies and/or the SBIR/STTR set aside programs. In FY 2017, OI hosted i ts fifth Suspension and Debarment Workshop. These free events (which are now co-sponsored by the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Council) have trained hundreds of individuals from OIGs, Suspension and Debarment Offices, Offices of General Counsel and United States Attorney's Offices. As a result of these workshops, several agencies that were not previously using suspensions or debarments to protect federal funds have begun to do so, and agencies that were using these critical tools have strengthened th eir practices and identified more robust ways to protect federal funds. OIG Support Functions . Most office- wide support functions fall under the executive leadership of an Assistant Inspector General (who also serves as OIG's Legal Counsel) and are functionally encompassed within two operating units\u2014an immediate office and a management division. Immediate office functions comprise those that have historically worked together, but which were formerly FY 2019 NSF Bu dget Request to Congress OIG - 7 aligned under the direct supervision of the Inspector General \u2014legal, legislative/congressional, and external affairs (including public/media contacts). The staff also actively supports government -wide projects in which NSF OIG has taken a leadership role, such as increasing the use and effectiveness of suspen sion and debarment remedies to protect taxpayer funds. Besides providing comprehensive legal advice, counsel, and critical analysis (including review of all audit and inspection reports) to the IG and all OIG divisions, the legal activity also administers financial disclosure requirements for OIG staff; performs certain functions related to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts; represents the office in external forums; and also enables the office to engage in proactive efforts (such as training and routine reviews) to help OIG staff recognize and deal with legal concerns as early as possible. OIG's management/administrative arm is responsible for performing strategic planning/budgeting, procurement, human resources, and administrative support and is currently comprised of just three staff. Functional alignment of the two areas under a single executive subordinate to the IG has saved money and afforded some synergistic benefits to the organization. No additions to staff in FY 2019 are contemplated. To assure that there are adequate resources available for our core mission of audits and investigations, support functions across the OIG have been streamlined to the maximum extent practical. Information Technology . Spending on hardware, software, and I T services is expected to remain at a reduced level through FY 2019. OIG plans to reduce its costs for computers and printers by lengthening their replacement cycle and phasing out the use of desktop printers.

These include major multi -user research facilities such as instrumentation networks, observatories, accelerators, detectors, telescopes, research vessels, aircraft, and simulators. In addition, investments in cyber -enabled and geographically distributed user facilities are increasing as a result of rapid advances in computer, information, and communication technologies. NSF's investments are coordinated with those of other organizati ons, federal agencies, and international partners to ensure they are complementary and well integrated. Planning, operations, and maintenance of major multi -user facilities are funded through the R&RA account. Most construction is funded through the MREFC account. An exception to this is the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) construction project, funded through R&RA. In FY 2018, NSF created the new position of Chief Officer for Research Facilities in the Office of the Director, to e nhance oversight of major multi -user research facilities throughout their complete lifecycle. The individual in that position serves as the senior agency official whose responsibility is oversight of the development, construction, and operations of major m ulti-user research facilities across the Foundation, as required by Section 110 of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114-329). This chapter provides descriptions of each major multi -user research facility supported through the R&RA account and provides funding information by life cycle phase for each facility. The information presented for each facility follows the overall framework established by NSF for major facility projects. Information on projects under construction funded through NSF's MREFC account is provided in the MREFC chapter.

In addition to operations, OCE has undertaken selected construction projects based on inter -agency planning and coordination as discussed in the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report1 published in May 2013. Details on these construction activities are contained in the Fleet Modernization section. FY 2020 FY 2021 $77.80 Fleet Modernization Regional Class Research Vessel 2.11 - - - - - - - Total $84.14 - $77.80 $77.80 $77.80 $77.80 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES ARF serves as the main platform for the collection of data, testing of hypotheses about the structure and dynamics of the ocean, and the development and testing of novel technological instrumentation. Scientists contribute to advances in many areas including climate variability, marine ecosystems, fisheries, and ocean - related natural hazards, such as tsunamis, through use of these facilities. Participating graduate and undergraduate students interact with scientists and marine technicians, enabling them to gain first -hand exposure to ocean science field research. Increasingly, technological innovations allow research conducted at sea to be transmitted via satellite back to the classroom, broadening the educational impact of the vessels. ARF is financially supported through an interagency partnership, principally with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the National Oceanic and Atmospher ic Administration (NOAA). The operating costs for the fleet are divided proportionally among the vessel users based on usage over the past several years, including the Ocean Observatories Initiative's use of the fleet. NSF coordinates with ship -operating a nd ship- user academic institutions both directly and through the University -National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) organizational structure. 1 www.nopp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/federal_oceanographic_fleet_status_report.pdf FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 5 Funding for scientists using the fleet is provided by NSF and other federal and state agencies. Within NSF, science is funded through competitive peer -reviewed proposals, most typically funded within OCE and through selected programs in the Division of Earth Sciences, Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, OPP, and BIO. Approximately 25 percent of OCE proposals request ship time. Not reflected in this number is the science that utilizes samples or data collected on prior cruises, scientists piggy -backing on scheduled cruises to accomplish additional science, international scientists sailing with the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, and science funded by other agencies. The FY 2019 funding level of $77.80 million will support approximately 1,675 ship operating days, and includes the entry of R/V Neil Armstrong and R/V Sally Ride , the two new vessels delivered by ONR in 2016 into the fleet. Fleet Operations/Management and Oversight O versight: NSF provides oversight to the Academic Research Fleet through cooperative agreements with each ship -operating institution and through a separate cooperative agr eement with the UNOLS Office. NSF is the cognizant agency for ship day -rate negotiations for ARF, regardless of owner. In addition, NSF oversees the fleet through Business Systems Reviews, site visits, ship inspections, and participation at the UNOLS Council and various c ommittee meetings by NSF program directors. Several program directors within OCE at NSF, at NOAA, and at ONR are involved in the activities and oversight of the Academic Research Fleet. After an in -depth review of the application of rate st ructures on ARF ship -related activities, NSF and ONR are in the process of transitioning the accounting of Fleet activities into a Specialized Service Facility in accordance with OMB's Uniform Guidance for Federal Awards 2 CFR 200.468. Management: Management of an institution's ship- operating facilities varies with the scale of the operation, but the core responsibility typically resides with the d irector of the institution, the Marine Superintendent (for all aspects of the facility), and the ship's Captain (for at -sea operations). For larger multi-ship- operating institutions, a Chief of Marine Technicians, schedulers, and finance administrators may also be involved in facility management. Reviews: Based on projected science requirements identified in recent reports and workshops, a fleet of vessels supporting ocean science and technological research will be needed far into the future. Documents supporting this need include the Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force 2 of July 19, 2010. Two applicable reports by the National Research Council (NRC) include Science at Sea: Meeting Future Oceanographic Goals with a Robust Academic Research Fleet3 published in 2009, and Critical Infrastructure for Ocean Research and Societal Needs in 20304 published in 2011. In coordination with UNOLS and the other federal agencies that invest in ocean research, the Interagency Working Group on Facilities and Infrastructure (IWG -FI) published a Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report5 in May 2013, reviewing the status and describing plans for modernizing the Federal Oceanographic Fleet, which includes both the Academic Research Fleet and the survey ships. This repor t was updated in March of 2016. 6 In January 2015, the National Academy of Sciences Report Sea Change 2015 -2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences7 identified the U.S. Academic Research Fleet as having \"the strongest match between current infrastructure and the decadal science priorities\" and emphasized the overall importance of ships in all of the N AS-identified ocean science and technology priorities. Ship operations and technical services proposals undergo external review by peers every five years. Detailed annual reports describing activities accomplished are provided by the operating institutions and budgets are negotiated yearly since they are dependent on 2 https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/files/documents/OPTF_FinalRecs.pdf 3 Research Facilities Facilities - 6 the number of days the ships will be at sea in support of NSF -funded research programs. F leet Modernization Oversight: The NSF coordinator for fleet modernization activities is the Program Director for Ship and Submersible Support, within the Integrative Programs Section (IPS) in OCE, with additional IPS staff providing project management assistance as required. Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV): In March 2012, NSF leadership approved th e request to advance the RCRV to the Conceptual Design Review (CDR) phase as a candidate Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project. Initial funds to initiate construction were requested in FY 2017. The RCRV will address requireme nts across government agencies for research vessels in support of ocean science research as discussed in the Fleet Status Report Update of 2016. For additional information on RCRV please refer to the MREFC chapter. R/V Sikuliaq , formerly the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV): The R/V Sikuliaq represents NSF's first major contribution to fleet renewal in over twenty years. Delivery of R/V Sikuliaq took place in June 2014. This was followed by a period of final outfitting, science trials, and transit to the first science operational area. Initial science operations began in late 2014. R/V Sikuliaq successfully completed ice trials in the Bering Sea and three science cruises in the Arctic Ocean. All final MREFC project activities were closed out under budget by March 31, 2016. R/V Sikuliaq provides a sophisticated and significantly larger platform fo r scientists, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, to participate in complex multidisciplinary research activities and enables the training of the next generation of scientists with the latest equipment and technology. R/V Sikuliaq greatly expan ds research and technology capabilities in the Arctic, providing up to 270- 300 science days at sea annually. R enewal/Recompetition/Termination Ships supported by NSF are operated by academic institutions, each having a cooperative agreement with NSF. All ship cooperative agreements were renewed in FY 2012 using the NSB -approved criteria and review by an external panel, with upcoming renewals underway in FY 2018. Awardees are subject to additional oversight measures, including quarterly safety and financial reporting, the use of NSF Business System Reviews, and site inspections. In 2013, NSF retired R/V Cape Hatteras , operated by a consortium of Duke University and the University of North Carolina from its homeport at the Duke University Marine Laboratory. I n 2014, NSF retired R/V Point Sur , operated by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, San Jose State University. For R/V Sikuliaq , a re -compete clause in ten years (2024) was included in the initial cooperative agreement for operations. This clause will be added to all renewals of NSF owned vessels. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 7 ARECIBO OBSERVATORY (ARECIBO) $6,080,000 2019 RequestChange Arecibo is a center for multidisciplinary research and education with advanced observational facilities. The observatory's principal facility is one of the world's largest single- dish radio/radar telescopes, a 305 -meter diameter reflector located near the town of Arecibo in western Puerto Rico on 120 acres of U.S. Government- owned land. Arecibo is currently operated and managed by SRI International (SRI) and subrecipients, Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) , under a cooperative agreement with NSF that initially ran from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2016, and was extended by 18 months to March 31, 2018. The observatory serves over 350 users annually with a wide range of research and observing instrumentation in passive radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy, and space and atmos pheric sciences. A peer -review telescope allocation committee provides merit -based telescope time to users. The committee is common to the three fields, but specific subject matter experts from outside the observatory are consulted for reviews. NSF does not provide awards targeted specifically for use of Arecibo, although some Arecibo users are supported through NSF or NASA grants to pursue scientific programs that require use of the facility. Currently, Arecibo is staffed at about 120 full -time equivalent (FTE) employees, of which about 100 are funded by NSF. The remaining FTEs are supported by a grant from NASA, by the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center, and by other funding sources. Staff include approximately 20 scientists who, along with engineers, technicians, and operators, are available to help visiting investigators with observing programs. In addition, there are management, administrative, and clerical positions, as well as maintenance staff, and several postdoctoral scholars and students. Along with the entire island of Puerto Rico, Arecibo Observatory was severely impacted by Hurricane Maria, which str uck on September 20, 2017. The observatory ceased regular operations shortly before Maria's Puerto Rico landfall. Commercial power was restored on December 9, 2017, and most normal observatory operations resumed by the end of December. Funding for observatory repairs are provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 1 The current cooperative agreement, initially scheduled to end in FY 2016, has been extended through 31 March 2018.Total Obligations for Arecibo (Dollars in Millions) FY 2017 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES1 Arecibo is jointly s upported by the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) and the GEO Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS). Based on the 2006 AST Senior Review recommendations , AST and AGS reduced support for the Arecibo Observatory. An external review of the AST portfolio was completed in 2012, and an external review of the AGS portfolio was completed in 2016. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 8 In 2012, the AST Portfolio Review Committee recommended \"continued AST involvement in Arecibo be re-evaluated later in the decade in light of the science opportunities and budget forecasts at that time.\"8 The New Worlds, New Horizons: Midterm Assessment (August 2016) reinforced this, with Recommendation 3.1 noting: \"The NSF should proceed with divestment from ground- based facilities that have a lower scientific impact .\"9 The Geospace Section (GS) Portfolio Review Committee was charged by the NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences to review the most promising Geospace science strategies and critical capabilities and to reconcile these with the science goals described by the 2013 Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics. 10 The GS is associated with AGS and its portfolio includes grant programs in upper -atmospheric sciences, space science , and space weather. This GS portfolio review was carried out usi ng the assumption of an inflation -adjusted, flat budget for GS over the next decade to FY 2026. The GS Portfolio Review Committee recommendations include the reduction of annual AGS Arecibo Observatory funding from $4.10 million to $1.10 million by 2020. GEO commissioned a review from a second panel assembled by the National Academ ies that assessed the process by which the GS Portfolio Review Committee reached their findings and recommendations. The panel published 11 the results of this review in early 2017 and, for Arecibo, reiterated the recommendations of the GS Portfolio Review Committee. Because of these potential changes, NSF prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate proposed operational changes at Arecibo due to funding constraints , pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. NSF also completed its compliance obligations with the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Endangered Species Act. NSF prepared a Final EIS , which was published in August 2017. 12 Following publication of the EIS, NSF published a Record of Decision13 in November 2017, which formalizes the selection of NSF's preferred alternative: to collaborate with interested parties to maintain science- focused operations at the Observatory with reduced agency funding. NSF issued a solicitation in January 2017 requesting proposals to provide continued operations and management of Arecibo for five years, but at reduced funding. The planned NSF funding profile presented in the solicitation gradually tapered NSF support to $2.0 million by the 5 th year of the award. In February 2018, NSF announced an award to University of Central Florida (UCF) to undertake formal transition activities expected to lead to UCF assumption of full operations and management responsibil ities for Arecibo Observatory. The award ensures continued science- focused operations that will maintain the Observatory's existing research lines of atmospheric, planetary and astronomical research. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : Arecibo supplements NSF support with funding provided by other federal and non- federal sources. Since FY 2010, the NASA Near Earth Object Observation Program has committed $2.0 million annually to Arecibo for the planetary radar program; this increased to $3.60 million for FY 2013, with more observing time allocated to the NASA program. In FY 2019, NASA support is expected to continue at approximately $3.60 million. 8 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp 9 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 9 Education and Public Outreach (EPO) : Arecibo hosts a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site, and Ph.D. students receive training through the use of the facility. Over 350 students have participated participated in REU programs at Arecibo. In collaboration with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Arecibo holds a summer school on s ingle -dish radio astronomy techniques. Arecibo also sponsors a major outreach program in Puerto Rico via the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center as well as summer workshops for K -12 teachers. This center attracts more than 80,000 visitors each year; over 1.4 million people have visited since its opening in 1997. Approximately 25 percent of these visitors are K -12 students. Exhibits at the visitor center were updated, and physical renovations to the visitor center building were completed in FY 2016. These improvements were funded by the Angel Ramos Foundation and the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University System and were formally approved by NSF. With funds received from the Puerto Rico Department of Education, Arecibo has hosted numerous teacher workshops and has traine d approximately 500 teachers. This program integrates formal activities at the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center into the STEM curriculum in Puerto Rico. Arecibo also hosts several meetings each year within a wide variety of scientific disciplines. O perations and Maintenance : Arecibo administers observing time to the astronomy and aeronomy communities via competitive observing proposals and conducts educational and public outreach programs at all levels. Observing hours among science programs are based on the quality of proposals. The telescope is currently oversubscribed, counting ongoing astronomy surveys, new astronomy projects, solar system observations, and atmospheric sciences programs. About 75 percent of astronomy users conduct their observing remotely via networked control software, while radar observations typically employ on -site users. M anagement and Oversight AST, $ 3.05 million: AST funding will maintain basic operations costs and science programs in passive radio astronomy. As recommended by the 2006 AST Senior Review, AST funding for Arecibo hasbeen gradually reduce d. AGS, $ 3.03 million: AGS funding will support basic operations costs and science programs in aeronomy and space physics, including space weather. NSF Structure: The lead NSF program officer in AST, in close cooperation with a program officer i n A GS and in consultation with community representatives, provides ongoing oversight. The program officers make use of detailed annual program plans, long- range plans, quarterly techn ical and financial reports , and annual reports submitted by the management and operations awardee. They also attend awardee governance committee meetings, as appropriate. To address issues as they arise, program officers work closely with other NSF offices such as the Office of the General Counsel, the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in the Office of Budget, Finance , an d Award Management. AST and AGS program officers conduct periodic site visits and frequent, regular, teleconferences. External Structure: Management is via a cooperative agreement . In February 2018 NSF announced an An image of the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico.

Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 10 award to UCF to undertake formal transition activities leading to U CF assumption of full operations and management responsibilities for Arecibo Observatory. NSF is currently negotiating the operations and management award with UCF, including details of the external management and oversight structure. Reviews: In January 2017 NSF issued a solicitation requesting proposals to provide continued operations and management of Arecibo for five years, but at reduced funding. Proposals received in response to this solicitation were afforded extensive NSF internal review together with formal review by a panel of external experts in observatory management and operations. AST and AGS jointly conduct annual external reviews of Arecibo program plans; the most recent such review was held in January 2017. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The current cooperative agreement with SRI for the management of Arecibo was awarded on October 1, 2011, when SRI succeeded the previous managing organization. T his followed a competitive process for a new five -year cooperative agreement, consistent with National Science Board policy. This agreement was in effect thr ough September 30, 2016, and was extended through March 31, 2018. In January 2017 NSF issued a solicitation for continued operations and management of Arecibo Observatory. Following a thorough review process, in February 2018, NSF announced an award to UC F to undertake formal transition activities expected to lead to UCF assumption of full operations and management responsibilities. NSF is currently negotiating the full operations and management award with UCF. The duration of this award is expected to be five years.

Without this action, the change over FY 2017 Actual would be -$8.0 million, or -44.4%. CHESS is a high -intensity, high -energy X -ray user facility located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. It uses synchrotron light given off by charged particles, both electrons and positrons, as they circulate in a ring at nearly the speed of light. CHESS provides capabilities for X -ray research in physics, chemistry, biology, materials, engin eering, and environmental sciences. Emphasis areas include soft matter and thin film studies, solution scattering, nanomaterials, high- pressure science, structural biology, time - resolved studies of materials, and X -ray studies of structural materials. Stew ardship and oversight of CHESS is provided through the MPS Division of Materials Research (DMR). CHESS is a national user facility accessed through a competitive proposal review process. The primary function of CHESS staff is to maintain and operate the f acility and to assist users. A pproximately 850 users annually perform a broad array of research including: computationally- enabled scattering studies of complex materials; an analysis of the structure of designer solids including the impact of processing; enabling the engineering of materials through time -resolved synchrotron radiation studies, X-ray imaging, and spectroscopic studies; studying structural materials under operating conditions; and the analyses of macromolecules and biochemistry. The latter t opic is done in collaboration with NIH. A n annual meeting of users and several workshops help disseminate results from the facility. CHESS supports users from academia, industry, and national laboratories. CHESS has developed a dynamic testing station fo r structural materials through collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research. CHESS collaborates with Department of Energy (DOE) - supported synchrotron facilities such as the Advanced Photon Source and the National Synchrotron Light Source. X -ray detectors developed at CHESS are now in use at 3rd and 4th generation X -ray sources around the world, including the world's first hard X -ray laser, DOE's Linear Coherent Light Source. CHESS - developed undulators, that cost an order of magnitude less than current technology, are being installed at CHESS. The undulators will increase X -ray flux by an order of magnitude and enable CHESS to pursue time-resolved and high- resolution imaging experiments not previously possible. The CHESS-developed undulators, and other innovations such as high flux X -ray optics, are impacting synchrotron science worldwide. CHESS researchers also developed a new Kolsky bar apparatus to study the impact on structure of high strain rates using in -situ diffraction from metals undergoing shock -wave induced strain. This unique capability uses the high flux of CHESS in combination with a new high -speed pixel array detector. Understanding high impact deformation is particularly important to the automotive and aerospace industries. CHESS supports and enhances Ph.D. level graduate education, postdoctoral research, and research experiences for undergraduates and for K -12 students and science teachers. The CHESS education and Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 12 outreach program annually impacts over 6,000 people of all ages, including over 1,300 visitors touring the Cornell facilities. Each year, about 60 Ph.D. degrees are granted as a result of CHESS research. CHESS is a key training ground for X -ray and accelerator scientists, with CHESS grad uates being hired to staff other X-ray facilities in the U.S. and around the world. With support from the State of New York, CHESS is currently upgrading the source ring to a high energy hard X -ray synchrotron source. In FY 2017, NSF conducted a review of the science case for this new X-ray source, named CHESS -U, and determined that this upgrade would not provide a sufficiently unique facility to justify continued stewardship of the source by NSF. This led to the decision to continue funding CHESS operations until March 31, 2019 and to accept a transition proposal in FY 2018. This proposa l would establish a partnership model , whereby NSF would consider investing in the most unique experimental components but no longer support full operation of the source.

A MPS/DMR program director is the primary contact with the facility. NIH provides additional support for CHESS operations through the Macromolecular Diffraction at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) award. A Joint Oversight Group (JOG) was established to better coordinate the CHESS and MacCHESS awards. The JO G serves as a vehicle to keep interested parties informed and includes MPS, ENG, BIO, and NIH program directors. External structure: The Cornell Laboratory of Accelerator -baSed Sciences and Education (CLASSE), which falls under Cornell's Vice Provost for Research, administers CHESS. The principal investigator serves as the CHESS Director and reports to the Director o f CLASSE. The CHESS Director receives guidance primarily from the CHESS executive committee, from an external policy and advisory board, the CHESS diversity committee, and the users' executive committee. Reviews: NSF provides oversight by monitoring annua l plans and reports including user metrics, as well as by conducting monthly phone conferences with the director. NSF uses annual site visit reviews to assess the user program, in -house research, long- term plans to contribute significant research developme nts both nationally and internationally, as well as the operations, maintenance, and facility development. Annual reviews also assess the status of education, training and outreach; operations and management efficiency, and diversity plans. In addition to a panel of experts composed of members from the research community, representatives from NIH attend these site visits. In addition to these yearly scientific reviews, CHESS undergoes periodic business systems review by the NSF Large Facilities Office and D ivision of Acquisition and Cooperative Support. Recent and upcoming reviews include: Review of science case for state funded upgrade of CHESS (CHESS -U), October 26-28, 2016. Review of the CHESS Business Plan for transition, November 2017.

Without this action, the change from FY 2017 to FY 2019 would be $1.16 million or 5.7 percent.Gemini Observatory Funding (Dollars in Millions) 2017 Actual1FY 2019 RequestChange over The Gemini Observatory consists of twin optical/infrared 8- meter telescopes, one each in the northern and southern hemispheres , thereby providing complete coverage of the sky . Gemini North sits atop Mauna Kea, Hawai 'i at an elevation of 4,200 meters, while Gemini South is located on the 2,700- mete r summit of Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile. Both telescopes offer superb image quality and employ sophisticated adaptive optics technology to compensate for the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. Among the fundamental questions being investigated at Gemini are the age and rate of expansion of the universe, the origin of the \"dark energy\" that drives cosmic acceleration, the nature of non -luminous matter, the processes that give rise to the formation and evolving structures of galaxies, and the birth of stars and their planetary systems. Technological advances incorporated into the design of the two telescopes optimize their imaging capabilities and infrared performance as well as their ability to quickly swap instruments in response t o changing atmospheric conditions. Gemini's flexible observing modes make it ideal for reacting rapidly to opportunities that arise in the new era of multi -messenger astronomy. Gemini was one of the first observatories used to characterize the recent neutron star merger/gravitational wave event GW170817, and also responded rapidly to the recently discovered interstellar asteroid A/2017 U1 whose orbit crossed the solar system in October 2017. The research agencies that currently form the Gemini internation al partnership include: NSF ; the National Research Council of Canada ; the Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia, Tecnologia e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o of de Ciencia, Tecnolog\u00eda e Innovaci\u00f3n Productiva of Argentina the Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Tecnol\u00f3gica of Chile . The se five agencies are signatories to the Gemini International Agreement , which currently covers January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2021. Gemini helps educate astronomy and engineering students through undergraduate internship programs in both Hawai 'i and Chile. Gemini also provides an engaging focal point for public outreach and student training in all of the partner countries. Gemini -sponsored activities attract students and teachers at all levels of elementary through high school education. T he unique Gemini -led Journey Through the Universe progra m in Hilo, Hawai 'i (now in its 14 th year) and its sister activity, Viaje al Universo in La Serena, Chile, bring astronomy into the classroom through week -long annual event s that involve dozens of astronomers from Gemini as well as from many of the other astronomical facilities at each location. Gemini staff also provides guidance and support to the 'Imiloa Astronomy Center, a public facility in Hilo that seeks to advance the integ ration of science and indigenous culture through education. The observatory supports four facility -class instruments at each telescope as well as a vigorous visiting instrument program. Each telescope is equipped with state -of-the- art adaptive o ptics and l aser guide star systems which greatly improve the ability to correct for atmos pheric blurring. The advanced multi - conjugate adaptive optics system on Gemini South continues to lead the world, providing near -infrared FY 2019 NSF Budget Reque st to Congress Facilities - 15 images that are often sharper than those observed from space with smaller telescopes, and which cover a field-of-view on the sky that is wider than any competing system on the ground. The observatory is actively developing new imagers and spectrometers. By agreement, the observatory partners contribute an additional amount ( 10 percent of their annual operations contribution) to the new instrument fund. The Gemini High -resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST), a workhorse instrument for studying a vast array of astronomical objects, is nearing co mpletion . A contract was signed in early 2017 for a new 8- beam optical/infrared spectrograph, OCTOCAM, that will be used to characterize exotic transient phenomena discovered with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in the 2020s. This latest instrum ent selection directly responds to the need for an LSST follow -up instrument, as recommended in the 2012 NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) Portfolio Review report Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges,14 in the 2015 National Academies report Optimizing the U.S. Ground- Based Optical and Infrared System ,15 and in the 2016 KAVLI Futures Symposium report Maximizing Science in the Era of LSST: A Community Based Study of Needed US OIR Capabilities .16 Construction of the telescopes and their instrumentation involved a large number of industrial entities in several countries, with areas of specialization that included large and complex optical systems, engineering, electronics, electro -mechanical systems, and computing. Continued development in these areas is reflected in the instrumentation and facilities renewal activities that are incorporated into the overall budget. The U.S. share of Gemini Observatory observing time is open to proposals from any researcher in the U.S. astronomical community, with peer -review committees providing merit- based telescope time. NSF does not provide awards targeted specifically for the use of Gemini. However, U.S. users are often supported through separate NSF rese arch awards to pursue scientific programs that require the use of the observatory.

Management and Oversight Governance Structure: The observatory is governed by t he Gemini Board, which was established by the Gemini International Agreement signed by the participating agencies. This b oard meets at least twice a year and acts as the primary forum for interactions and decisions among the Participant s in the Gemini Agreement; the Gemini Board ensures that Gemini is managed and operated in accordance with the Agreement , and is the body with overall budgetary and policy control over the observatory. NSF -User Research Facilities Facilities - 16 serves as the Executive Agency for the partnership , carrying out the project on their behalf. The U.S. holds six of the 13 seats on the Gemini Board; NSF appoints the five non- NSF U.S. members. Managing Organization: The Gemini Observatory is currently managed by the Association of Universities for Resea rch in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) on behalf of the partnership through a cooperative agreement with NSF. The current cooperative agreement covers January 1, 2017 t o D ecember 31, 2022. AURA conducts its own management reviews through oversight committees. NSF Structure: NSF has one seat on the Gemini Board, currently occupied by the AST program officer responsible for Gemini programmatic oversight. An other NSF staff member serves as Board executive secretary . The program officer monitors operations and developme nt activities at the observatory , nom inates U.S. scientists to Gemini advisory committees, conducts reviews on behalf of the partnership, participates in various Board sponsored sub- committees, and approves funding actions , r eports, and contracts . Reviews: NSF conducts periodic reviews of the management and operation of the observatory , and of AURA's financial systems. NSF most recently conducted a Business System Review (BSR) of the observatory and AURA's centralized administrative services in 2013. In April 2017, NSF conducted a Gemini Accounting System Audit, and plans to conduct a new BSR in 2018 or 2019 . Re newal/Recompetition/Termination The United Kingdom withdrew from the Gemini partnership at the end of 2012, requiring about a 24 percent budget reduction for overall facility management and operations . More recently, Australia, a 6.3 percent partner in 2015, first moved to a limited -term participation and then ceased participation entirely in late 2017. S outh Kor ea has a similar limited -term, year -to-year arrangement through the end of 2018, though discussions are underway regarding full partnership from 2019 onwards at a roughly 5 percent level . The next participant assessment point is scheduled for 2018, at which time existing partners will establish participation levels in the Gemini Observatory beyond December 2021. T he cooperative agreement for managing Gemini that expired at the end of 2016 included a plan to support the transition to the new operations model under the reduced budget due to changes in international partner participation. Reductions in project scope included a decreased facility -class instrument complement on each telescope, cost savings from a shift to remote telescope operations from the sea level base facilities in Hawai 'i and Chile, a redesign of the data archive, and prioritization of serving the partner user communities over internal scientific research activities. These and other transition projects have now been successfully completed. P rior to the completion of the aforementioned transition program, re -competition of the managemen t and operation of Gemini was conducted in 2014-2015. T he National Science Board authorized a new cooperative agreement with AU RA in February 2016 that covers January 2017 through December 2022. The Gemini t elescopes atop Maunakea (right). Credit: Gemini Observatory FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 17 GEODESY ADVANCING GEOSCIENCES AND EARTHS COPE (GAGE ) $12,190,000 Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope comprises a distributed, multi -user, national facility for the development, deployment, and operational support of modern geodetic instrumentation to serve national goals in basic research and education in the E arth sciences with a focus on studies of Earth's surface deformation at many scales with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. GAGE facilities support fundamental research and discovery on continental deformation, plate boundary processes, the ear thquake cycle, the geometry and dynamics of magmatic systems, continental groundwater storage, and hydrologic loading. GAGE is managed and operated for NSF by UNAVCO, a consortium of 115 U.S. universities and non-profit institutions with research and teach ing programs in geophysics and geodesy and 108 associate members from foreign institutions. GAGE was formed in late FY 2013 from the geodetic component of the EarthScope facility and related geodetic facilities previous managed by UNAVCO. The FY 2019 Budge t Request will enable GAGE to provide key services for the geoscience research community, including global and regional observing networks, field and technical support for experiments worldwide, data management and distribution systems, and other related activities. Over the last three decades, the Earth science research community has greatly refined our ability to determine the position and motion of points on Earth's surface using space geodetic techniques, enabling high-resolution studies of Earth processes in a wide range of fields. Space geodesy applications are extremely broad and expanding to include important societal research on earthquake and tsunami hazards, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, coastal subsidence, wetlands health, soil moisture, groundwater distribution, and space weather. Applications of geodetic techniques to understanding the complex interplay between climate dynamics, continental ice sheet and mountain glacier dynamics, crustal isostatic adjustments, and sea level change is of fore most relevance to current global issues confronting humanity. FY 2020 FY 2021 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES To serve the research needs of the broad Earth science community, GAGE is organized under three primary service areas and two special emphasis areas: Geodetic Infrastructure The EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) includes more than 1,100 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations ( more than 720 of which transmit data in real -time with sub -second latency) distributed across the U.S., with focus on the active plate boundaries in the western contiguous U.S. and southern Alaska. Data recovery for the PBO GPS network typically exceeds 90 percent. PBO also includes 76 borehole strainmeters and 79 borehole seismometers deployed along the San Andreas Fault and above the Cascadia subduction zone and volcanic arc. Tiltmeters (25) and pore pressure sensors (23) are also collocated with the other borehole instruments. Together, data collected by these Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 18 instruments enable scientists to study the full range of deformation in the solid Earth, from the rapid shaking associated with earthquakes, through more gradual motions related to slow slip events on faults and to Earth's evolving water cycles, up to long- term plate tectonics. Global geodetic a rrays outside of the PBO footprint are supported by GAGE in partnership with investigators. Nearly 900 continuous GPS stations from around the world are now maintained, monitored, and data compiled into the GAGE data system. GAGE supports 58 of the over 250 GPS sites in th e National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) -supported Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) array that supports satellite orbit and clock corrections and the refinement of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) ; the ITRF is the foundation for high -precision global Earth science and other applications of geodesy such as land surveying . GAGE is also supporting the development of data distribution systems for a Caribbean region GPS and meteorological sensor network (COCONet) of mor e than 100 stations that support tectonic, volcano, tropical storm, and sea level change investigations. Community GPS receiver and geodetic technology pool includes a pool of over 680 GPS and Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, ancillary equipment, and six terrestrial laser scanners, which can be used by investigators for short - and long -term deployments on research projects supported via multiple Earth science programs funded by NSF. Polar Networks supports GAGE's polar GPS networks in Antarctica (ANET) and Greenland (GNET) and development of specialized GPS monumentation, power, and telemetry solutions for use in harsh environments. GAGE also provides portable campaign deployment geodetic instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments in the polar regions. Investigator Project Support includes project management, field engineering, and technical support services to plan and execute GPS surveys and permanent station installations. GAGE also maintains a staff focused on geode tic technology equipment testing services to evaluate new geodetic technologies and improve performance for science applications. Geodetic Data Services Geodetic Data Services manages an archive of over 282 terabytes of data from GPS, laser scanning, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and borehole geophysical instruments from all GAGE components including EarthScope PBO, global continuous geodetic networks, and campaign GPS observations; operates automated and manual systems to ensure the quality of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. The archive of SAR imagery maintained and distributed by GAGE to support inte rferometric SAR imagery of continuous surface deformation at scales of 100 km to 1,000 km is complementary to discrete GPS measurement of displacement. UNAVCO, as the manager of GAGE, brokers for cost -effective community access to the SAR imagery acquired by foreign SAR satellite systems. These data enable the wide range of Earth science studies described above. Education and Community Engagemen t The GAGE Education and Community Engagement (ECE) program enables audiences beyond geodesists to access and use geodetic data and research for educational purposes, including technical short courses, student internships, web- based materials, and programs for strengthening workforce development and improving diversity in the geosciences. Special Emphasis Areas Com munity Activities include scientific and technical workshops that bring together the international geodetic community and publications designed to communicate GAGE activities and results to the community. External Affairs maintains outreach efforts to poli cymakers and planning for coordination with the international geodesy community. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 19 Beside its role in providing observational data essential for basic Earth science research, GAGE also plays a significant role providing geodetic infrastructure support to NA SA investigators and the international community through activities in maintaining a subset of the Global GNSS Network (GGN) . GCN supports the refinement of the ITRF and corrections to satellite orbits and clocks, all contributing to the capability for mil limeter -level geodetic positioning, subtle observations of Earth's time -varying gravity field, and detection of millimeter -level changes in sea level. Commercial surveyors and engineering firms download GAGE facility real -time GPS data daily to support precision positioning. The economic impact of this service to the commercial sector has not been quantified, but is likely substantial. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) in the Directorate for Geosciences, through its Instrumentation & Facilities program (IF), provides general oversight of GAGE to help assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of GAGE programs and projects with other NSF -supported facilities and proje cts, and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of UNAVCO in managing and operating GAGE. The EAR Division Director and Integrated Activities Section Head provide other internal oversight. External Structure: GAGE is managed and operated by UNAVCO, which is incorporated as a non- profit consortium representing 115 U.S. universities and non- profit organizations with research and teaching programs that rely on geodetic technologies for Earth Science research. Each voting member institution of the Consortium appoints a member representative, and these member representatives elect the nine members of the UNAVCO Board of Directors, seven of which are drawn from member institutions, and two directors- at-large. The board members, who serve two -year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with GAGE management and operation, through consultation with UNAVCO staff and GAGE advisory committees (one for each major GAGE component and additional ad hoc working groups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president of UNAVCO to a renewable two -year term. The president is responsible for UNAVCO operations, all of which are managed through the UNAVCO Corporate Headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. Reviews: All major ongoing geoscience facilities routinely undergo reviews of their management, in addition to peer review of proposals for new or continued support. The formal NSF merit review of the five-year proposal for the GAGE facility took place in 2012 and 2013 and was also the most recent review of UNAVCO. Although the ad hoc reviewers and two independent review panels had a number of specific recommendations at the working level for GAGE, overall the review found that GAGE was a critical facility for U.S. and international earth sciences. Furthermore, the reviewers found that UNAVCO is a well -managed and effective organization that has, through its commitment to the collection and open dissemination of the highest quality geodetic data, transformed the discipline of geodesy and its geoscience applications. R enewal/Recompetiti on/Termination The GAGE cooperative agreement began October 1, 2013, and will expire September 30, 2018. In FY 2016, in keeping with the phased integration and recompetition plan presented to the National Science Board in December 2009, NSF solicited proposals to manage and operate one or more components of a new facility to support the Earth sciences research and education community. These components are currently supported by GAGE and the related Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience and EarthScope (SAGE). The new distributed, multi -user, national facility would support the development, deployment, management, and operational support of modern geodetic, seismic, and related geophysical instrumentation and provide services to serve national goals in basic research and education in the Earth sciences. NSF is currently reviewing proposals received in response to this facility solicitation. As part of a robust re - competition and cost review process, various NSF oversight activities have been completed and others are underway, such as an independent cost assessment s to inform NSF's cost analysis for a potential award. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 20 ICECUBE NEUTRINO eCube is the world's first high- energy neutrino observatory and is located deep within the ice cap under the U.S. Amundsen- Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. With the discovery in 2013 of the first neutrinos from beyond our solar system, the Observatory has demonstrated that it represents a new window on the univers e, providing unique data on the engines that power active galactic nuclei, the origin of high-energy cosmic rays, the nature of gamma ray bursts, the activities surrounding supermassive black holes, and other violent and energetic astrophysical processes. The energy and arrival direction of high -energy neutrinos ranging in energy from 100 GeV to 10 PeV (1 GeV is 10 9 electron Volts [eV]; 1012 eV; and are derived from the IceCube data stream. The IceCube collaboration has recently fo cused on studies of neutrino events with a deposited energy of 1 TeV and above . Astrophysical neutrinos remain the dominant component above 10 TeV. The number of these neutrinos , detected by IceCube in the range between 100 TeV and 10 PeV has already exceeded 150, and so will provide a statistically robust basis for determining the extrasolar neutrino flux. Mu lti-messenger astrophysics followed the IceCube telegram on 22 September 2017, reporting a well -reconstructed track of a ~290 TeV extraterrestrial muon neutrino that pointed to the location of the bright flaring blazar (a quasi -stellar radio source associated with a supermassive black hole at the center of an active giant galax y). Three scientific spacecraft (Fermi -LAT, AGILE, SWIFT) and one ground- based telescope (MAGIC) reported ~100 GeV - level gamma -ray observations from a direction that was consistent within 0.1\u00b0 from the location of the blazar, previously located by the Ferm i Large Area Telescope. Appr oximately one cubic kilometer of ice is instrumented with photo- multiplier (PM) tubes to detect neutrino- induced, charged reaction products that are produced when a high -energy neutrino interacts in the ice within or near the cubic kilometer fiducial volume. Since completion in 2010, the IceCube detector has been taking data in its final configuration with an uptime of well over 99 percent. To handle the high data rates, initial analysis of the data is performed by a cluster of computers housed in a two- story building placed on top of the array. The filtered data is sent over geostationary satellites to the IceCube Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. Th e Observatory includes a Deep Core Array (DCA) with tightly space d digital optical modules to detect lower energy neutrinos (down to about 10 GeV), thus opening the door to studies of neutrino oscillation measurements and studies of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) below 250 GeV. The DCA closes the energy ga p between the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the Super -Kamiokande detector in Photo Library, Sven Lidstrom (sic), NSF.FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 21 Japan, and allows effective observations of high -energy neutrinos entering from the sky of the southern FY 2021 FY $3.50 $3.50 $3.50 Operations & Maintenance (MPS) 3.50 - 3.50 3.50 3.50 3.50 3.50 3.50 Total $7.00 - $7.00 $7.00 $7.00 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is presently led by the University of Wisconsin (UW) and was constructed with support from four countries (U.S., Belgium, Germany, and Sweden). The science collaboration is much broader, currently consisting of 23 U.S. institutions and 24 institutions in 11 other countries (Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). NSF's foreign partners contribute a pro rata share of operations and maintenance costs based on the number of PhD- level researchers involved. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: Oversight of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the joint responsibility of the Geosciences Directorate's Office of Polar Programs (OPP) and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate's (MPS) Division of Physics (PHY). Support for o perations and maintenance, research and education, and outreach are shared by OPP and PHY, as well as other external organizations and international partners. NSF provides oversight through regular site visits by NSF managers and external reviewers. Extern al Structure: The UW management structure for IceCube includes leadership by the project's principal investigator supported by the director of operations and two associate directors (one for science and instrumentation and one for education and outreach). A Collaboration spokesperson is selected from the senior international scientific leaders for a two -year term, with an option to be renewed once for at most four consecutive years. At lower levels, project management includes international collaboration re presentatives, as well as participation by staff at collaborating U.S. institutions. UW has in place an external Scientific Advisory Committee and a Software and Computing Advisory Panel that meet annually and provide written advice to the project. UW lead ership, including the Chancellor, provides additional awardee- level oversight. Operations Costs Full operations and maintenance in support of scientific research began in FY 2011. The associated costs are and will continue to be shared by the partner fund ing agenciesU.S. (NSF) and non- U.S.proportional to the number of PhD researchers involved. The $ 1.0 million reduction in the U.S. operational cost contribution w ill likely be taken over by non- U.S. partners . This would shift the ratio of U.S.:non- U.S. P hD researchers from about 55:45 to 47:53. The current NSF award for operations and maintenance constitutes the bulk of the U.S. contribution to general operation of the facility. In addition, work in support of facility operations is performed by students, postdocs, and senior researchers who are participating in research on the data produced by the Observatory. Approximately $4.0 million annually is provided in NSF support for U.S. institutions working on more refined and specific data analyses, data int erpretation (theory support), and instrumentation upgrades is provided in response to merit -reviewed proposals , through research grants. The general operations of South Pole Station, reported in the Polar Facilities and Logistics narrative, also contribut e to supporting IceCube. The cost of IceCube operations shown in the table herein includes only Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 22 those that are project -specific and incremental to general South Pole Station operations. The expected operational lifespan of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is 25 years, beginning in FY 2011. Education and Outreach IceCube provides a vehicle for helping to achieve U.S. and NSF education and outreach goals. Specific outcomes include the education and training of future leaders in astrophysics, including under graduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates; K -12 teacher scientific and professional development, including development of new inquiry- based learning materials and use of the South Pole environment to convey the excitement of astrophysics and science generally to K -12 students; increased opportunity for involvement of students in international collaborations; increased diversity in science through partnerships with minority serving institutions; and enhanced public understanding of science through broadcast media and museum exhibits (such as the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois) based on IceCube science and the South Pole environment. NSF supports evaluation and measurement -based education and outreach programs under separate grants to universities and other organizations that are selected following standard NSF merit review. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination NSF re -competed the IceCube operations and maintenance award in FY 2016. The new award was issued on April 1, 2016 for 60 months. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 23 INTERNATIONAL OCEAN DISCOVERY PROGRAM (IODP) $48,000,000 $0 / 0% Amount Percent $48.00 - (TBD)FY 2019 RequestChange over FY 2017 Actual The International Ocean Discovery Program began in FY 2014 as the replacement for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and the prior Ocean Drilling Program. The IODP represents an international partnership of the scientists, research institutions, and funding organizations of 23 nations to explore the evolution, structure, and behavior of Earth as recorded in the ocean basins. The program management structure focuses on maximizing facility efficiency, while retaining the intellectual cooperation and exchange with NSF's international partners. NSF, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) continue to provide drilling platforms. The IODP platforms provide sediment and rock samples (cores); in -situ monitoring, sampling, and measurement from borehole observatories; shipboard and shore -based descriptive and analytical facilities; down -hole geophysical and geochemical measurements (logging); and opportunities to conduct experiments to determine in- situ c onditions beneath the sea floor. ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES Annual operations and maintenance support for operating the JOIDES Resolution , the most -used IODP platform, represents NSF's primary contribution to the program. The JOIDES Resolution is leased from an offshore drilling contractor under a long- term contract. The FY 2019 Request of $48 .0 million for operations and maintenance of the JOIDES Resolution will support five expeditions per year . Another commercial contractor provides down -hole- logging services. D atabases and core repositories, preparing scientific publications emerging from JOIDES Resolution IODP expeditions, and management of international program proposal review through the IO DP Science Support Office, represent additional NSF IODP science integration costs, made at minimal cost to NSF because of international contributions to the program. NSF also provides support for U.S. scientists to sail on IODP drilling platforms and to p articipate in IODP advisory panels through an associated program. The annual costs for the associated science integration and science support (not included in the table above) for FY 2019 are projected to be approximately $8.5 million, funded separately through the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) . The IODP scientific program emphasizes the following research themes: Climate and Ocean Change: Reading the Past, Informing the Future; Biosphere Frontiers: Deep Life, Biodiversity, and Environmental Forcing of Ecosystems; Earth Connections: Deep Processes and Their Impact on Earth's Surface Environment; and Earth in Motion: Processes and Hazards on Human Time Scales. The umbrella IODP Forum provides a venue for all IODP entities to exchange ideas and views on the scientific progress of the program. In the current IODP, each drillship is governed by independent facility boards, each of which is unique and optimized for their respective drilling platform. In the case of the Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 24 JOIDES Resolution Facility Board (JRFB) , two advisory panels review proposals and provide science and safety advice. A U.S. scientist leads the JFRB, with other members from the scientific community, funding agencies, and the facility operator. The other IODP platforms utilize the JRFB advisory panels for drilling proposal review. IODP participants include the United States, Japan, ECORD (Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), Br azil, the People's Republic of China, Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand, with all participants except Japan providing financial contributions to JOIDES Resolution operations. Japan provides program support through substantial investment in Chikyu operations, with U.S. and Japanese scientists enjoying reciprocal rights on each drilling vessel, and through curation of JOIDES Resolution core samples at Japan's Kochi Core Center. Over 3,900 scientists from 52 nations have participated on Ocean Drilling Program, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, and International Ocean Discovery Program expeditions since 1985, including approximately 1,660 U.S. scientists from over 150 universities, government agencies, and industrial research laboratories. Samples and d ata have been distributed to well over 1,000 additional U.S. scientists. Scientists from these groups propose and participate in IODP cruises, are members of the program's advisory panels and groups, and supply data for planning expeditions and interpretat ion of drilling results. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) manages IODP operations of the JOIDES Resolution and the IODP Science Support Office under the NSF Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) . NSF's ODP is located within the Integrative Programs section, with one and a half program officers dedicated to its oversight. One of the program officers has responsibility for two cooperative agreements supporting JOIDES Resolution operations and the IODP Support Office, while the other oversees the cooperative agreement for the IODP U.S. Science Support Program (USSSP). External Structure: NSF provides the JOIDES Resolution as the light IODP drillship through a cooperative agreement with Texas A&M University. MEXT provides the Chikyu as the heavy IODP drillship through the Japan Agency for Marine- Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), while the British Ge ological Survey manages ECORD drilling contributions through single -use Mission -Specific Platforms. Each entity providing an IODP drilling platform is responsible for sample and data storage, publications, and other science costs associated with the respec tive platform operations . IODP JOIDES Resolution operations are determined by the JRFB, utilizing advice and recommendations provided by the Science Evaluation Panel (SEP) and the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP). Representation on the pane ls is determined by contribution level to JOIDES Resolution operations and exchange with other facility boards. NSF is a member of the JRFB. Reviews: Performance of the JOIDES Resolution facility is reviewed yearly by an NSF panel , in consultation with the JRFB. Substantive review of management performance regarding JOIDES Resolution operations occur red in the third year of the cooperative agreement (FY 2017) to guide potential renewal or re -competition decisions. Review of scientific progress in broader thematic areas is conducted under the authority of the IODP Forum. R enewal/Recompetition/Termination In FY 2013, to facilitate support for drilling proposal review, advisory panel meeting logistics, and other integrative activities for scientists participating in IODP activities (e.g. , websites), the IODP Science Support Office was selected at the University of California, San Diego through a competitive process for a five-year (FY 2014 - FY 2018) cooperative agreement. In January 2018 NSF awarded a 5-year extension for this Office through FY 2023. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 25 I n FY 2014, through a competitive process, Texas A&M University was selected to be the JOIDES Resolution operator under a five-year (FY 2015 - FY 2019) cooperative agreement. This cooperative agreement contains language encouraging the awardee to facilitate novel partnerships involving support of JOIDES Resolution operations between the U.S. scientific drilling community and commercial industry, thereby providing new intellectual opportunities and potent ial redu ction in overall facility cost. NSF is considering a possible recommendation for a Five Year Award renewal and will make a determination in FY 2018. I n FY 2015, to facilitate support for U.S. scientists participating on IODP platforms (i.e., salar y and travel support) and for U.S. IODP education and outreach efforts, a new cooperative agreement was awarded, after competitive selection, to the Lamont -Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University for operation of the U.S. Science Support Pr ogram for a five -year period (FY 2015 - FY 2019).

Credit: Gabriel Tagliard Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities 26 LARGE HADRON COLLIDE R (LHC ) in FY High- Lumosity LHC LHC , an international project at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN ) laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, is the most powerful particle accelerator ever constructed. It produces the highest energy particle beams ever created, making it the premier facility in the world for research in elementary particle physics. The LHC consists of a superconducting particle accelerator, approximately 16.5 miles in circu mference, providing two counter -rotating proton beams with a design energy of 7 TeV (1 TeV=1012 electron volts) per beam. It can also provide colliding beams of heavy ions, such as lead. During 2011 and 2012 (\"Run 1\") the LHC operated at 4 TeV per beam bec ause of a limitation in the electrical connections between the superconducting magnets. After the connections were upgraded during a nearly two- year shutdown, Run 2 began in mid -2015 and will continue through the end of 2018 at 6.5 TeV per beam, exploring a new energy region not accessible during Run 1. Four large particle detectors collect the data delivered by the LHC. They characterize the reaction products from high -energy proton- proton and heavy ion beam collisions. These are analyzed to investigate t he fundamental properties of matter. More than 40 international funding agencies provide support for scientists to participate in experiments at the LHC. CERN is responsible for meeting the overall LHC project goals and coordinating international participa tion. The U.S., through a partnership between the Department of Energy (DOE) and NSF, made major contributions to the construction and operation of two of the largest particle detectors, a Toroidal LHC Apparatus (ATLAS) and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), while NSF additionally supports a small number of researchers who participate in the LHC -b detector. LHC data have resulted in major scientific discoveries. Foremost of these was the July 4, 2012, announcement by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations of the discovery of a particle having properties consistent with the long- sought Higgs boson, a prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics. Its existence was a prediction of the theoretical framework describing the origin of the masses of elementary particles. The experimental confirmation of this theory was recognized by the award of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics to Fran \u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs. Another important discovery was announced on July 14, 2015, when the LHC -b experiment reported the discovery of a new way to aggregate quarks (the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter) into a collection of five quarks, a combination never before observed. On June 28, 2016, the same collaboration reported the observation of another novel aggregation of quarks into novel four -quark elementary particles. The collaborations continue to search for evidence of new physical phenomena beyond the Standard Model. For example, the LHC program includes searches for particles predicted by a powerful theoretical framework known as supersymmetry, which may provide clues as to how the known forces - weak, strong, electromagnetic, and g ravitational - evolved from different aspects of the same \"unified\" force in the early universe. Despite no conclusive signs of new physics so far, the experimental results to date have helped tighten constraints on different models and possibilities, homi ng in on the most exciting areas of investigation ahead. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 2021 $22.30 $20.50 $20.50 $20.50 $20.50 $20.50 1 The current cooperative agreements end in December 2021 (CMS) and January 2022 (ATLAS) .Total Obligations for LHC (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 Request A world -wide cyber -infrastructure, the LHC grid, is dedicated to LHC data processing, allowing scientists to remotely access and analyze vast data sets. The U.S. LHC col laboration continues to be a leader in the development and exploitation of distributed computing. The LHC grid and the Tier 2 computing centers funded by NSF enable U.S. universities to access LHC data and computing resources and thus train students in bot h state -of-the- art science and computational techniques. The distributed computing tools and techniques developed for the LHC are expected to have broad application throughout the scientific and engineering communities. The May 2014 report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) recommended to DOE and NSF that the highest priority strategic goal for the U.S. particle physics research program, within a global context, should be continued support for involvement in the LHC program. Within the scope of supported activities, they recommended including a further planned upgrade of the accelerator to very high luminosity (nearly ten times the luminosity of initial operation). A high luminosity upgrade w ill facilitate precision measurements that may reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model. This will necessitate significant enhancements to the detectors to exploit this scientific opportunity. NSF has been working with the US ATLAS and CMS detector collaborations to plan for a possible contribution to this upgrade. Supplemental funds provided through the operations award in FY 2016 and FY 2017 have enabled the collaborations to initiate a preliminary design for an NSF component. Through the participation of young investigators, graduate students, undergraduates, and minority institutions in this international project, LHC serves the goal of helping to produce a diverse, globally - oriented workforce of scientists and engineers. Innovative education and outreach activities allow high school teachers and students to participate in this project. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: A program director in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Physics is responsible for day -to-day project oversight. The Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support provides financial and administrative support. An Integrated Project Team, with representatives from the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, experienced program officers, the Large Facilities Office, and other areas of the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management, contribute to the planning activities that may lead to a major construction upgrade. External Structure: U.S. program management occurs through a Joint Oversight Group (JOG), created by NSF and DOE. The JOG has the responsibility to see that the U.S. LHC program is effectively managed and executed to meet commitments made under the LHC international agreement and its protocols. NSF operations support is provided through cooperative agreements with Pr inceton University for US -CMS and with Stony Brook University for US- ATLAS. Reviews: There is one major management/technical review each year with a panel of external, international experts, a follow -up review six months later, as well as bi -weekly telephone reviews by NSF/DOE program directors to monitor progress. NSF and DOE conduct separate and joint external reviews of the detector upgrade activities so that each agency is fully cognizant of the activities of the other partner. The most recent major joint management/technical review was held in October 2017. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 28 Two JOG review meetings per year monitor overall program management. The most recent JOG was held in April 2017.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities 29 LASER INTERFEROMETER GRAVITATIONAL -WAVE $45,000,000 OBSERVATORY 2019 theory of general relativity predicts that cataclysmic processes involving extremely dense objects in the universe, such as the collision and merger of two black holes, will produce gravitational radiation. On Sept ember 14, 2015, LIGO directly observed gravitational radiation from a black- hole merger, verifying this 100- year-old prediction. This is an achievement of historic importance for fundamental physics, astrophysics, and astronomy, as it opens an entirely new observational window on the universe. This achievement was announced to the world in a series of international press conferences on February 11, 2016. LIGO announced detection of a second black -hole merger on June 15, 2016. Since that time an additional t hree black -hole- black -hole mergers have been observed, the last , on August 14, 2017, in coincidence with the VIRGO interferometer in Italy. In O ctober 2017, LIGO a nnounced the first detection of a neutron star -neutron star merger on August 17, 2017 . This event was also observed in the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves, by 70 telescopes around the world. These observations had the far -reaching consequence of confirming that most of the elements heavier than iron were produced by neutron star -neutron star mergers . Long considered a theoretical possibility , this is now a reality. LIGO, the most sensitive gravitational -wave detector ever built, comprises two main facilities, one in Livingston Parish, LA and one in Hanford, WA. At each facility, an L -shaped vacuum chamber, with two 4-km long arms joined at right angles, houses an optical interferometer. The interferometers are used to measure minute relative changes in the distances between the vertex of the L and mirrors at the ends of the arms that are caused by a passing gravitational wave. A passing gravitational wave causes the distance along one arm to lengthen while the other arm shrinks duri ng one half cycle of the wave, and then the first arm shrinks while the other arm lengthens during the second half cycle. The predicted distortion of space caused by a gravitational wave from a likely source is on the order of one part in 10 21, meaning tha t the expected amplitude of the length change over the 4- km length is only about 1/1000th the diameter of a proton. LIGO's 4 -km length was chosen to make the expected signal as large as possible within terrestr ial and financial constraints: Longer arms would result in a bigger signal but would entail larger construction costs. Looking for coincident signals from both interferometers increases LIGO's ability to discriminate a gravitational wave signal from local sources of noise that can mimic the signal. Components for a third interferometer, initially intended for installation at Hanford as a further tool to discriminate candidate signals from random noise, have been set aside in response to a proposed initiative from the Government of India to establish a gravitational wave observatory there. If realized, this third interferometer would greatly enhance LIGO's ability to locate gravitational wave sources on the sky, facilitating follow -up investigations using optical and radio telescopes. The scientific val ue of o btaining complementary gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from the same source has already been demonstrated in the recent observation of a neutron star -neutron star merger. As the number of observations expands with enhanced sensitivity and localization, this will s ignificantly increase our understanding of supernovae and neutron stars. Such scientific prospects help motivate the NSF Big Idea Windows on the Universe. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 30 The Advanced LIGO upgrade, funded through the MREFC account, resulted in the design, fabrication, and installation of improved apparatus that is expected to increase LIGO's sensitivity 10 -fold. LIGO's operating budget supported the initial commissioning of this apparatus. Following completion of installation of the Advanced L IGO apparatus in March 2015, LIGO scientists and engineers were able to achieve about four times LIGO's initial sensitivity by September 2015 in order to make the historic first detection of gravitational waves. Since then, after further commissioning, LIG O has been able to achieve more than a six-fold increase in sensitivity. Following the conclusion of the highly successful observing run that led to the discoveries discussed above, LIGO is now in the midst of a commissioning period that will lead to furth er enhancement of the sensitivity and more frequent detection possibilities. FY 2020 FY 2021 $45.00 1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in September 2018.Total Obligations for LIGO (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 Request LIGO is pursuing an integrated program of periodic scientific operation of the LIGO observatories, interleaved with engineering studies that continue to enhance operating performance . The operations budget also supports basic infrastructure maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of data obtained from the interferometers, and maintenance of computational resources for data storage and analysis. Operations funding also enables strategic research and development in instrument science that is expected to lead to longer-term enhancements to operational performance. A small part of the operations budget supports education and outreach activities. The LIGO S cience Education Center (LIGO SEC), located on the Livingston Observatory site, hosts 50 hands -on inquiry- based learning exhibits and reaches over 15,000 students, teachers and members of the public each year. Its activities benefit from a partnership with Southern University Baton Rouge (SUBR), the San Francisco Exploratorium, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), and other collaborating educational entities. Trained docents from SUBR assist participants and serve as collegiate- age role models for young visitors. LIGO SEC programs are supported both through LIGO's operations cooperative agreement and through grants to SUBR and BRAF. The LIGO Hanford Observatory also promotes a highly successful program of outreach to K -12 students and the general public i n that region. LIGO created a number of connections to industry in order to achieve the demanding technical performance requirements needed to detect gravitational waves. Innovations across a diverse range of technologies have led to new techniques with broad applications (for example, preparation of stainless steel for ultra- high vacuum application, adaptive laser beam shaping, and precision dielectric optical coatings). Other cases have resulted in patents and commercial products (in -vacuum electrical connectors, high power electro- optic modulators). The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), an open collaboration that organizes the major international groups doing research supportive of LIGO, has more than 100 collaborating institutions in 18 countries with more than 1,2 00 participating scientists. The LSC plays a major role in many aspects of the LIGO effort. These include establishing priorities for scientific operation, data analysis and validation of scientific results, and contributing to instrumental improvements at the LIGO facilities, as well as fostering education and public outreach programs. NSF supports LSC activities in the U .S. at approximately $8.0 million per year, which is provided through regular disciplinary program funds. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 31 In addition to the operations budget NSF also provides funds on an as -needed basis to handle critical infrastructure needs. These are awarded as supplemental funding contingent on the review and recommendation of a special expert review panel charged for that purpose. Such a review was held in May 2017 to respond to a need to address vacuum issues that threatened the integrity of the beam pipe. That review resulted in $2.50 million in supplemental funding in FY 2017. NS F continually assesses the appropriate level of financial support by monitoring actual expenditures contained in quarterly activity -based financial reports from LIGO and through annual external reviews of operation. Man agement and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is coordinated internall y by the LIGO program director in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Physics (MPS/PHY). The program director consults regularly with representatives from the NSF Large Facilities Office, the MPS Facilities Coordinator, and the NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support. External Structure: LIGO is managed by the California Institute of Technology under a cooperativeagreement. The management plan specifies significant involvement by the user community, represen ted by the LSC, and collaboration with the other major gravitational -wave detector activities in Asia, Europe, and Australia. External peer -review committees organized by NSF help provide oversight through annual reviews. Recent Reviews: Reviews of observ atory operation are held annually. Special purpose reviews using external expert panels have also been held as needed, examining topics such as long -term storage of the interferometer components set aside for possible deployment to India, LIGO computing pl ans, and LIGO ultra -high vacuum system needs. The last annual review was held in June 2017 . Re newal/Recompetition/Termination LIGO began operating under a five -yea r cooperative agreement in early FY 2009, which ran concurrently with the Advanced LIGO MREFC project. Following approval by the National Science Board in August 2013, the cooperative agreement was renewed at the beginning of FY 2014 for five additional years, overlapping the conclusion of Adv anced LIGO construction and the start of commissioning and scientific operation. NSF conducted a detailed consideration of whether or not to recompete the management of LIGO and det ermined that it would be in the best interest of U.S. science and engineering to renew the LIGO operating award at the end of FY 2018. Accordingly, NSF has requested and is in the process of reviewing a renewal proposal with the intent of submitting a request to the NSB in May 2018 for authorization to continue support.

Without this action, the FY 2019 change over FY 2017 would be -$400,000, or -0.11 percent.National High Funding1 FL is managed by Florida State University (FSU), and consists of facilities at FSU, the University of Florida (UF), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). NHMFL develops and operates high magnetic field facilities that scientists and engineers use for research in condensed matter and material physics, materials science and engineering, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, neuroscience, energy, and the environment. It is the world's premier high magnetic field laboratory with a comprehensive collection of high-performing m agnet systems and extensive support services. The facilities are available to all qualified scientists and engineers through a peer -reviewed proposal process. There are approximately 1,500 users per year, including faculty and staff at the three host insti tutions. Stewardship and oversight of NHMFL is provided through the MPS Division of Materials Research (DMR), a nd the Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT -ICR) Laboratory is overseen by the MPS Division of Chemistry (CHE). T he laboratory is an internationally recognized leader in magnet design, development, and construction, including the development of new superconducting materials. Many unique magnet systems have been designed, developed, and built by the Magnet Science and Technology Division of NHMFL. Since 2012, the laboratory has held the world's record for the highest nondestructive, pulsed magnetic field at 100.75 Tesla, a unit of magnetic strength (magnetic flux density ). The 45 Tesla magnet currently provides the highest steady -state magnetic fields in the world for user access. T his world record has been held for more than a decade. Recently, NHMFL's new 36 Tesla Series- Connected Hybrid (SCH) magnet has reached its performance milestone of no change in magnetic fiel d stability and homogeneity greater than 1 part per million (ppm) across the sampling volume. This stability has enabl ed the world's fi rst nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum at 1.5 GHz which opens a window for chemists and biologists to probe greater numbers of elements in the periodic table. T he field strength of this 36 T esla magnet design exceed s those of other all-superconducting magnets by 62 percent, and those of all -resistive magnets with similar bore size and uniformity by 44 percent. Both the 45 T esla and 36 Tesla magnets enable scientists to gain new insights into the electronic structures of novel materials such as graphene, topological insulators, and high temperature superconductors I n 2009, a $15.0 million award funded through CHE enabled the purchase of a 21 Tesla magnet for the construction of a FT -ICR spectrometer. The FT -ICR instrument opened for user operations in October 2015. This 21 Tesla FT- ICR is unprecedented in sensitivity and selectivity, capable of analyzing chemical samples of great complexity, such as biological fluids, biofuels, and raw and weathered petroleum. The system impacts a broad array of research areas, such as chemistry, molecular biology, and earth science. A major scientific impact from NHMFL is expected from the research on quantum materials conducted by users using the record- setting NHMFL magnets. These magnets allow for the exhibition, identification, and visualization of new and unusual quantum effects that lead to deeper understanding of quantum materials and enables the discovery of new ones.

NNCI comprises 16 independent awards to universities around the N ation as user facility sites in nanotechnology. NNCI represents a model in which NSF selects and manages each university site in the network rather than a single lead institution with collaborating partners as in the previous NNIN, thus providing more flexibility in awardee selection and management, and more agility in addressing emerging user facility needs in nanoscale research and education. The 16 NNCI sites involve 29 universities and other partner organizations located in 17 states. The NNCI sites provide researchers in academia, small and large companies, and government with access to university user facilities with leading - edge fabrication and characterization tools, instrumentation, and expertise within all disciplines of nanoscale science, engineering and technology, thus helping to catalyze new discoveries in science and engineering and to stimulate technological innovation. A Coordinating Office at the Georgia Institute of Tech nology was selected in FY 2016 through externally reviewed proposals from among the awarded sites to enhance the impact of NNCI as a nati onal infrastructure network of user facility sites. The director of the Coordinating Office is a key individual for developing management strategies and operational plans in concert with the site directors of the individual user facilities, and serves as the principal contact person with NSF. The individual NNCI sites have autonomy in their operation and management but are required to act in concert with the Coordinating Office. The Coordinating Office has established a comprehensive web portal to ensure close linkage among the individual facility websites to present a unified face to the user community of overall tools, instruments, and capabilities. 18 It is harmonizing capabilities for modeling and simulation across sites and interaction with NanoHUB of the NSF-supported Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). It is coordinating and disseminating best practices for national -level education and outreach programs, as well as instruction across sites in social and ethical implications of nanotechnology. It is establishing uniform methods for assessment and quantifiable metrics of site performance and impact ; and is also engaging all sites in a planning process to explore emerging areas of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology that can lead to new research opportunities and future growth of the external user base. The broad scope of NNCI sites coverage includes materials, structures, devices, and systems in areas of physics, chemistry, materials sciences, mechanical systems, geosciences, geophysical, geochemical, environmental sciences, biology, life sciences, synthetics biology, fabrication in soft matter including biological interfaces, biomedicine, electronics, optics, magnetics, molecular synthesis, molecular scale devices, manufacturing conce pts, modeling and simulation, social and ethical implications of nanotechnology, and education and outreach. The individual award sites are intended to support a rich user base with broad accessibility and affordable user fee structure. NSF funds leverage those of university and other resources to grow the numbers of external users, including those from companies and academia. Sites embrace a culture of open access to researchers for any research project of merit, with protection of intellectual property, and mechanisms for encouraging non- traditional users from diverse disciplines. They also have an organizational structure that facilitates coordination of complex process steps and tools for 18 NNCI Coordinating Office web portal, www.NNCI.net Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 36 integrated tasks and acceptance of experimental risks associated w ith non- standard processes and materials. Nanotechnology facilities provide unique opportunities to infuse innovative education with research at the frontiers of the field. Award sites are providing focused strategies for integrating pioneering science a nd engineering with education, including plans for assessing effectiveness and spreading promising practices. Sites having particular expertise in the social and ethical implications of nanotechnology have integrated study and dissemination of those aspect s into their activities that can leverage their user community base, which relate to the capabilities of their respective user facilities. NNCI collects annual user data from October 1 to September 30 each year. In Year 1, the total number of unique users (internal and external) was 60,675, with 2 ,561 external users (23.9 percent ). External users were composed of 1 ,151 academic users and 1 ,410 industry users (65 percent from small companies). There has been steady growth in these numbers. In Year 2, there were 12,447 total users, with 3,171 external users (25.5 percent ). Year 2 external users include 1 ,504 academic and 1 ,667 industry users (61 percent from small companies).

External Structure: The NNCI Coordinating Office is led by a director, deputy director , and three associate directors who manage the network in specific areas: education and outreach programs, societal and ethical implications (SEI) activities, and computational activities and facilitates interactions with nanoHUB/NCN at Purdue University. The core staff is guided by an executive committee , which includes the 16 NNCI site directors. T he NNCI Executive Committee meets monthly via teleconference/WebEx and annually in person at the NNCI Conference. The NNCI Executive Committee and Coordinating Office are advised by an external advisory board comprised of members representing industry, academia, government, education and outreach, SEI, computation and non- traditional disciplines in nanoscience and nanoengineering. Several subcommittees of the NNCI Executive Committee work to address high- level issues related to the NNCI network, such as new equipment and research opportunities, workforce development, diversity, and building the user base. An annual NNCI Conference organized by the NNCI C oordinating O ffice is held at different network sites to highlight the research supported by the NNCI faci lities and to provide a venue to share best practices. The first of two annual NNCI Conferences was held at Georgia Tech in January 2017 covering FY 2016 activities and the second, covering FY 2017 activities, at the University of Pennsylvania in October 2017. Reviews: Reviews are being conducted through annual reverse site reviews at NSF. The awardees submit comprehensive annual project reports to NSF in advance of each annual review. The annual project reports contain a program plan and budget for the next year's funding increment. Each annual review of a site focuses on the quality of performance and management under the cooperative agreement. Data collection is consistent with NSF policies for information collection.

Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 38 NATIONAL SUPERCONDUCTING CYCLOTRON LABORATORY $24,000,000 2019 RequestChange over FY 2017 Actual NS CL is a national user facility based at Michigan State University (MSU). With two linked superconducting cyclotrons, K500 and K1200, it is the leading rare isotope research facility in the U.S. and is a world leader in nuclear physics with the unique capability of producing radioactive beams at energies relevant to nuclear astrophysics. Funding for NSCL also supports the research program of the MSU nuclear science faculty. N SCL scientists employ a range of tools for conducting advanced research in fundamental nuclear science, nuclear astrophysics, and accelerator physics. Applications of research conducted at NSCL benefit society in numerous areas, including studies on the effects of ionizing radiation on DNA, tests of detectors to be used in space missions, development of data acquisition systems and software, and homeland security. The K500 was the first cyclotron to use superconducting magnets, and the K1200 is the highest -energy continuous beam accelerator in the world. Through the Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF), heavy ions are accelerated by the K500 and then injected into the K1200, enabling the production of rare unstable isotopes at much higher intensities. The laboratory operates an MSU -funded reaccelerator facility (ReA3) that enables experiments at very low energies \u2014a domain of particular interest to nuclear astrophysics. NSCL is the only facility in the world to provide radioactive beams in this energy regime. Nearly one third of recently proposed experiments will use the ReA3. The mix of experiments is determined by proposals for beam use. An external program advisory committee selects the best proposals at a typical success rate of about 50 percent, with constraints on bea m availability. The science output of NSCL is driven by these experiments, with most running five to fifteen days. S cientists at NSCL work at the forefront of rare isotope research. They make and study atomic nuclei that cannot be found on Earth and perf orm experimental research using beams of unstable isotopes to extend our knowledge of new types of nuclei, many of which are important to understanding stellar processes. Research activities include a broad program in nuclear astrophysics studies, the stud ies of nuclei far from stability using radioactive ion beams, and studies of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, research is carried out in accelerator physics. N SCL supports and enhances doctorate graduate education and post -doctoral research experiences. About 10 percent of all doctorates granted in nuclear physics in the U.S. are based on research at NSCL. The lab also provides research experiences for undergraduate students, K -12 students, and K- 12 teachers. Graduate st udent Andrew Miller aligning instrumentation on an optical table .

NSF oversight is provided through annual site visits by the cognizant program officer in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Physics (MPS /PHY) and other staff, accompanied by external experts. The NSF program officer monitors lab operations and plans through monthly phone conferences with the NSCL director. NSF uses the annual site reviews to assess the user program, operations, maintenance, facility efficiency, national and international research developments, and in- house research programs. The program director consults regularly with the NSF Large Facilities Office, the MPS Facilities Coordinator, and the NSF Division of Acqui sition and Cooperative Support. External Structure: MSU provides add ed support for NSCL, which is managed by a director and three associate directors (experimental research, education and outreach, and operations) as well as a chief scientist. The director has the authority to appoint associate directors and designate responsibilities, notifying NSF of changes. NSCL's research program is guided by a program advisory committee of external experts as well as an in -house expert and the chairperson of the NSCL user group. Opportunities for proposal submission occur once a year and the beam hour backlog is no longer than two years. Optimally the laboratory can provide about 5,000 beam hours to the scientific community each year, with actual output depending upon facility reliability factors and available funds. Reviews: An in -depth review in FY 2016 looked at results and achievements related to intellectual merit and broader impacts for the past four years (FY 2012 -FY 2015) as well as a review of proposed research, operations, and maintenance funding for the next five years (FY 2017-FY 2021). The most recent annual review took place in April 2017. The report expressed overwhelming support for the management and operations of NSCL. The next review is planned for April 2018. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination NSCL currently operates under a cooperative a greement with MSU, which is d ue to expire in FY 2021. After that time NSCL will transition to the new Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) , which is being built by the Department of Energy (DOE) on the NSCL site. FRIB is scheduled to become operational in FY 2022 and will use much of the NSCL beamlines, instrumentation, and general infrastructure. NSF anticipates ending support for the operations component of NSCL when CCF operations cease so that FRIB can be integrated into the NSCL beamlines and FRIB become operational. MSU will be the performing institution under a cooperative agreement with DOE for the future FRIB. To facilitate interagency planning and coordinate the transition from the NSF -funded NSCL to the DOE -funded FRIB, a Joint Oversight Group (JOG) of DOE and NSF personnel has been meeting since 2010. DOE and NSF will coordinate transfer of facility stewardship as it transitions from NSCL to FRIB. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 40 NATURAL HAZARDS ENGINEERING RESEARCH $11,750,000 INFRASTRUCTURE (NHERI) -$3,240,000 / Actual includes $2.49 million in forward fundingNatural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2017 Actual1FY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestChange over FY 2017 Actual The Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure program was established in 2015 by NSF as a distributed, multi -user, national research facility for use by the Nation's natural hazards engineering research community. NHERI facilities provide researc hers access to large, shared, state-of-the- art facilities, unavailable through any other agency, to study the performance of civil infrastructure, including buildings, geostructures, and underground structures, to individual natural hazards, and to combinations of natural hazards. These facilities are essential research infrastructure to support two federally -mandated interagency programs: the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. The portfolio of research investigations, which is funded separately through NSF's highly competitive, parallel proposal evaluation process, involves large scale experimentation linked to numerical modeling, and collection and sharing of data to increase the knowledge g leaned from investment in these facilities. Such research is essential to the development of more comprehensive and more realistic predictive models of how civil infrastructure responds to earthquake, wind, storm surge, and tsunami loading. These advances, in turn, enable the design of more hazard- resilient civil infrastructure and improved safety for citizens during these events. The research infrastructure includes earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities; a post - disaster, rapid response r esearch (RAPID) facility; cyberinfrastructure; computational modeling and simulation tools; and a research data repository. The research infrastructure investment also supports education and community outreach activities. During FY 2015 and FY 2016, NHER I was established by NSF through eleven cooperative agreements: Network Coordination Office (NCO) at Purdue University, Cyberinfrastructure (CI) at the University of Texas at Austin, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter) at the Universi ty of California, Berkeley, Twelve -Fan Wall of Wind at Florida International University, Large -Scale, Multi -Directional, Hybrid Simulation Testing Capabilities at Lehigh University, Large Wave Flume and Directional Wave Basin at Oregon State University, Geotechnical Centrifuges at the University of California, Davis, Large, High -Performance Outdoor Shake Table at the University of California, San Diego, Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel, Wind Load and Dynamic Flow Simulators, and Pressure Loading Actuators at the University of Florida, Large, Mobile Dynamic Shakers for Field Testing at the University of Texas at Austin, and RAPID Facility at the University of Washington. The NCO serves as the national and international scientific leader, community focal point, and network - wide coordinator for NHERI governance and community- building activities. Key activities include convening the governance groups, working with the Council of Awardees to develop consensus -based FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 41 policies and procedures for NHERI, and the annual Council work plan, implementing the facility scheduling protocol to provide user access to the experimental facilities, leading development of a community science plan, running NHERI -wide education and community outreach programs, and building strategic partne rships. NHERI awardees and the natural hazards engineering community work together, through governance and awardee activities, to establish a shared vision for NHERI, set natural hazards engineering research and education agendas and priorities, and make N HERI a highly value -added and productive research infrastructure. The CI awardee serves as the integrator for enabling NHERI to be a virtual organization for the natural hazards engineering community, by providing an array of information, resources, and services, including the definitive NHERI website; data repository (Data Depot); software service delivery platform with computational modeling, simulation, and educational tools (Discovery Workspace); collaboration tools; access to high performance computing resources; and user training and support. The CI awardee also establishes and implements the NHERI- wide cybersecurity plan with all NHERI awardees. The SimCenter develops a portfolio of computational modeling and simulation software and educational modules that reflects a balance of community -prioritized, new capabilities for earthquake, wind, and multi - hazard engineering research and education. The SimCenter's tools are integrated into the CI awardee's Discovery Workspace. The experimental facilities provide well- maintained and fully- functioning facilities, services, and staffing to enable earthquake engineering, wind engineering, and post -disaster, rapid response research requiring experimental work and data collection. Data generated by these experimental resources and their users are archived and shared in the publ icly accessible NHERI Data Depot. Along with direct operations and maintenance support for NHERI awardees, NSF provides separate support for research to be conducted at the NEHRI experimental facilities through ongoing research and education programs. The support for such activities is primarily provided through the Engineering for Civil Infrastructure (ECI) core research program in the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) division in ENG. $12.00 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in FY 2019.Total Obligations for NHERI (Dollars in Millions) FY 2017 (TBD)FY Management and NSF Structure: The NSF Program Officer for NHERI is located within ENG/CMMI. The Deputy Director of the Large Facilities Office in the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management provides advice and assistance. External Structure: Each NHERI awardee is led by a principal investigator (PI), who is responsible for the overall award operations. The NCO awardee coordinates NHERI governance and network activities. Governance is comprised of the following groups: (a) a Council, which consists of the PI of each NHERI award, to provide collective and coordinated leadership for NHERI as a national facility, (b) Network Independent Advisory Committee, with diverse representation from the broad scientific and engineering communities served by NHERI, to provide independent external guidance and advice to the Council, (c) User Forum, consisting of representatives from the broad scientific and engineering communities served by NHERI, and (d) Council -identified committees, comprised of internal awardee staff and/ or users, to advise the Council on community priorities and needs for NHERI. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 42 Reviews: NSF provides oversight to NHERI awardees through cooperative agreements. Individual and joint awardee operations and activities are reviewed through quarterly and annual project reports submitted by awardees, and site visit reviews, as well as reverse site visit reviews, conducted by NSF program officers . R enewal/Competition/Termination In FY 2010, NSF supported two studies to assess the need for earthquakeengineering experimental and cyberinfrastructure facilities beyond 2014, as described in the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) NSF 10 -071. One study, a w orkshop held by the National Research Council on the GrandChallenges in Earthquake Engineering Research, was completed in FY 2011, a nd the second study was completed in FY 2012. These studies provided inputto NSF for the determination of s upport for future earthquake engineeringresearch infrastructure beyond FY 2014. T he plan to support a smaller \"second generation\" Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ( NEES) (NEES2) during FY 2015- 2019 was presented to the National Science Board at their July 2012 meeting and described in DCL NSF 12 - 107.20 The plan proposed a lower annual operations budget, reflected in the $8.0 million reduction from FY 2014 in the FY 2015 Budget Request, from $20.0 million to $12.0 million, to allow larger investment in earthquake engineering research using NHERI facilities. In 2012, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and NSF jointly supported a workshop that led to a roadmap report for measurement science research and development for windstorm and coastalinundation impact reduction, which was published in January 2014. 21 I n February 2013, NSF released solicitation NSF 13- 537 to compete and operate NEES2 for FY 2015- FY 2019. Based on the merit review of proposals submitted under NSF 13-537, NSF made no award. Based on the above studies and report, NSF established the plan for NHERI in FY 2014. This led to therelease of solicitations NSF 14 -605 and NSF 15- 598 to establish NHERI through two competitions. Those competitions were completed in FY 2016. Awards for NHERI operations involve commitmentsfor five years, contingent on available funds and satisfactory performance. During 2018 and 2019, ENG will develop a post -NHERI decadal science plan for natural hazards engineering research, education, and research infrastructure. NSF will use this decadal science plan as input for natural hazards engineering research infrastructure support beyond 2019.19 19 http://nsf.gov/pubs/2010/nsf10071/nsf10071.jsp 20 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12107/nsf12107.jsp 21 www.nist.gov/customcf/g et_pdf.cfm?pub_id=915541 The above image displays the University of California, San Diego outdoor shake table, which allows large structures to be tested against seismic activity.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 43 OCEAN OBSERVATORIES INITIATIVE (OOI) $40,000,000 The Ocean Observatories Initiative began in FY 2009 as a MREFC construction project. In FY 2016, OOI transitioned from the MREFC construction effort to the management and operations phase and is now referred to as the OOI Program. OOI is a networked ocean -focused research observatory with arrays of instrumented buoys, profilers, gliders, and autonomous vehicles within different open -ocean and coastal regions, as well as a cabled array of instrumented platforms and profilers on or above the seafloor over the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. This networked system of instruments, platforms, and arrays enables researchers to examine complex, interlinked physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes operating throughout the coastal regions and to investigate a spectrum of phenomena and processes including episodic, short -lived events (meteorological, tectonic, volcanic, geological, geophysical, and ecol ogical), and more subtle, long -term changes and emergent phenomena in ocean systems (circulation patterns, climate change, ocean acidity, geophysical events, and ecosystem trends). The OOI facility provides the public, educators, students, and researchers with: (1) OOI long- term time series data sets (raw data and metadata are processed via conventional algorithms and quality control methods); (2) an in- situ ocean laboratory capability to allow OOI users to submit proposals for development and application of new technologies by connecting their instruments or concepts to the OOI network; and (3) OOI tools that will support undergraduate classroom applications of the OOI, as well as public outreach through informal education. Currently, t he OOI delivers data /metadata and education tools to the public via the internet at www.oceanobservatories.org. As originally conceived, the overarching scientific themes of the OOI span ned six multi -disciplinary domains, and each theme incorporates a multitude of research q uestions. Ocean -Atmosphere Exchange. Quantifying the air -sea exchange of energy and mass, especially during high winds, is critical to providing estimates of energy and gas exchange between the surface and deep ocean, and improving the predictive capability of storm forecasting and climate-change models. Climate Variability, Ocean Circulation, and Ecosystems . As both a reservoir and distributor of heat and carbon dioxide, the ocean modifies climate, and is also affected by it. Understanding how climate variability will affect ocean circulation, weather patterns, the ocean's biochemical environment, and marine ecosystems is a compelling driver for multidisciplinary observations. Turbulent Mixing and Biophysical Interactions . Mixing occurs over a broad range of scales and plays a major role in transferring energy, materials, and organisms throughout the global ocean. Mixing has a profound influence on primary productivity, plankton community structure, biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon sequestration) i n the surface and the deep ocean, and the transport of material to the deep ocean. Coastal Ocean Dynamics and Ecosystems. Understanding the spatial and temporal complexity of the coastal ocean is a long -standing challenge. Quantifying the interactions betw een atmospheric and terrestrial forcing, and coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes, is critical to elucidating the role of coastal margins in the global carbon cycle, and developing strategies for managing coastal Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 44 resources. Fluid -Rock Interactions and the Subseafloor Biosphere. The oceanic crust contains the largest aquifer on Earth. Thermal circulation and reactivity of seawater -derived fluids modifies the mineralogy of oceanic crust and sediments, leads to the formation of hydrothermal vents that support unique micro- and macro -biological communities, and concentrates methane to form massive methane gas and methane hydrate reservoirs. The role that transient events (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and slope failures) play in these fluid -rock interactions and in the dynamics of benthic and sub- seafloor microbial communities remain largely unknown. Plate -Scale, Ocean Geodynamics . Lithospheric movements and interactions at plate boundaries at or beneath the seafloor are responsible for s hort-term events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. These tectonically active regions are also host to the densest hydrothermal and biological activity in the ocean basins. The degree to which active plate boundaries influence the ocean from a physical, chemical, and biological perspective are largely unexplored. Current Status The OOI infrastructure is operating, transmitting ocean data to storage, and incrementally delivering processed datasets and data products via the website. Refurbishment and redeployments of the moorings, instruments, and platforms are planned and executed. Data quality management is maturing and the OOI science team is conducting outreach to the science community on the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) m ethods and procedures being used. The FY 2017 budget of $340,000 reflected only the incremental support necessary to enable the potential transition of managing institutions associated with the competition for a new operation and m anagement award of the O OI. Operating and managing the OOI currently costs $ 50.0 million annually, and was reduced to $44.0 million during the current recompetition expected to be completed by the end of FY 2018. In FY 2018, NSF decommissioned and removed the Global Array in the Argentine Basin. The Global Array in the Southern Ocean was partially removed and planning is ongoing with an international partner to complete the removal of the remaining components and reinstall the Surface Mooring at their cost in Fall 2018. Operations plans at the FY 2019 Request level of $40.0 million will be developed in partnership with the awardee and research community to maximize the scientific return of the facility. FY 2020 FY 2021 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES The Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL) is the current awardee for OOI operations and maintenance. COL has major sub -awardees on the OOI program t eam to operate and maintain the marine infrastructure, manage the scientific data, and operate the cyberinfrastructure. The University of Washington operates the OOI Cabled Array. Oregon State University currently operates the Coastal Endurance Array. Wood s Hole Oceanographic Institution operates the Pioneer Coastal Array as well as the Global Arrays at the two remaining (in FY 2018) OOI global sites. Rutgers University currently manages the OOI data as well as the cyberinfrastructure and education and public outreach. Raytheon Corporation currently provides project management support, systems engineering, and software services for the OOI cyberinfrastructure. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in GEO manages OOI op erations located within the Integrative Programs Section. The oversight includes the review of observatory metrics and data quality management, as well as integration of the OOI with any new science or infrastructure proposals. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 45 External Structure: The OOI Program has a Science Oversight Committee (SOC) which provides input and guidance internally to COL for OOI infrastructure planning and management. In FY 2017, NSF established the nine member \"Ocean Observatories Initiative Facility Board' (OOIFB) to provi de input and guidance regarding the management and operation of the OOI. The OOIFB is independent of the SOC and held several formal meetings during FY 2017 and FY 2018. Reviews: In December 201 7, NSF conducted a review of the OOI Glider Operations Progra m component. NSF is considering a n Operations and Management review in c alendar year 2018 before the planned closeout of the COL cooperative agreement in September 2018. Operations Costs Operations and Management in support of scientific research began in FY 2013 with the deployment of the first OOI instruments. The associated costs have been and will continue to be supported by OCE, with temporary support from the GEO's Division of Integrative and Collaborative Education and Research from FY 2015- 2017. Support for research utilizing observatory data will be through the standard NSF proposal submission process to existing science programs in OCE, however, because the data is freely available over the internet, researchers around the world will have access t o the unique data sets OOI is producing regardless of the source of their support. Education and Outreach The OOI website and cyber infrastructure provides an education portal to enable undergraduate level tools for education. The internal OOI SOC actively conducts outreach activities regarding the ocean science datasets to researchers, public, and education users. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The OOI Operations and M anagement cooperative agreement with COL has been extended until September 30, 2018. A re -competition for the award was initiated in FY 2016 and is planned for completion by September 30, 2018.

OPP cont racts with a prime contractor for science support, operations, the leasing of research vessels, and the maintenance of the Antarctic stations and related infrastructure in New Zealand and Chile. The contractor is selected through a competitive process. Rot ary and fixed -wing aircraft used in support of research are also provided through separate competitively -awarded contracts. Other agencies and contractors provide technical support in areas of expertise such as engineering, construction, and communications . Following a major refurbishment program, the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) Polar Star returned to service in 2014 and is successfully providing annual icebreaking services for the Mc Murdo Station resupply effort. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: OPP staff, including subject matter experts in operational and scientific disciplines, have overall responsibility for funding and managing Polar Facilities under the U.S. Antarctic Program FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 47 (USAP); NSF budgets for and manages USAP on behalf of the Nation. This includes planning all activities and overseeing contractors. OPP's Antarctic Sciences section funds merit -reviewed research proposals for which access to Antarctica is essential to advancing the scientific frontiers and that can only be achieved or are best achieved with research work in/on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Research is conducted in a broad array of geo - and bio- sciences, including earth system science, and space and astrophysical sciences. The Antarctic Infrastructure and Logistics section enables research in Antarctica on behalf of the U.S. government through a network of stations, labs, equipment, and logistical resources. The Environment, Health, and Safety section oversees the environmental, health, and safety aspects of research and operations conducted in Polar Regions. External Structure: The Antarctic prime support contract is currently held by Leidos Innovations Corporation. There are many separate subcontractors for supplies and technical services, and otherservices are procured through separate competitively -bid contracts. Reviews: OPP evaluates the performance of the Antarctic support contractor annually via an Award Fee Plan, which involves multiple tiers of review, including a Performance Evaluation Board (PEB)composed of representatives from OPP and the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management (BFA). In additi on, OPP's performance is reviewed externally by Committees of Visitors and the Office of Polar Programs Advisory Committee. The USAP Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) released a report on itsrevie w of the program in July 2012.22 The NSF response to the USAP BRP repo rt was released in March 2013.23 Current Status All facilities (stations, research vessels, and field camps) are currently operating normally. The USAP BRP report concluded that ushering in a new age of Antarctic science simply by expanding traditional methods of logistical support would be prohibitively costly. Instead, it recommended numerous ways to more efficiently and cost -effectively support research while maintaining high standards of safety and increasing the flexibility to support evolving scien ce foci in the future. Continued progress is planned to implement BRP recommendations, including investment in prioritized lifecycle acquisitions. For example, p lans are under development to upgrade satellite communications systems to support operations and research and to replace the Palmer Station pier to ensure long -term access to uniqu e r esearch in the peninsula region. The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project is currently movin g t oward the final stages of design. FY 2019 funds will be used to complete the designs of all construction components, begin the site preparation work for the backbone utilities and the initial buildings such as the Vehicle and Equipment Operations Center, and procure the first phases of construction materials . The AIMS project will redevelop McMurdo Station to be a consolidate d, co st effective facility , including modernized utilities distribution and fire protection. For additional information on AIMS see the OPP narrative .

A five- year contract for helicopter support was awarded to PHI, Inc. of Lafayette, Louisiana. A five- year contract for fixed -wing aviation services, currently held by Kenn Borek Air of Calgary, Canada, is now under competition. U.S. policy directs NSF to maintain an active and influential presence in Antarctica, including year - round occupation of South Pole Station and two coastal stations. As the scientific forefronts addressed there evolve over time, so do the research emphases at the three stations and the infrastructure needed to support them. Polar Logistics Polar Logistics consists of two activities: the U.S. Antarctic Logistical Support program within the Antarctic Infrastructure and Logistics section, and the Research Support and Logistics program within the Arctic Sciences section. FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES The FY 2019 Budget Request for Polar Logistics is $1 10.33 million. The U.S. Antarctic Logistical Support program funds support activities provided by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). DoD operates as a logistical support provider on a cost -reimbursable basis. Major funding elements of DoD support include: military personnel, LC -130 flight operations, and maintenance support through the 109th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard in Scotia, New York, and Antarctica; transportation and training of military personnel supporting the USAP; support for air traffic control, weather forecasting, and ground electronics maintenance through the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command; the charter of Air Mo bility Command airlift and Military Sealift Command ships for the re -supply of McMurdo Station; bulk fuel purchased from the Defense Logistics Agency; and reimbursement for use of DoD satellites for communications. The Research Support and Logistics progr am in the Arctic Sciences section of OPP responds to science supported by the section. Funding is provided directly to grantees or to key organizations that provide or manage Arctic research support and logistics. A contractor provides research support and logistics services for NSF -sponsored activities in the Arctic. Additional major support components include: access to USCG and other icebreakers, University -National Oceanographic Laboratory (UNOLS) vessels and coastal boats; access to fixed - and rotary-w ing airlift support; assets at Toolik Field Station, University of Alaska Fairbanks' field station for ecological research on Alaska's North Slope; safety training for field researchers and funding for field safety experts; global satellite telephones for emergency response and improved logistics coordination; and development of a network of strategically placed U.S. observatories linked to similar efforts in Europe and Canada.

Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 50 SEISMOLOGICAL FACILITIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT $24,160,000 OF GEOSCIENCE AND EARTHSCOPE (SAGE) $24.16 -$1.04 -4.1%(Dollars in Millions)Seismological Facilities for Earthscope Funding 2017 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestChange over FY 2017 Actual The Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience and EarthScope comprise a distributed, multi- user, national facility for the development, deployment, and operational support of modern digital seismic instrumentation to serve national goals in basic research and education in the earth sciences, earthquake research, global real- time earthquake monitoring, and nuclear test ban verification. SAGE is managed and operated for NSF by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), a consortium of 125 U.S. universities and non- profit institutions with research and teaching programs in seismology, 21 educational affiliates, three U.S. affiliates, and 128 foreign affiliates. SAGE was formed in late FY 2013 from the seismic components of the EarthScope facility and seismic facilities previously managed by IRIS. The FY 2019 Budget Request will enable SAGE to provide key services for the geoscience research community, including global and regional observing networks, field and technical suppor t for experiments worldwide, data management and distribution systems, and other related activities. FY 2020 FY 2021 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestESTIMATES The Earth's interior remains a major scientific frontier holding the key to understanding the origin of the planet. Recent dev elopments in seismic sensor design and the acquisition, transmission, and storage of data have resulted in dramatic improvements in the resolving power of seismic imaging of the interior of the Earth . To serve the research needs of the broad Earth science community, SAGE is organized under three primary service areas: Instrumentation Services The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) consists of over 150 permanently -installed broadband digital seismic stations, most of which have real -time data access. GSN stations provide critical data for a range of global Earth science research, and support key national security needs such as nuclear test-ban treaty verification and natural hazards warning and response. GSN is operated in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Portable Seismology (PS) includes a pool of over 5,200 portable seismometers that are made available to the E arth science research community for a wide range of principal investigator -driven experiments largely funded through the NSF merit review process to study a wide range of Earth processes. Polar Support Services (PSS) supports the development of specialized seismic equipment for use in harsh environments and provides instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments i n the polar regions. The Transportable Array (TA) is a continental- scale seismic observatory designed to provide a foundation for multi -scale integrated studies of continental lithosphere and deep Earth structure. Over 1,700 TA stations operated across the lower 48 states and southern Ontario and Quebec, Canada, FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 51 between 2004 and 2015. The full 280- station TA network is now deployed in Alaska and western Canada . These stations collect data for use in studies of natural hazards including earthquakes, volcanoe s, and tsunami; the plate tectonic process that have formed Alaska; Earth's magnetic field; and Earth's changing climate. The Magnetotelluric (MT) component exploits the natural variations in Earth's magnetic and electric fields to provide information on the distribution and composition of fluids in Earth's crust and upper mantle, which gives constraints on Earth's structure that are complementary to those resulting from seismology. Instrumentation Services- Coordinated Activities include efforts to develop the next generation of seismic instrumentation for large -scale scientific experiments; global- scale geophysical networks; and training courses to distribute best practices to partners worldwide. Data Services SAGE Data Services (DS) manages an archive of over 450 terabytes of seismic, magnetotelluric, and other data from all SAGE components, the EarthScope program, and numerous affiliated networks; operates automated and manual systems to ensure the quality of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. In the last quarter of FY 2017, more than 20 ,000 unique users downloaded over 136 TB of data from the SAGE archive. These data enable the wide range of Earth science studies described above. Education and Public Outreach The SAGE Education and Public Outreach (EPO) program enables audiences beyond seismologists to access and use seismological data and research, including student internships, and programs for under- resourced educational institutions. Besides its role in providing the observational data essential for basic Earth science research, SAGE supports community activities including scientific and technical workshops that bring together the internationa l seismic community and publications designed to communicate SAGE activities and results to the community. SAGE also provides real -time seismic data to the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for global earthquake, volcano, and tsunami monitoring , and enables international seismic monitoring of compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. SAGE is heavily involved in partnership activities, many international in nature. Because GSN stations are hosted by a variety of local organizations, installation and operation of the GSN has put IRIS in contact with scientists, as well as government al and non- governmental organizations, from around the world. Many international GSN stations are designated as the official stations for nuclear test ban monitoring in their host countries . For all these purposes, Federal agencies in partnership with NSF have provided substantial support for accelerated development of the GSN, shared operation and maintenance of the GSN, and accelerated development of the PS instrument pool. The EarthScope, Geophysics, GeoPRISMS, and Tectonics Programs in the Division of Earth Sciences (EAR); the GeoPRISMS and Marine Geology and Geophysics Programs in the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE); and the Geology a nd Geophysics Program and the Glaciology Program in the Antarctic Research Section of OPP provide most of the funds, totaling approximately $15.0 million annually, for NSF - sponsored research making use of SAGE. Funds permit deployment of portable seismic i nstruments and use of data managed by DS to solve major Earth science problems. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) in the Directorate for Geosciences, through its Instrumentation & Facilities program (IF), provide s general oversight of SAGE to help assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of SAGE programs and Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 52 projects with other NSF -supported facilities, and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of IRIS in managing and operating SAGE. The EAR Division Director and Integrated Activities Section Head provide other internal oversight. External Structure: SAGE is managed and operated by IRIS, which is incorporated as a non- profit consortium representing 125 U.S. universities and non-profit organizations with research and teaching programs in seismology. Each voting member institution of the Consortium appoints a member representative, and these member representatives elect the nine members of the IRIS Board of Directors. The Board members, who serve three- year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with SAGE management and operation, through consultation with IRIS staff and SAGE advisory committees (one for each major SAGE com ponent and additional ad hoc working groups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president of IRIS to a renewable two - year term. The president is responsible for IRIS operations, all of which are managed through the IRIS Corporat e Office located in Washington, DC. Reviews: All major ongoing geoscience facilities routinely undergo reviews of their management, in addition to peer review of proposals for new or continued support. The formal NSF merit review of the five-year proposal for the SAGE facility took place in 2012 and 2013. Although the ad hoc reviewers and two independent review panels had a number of specific recommendations at the working level for SAGE, overall the review found that SAGE was a critical facility for U.S. a nd international Earth sciences. Furthermore, the reviewers found that IRIS is a well -managed and effective organization that has, through its commitment to the collection and open dissemination of the highest quality seismological data, transformed the discipline of seismology. In 2015, an external review of the GSN component of SAGE found that management of GSN by IRIS has been exemplary. R enewal/Recompetition/Termination Funding for the SAGE cooperative agreement began in FY 2014 and ends in FY 2018. In FY 2016, in keeping with the phased integration and recompetition plan presented to the National Science Board in December 2009, NSF solicited proposals to manage and operate one or more components of a new facility to support the Earth sciences research and education community. These components are currently supported by SAGE and the related Geodesy Advancing Geoscience s and EarthScope facility . The new distributed, multi- user, national facility would support the development, deployment, management, and operational support of modern geodetic, seismic, and related geophysical instrumentation and provide services to serve national goals in basic research and education in the Earth sciences. As part of a robust re- competition and cost review process, various NSF oversight activities have been completed and others are currently underway, such as an independent cost assessment s to inform NSF's cost analysis for a potential award.

Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 54 ActualFY 2018 (TBD)FY 2019 Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : NCAR leverages NSF support with funding provided by other federal agencies and non- federal sources. In FY 2017, NCAR received approximately $38.30 million in support from other federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy, and the Federal Aviation Administration, and $20.0 million from non- federal sources. This funding supports research collaboration that enhance NCAR's NSF -supported research goals or facilities missions. Major Investments in FY 2019 : In FY 2019, investments at NCAR will focus on fundamental research aimed at improving our ability to predict atmospheric, chemical, and space weather hazards, and increasing our understanding of the variability in the Earth's climate system at regional and global scales. In all of these areas, NCAR scientists will work with their university colleagues to further understand the fundamental processes that control the Earth's climate and weather systems. This will include research thrusts in areas such as the role of the chemical composition of the atmosphere, better understanding of the structure and nature of hurricanes and other severe weather events, and the impacts of processes on the surface of the Sun on space weather and weather on Earth. A continuous process of community prioritization will inform activities undertaken in FY 2019. Aircraft Support : NCAR operates two NSF aircraft: a C -130Q Hercules and a Gulfstream -V (the 'G -V'), both of which are highly modified and equipped with specialized instrumentation, to enable the support of research activities designed to provide new insights into atmospheric chemical processes, the dynamics and coupling of the atmosphere's layers, and interactions between the atmosphere and Earth's surface. The two aircraft will support community- originated projects deemed by peer review to be of exceptional scientific merit , consistent with the research prioritization mentioned above. Computational Infrastructure : NCAR operates a facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming (the NCAR -Wyoming Supercomputing Center), that supports high- end community modeling programs in atmospheric, solar, and other Earth Systems processes. These include the Community Earth System Model (CESM) , the Weather Research and Forecasting Models (WRF), and the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), which use mathematical formulas to simulate and better understand the chemical and physical processes that drive Earth's climate and weather system. NCAR leads the development of these community models and supports many thousands of users in the U.S. and worldwide. NCAR also maintains extensive data archives, providing access to a vast collection of observational, experimental, and modeling data, together with sophisticated analysis and visualization facilities, and training and support for users of all levels. Other Facility Support : In addition to the C -130 and G -V aircraft, NCAR provides support for a number of other atmospheric and solar observing platforms through its Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) and High Altitude Observatory (HAO), including specialized Doppler weather radars, lidar systems, upper atmosphere observing capabilities, an advanced coronagraph, and other experimental systems. Research and Education Support : As an internationally recognized center of excellence, NCAR operates FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 55 scientific research programs that include the following areas: studies of large -scale atmospheric and ocean dynamics that contribute to an understanding of the past and present Earth System processes; global and regional atmospheric chemistry, including atmospheric connections to geochemical and biogeochemical cycles; the variable nature of the sun and the physics of the corona and the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetic field; the physics of clouds, thunderstorms, precipitation formation, and their interactions and effects on local and regional weather; and examination of human society's impact on atmospheric composition, weather, and climate, and response to global environmental change. Research collaborations with university colleagues are integral to NCAR's success as an institution, and NCAR serves as a focal and meeting point for the broader atmospheric and related sciences community. NCAR also maintains extensive partnerships and collab orations with the private sector through directed research and technology transfer. This work focuses on developing information and analysis platforms tailored to the specific needs of stakeholders in a variety of sectors, including energy, aviation, and agriculture. Educational activities include the SOARS (Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science) program that integrates research, education, and mentoring to bridge the undergraduate -to- graduate transition and to broaden participation in the atmospheric and related sciences. NCAR further supports the scientific community by providing fellowships, internships, workshops, and colloquia for students and visiting scientists, and disseminates knowledge of the geosciences. Professional trai ning courses, innovative and award- winning science education websites, as well as the directed activities of NCAR's education and outreach programs, are further examples of how NSF's goal of integrating research and education is attained through NCAR activ ities. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) within GEO and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) oversee NCAR and the cooperative agreement under which UCAR manages NCAR. The cooperative agreement encourages interactions between NCAR scientists and AGS staff and ensures close coordination between AGS and NCAR management. The cooperative agreement contains requirements for AGS's oversight of the NCAR program and UCAR management activities that affect NCAR. UCAR submits for AGS approval an annual program plan for NCAR that details how resources will be used, and an annual report on the previous year's scientific accomplishments and achievements. UCAR also reports annually to NSF on its activities as NCAR's manager. Annual strategic planning between AGS, UCAR, and NCAR ensures that scientific and facility priorities align with those of NSF. External Structure: UCAR works in partnership with NSF and the university community to ens ure that NCAR's strategic mission is implemented effectively and for the benefit of NCAR's stakeholders in the atmospheric and geospace sciences Reviews: A Committee of Visitors (COVs) is convened periodically to evaluate AGS oversight of NCAR. The most recent COV was conducted in FY 2015, with the next anticipated in FY 2019. A Business Systems Review was conducted in FY 2011 and examined UCAR administrative business systems. No significant issues were raised in either of the most recent reviews. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 56 Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In 2016, AGS conducted a comprehensive review of NCAR's science programs and facilities, and UCAR's management of NCAR. The review was conducted as a series of site visits to NCAR by teams comprising members of the research community with expertise in the atmospheric and related sciences and in the management of scientific centers and facilities. The site visit teams found that NCAR continues to be a world -leading research center, providing essential services and capabilities that foster excellence throughout the atmospheric and geospace sciences community. T he cooperative agreement for management and operation of NCAR is currently being recompeted, with the next award expected to be for the five years beginning in FY 2019. As part of a robust re -competiti on and cost review process, various NSF oversight activities have been completed and others ar e underway, such as independent cost assessments to inform NSF's cost analysis for a potential award.

As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by NSF, the primary purpose of NOAO is to serve as the U.S. national center for ground- based optical and infrared (OIR) astronomy to coordinate, integrate, and operate observational, technical, and data- oriented capabilities available throughout the U.S. OIR system of federal and non- federal assets. NOAO's mission is to enable discovery in ground- based OIR astronomy. In pursuit of this mission, NOAO facilitates access for all qualified professional researchers to state-of-the- art observational capabilities and databases in OIR astronomy. NOAO enables the U.S. research community to pursue a broad range of modern astrophysical challenges from small bodies within the Solar System, to the most distant galaxies in the early universe, to indirect observations of dark energy and dark mat ter. NOAO is the gateway for the U.S. astronomical community to the Gemini Observatory through the U.S. National Gemini Office . NOAO coordinates community access to telescopes throughout the U.S. OIR system, and it facilitates connecting the scientific use r to data archives by developing and maintaining data management capabilities. NOAO integrates community planning for future facilities and instrumentation projects under a national organization. In partnership with the community and NSF, NOAO works with colleges and universities to train the next generation of scientists and engineers, and promotes accomplishments to strengthen education and public awareness of the astronomical sciences. NOAO facilities, telescopes, and data systems, are open to all qualified astronomers regardless of institutional affiliation. They serve nearly 1,200 U.S. and foreign scientists annually. Doctoral dissertation students and non- thesis graduate students from U.S. institutions use NOAO facilities f or research projects. In FY 2017, NOAO employed 300 personnel in Arizona and Chile, including 45 support scientists and 10 postdoctoral fellows.

Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : The managing organization for NOAO is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), which is comprised of 44 U.S. member institutions and f our international affiliate members. A key NOAO partnership is ongoing with the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct a survey of the southern sky to investigate the nature of dark energy. The five - year Dark Energy Survey began operation in 2013 on the CTIO 4 -meter Blanco telescope, and is now scheduled for a one year extension , due to poor weather conditions at the observing site in Chile. The extend ed survey is expected to end in February 2019. NOAO is a partner in the 4.1 -meter SOuthern Astrophysical Research (SOAR ) telescope at CTIO. SOAR partners include the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Michigan State University; and Brasil. Another partnership with DOE involves installation of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument on the Mayall telescope on Kitt Peak in February 2018 for a five -year dark energy science program. In FY 2019, DOE is scheduled to fully assume Mayall operations funding. A large number of U.S. universities support their own astronomical facilities at KPNO and CTIO with reimbursed services provided by NOAO. Development of new telescopes, instrumentation, and sensor techniques is done in partnership with universities and with industry through subawards to aerospace, optical fabrication, and information technology companies. NOAO leverages NSF support with funding from other federal agencies and non-fede ral sources. NOAO typically receives approximately $10.0 million each year for reimbursed services from partnerships and tenant observatory support, from the Kitt Peak Visitors Center, and from grants from other federal agencies. Education and Public Out reach : NOAO supports U.S. education goals by promoting public understanding and support of science and by providing education and training at all levels. Over 200 U.S. and foreign graduate students observe on NOAO telescopes yearly and a significant fracti on of the observations contribute to Ph.D. dissertations. The observatories introduce undergraduate students to scientific research by providing stimulating environments for basic astronomical research and related technologies through NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduate Students program. NOAO has a diverse education program, visitor centers, and a web -based information portal at www.noao.edu. NOAO Base O&M : $19.13 million, $ 60,000 below the FY 2017 actual . Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 58 T ucson Operations: $ 9.30 million, $ 620,000 below the FY 2017 A ctual : This covers the cost for headquarters, offices, laboratories, and workshops in Tucson, Arizona.

Special Projects (W isconsin, Indiana, Yale, NOAO consortium (WIYN ) and Mayall): $ 1.0 million, $ 2.80 million below the FY 2017 A ctual : This decrease is due to Mayall operations being fully supported by the DOE in FY 2019. Potential Future Projects - Data Science Support : NOAO currently provides data scientific support for U .S. community observations with the Gemini telescopes. In addition, proposals are under consideration for NOAO to maintain an ongoing management role for Gemini and LSST operations through the scope of its Federally Funded Research and Development Center. Po tential future funding (FY 2020 and beyond) would provide the option for a modern management structure for U .S. Optical/IR nighttime telescope assets without reducing commitments to flagship facilities. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Fac ilities - 59 Management and Oversight NSF Structure: An NSF program officer in the MPS Division of Astronomoical Sciences ( AST) provides continuing oversight, including consultation with an NSF panel of external program reviewers that meets once a year. The program officer reviews detailed annual program plans, annual long -range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted by NOAO. The NSF program officer also attends AURA governance committee meetings. Governance committees are formed from the national astronomical community and provide additional avenues for input of community priorities and concerns. The AST program officer works closely with other offices at NSF, particularly the Office of General Counsel, and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in the NSF Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. External Structure: AURA is the managing organization for NOAO. The NOAO direc tor reports to the president of AURA, who is the principal investigator on the NSF cooperative agreement that began in FY 2016. AURA receives management advice from an observatory council composed of members of its scientific and management communities. NO AO uses a Users ' Committee, comprised of community scientists, to advise the NOAO director on all aspects of user experiences at the Observatory. Reviews: In addition to reviews midway through all cooperative agreements, NSF conducts both periodic and ad h oc external reviews of AURA management. A comprehensive review of AURA's performance is planned for FY 2019, the fourth year of the five- year cooperative agreement. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The last competition for management and operation of NOAO was completed with the issuance of a new cooperative agreement with AURA starting October 1, 2015 and ending September 30, 2020.

NRAO conceives, designs, builds, operates, and maintains state-of-the- art radio telescopes used by scientists from around the world. Operating synergistically with optical, infrared, x- ray, and gravitational wave telescopes, NRAO facilities enable discovery over a remarkably broad range of key problems in modern astrophysics that reach from within our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the universe. Using NRAO observing capabilities and data archives, scientists: carry out precision cosmological measurements; test fundamental physics; probe deep into the earliest, most intense, and optically obscured phases of planet, star, galaxy, and b lack hole formation; reveal the cool gas from which stars form; provide essential tools for studying magnetic fields and high -energy cosmic phenomena; and seek to detect the sources of gravitational waves. As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, NRAO operates the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico and is also the North American implementing organization for the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (A LMA). These ground- based observing facilities for radio astronomy are available to any qualified researcher, regardless of affiliation or nationality, on the basis of scientific, merit -reviewed proposals. NRAO facilities annually serve over 2,500 users wor ldwide; moreover, continuing high demand for ALMA has resulted in the most proposals ever received for an astronomical facility in response to a single proposal call. NSF does not provide individual investigator awards targeted specifically for use of NRAO facilities, but many users are supported through NSF or NASA grants to pursue scientific programs that require use of NRAO facilities. Including the ALMA operations staff located at NRAO, staff in FY 2019 will consist of 296 full - time equivalent positions (FTEs) in the operations and in in 3 5 in nt, nd lic de maintenance components: 114 telesco pe operations, 56 science support and research, in development programs, 51 computing and data manageme21 in administrative services, a 19 in education and puboutreach.

Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 62 Education and Public Outreach, $760,000 : NRAO supports a comprehensive outreach program that makes radio astronomy information available to th e public .24 With over 150 students involved per year, NRAO facilities are used by graduate students carrying out dissertation research and work experience programs and by undergraduates participating in the Research Experiences fo r Undergraduates program. NRAO also supports a visitor and education center and conducts active educational and public outreach programs. The VLA visitor center attracts over 20,000 public visitors each year. ALMA Operations, $ 40.28 million : In FY 2015, NRAO completed construction of the international ALMA Observatory, funded through the MREFC account. Early operations funding for ALMA began in FY 2005 and ramps up to steady state operations in FY 2018. Operations funding supports a share of observatory operations in Chile, a technical development program, and the North American ALMA Science Ce nter (NAASC). NRAO created the NAASC in 2006 to provide technical and scientific support for, and easy access by, the broad astronomical community that uses ALMA. The NAASC also organizes summer schools, workshops, and courses in techniques of millimeter and submillimeter astronomy. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: In consultation with community representatives, a n AST program officer carries out continuing oversight and assessment for NRAO and ALMA by making use of detailed annual program plans, long- range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports. This p rogram officer participates in the international ALMA Board and attends AUI/NRAO governance and advisory committee meetings. To address issues as they arise, AST works clo sely with other NSF offices, such as the Office of General Counsel, the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and the Large Facilities Office in BFA . External Structure: Management is through a cooperative agreement with AUI , which m anages the observatory through its own community- based oversight and users committees. The NRAO director reports to the AUI president. Oversight of the international ALMA project is vested in the ALMA Board, which i ncludes a member from NSF; coordination and management of the merged international efforts are the responsibility of the Joint ALMA Observatory whose staff includes an ALMA director. An international ALMA review committee advises the ALMA Board. Reviews: NSF conducts annual reviews of the NRAO Program Operating Plan and strategic planning documents, ALMA operations, and the AUI Management Report. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Following a solicitation issued in FY 2014 (NSF 14- 568), management and operation of NRAO, including ALMA, was competed and NSB authorized a cooperative agreement with AUI for October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2026. 24 https://public.nrao.edu/ FY 2019 NSF Budget Requ est to Congress Facilities - 63 NATIONAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY (NSO) $20,500,000 +$3,000,000 / 17.1% Amount Percent $17.50 - $20.50 (TBD)FY 2019 RequestChange over FY 2017 Request FY 2019 marks the final year of a five -year funding ramp that will bring the NSO budget to a level commensurate with requirements to operate the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) , the construction of which is nearing completion. (See the MREFC chapter for more information). This budget request will fund the development of the DKIST science operations and data center concepts in preparation for full DKIST operations expected to begin in late 2019- early 2020. The FY 2019 Budget R equest fully funds t he DKIST operations requirement and the NSO Integrated Synoptic Program (NISP) . As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), NSO is headquartered on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder and provides leadership to the solar community through management of the construction of DKIST . When completed, DKIST will be the world most powe rful solar observatory. L ife on Earth is critically dependent upon the Sun. S olar phenomena such as space weather (e.g. geomagnetic storms) can significantly impact our increasi ngly technological society. DKIST will investigate the structure and evolution of magnetic structures on the Sun on spatial sca les of tens of kilometers, the fundamental length scales of the processes that drive space weather. With DKIST poised to answer f undamental questions in solar physics by providing transformative improvements over current ground- based facilities, solar research enabled by DKIST will benefit all of humankind . NSO also operates a coordinated worldwide network of six telescopes specific ally designed to study solar oscillations . NSO routinely provides detailed synoptic solar data used by individual researchers and other government agencies through the NSO Digital Library. NSO data are also made available to the user community via the Virtual Solar Observatory. NSO telescopes are open to all astronomers regardless of institutional affiliation based on peer -reviewed observing proposals. In FY 2017, 27 unique observing programs from 18 U.S. and seven foreign institutions were carried out using NSO facilities. This is a reduction from previous years as NSO ramps down its involvement in Sacramento Peak and the McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope . Students were part of 1 4 percent of these programs, which included three Ph.D. thesis projects. Nearly 12 terabytes of NSO synoptic data were downloaded from the NSO Digital Library. NSO employed approximately 138 staff members in FY 2017, including 59 FTEs employed on the DKIST construction project funded via the MR EFC account as mentioned above. In 2010, the National Research Council (NRC) conducted its sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. In their report, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics , 25 the NRC committee recommended that \"NS F-Astronomy should complete its next senior review before the mid - decade independent review that is recommended in this report, so as to determine which, if any, facilities NSF-AST should cease to support in order to release funds for (1) the construction and ongoing operation of new telescopes and instruments and (2) the science analysis needed to capitalize on the results from existing and future facilities.\" In response to this recommendation, the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (A ST) conducted a c ommunity- based review of its portfolio. The resulting Portfolio Review 25 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 64 Committee (PRC) report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges ,26 was released in August 2012 and included recommendations about all of the major AST tele scope facilities. Prior to receiving the PRC report, NSF had instructed NSO to begin divestment of the facilities on Kitt Peak, including the McMath- Pierce Solar Telescope and the Vacuum Tower (no longer in use), thereby accelerating the already -planned divestment by a few years. The PRC endorsed this decision. The PRC recommended continued operation of the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) at Sacramento Peak through 2017 and a 50 percent reduction in funding of the NSO Integrated Synoptic P rogram (NISP). The sta tus of the divestment of NSO operated facilities is as follows: McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope, Kitt Peak, AZ: NSO ceased operating the McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope as a national user facility at the end of FY 2017. NSF completed a divestment options study of NSO facilities on Kitt Peak and anticipates beginning an environmental impact analysis process in FY 2018, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act. On March 31, 2017, NSO/ Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (A URA) issued a request for proposals from parties interested in taking over operation of the McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope for scientific and educational purposes , but received no viable proposals . The path forward for the McMat h-Pierce is currently under discussion. Sacramento Peak Observatory, Sunspot, NM : This facility includes the DST and associated infrastructure including office space, laboratory space, dining facilities, and housing . NSO ceased operating Sacramento Peak Ob servatory as a national user facility at the end of FY 2017. A proposal from New Mexico State University (NMSU) to transition operations of the facility from NSO to an NMSU- led consortium was funded in FY 2016. As discussions on the future of Sacramento Peak continue with NMSU, in parallel NSF began the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in late 2016, which is examining a range of paths for Sacramento Peak Observatory. Fully compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act, the final EIS is expected in late 2018. NSO Integrated Synoptic Program : NISP consists of the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) and the Synoptic Optical Long- term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS). GONG now has a component of its operations funding provided through a 5- year (FY 2016 - FY 2020) interagency agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This NOAA funding supports the use of GONG and its data products for operati onal space weather forecasting. (Also s ee Partnerships section below). NSO is in the process of relocating the SOLIS facility to the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) on Big Bear Lake, CA. On September 29, 2017, NSO received a permit from San Bernardino County to install SOLIS on the site. Shortly thereafter, NSF's Record of Environmental Compliance was signed on October 2, 2017 allowing the project to move forward. 2 Excludes funding for cultural mitigation activities as agreed to during the compliance process.

NSO partners include NOAA, NASA, industrial entities, and universities and institutes that collaborate with NSO on solar instrumentation development. NSF is currently under discussions wit h New Mexico State University (NMSU) regarding future operations of Sacramento Peak Observatory and New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) on future operations of SOLIS at B BSO. Due to the increasing national and international awareness of the impacts of space weather on critical infrastructure and society in general, the importance of operational space weather forecasting has become apparent to U.S. policy makers. Space weather forecasting requires both accurate models of the heliospheric environment and precise observational data inputs to those models. NSO's GONG program provides operational data products on a routine basis that are used as inputs to predictive space weather models from the U.S. Air Force and the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center. FY 2016 support for NSO included a one-time $2.50 million investment in GONG to increase its robustness for future space weather predictions. NSO is in the process of upgrading the GONG facility with this funding , with completion expected in FY 2018. In FY 2016, NSF and NOAA signed an interagency agreement whereby NOAA is providing approximately $800,000 per year in funding support for GONG operations. NSO Base Operations, $ 3.70 million, $ 2.04 million below the FY 2017 A ctual : NSO Base Operations includes the offices at NSO's Boulder, C olorado headquarters and the world -wide NSO Integrated Synoptic Program consisting of the GONG array and the SOLIS telescope. At the end of FY 2017, NSO ceased operating the Sacramento Peak Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico and the McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona as national user facilities . The funding profile for NSO Base Operations has been trending downward in anticipation of these di vestment s. DKIST Operations, $16.50 million, $ 5.0 million above th e FY 2017 A ctual : Support for DKIST operations is through the R&RA account , while DKIST construction support is through the MREFC account. (See the MREFC chapter for more information on construction.) The FY 2019 Budget Request for DKIST Operations represents the f inal year of a five -year funding ramp that will bring the NSO budget to a level commensurate with requirements to operate DKIST. This profile is funding the development of the DKIST science operations and data center in preparation for full DKIST operations, which is expected to begin late 2019-early 2020. Education and Public Outreach, $300 ,000, $ 40,000 above the FY 2017 A ctual : NSO supports U.S. education goals by promoting public understanding and support of science and by providing education and training at all levels. NSO introduces undergraduate students to scientific research by providing stimulating environments for basic astronomical research and related technologies through NSF's separately funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. NSO has diverse education programs, including teacher training and curriculum development, visitor centers, and a web portal at www.nso.edu. In preparation for the total solar eclipse in August 2017, and with the imminent arrival of DKIST, NSO significantly increased its education, public outreach, and broadening participation effort by establishing an Office of Education and Outreach. In FY 2016, NSO hired a new office head and recently filled a second EPO position, based in Maui, focused on DKIST. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: An NSF program officer in AST provides continuing oversight, including consultation with an annual NSF program review panel. The program officer makes use of detailed annual program plans, annual long- range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted by NSO as well as attending AURA Solar Observatory Council meetings. The latter committee is formed from the national solar physics community and provides a window into communit y priorities Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 66 and concerns. The AST program officer works closely with other offices at NSF, particularly the Office of General Counsel, the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and the Large Facilities Office . External Structure: AURA is the ma naging organization for NSO. The NSO director reports to the president of AURA, who is the principal investigator on the current NSF cooperative agreement. AURA receives management advice from its Solar Observatory Council, composed of members of its scien tific and management communities. NSO uses visiting and users committees for the purposes of self- evaluation and prioritization. The visiting committee, composed of nationally prominent individuals in science, management, and broadening participation, revi ews for AURA all aspects of the management and operations of NSO. The users committee, composed of scientists with considerable experience withthe observatory, reviews for the NSO director all aspects of NSO that affect user experiences. Reviews: In addit ion to reviews held mid -way through all cooperative agreements, NSF conduc t s pe riodic and ad hoc reviews by external committees. In February 2017, NSF review ed NSO's Annual Progress Report and Program Plan . From December 2015 through March 2016, NSF conduc ted a B usiness Systems Review covering AURA and NSO. Findings and recommendations from the final NSF report were conveyed to AURA in April 2016, and AURA continues to resolve issues and implement report recommendations. NSO also participated in reviews of the DKIST project in FY 2016 including: a contingency assessment (Feb. - July 2016) and an Earned Value Management System validation review (Sept. 2016), both of which are described in the DKIST narrative in the MREFCchapter. R enewal/Recompetition/Termin ation On August 14, 2014, the National Science Board (NSB) authorized a renewed cooperative agreement with AURA for management and operation of NSO . The renewed award was put into place in June 2015 a nd will run through September 2024. Two snapshot images of the 2017 Great American Eclipse for the NSO -led Citizen CATE project.

Prior to FY 2017, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) operated major radio telescopes at GBO in Green Bank, West Virginia, including the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and at 10 telescope array sites spanning the U.S. from the Virgin Islands to Hawai'i, together constituting the Very Long B aseline Array (VLBA). Beginning in FY 2017, GBO and VLBA were separated from NRAO. GBO now operates GBT, and the newly formed LBO operates VLBA. Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI) remains the managing organization for GBO and LBO through a c ooperative agreement with NSF. This narrative presents the combined FY 2019 Budget Request for GBO and LBO. GBO provides key ground- based radio -wavelength research facilities fo r the US national community, while carrying out a program in education for pub lic visitors and students. The GBT is the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope and is GB O's flagship research instrument . From fundamental physics and astronomy to the discovery and characterization of interstellar organic molecules that provide insight to the organic chemistry of life on Earth, to the search for intelligent life beyond the Earth, the GBO contributes to a very broad area of scientific research. GBO is also the anchor and administrative site of the 13,000- square- mile National Radio Quiet Zone , where all radio transmissions are limited. Having telescopes within this quiet zone allows for detection of faint scientific signals that would otherwise be drowned- out by human- made signals. LBO operates the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), the world's premier radio interferometer, using 10 identical 25 -meter radio telescopes located across the U .S., from Hawaii to St. Croix Virgin Islands. The VLBA provides researchers with key insight into the structure and evolution of our galaxy, the Milk y Way, and helps to determine the fundamental distance scale of the universe. In addition to basic astrophysical research, LBO contributes to the national infrastructure through the U.S. Naval Observatory's u se of the VLBA for measuring daily Earth Orientation parameters, necessary to maintain the integrity of the GPS system . In September 2017, the VLBA antenna at St . Croix, Virgin Islands sustained a direct hit from Hurricane Maria. Although significant damage was sustained across the island of St. Croix, preliminary reports indicate that the VLBA antenna on St . Croix escaped serious damage. The power is now up and running. An expert team is expected to visit the site in February to assess when operations may resume. Funding for full repair of the St. Croix installation are provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. I n 2010, the National Academies conducted their sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. In their report, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics ,27 the committee recommended that \"NSF -Astronomy should complete its next senior review before the mid -decade independent review that is recommended in this report, so as to determine which, if any, facilities NSF -AST should cease to support in order to release funds for (1) the construction and ongoing operation of new telescopes and instruments and (2) the science analysis needed to capitalize on the results from existing and future 27 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 68 facilities.\" In response to this recommendation, the MPS Division of Astronomi cal Sciences (AST) conducted a community- based review of its portfolio. The resulting Portfolio Review Committee report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges,28 was released in August 2012 and included recommendations about all major AST telescope facilities. In 2012, under constrained budgets, the Portfolio Review Committee recommended divestment of GBT and VLBA from AST funding because of a less compelling mapping to the science questions of the 2010 decadal survey compar ed to other facilities . As announced in a Dear Colleague Letter, NSF 13 -074,29 NSF partitioned GBT and VLBA from the competition for NRAO management and operations, which increased flexibility for exploring cost -efficient operational models and sustainable partnerships for GBO (comprising GBT and the Green Bank site and facilities) and VLBA. Existing partnerships are described below, and additional partner discussions with governmental and non-governmental entities are ongoing. In FY 2016, AST received a proposal from A UI to continue management and operation of GBO and LBO in FY 2017 and FY 2018, separate from the management and operation of NRAO. Previously, the obligations for GBO and VLBA were heavily matrixed and not separable from the overall obligation for NRAO. Hence, GBO and VLBA, which were previously included in the NRAO narrative, were first presented as stand -alone entities in the FY 2017 Budget Request. The table below does not separate funding for GBO and LBO, as the detailed breakdown between the two depends on anticipated and achieved partnerships. Notional funding beyond FY 2020 is shown below, although it is expected that the outyear numbers will change significantly as partnerships evolve. In FY 2017, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act , NSF began a formal environmental review of GBO to develop an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) , which will consider the environmental impact of various future alternatives for GBO . The process is expected to conclude in FY 2019 with publication of the final EIS, followed by a decision on the f uture path of the GBO , memorialized in a Record of Decision to be published by the NSF. $11.85 $11.85Total Obligations for Other Astronomical Facilities (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2019 Request 1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only.

Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : In FY 2017, GBO and LBO received approximately $8.80 million from other sources, roughly half from non- federal partners and half from other federal sources. External (non- NSF) contributions represent ed approximately 25 percent of the total operations budget of GBO and over 50 percent of the total operations budget of LBO . Many of the GBO and LBO partnerships involve guaranteed allocations of observing time on GBT or VLBA. In FY 2016, GBO began a 10- year partnership with Breakthrough Listen and had funding partners hips with 28 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp 29 http://nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13074/nsf13074.jsp FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 69 West Virginia University and the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) consortium that are expected to continue through FY 201 9. (The NANOGrav funding comes from the NSF award to the NANOGrav Physics Frontier s Center.) In addition, the GBO partnership with the RadioAstron space mission continue s in FY 201 8 and is anticipated to continue in FY 2019. O ther partner discussions are ongoing. In FY 2017, NSF and LBO established an agreement with the U.S. Naval Observatory to provide observing time and data in exchange for substantial support of LBO operations. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: In consultation with community representatives, a dedicated AST program officer carries out continuing oversight and assessment for GBO and LBO by making use of detailed annual program plans, technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted to NSF. The AST program officer attends AUI governance and advisory committee meetings. To address issues as they arise, A ST works closely with other NSF offices, such as the Office of General Counsel, the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and the Large Facilities Office in the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. External Structure: Management is through a cooperative agreement with AUI. AUI manages the observatories through its own community- based oversight and users committees. The GBO and LBO directors report directly to the AUI Vice President for Radio Astronomy. Reviews: NSF conducts annual reviews of the Program Operating Plan and reports. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination GBO and LBO are currently supported through a cooperative agreement, w hich ends on September 30, 2018. NSF expects to extend the current agreement to continue support of GBO through September 30, 2019. Management of GBO after FY 20 19 will be based on the further development of collaboration opportunities , the EIS process mentioned previously, and a potentia l solicitation . As for LBO, NSF expects to receive a proposal from AUI that will help to identify the future structure and operat ional support required for LBO and the VLBA beyond FY 2018.

With world population projected to increase to nine billion (U.S. population reaching 400 million) by 2050 and urban populations expected to double, there are expected to be major increases in demand for these resources. The INFEWS investment area enables interagency cooperation on one of the most pressing problems of the millenniumunderstanding interactions across the FEW nexus, how it is likely to affect our world, and how we can proactively plan for its consequences. Food, energy, and water systems interconnect and are interdependent in many ways. Water is required for the production of energyhydropower, cooling of electric power plants, energy production, etc. Energy is needed for wastewater treatment, desalination, pumping groundwater, and for transport of wate r. Water and energy are critical for agriculture and food production. Biofuels consume water and, in some instances, result in reductions in the production of food. In addition, different land use practices, increased urbanization, and climate variability have major impacts on all three. These multifaceted interactions are impacted on the one hand by fundamental laws governing various physical, chemical, and biological processes, and on the other hand by the social, behavioral, and economic decisions made by individuals, organizations, and governments. Given the increased demand on these resources, societies can no longer sustain optimal operation for one system (i.e., food, energy, or water system) we must plan our interaction within the FEW system of systems so that no single one fails even if it means that all operate sub -optimally. The food, energy, and water nexus creates a grand research challenge: to understand how these complex, coupled processes and systems function now and in the future. There is also a critical need for research to enable new technologies that will enhance the productivity of the system and subsystems, maximize efficient overall usage of FEW resources, and define new means for socially and technologically adapting to future variabi lity and demands. Investigations of this complex system will produce discoveries that cannot emerge from research on food or energy or water systems alone; the interactions among these components and the context(s) of the problem(s) they pose at the FEW nexus will produce new knowledge and technologies. NSF support of basic research in the science and engineering disciplines is needed to understand the interdependent and interconnected FEW systems and could lead to an integrated model useful not only for sc ientific understanding, but also informed decision- making. INFEWS investments began in FY 2016 and are planned to continue through FY 2020. The overar ching desired outcome of INFEWS is to improve understanding of the interdependencies of the FEW systems, within a disciplinary and interdisciplinary context. Supporting examples include: Improve understanding of FEW systems embedded in differing social contexts and the societal vulnerabilities of these systems with respect to short and long timescale events ( e.g., weather, power outages, resource distribution, population pressures, and land- use changes). Advance scientific and engineering understanding to: Improve systems models covering a range of environments, technologies, policies, individual and organizat ional behaviors, and relative weighting of FEW stresses/needs across the scope of the human, built, and natural environments; Enable discoveries that lead to technological innovations incorporating sustainability, safety, security, efficiency, and affordability, while addressing relevant social, economic, and cultural factors; systems or models that promote efficient use of resources, as well as conversion and/or reuse of waste materials; Inform technologies and policies that improve food security and agric ultural practices that better Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) NSF-Wide Investments - 4 maintain ecosystem services; Strengthen partnerships with projects at the state and local levels that will test research results in real-world systems; and Encourage the results of modelling as well as technological and social solutions to be widely available to agencies, industries, and the public through computing interfaces that encourage interaction, contribution of additional data, and local application. G oals Goal 1: Significantly advance our understanding of the FEW system s through quantitative and computational modeling, including support for advanced cyberinfrastructure; Goal 2: Develop real -time, cyber -enabled interfaces that improve understanding of the behavior of FEW systems and increase decision support capability; Goal 3: Enable research that will lead to innovative solutions to critical FEW system problems; and Goal 4: Grow the scientific workforce capable of studying and managing the FEW system, through education and other professional development opportunities.

NSF's investments in I-Corps strategically address the challenges inherent in the early stages of the innovation process by providing education, training, and mentoring to scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to enable them to identify and explore the commercial potential of NSF -funded research . The I -Corps program fosters a national innovation ecosystem that stimulate s the translation of federally -funded research to a commercial stage more quickly and efficiently. The I -Corps program was initiated in Fiscal Year 2011 and provides immersive, experiential entrepreneurial education to scientists and engineers who form I- Corps Teams. The program is building a National Innovation Network (NIN) comprising I-Corps Nodes and I-Corps Sites that work cooperatively to build, utilize, and sustain the national innovation ecosystem. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) was signed into law January 2017 ( P.L. 114- 329), and Section 601 of AICA directs NSF to develop and expand the I-Corps Program. Goals The goals of the I-Corps program are to: Spur translation of fundamental research to the marketplace; Encourage collaboration between academia and industry; Train NSF -funded faculty, students, and other researchers in innovation and entrepreneurship; and Maximize the potential of NSF's investments in basic research through creation of a National Innovation Network.

Seemingly overnight, society has become deeply reliant on the smooth functioning of its digital infrastructure. Unfortunately, attacks on corporations, agencies, national infrastructure , and individ uals have exposed the fragility and vulnerability of this complex cyberspace. Achieving a truly secure cyberspace requires addressing not only challenging scientific and engineering problems involving many components of a system, but also vulnerabilities that arise from human behaviors and choices. Examining the fundamentals of security and privacy as a multidisciplinary subject is the m ost promising approach to develop better ways to design, build, and operate cyber systems; to protect existing and future infrastructure ; and to motivate and educate individuals about cybersecurity. Achieving these goals not only requires application of expertise in computer science , engineering, statistics, mathematics, social and behavioral science, economics, and education, but also the translation of new concepts and technologies into practice. SaTC is a multi- year investment area, spanning FY 2014 - F Y 2020. However, NSF's emphasis on cybersecurity research is expected to continue beyond FY 2020 because it constitutes an enduring challenge for science and engineering research and education that must evolve constantly to address new threats. Outcomes f rom SaTC will include an organized scientific body of knowledge that informs the theory and practice of cybersecurity and privacy, and an improved understanding of the causes of and mitigations for current threats. SaTC will contribute to the development of foundational countermeasure techniques leveraging sound mathematical and scientific foundations, principled design methodologies, and socio - technical approaches that consider human, social, organizational, economic, and technical factors, as well as design metrics for evaluating success or failure of these approaches. In the space of training and education, SaTC will make recommendations for new instructional materials, degree programs, and educational pathways. Foundational research in SaTC will lead to a research community pursuing a broad and deep multidisciplinary research portfolio spanning cybersecurity and privacy, whose results underlie methods for securing critical infrastructure. Ultimately, through SaTC, NSF expects to produce an innovation ecosystem that ensures new and existing technologies are secure from attack and users' information is protected from violations of privacy des pite the new attack surfaces these technologies present. Similarly, the creation of an American workforce and citizenry with an understanding of cybersecurity and privacy issues is an anticipated benefit of NSF's support of activities related to the educat ion and training of cybersecurity researchers and professionals. Goals Goal 1: Foundational Research : Develop the scientific theory, methodologies, and tools necessary to the development of trustworthy and usably secure systems and appropriate privacy safeguards. Goal 2: Accelerating Transition to Practice: Transition successful basic research results and commercial innovations into early adoption and use, allowing NSF cyberinfrastructure to serve as a premier proving ground and state -of-the- art environment for advancing cybersecurity solutions and moving them into technical and organizational practice.

In FY 2013, the multi -agency Brain R esearch through Advancing I nnovative N eurotechnologies ( BRAIN) Initiative was announced, with NSF as one of the lead participating agencies, and Congress reaffirmed its support for NSF's continued investments in the BRAIN Initiative as part of the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P .L. 114-329). 1 Through several new , cross -cutting programs and numerous existing core programs across the directorates, NSF will continue to support catalytic innovation in neuroscience as well as large -scale dissemination efforts to establish a national research infrastructure that will accelerate our understanding of brain function. There remains much to discover to attain a comprehensive understanding of the general principles underlying how cognition and behavior relate to the brain's structural organization and dy namic activities ; how brain, behavior, and environment interact ; and how the brain can recover from lost functionality. The critical challenge to this comprehensive understanding is to integrate research and innovation across multiple scales of space and t ime, from biophysical, m olecular, physiological, and genetic to cognitive and behavioral, with the ultimate goals of establishing integrative, quantitative, computational, and predictive theories of brain structure, activity, and function. NSF is uniquely positioned to address this challenge and continue advancing research on understanding the brain by bringing together a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines to reveal the fundamental principles underlying brain structure and function. Since FY 2014, the UtB activity has consolidated NSF's ongoing activities in cognitive science, neuroscience and the BRAIN Initiative. The UtB activity began in FY 2016 and will continue until FY 2020. NSF has been instrumental in supporting transformative breakthroughs in brain research and related technologies, such as optogenetics, the CLARITY brain preservation technique, and the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved artificial retina, which all began with NSF support. The co- mingling of NSF's di sciplinary and interdisciplinary fields is expected to foster new trans-disciplinary and convergent approaches to transform understanding of brain, cognition, behavior, and education, through the development of new technologies, theories, and fundamental r esearch. Goals The overall goal of UtB is to enable scientific understanding of the full complexity and function of the brain in action and in context. This multi-year goal is being pursued across four ongoing priority areas: 1. Develop innovative neurotechnologies, new physical and conceptual tools, experimental approaches, theories, and models to monitor and analyze brain activity and integrate neuroscience information across scales and scientific disciplines; 2. Identify the fundamental relationships among neural architecture, activity, cognition, and behavior; 3. Transform our understanding of how the brain responds and adapts to changing environments ; and 4. Train a new generation of scientists, engineers, and educators for a transdisciplinary, globally competitive workforce in neuroscience and neuroengineering. 1www.congress.gov/bill/114th -congress/senate-bill/3084/text FY 2019 NSF - 9 Dir/OfficeFY 2017 ActualFY the Brain (UtB) (Dollars in Millions)Funding Levels NSF-Wide Investments - 10 IMPROVING UNDERGRADUATE STEM $102,500,000 EDUCATION (IUSE) +$400,000 / 0.4% Overview Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) is an NSF -wide activity that supports both research about and implementation of high- quality undergraduate education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) , including computer science . High -quality undergraduate STEM education is vital to preparing a diverse professional STEM workforce that is equipped to sustain U.S. leadership in STEM innovation. 1,2 For example, STEM -related occupations represent about six percent of total U .S. employment3 and the demand for workers in STEM- related occupations is expected to continue to grow at higher than average rates. Further, the average wage of STEM occupations is nearly double that of non - STEM occupations.4 In addition to preparing the STEM workforce, high -quality undergraduate STEM education is also critical for produc ing STEM -knowledgeable workers who can use STEM skills in business and industry, and a STEM -literate public that supports and benefits from the progress of science.5 By investing in improving the quality and effectiveness of undergraduate STEM education, I USE directly contributes to national STEM needs and our scientific understanding of undergraduate STEM learning and learning environments. IUSE can support projects in any NSF directorate, enabling IUSE to coordinate NSF investments in undergraduate STEM education across the Foundation. This coordination increases the potential impact of NSF investments in undergraduate education. IUSE supports investigators in a particular discipline to address discipline- specific issues, such as the need to recruit more women and minorities into computer science. IUSE investigators also contribute to issues that are relevant across all disciplines, such as incorporating active learning approaches. 6 The cross -directorate coordination provided by IUSE also supports science -driven innovations in undergraduate education, such as those needed to produce a STEM workforce that can use interdisciplinary approaches and/or massive data sets to identify and solve problems. As part of its mission to advance STEM , NSF plans to invest $ 102.50 million in FY 2019. This funding represents investments within and a cross directorates, and is aligned with the IUSE funding strategies framework and the IUSE goals. Goals NSF undergraduate investments target one or more of the following three IUSE goals: 1. Improve STEM learning and learning environments at the undergraduate level . These investments improve the knowledge base for defining, identifying, and implementing innovative undergraduate STEM instruction that leads to improved student learning and fosters widespread use of evidence- based 1 Hulten , C.

These investments increase the number and diversity of undergraduate student s recruited and retained in STEM fields and career pathways by implementing evidence- based, successful strategies to broaden participation and by growing that evidence base. 3. Build the STEM workforce for tomorrow. These investments improve the preparation o f undergraduate students so that they can succeed as productive members of the future STEM and STEM- capable workforce, regardless of career path, and be engaged as members of a STEM- literate society. The IUSE initiative's anchor investment is IUSE: Educat ion and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), a solicitation -based program in the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE). IUSE: EHR funds ( 1) innovative learning resources; ( 2) design of research questions to understand the impact of such resources; (3) stra tegies to implement effective instruction in a department or multiple departments, within or across institutions; (4) faculty development projects; ( 5) design and testing of instruments for measuring student outcomes; and ( 6) innovative activities that cou ld have a high impact on learning and contribute to transforming undergraduate STEM education. IUSE: EHR is complemented by five additional IUSE core programs: IUSE : Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI Program ); BIO: Research Coordination Networks: Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN: UBE); (IUSE/PFE : RED); CISE: innovation in undergraduate computer science education that enables , in part, the diffusion of computational thinking and computer science across a broad array of other fields (i.e. \"CS+X\"). GEO/ IUSE: Pathways into Geoscience (IUSE: GEOPATHS). Together with IUSE: EHR, these six programs form the core of the IUSE framework of inve stments.

Today, emerging fields of S&E increasingly demand collaborations that span institutions, disciplines, and national boundaries, and require the use of sophisticated data infrastructure, instruments, and networks of researchers. Computationally intensive and data- enabled science is dramatically changing the knowledge and experience required of researchers and other STEM professionals across all fields. Thus, the preparation of graduate students in STEM must continue to evolve to provide a supply of scientists and engineers who not only meet the needs of the STEM enterprise, but who also have the knowledge, skills, and preparation to advance it and lead innovation in academia and the private and public sectors. Investing in discoverers\u2014 that is, building a diverse and talented next -generation of STEM research leaders and professionals across sectors through inclusive processes\u2014is an important NSF focus. A major portion of NSF's overall investment in graduate education and graduate students supports research a ssistants funded through research grants. NSF also supports graduate students through other mechanisms such as fellowships and traineeships. Goals The goal of NSF's investments in STEM graduate education and STEM graduate students is to prepare a diverse workforce with advanced research training that is equipped to transform the frontiers of S&E, and to prepare professionals to participate and innovate in STEM intensive careers. NSF's graduate STEM investments will do the following: Support training in areas of national S&E priority. Catalyze development of innovative models for graduate education with potential for scalability. Build the research knowledge base to inform improvements in graduate education. Promote professional development of graduate students for both academic and non- academic careers. FY 2019 Investments NSF's two major agency -wide programs in graduate education are the Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) and the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program. EHR leads administration for both programs. NSF -wide working groups guide the management of these programs. Both programs contain design elements recommended in major national reports 1 as ways to better prepare graduates for a broad range of careers. GRFP has identified and supported outstanding, basic STEM researchers since 1952. The program also provides opportunities for graduate students to gain research experience internationally and in federal agencies. GRFP provides rich data that will be used for monitoring career outcomes longitudinally and will contribute to improving the understanding of STEM professional workforce development. 1 American Chemical Society Presidential Commission (2012).

Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group Draft Report. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. Retrieved from http://acd.od.nih.gov/bmw_report.pdf FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 13 There are several other programs at NSF that focus on developing sectors of the STEM workforce, and provide support to students in testing new models and approaches to graduate education. For example, the CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service ( SFS) program, led by EHR, addresses national need for a cybersecurity workforce as authorized by Public Law 113- 274, Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. In addition to scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students, the program supports the expansion of existing educational opportunities and resources in cybersecurity through research on the teaching and learning of cybersecurity. Collaborators include CISE, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of Personnel Management. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program (Noyce) provides fellowship support to members of the master teacher cohort at the graduate level and funds innovation and development in STEM teacher education approaches. In addition to GRFP, NRT, SFS, and Noyce, the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation's Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP -BD) track, and NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math ematics (S -STEM) support the successful entry and transition of underrepresented and underserved populations into STEM graduate education and into the STEM workforce. This broad suite of programs contributes substantially to the NSF investment in graduate education of the STEM research and education workforce of the future. In FY 2019, NSF directorates will be engaged in considering how to extend the range of professional development opportunities for graduate students across all NSF disciplines and will undertake several pilot activities. EHR is pursuing collaborations with other directorates to establish additional partnerships with industry for internship opportunities to give graduate students the professional development needed to pursue successful car eers in STEM and STEM -related occupations. With OISE, EHR is seeking to expand graduate students' international research and professional development opportunities. The Dear Colleague Letter: Non -Academic Research Internships for Graduate Students (INTERN) , NSF 17 -091, 2 will provide supplemental funding in FY 2018 and FY 2019 for non- academic research internships for graduate students to support career opportunities. The Division of Graduate Education's (DGE) component of EHR's core research program will al so emphasize research on the development of the STEM workforce. 2 www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504991 NSF Centers NSF-Wide Investments - 14 NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUN DATION CENTERS NSF supports a variety of centers programs that contribute to the Foundation's mission and vision. Centers exploit opportunities in science, engineering, and technology in which the complexity of the research program or the resources needed to solve the problem require the advantages of scope, scale, duration, equipment, facilities, and students. Centers are a principal means by which NSF fosters interdisciplinary research.

The smaller, developmental Phase I awards do not meet the criteria as formal NSF Centers and so are not captured here. 1 Counts include centers that received no-cost award extensions in FY 2017 but no additional funding. 3 Includes forward funding of $6.13 million in FY 2017. Without this action, FY 2019 Request would be level with FY 2017 Actual. Description of Major Changes Centers for Analysis and Synthesis - BIO The FY 2019 Request of $ 4.40 million funds one Center for Analysis and Synthesis \u2014the National Social- Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC ). Both CyVERSE and the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis received their final year of funding in FY 2017 and sunset as planned. SESYN C, located at the University of Maryland, is dedicated to accelerating scientific discovery at the interface of human and ecological systems. This center allows scientists from diverse disciplines to transform approaches for identifying solutions to society's most challenging and complex environmental problems. Workshops sponsored by this Center engage philosophers, sociologists, political scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, and environmental biologists (together with policy makers) to integrate broad disciplines from the outset and to set precedence for a ll subsequent activities. This center underwent external review in FY 2016, and was granted a five -year renewal award that started in FY 2016 and will continue through FY 2020. FY 2019 funding will provide continued support for staff and core research activities. Centers for Chemi cal Innovation (CCI) - MPS The FY 2019 Request of $20 .0 million funds five Phase II CCIs , four continuing, and one potential renewal. Funding for each of these CCIs will be $ 4.0 milli on per year. The CCI program makes awards at two levels: smaller Phase I (three -year awards) for center development, FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 15 and larger Phase II for full centers (five- year awards with the potential for renewal for up to a total of ten years). Phase I awards are considered part of the NSF Division of Chemistry's core research program investments as they fall under the threshold for formal NSF center award s; thus , their funding is not captured here. In FY 2019, a Phase I CCI competition will be held, supporting up to three new developmental awards. No Phase I CCIs are eligible to compete for Phase II in FY 2019. An independent CCI evaluation was funded in FY 2017 and is expected to be completed in FY 2019. Engineering Research Centers (ERC) - ENG The FY 2019 Request of $56.0 million funds 14 ERCs. The total includes four Nanosystems Engineering Research Centers, three first funded in FY 2012 and one in FY 2017. NSF's ERCs enable innovation, bridging the energy and intellectual curiosity of university research focused on discovery with real- world engineered systems and technology oppor tunities through partnerships with industry. These centers also are successful in educating a technology-enabled workforce with hands-on, real- world experience. The ERC program periodically commissions program -level evaluations by external evaluators to determine the effectiveness of ERC graduates in industry, the benefits of ERC membership to industry and others. In FY 2015, NSF funded the National Academies of S ciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study The Future of Center -Based, Multidisciplinary Engineering Research. To help inform the study, the National Academies held a public symposium on April 6, 2016, and published a proceedings. 1 The study report,2 delivered May 2, 2017, articulates a vision for the future of NSF -supported center -scale, multidisciplinary engineering research, which ENG will carefully consider for the path ahead. A new solicitation for the next generation of ERCs is expected in FY 2018. Reports include Post-Graduation Status of Engineering Research Centers2010 (SciTech Communications). This study, augmented by a recent update, found that of the 35 ERCs that have graduated from NSF support after 10 years , 29 (83 percent) are self-sustaining with strong financial support and most ERC features in place. The ERCs are successful at engaging a broader participation from underrepresented groups. For example, across an average of the currently active ERCs, approximately 32 percent of all those involved in the activities are womenin comparison to the national average of 16 percent across all engineering. In addition, the percentage of underrepresented minorities is more than three times that of engineering's national average. ERC p roducts of innovation include 2,305 inventions disclo sures, 1,909 patent applications filed, 790 patents awarded, and 1,345 licenses issued since the inception of the program. As for workforce d evelopment, ERCs have graduated 4,171 Bachelor's, 4,064 Master's, and 4,644 Doctoral degrees and impacted a total of 63,317 Pre- college K -12 Teachers and K -12 Students. Materials Centers - MPS The FY 2019 Request of $ 56.0 million is expected to fund 20 M aterials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSECs ). FY 2019 will be spent preparing for the next MRSEC competition in FY 2020. This includes stimulating the seeding efforts built within each MRSEC to start addressing DMR emerging research areas. These include the Quantum Leap, the Future of Work at the Human Technology Frontier, and Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st-Century Science and Engineering Big Ideas, as well as Materials Sustainable Development research. MRSECs exists to solve complex grand challenge materials problems requiring broad complementary multidisciplinary expertise within the physical sciences and engineering to understand materials phenomena, exploit materials behavior, and to create and discover new materials. Through the collaborative efforts involving academics, industrial, internatio nal and educational partners , MRSECs are a primary example of what is known transdisciplinary convergent MRSECs have five major components: interdisciplinary research thrusts, education and outreach, industrial outreach/partnerships, the materials research facilities network , which provides access to nearly 1,200 state- of-the art equipment instrumentation to materials researchers across the N ation, and the SEED program which enable MRSECs to rapidly react/move into new high risk and potentially transformative areas not yet fully explore d. Each year, MRSECs produce about 210 PhDs in STEM fields, mentor over 450 research experience for undergraduate students and 60 research experience for teachers, and impact nearly 1 million students and parents through outreach activities such as summer camps, K -12 science curriculum deve lopment, K -12 in- school science demos, development and deployment of science kits, and partnering with the N ation's top museums to create STEM- related exhibits that impact the public. Since 1994, the program has created over 150 startups and produces yearl y about 50 awarded patents and 30 patent licensures. MRSECs engage and assist about 220 industrial partners per year in advancing fundamental materials research that can be translated into the market place. Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Par tnerships (STC) - multi- directorat e The FY 2019 Requ est of $53.65 million will support twelve STCs and the administrative costs ($1 50,000) associated with management and oversight of the program. All are continuing awards from the FY 2010, FY 2013, and FY 2016 cohorts. Awards are for five years, with possible renewal for an additional five years, or 10 years total. Award sizes are typically $4.0 million to $5.0 million per year. Funding for the five centers in the 2010 cohort will sunset in FY 2020, with support beginning to ramp down in FY 2019. The STC program has developed a network of evaluators working with the centers to share information and lessons learned about the most effective way to measure progress at the centers. The STC program advances interdisciplinary discovery and innovation in science and engineering through the integration of cutting -edge research, excellence in education, targeted knowledge transfer, and the development of a diverse workforce. The STC portfolio reflects NSF -supported disciplines. Examples include: engineering biological systems; energy -efficient electronics; new ways of handling the extraction, manipulation, and exchange of information; and new nano- atomic scale imaging modalities. STCs engage the Nation's intellectual talent and collaborate with partners in academia, industry, national laboratories, and government. STCs strengthen the caliber of the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce through intellectually challenging research experienc es for students, postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and educators; they advance public scientific understanding through partnerships with K-12 and informal education communities.

Information about NSF's performance can also be found on the NSF website in the FY 2017 Performance and Financial Highlights Report.1 Strategic Plan and Strategic Objectives Alongside this Request, NSF releases its new Strategic Plan for FYs 2018-2022: Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation. 1 This Plan lays out two strategic goals that embody the dual nature of NSF's mission t o advance the progress of science while benefitting the N ation : Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning and Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges . A third goal, Enhance NSF's performance of its mission , directs NSF to hold itself accountable for achieving excellence in carrying out its mission. Each goal has two Strategic Objectives which together encompass all areas of agency activity. This goal structure enables NSF to link its investments to longer - term outcomes. Strategic Goal Strategic Objective 1 Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning. 1.1 Knowledge Advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure. 1.2 Practice Advance the practice of research. 2 Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges. 2.1 Societal Impacts Support research and promote partnerships to accelerate innovation and to provide new capabilities to meet pressing societal needs. 2.2 STEM Workforce Foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation. 3 Enhance NSF's performance of its mission. 3.1 Human Capital Attract, retain, and empower a talented and diverse workforce. 3.2 Processes and Operations Continually improve agency operations. FY 2018-2019 Agency Priority Goal In this Request, NSF is establishing an Agency Priority Goal (APG) to Expand public and private partnerships to enhance the impact of NSF's investments and contribute to American economic competitiveness and security. By September 30, 2019, NSF's number of partnerships and/or award actions with other federal agencies, private industry, and foundations/philanthropies will grow by five percent, relative to the FY 2017 baseline, to make available infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources to the U.S. scientific and engineering research and education enterprise. FY 2019 Performance Plan NSF's FY 2019 APP continues two goals aimed at monitoring of key program and infrastructure investments. The FY 2019 APP also includes two goals aimed at maintaining and improving customer service: NSF's longstanding performance goal to make timely award decisions and a goal new in FY 2018 1 www.nsf.gov/about/performance Performance Performance - 4 that focuses on improving the quality of the reviews written by outside reviewers. This goal includes new targets for FY 2019 associated with the agency's reform plan. NSF's long -standing diversity and inclusion goal has been updated to focus on leadership engagement. In addition to the APG on partnerships , which supports agency reform efforts , NSF has also added new performance goals tied to the agency reform plans to ensure alignment of job requirements with competencies and improve use r interactions with IT systems. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 5 FY 2017 STRATEGIC OB JECTIVE PROGRESS UPDATES In FY 2017, the National Science Foundation conducted Strategic Reviews of the seven Strategic Objectives in its 2014- 2018 Strategic Plan, in response to the requirement of the GPRA Modernization Act 2010 Section 1116(f). The FY 2 017 strategic review was a high -level assessment of the NSF strategic review process. The strategic review team assessed both the aggregate outcomes of the recommendations from all the earlier reviews as well as the effectiveness of the strategic review process itself. The strategic review required substantial data collection and analysis to provide the evidence to objectively assess the process and support recommendations to improve the process. The strategic review team included members from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, NSF's Evaluation and Assessment Capability, and program staff. The team conducted a survey of past participants to obtain views on the strategic review process, interviewed past parti cipants to obtain more contextual information, and reviewed the actions and progress of prior year's recommendations. Several key findings were emphasized in the strategic review report: The process was effective and could be useful as a model for other evidence- based decision- making efforts at NSF. Aspects of the process that were considered to be particularly strong included composition of the teams with specific subject matter expertise, team leadership, well- defined timeline and specific deliverables, and the data and analytic support provided to the strategic review teams. The assessment found that action has been taken on 75 percent of Strategic R eview recommendations. 47 percent of actions recommended were fully complete d. Key r ecommendations ma de by the report included: The strategic review process should be considered as a framework for data- driven decision- making throughout the National Science Foundation. The strategic review process should be used as a model for leadership and staff engagement for agency - wide planning and priority setting. The efficiency and effectiveness of other NSF decision -making groups could be improved by incorporating these aspects of the strategic review process: a defined timeline, specific deliverables, and data and analytic support. Participants should continue to be selected based on their subject matter expertise and their leadership and teamwork skills. Communications with NSF staff should be improved, particularly at the beginning and end of the process. All recommendations were accepted by senior management, and many of these actions are already underway including the final recommendation to consider the strategic review framework for broad based decision -making throughout NSF. Performance Performance - 6 FY 2019 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN NSF's FY 2019 Annual Performance Plan reflects NSF's priorities as identified through its planning and budget process. The table below provides a summary of NSF's performance goals for FY 2019.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 7 Goal 1: Agency Priority Goal: Expand Public and Private Partnerships Goal Statement Expand public and private partnerships to enhance the impact of NSF's investments and contribute to American economic competitiveness and security. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable By September 30, 2019, NSF's number of partnershi ps and/or award actions with other federal agencies, private industry, and foundations/philanthropies will grow by five percent, relative to the FY 2017 baseline, to make available infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources to the U .S. scientific and engineering research and education enterprise. Description This goal aligns with one of the four agency operational reform areas described in this Request's Overview. Private industry, foundations, and non- prof its, together with other f ederal agencies and international funding organizations, bring additional expertise, resources, and capacity to NSF -funded research. This, in turn, accelerates discovery and translation of research to products and services, and enhances preparation of the future workforce to benefit society and grow the American economy. Partnerships require significant time and intellectual capital, as well as strategic foresight, in their development. NSF will improve efficiencies in developing, implementing, and managing partnerships to ultimately grow the number and scope of partnerships and maximize the scientific, economic, and societal impacts of its investments. An i mplementation plan for this APG will be posted on performance.gov. Trend Information This is a new activity in FY 2018 . Lead Organization/s Computer and Information Science and Engineering , Performance Performance - 8 Goal 2. Ensure that Key Program Investments are on Track Goal Statement Ensure that key FY 2019 NSF-wide program investments are implemented and on track. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable 1. Monitor the progress of selected NSF-wide investments using a common set of milestones and indicators: Understanding the Brain (UtB) and Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) . 2. Review the results w ith senior leaders quarterly in data -driven performance reviews. Description Each year, NSF highlights a number of cross -agency investments in the NSF - Wide Investments chapter of its Budget Request to Congress. Although the overall impact of these investments will not be realized for many years, tracking near-term indicators of implementation and progress can help the agency make formative changes or course corrections. Key investments will be selected at the beginning of FY 2019 for strategic monitoring with a set of common metrics. These may include: Contextual indicators, such as the investment's funding level. Input indicators, such as date of release of solicitation, number of proposals received, numbers of reviews conducted. Output indicators, such as number of awards, average and total amounts awarded, and funding rate. Medium- t erm output and outcome indicators that gauge whether funded projects are on track. Activity -specific outcome indicators, e.g., those relating to programmatic long- term goals. Progress will be assessed quarterly and discussed at quarterly review meetings with leadership. Trend Information This has been a goal since FY 2014. The list of monitored programs is subject to change each year based on investment priorities for a particular year. FY Target Result 2017 Monitor 4 programs (NSF INCLUDES, INFEWS, Risk and Resilience, and UtB); review results with leadership. Achieved. 2016 Monitor 3 programs (NSF INCLUDES, INFEWS, and UtB).

Lead Organization/s Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 9 Goal 3: Ensure that Infrastructure Investments are on Track Goal Statement Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Construction Project Monitoring: For all (100 percent) MREFC facilities under construction that are over 10 percent complete, keep negative cost and schedule variance at or below 10 percent. Description NSF monitors the performance of major f acility projects by monitoring cost and schedule variances using Earned Value Management (EVM), a standard measure of performance for construction projects. Projects that are under 10 percent complete are not reported against this goal because EVM data are statistically less meaningful in early stages. The final Q4 EVM results for the reportable projects in the construction s tage are used to determine whether NSF has met this goal. Trend Information Note : N SF currently has only three projects in the construction s tage tha t are greater than 10 percent complete due to project completion s since FY 2015. For more details on these projects , see the MREFC chapter of this Request . Lead Organization/s Large Facilities Office, Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Target Trends, FY 2012- 2017Performance Performance - 10 Goal 4: Make Timely Award Decisions Goal Statement Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding in a timely manner . Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable 75 percent of proposal funding decisions are made within 182 days of deadline, target, or receipt date, whichever is later. Description Time -to-decision or \"dwell time\" is the amount of time that passes between receipt of a proposal and notification to the principal investigat or about the funding decision. An important issue raised in customer satisfaction surveys is the time it takes NSF to process proposals. Too long a time period inhibits the progress of research as it delays the funding process, but too short a time period may weaken the merit review process by forcing premature decisions . The optimal dwell time depends on a number of factors including the complexity of the proposed activity, the need for co- review by more than one panel, the need for site review, infrastructure requirements of the proposed activity, and t he potential size of the award. Large, complex proposals require more time under review to ensure that taxpayer dollars are invested wisely. Trend Information NSF has tracked six month dwell time as a performance goal for over a decade and has consistently met a t arget of 70 percent. In FY 2015, the six month target was increased to 75 percent. NSF did not meet the 75 percent target in FY 2017 for reasons relating to its move to new headquarters at the end of the fiscal year .

Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable By September 30, 2019 , 1. 60 NSF programs will have had reviewers view the presentation \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 8,000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing written reviews. 3. Improve the perceptions reported by survey respondents in a repeat survey of proposers and reviewers. Increase the percentage of PI survey respondents who agree that written reviews are thorough from a baseline of 55 percent (2015) to 57 percent in FY 2019. Increase the percentage of PI survey respondents who agree that written reviews are technically sound from a baseline of 63 percent (2015) to 65 percent in FY 2019. Description This goal aligns with one of the four agency operational reform areas described in this Request's Overview. This goal addr esses and incorporates feedback NSF has received about its customer service. Committees of Visitors (COVs), program officers, and principal inv estigators frequently note that the quality of individual written reviews is variable. In 2015, NSF conducted a survey of researchers who were submitting and/or reviewing proposals. Survey respondents identified the quality of reviews as the factor that would have the most significant effect on improving their proposals and fostering science (see chart below, n =22,174 respondents). This goal measures the implementation of a pilot program, initiated in December 2016, to improve the quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. The pilot encourages NSF programs to use the video presentation \"Tips on how to write bette r reviews \" early in the review process to orient reviewers a nd provide information on how to write more effective reviews . The assumption is that orienting reviewers before the reviews are written (as opposed to at the beginning of a review panel, at which time the reviews have been drafted but not finalized) helps reviewers better understand and apply the review criteria. The intention is to make written reviews more useful to both principal 16%55%12%3%14% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%Timeliness and responsiveness to, proposals by NSF staffQuali ty of feedback to PIs in the form of reviewers' comments and panel summariesQuality of PI conversations with, and written comments from, program officersQuality of information available during proposal submissionQuality of the review process from the perspective of a reviewerPerformance Performance - 12 investigators and NSF program staff. NS F will conduct another survey in FY 2019 to learn whether the perceived quality of reviews has changed. The anticipated survey will take upwards of a year to field and analyze following the pilot program. For additional information about how this performance goal is aligned with reform efforts, costs and savings, and a multi -year roadmap of this activity, please see the Agency Reform Plan chapter. Trend A strategic review in the spring of 2015 recommended that NSF apply what was Information learned from the PI and reviewer survey to inform a new performance goal aimed at improving customer service. This goal was designed in response to that recommendation and was new in FY 2018. Lead Office of Integrative Activities, Office of the Director Organization/s FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 13 Goal 6: Foster a Culture of Inclusion Goal Statement Foster a culture of inclusion through active engagement of leadership. Indicator To be determined in spring 2018 . Description NSF puts a high premium on diversity and inclusion: by engaging the talent of all our workforce, individuals are empowered to realize their full potential; by insuring that our workforce is diverse, our collective ability to deliver on our scientific mission is enhanced. NSF is always looking for ways to intensify and innovate diversity efforts through active leadership and include and engage everyone in the workplace. In mid-FY 2018, NSF is establish ing a new Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Group that will help NSF to continue its effort to attract, retain, and cultivate diverse leaders and staff. The group will have members representing a cross -section of NSF employees: leadership, the NSF Union, administrative staff, and programmatic staff. The Head of ODI, the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), the Deputy CHCO, and the Labor Relations Officer will serve in an advisory capacity to the group as ex -officio (non- voting) members. The group will be action- oriented, proposing approaches to cultivate and mo del a workplace culture that supports inclusion, collaboration, employee engagement, transparency, and information sharing to enable the NSF to achieve the highest level of organizational performance. Once t he group is established, it will plan its first few years of activities. Targets for FY 2019 will be established in spring of 2018. Trend Information NSF has had a performance goal relating to diversity and inclusion since FY 2011. For five years, goals were largely focused on NSF's efforts to attain \"Model EEO Agency\" status. Inclusion represented a new direction for this goal since FY 2016. For more information, refer to the FY 2015 A PR in the FY 2017 NSF Budget Request.1 FY Target Result 2017 Conduct the N ew IQ process with two NSF units, improve the units' New IQ Self- Survey Scores by five percent above established baseline.

Goal Statement Ensure that employee job requirements are aligned with competencies and skills needed for the future. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable By the end of FY 2019, the Division of Human Resource Management will review, modernize, or eliminate 10 percent of the existing position descriptions requiring review. Description This goal aligns with one of the four agency operational reform areas described in this Request's Overview . Technological improvements have automated many tasks once performed by NSF staff. Requirements for NSF's administrative staff have evolved from the more traditional competencies related to general clerical and office tasks such as categorizing, processing and tracking paper forms to more advanced competencies related to the use of multiple automated data systems. Additionally, the increasing high number of proposals NSF receives , processed by the relatively stable num ber of program officers, means greater support is needed in data processing, data mining, analytics, and use of automated processes. NSF is also putting into place efforts to enable transdisciplinary, convergent research , and t he agency needs to ensure its current and future workforce can adapt to this convergent approach. NSF will review and realign its workforce to ensure its greatest resource - its people - are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and abilities for success now and in the future. Ultimate ly, this will result in increased alignment between NSF's organizational structure, its core mission, and strategic plan. NSF will improve performance and increase accountability by systematically reviewing the NSF workforce from top to bottom. This revi ew will allow NSF to revise position descriptions (PDs) that are outdated or do not reflect current and future work responsibilities. This PD modernization effort will enable NSF to identify the skills needed in today's work environment and will establish more relevant opportunities for training and developing NSF's existing workforce, while also enabling hiring managers to better target recruitment and outreach efforts to obtain the highest caliber of external cand idates. Trend Information This will be a new activity in FY 2018 and FY 2019 relating to agency operational reform. Lead Organization/s Division of Human Resource Management, Office of Information and Resource Management FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 15 Goal 8. Improve user interactions with IT systems. Goal Statement Streamline and simplify user interactions with IT systems and functions that support the merit review process, reducing non- value -added steps and reducing the time spent managing the proposal and award lifecycle. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable 1. By the end of FY 2019, NSF IT syste ms will have been available 99.5 percent of the time, excluding 469 hours of planned downtime. 2. By the end of FY 2019, 72 p ercent of internal merit review functions will be accessible through a single portal. 3. By the end of FY 2019, 32 p ercent of external merit review functions will be accessible through a single portal. Description This goal aligns with one of the four agency operational reform areas described in this Request's Overview . As NSF positions itself to operate as a more agile organization, information technology (IT) will play a major role in enabling NSF's mission and allowing NSF to remain flexible to adapt to reform areas. NSF will look to leverage state-of-the- art IT soluti ons from the private and public sectors to develop flexible tools that support the formation of agile work teams; to drive changes in the way research is solicited, identified, and funded; and to ensure user adoption is achieved to the maximum extent possi ble while also easing the use of IT systems. This emphasis on efficiency and improved service to end users will ensure that IT responds rapidly to changes in the way NSF is organized and carries out its mission, with the goal of ensuring that NSF IT tools minimize staff workload and simplify decision- making by providing accurate data, easy-to-use interfaces, and readily available and reliable access. Indicator 1, Percent of Systems Availability, measures the amount of time that the system is up and runnin g, AND is available for access because connectivity is available (i.e. no network or internet outages impact accessibility). Indicator 2 is the percentage of internal merit review functions accessible through a single portal. Indicator 3 is the percentage of external merit review functions accessible through a single portal. For more information about implementation, costs and savings, and a multi -year roadmap of this activity, please see the Agency Reform Plan chapter. Trend Information As of June 30, 2017, the values for the three indicators were: 1. Systems Availability: 99.7 percent, excluding planned downtime. 2. Internal merit review functions available through a single portal: 59 percent. 3. External merit review functions available through a single portal: 14 percent. Lead Organization/s Office of the Chief Information Officer and the Division of Information Systems, Office of Information and Resource Management Performance Performance - 16 FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT In FY 2017, NSF tracked progress toward its three strategic goals using nine performance goals, two of which were Agency Priority Goals (APGs). Four of the nine goals fully a chieved their targets in FY 2017 and five did not achieve one or more targets. Below is a tabular summary .

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 17 Goal 1: Improve Graduat e Student Preparedness (Agency Priority Goal) Lead Organization s: Directorate for Geosciences, Directorate for Engineering , Directorate for Social and Behavioral Sciences. Goal Statement Improve STEM graduate student preparedness for entering the workfor ce. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion A strong global economy relies on the ability to capitalize on technical innovations that result from a skilled and agile STEM workforce. To achieve this, the Nation's scientific workforce must evolve and mature to include more doctoral level researchers i n positions outside of academia. These positions require comprehensive preparation in science at the graduate level, as well as proficiency in other critical skills. However, Ph.D. training remains largely focused on preparation for the research component of academic careers with an emphasis on skills needed at research institutions. The purpose of this APG was to provide opportunities for science and engineering doctoral students to acquire the knowledge, experience, and skills needed for highly producti ve careers, inside and outside of academe. To achieve this goal, NSF took two approaches: piloting support for summer institutes, to provide students with broad experiences in professional development areas, and supporting supplements to existing research awards, to enhance graduate education opportunities. Supplements were cat egorized as either enhancing the student's experience or activities . Enhanced experience awards were single or collaborative awards for graduate students to acquire professional development experience. Enhanced activity awards went to \"center -like\" activities that support cohorts of graduate students with the goal of developing new \"best practice activities for enhancing graduate student preparedness.\" Goal Category FY 2016 FY 2017 Total Summer Institutes 1 4 5 All supplements 80 83 163 Enhanced experience 68 77 139 Enhanced activity 12 6 18 A portfolio analysis of the awards made under this APG is underway to inform future decision- making in this area. FY Target Final 2 -Year Result 2016 -2017 By September 30, 2017, NSF will fund at least three summer institutes and 75 supplements to existing awards to provide STEM doctoral students with opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills to prepare for a range of careers. Summer Institutes = 5 Supplements = 163 Trend Information This was a new goal in FY 2016. The topic was identified through the 2015 Strategic Review process. Performance Performance - 18 Goal 2: Invest Strategically in Public Participation in STEM Research (PPSR) (Agency Priority Goal) Lead Organizations: Directorate for Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering, Directorate for Education and Human Resources. Goal Statement Build the capacity of the Nation to solve research challenges and improve learning by inv esting strategically in crowdsourcing and other forms of public participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics research (PPSR). Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion Scientists, mathematicians, and engineers have involved the public in their research efforts to solve challenging problems for centuries . These types of activities have been referred to in a variety of ways. For this goal, PPSR is used as an overarching term that includes citizen science, crowdsourcing research, and similar activities . PPSR has grown significantly in the past decade, in part due to new technological tools that facilitate interactions between scientists and participants . PPSR approaches can address new research questions and contribute to ongoing STEM research. To achieve this APG, NSF used three specific funding mechanisms to fund proposals that expli citly include PPSR approaches: Early -concept Grants for (EAGERs) are designed as \"high risk -high payoff\" awards with the potential to explore new areas within PPSR and/or further our understanding of how PPSR is leveraged to support scientific discovery and the public's engagement with research . NSF aimed to fund five EAGERs a year that included PPSR. Across both years, 40 such EAGERs, funding 34 separate projects,1 were funded by five different directorates. Supplements to existing awards provide opportunities to include PPSR a pproaches in projects that are appropriate for PPSR but ha dn't already incorporated PPSR approaches. NSF aimed to fund five supplements a year that included a focus on PPSR. At least 18 supplements supporting PPSR were funded over the two- year period, acro ss at least five directorates. More supplements that meet the criteria may be identified. Research Coordination Networks (RCNs) support communication and coordination across disciplinary, organizational, institutional, and geographic boundaries . Two RCNs t hat support PPSR were funded over the APG period. Over the course of FY 2016 and FY 2017, six Dear Colleague Letters were issued that called for proposals that helped achieve this APG, including one that was specifically issued as a result of the Priorit y Goal (NSF 17 -047, \" Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) : Public Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, 1 Some projects were submitted as collaborative proposals, resulting in multiple awards . FY Target Final 2 -Year Result 2016 -2017 By September 30, 2017, NSF will implement mechanisms to expand and deepen the engagement of the public in research . EAGERs = 34 projects Supplements = 18 Research Coordination Networks = 2 Trend Information This wa s a new goal in FY 2016. The topic was identified through the 2015 Strategic Review process. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 19 an d Mathematics Research: Capacity -building, Community-building, and Direction- setting \"). NSF also used mechanisms designed to receive input from stakeholder communities to ensure that its efforts to support PPSR were appropriately informed: Convened stakeholders external to the federal government to help NSF identify trends, opportunities, and gaps in PPSR, and inform how NSF targets funding opportunities towards scientific needs and public audiences. Over the two -year timeframe of this goal, NSF officials interacted with two NSF Advisory Committees and the national Citizen Science Association (CSA) steering committee, and conducted outreach at CSA's biennial meeting, among others. NSF also funded three PI -led conferences with significant PPSR components and called for conference proposals to support PPSR in NSF 17 -047. Conferred with other federal agencies to inform and coordinate efforts related to PPSR. At least 17 such conferrals occurred in the timeframe of this goal, most often with the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science, as well as with the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Social Computing Interagency Working Group. Issued communications highlighting PPSR and related funding opportunities. A total of six funding opportunities were released, as well as a video, \"Pick Your Passion w ith Citizen Science\".2 NSF 16 -031: DCL: Leveraging GLOBE to Increase Student Engagem ent and Diversity NSF 16 -059: DCL : Citizen and Engineering Research NSF 16 -119 DCL : Support for Engaging Students and the Publ ic in Polar Research NSF 17 -047: DCL : Public Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Research: Capacity -building, Community-building, and Direction- setting NSF 17 -055: : Participation in ing Research: Water Qual ity NSF 17 -129: DCL : Support for Engaging Students and the Public in Polar Research 2 www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ijSk -QWwjw Performance Performance - 20 Goal 3: Ensure that Key Program Investments are on Track Lead Organization: Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. Goal Statement Ensure that key NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion NSF instituted this goal in FY 2014 to track the interim progress of major investments towards their long- term goals. Each year, NSF highlights a number of cross -agency investments in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter of its Budget Request to Congress. Although the overall impact of these investments will not be realized for many years, tracking near -term indicators of implementation and progress can help the agency make formative changes or course corrections. In FY 2017, NSF successfully monitored the progress of four NSF-wide investments (NSF INCLUDES, INFEWS, Risk and Resilience, and Understanding the Brain) using a common set of indicators and reviewed the results with senior leaders. The indicators that NSF chose to measure were programmatic inputs and outputs that can provide valuable signals to managers and leaders about a program's vitality and potential success, as they address whether the program is being administered as planned or whether the program is generating enough interest from the community. NSF also added the second target in FY 2017 to monitor the presentation of results to leadership. The following w ere tracked quarterly in F Y 2017: Input indicator: progress towards the investment's funding level target. Output indicators: solicitations issued, proposals received, awards made. Program -specific activities: e.g. PI meetings, workshops, and/or evaluation contract deliverables. These measures enabled managers and leaders to quickly gauge the status of a program's implementation, interest from the scientific community, whether the review process resulted in awards in a timely manner, FY Target Result 2017 1. Monitor the progress of the following NSF -wide investments using a common set of milestones and indicators: NSF INCLUDES, INFEWS, Risk and Resilie nce, and UtB. 2. Review the results with senior leaders quarterly in d at a-driven performance reviews. Achieved Trend Information 2016 Monitor the progress of the following NSF -wide investments using a common set of milestones and indicators: NSF INCLUDES, INFEWS, and UtB.

Not achieved (4 of 6 monitored) FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 21 and whether the program has met its internal goa ls for short -term outcomes. Tracking these measures over time provided managers and leaders with the opportunity to assess whether mid -course corrections were needed to improve program management and/or the overall direction of the investment. Performance Performance - 22 Goal 4: En sure that Research Infrastructure Investments are on Track Lead Organization: Large Facilities Office, Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. Goal Statement Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion The MREFC account supports the acquisition, construction, and commissioning of major research facilities and equipment that provide unique capabilities at the frontiers of science and engineering. Performance of construction projects funded by the MREFC account is monitored using the Earned Value Management (EVM) system. EVM is an integrated management control system for assessing, understanding, and quantifying what a contractor or field activity is achieving with program dollars. Monitoring cost and sched ule is a standard measure of performance for construction projects. Projects that are under 10 percent complete are not considered eligible for this goal because EVM data is less meaningful statistically in the very early stages of a project. Two of the t hree projects that were over ten percen t complete by the end of FY 2017 were on track . At the end of FY 2017, the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) was 78 percent complete and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) was 44 percent complete. Both projects had cost and schedule variances well below the 10 percent thresholds. Explanation of Unmet Goal The goal was not met because of schedule issues associated with the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) , which was 75 percent complete at the end of FY 2017. These are discussed further in the NEON section of the MREFC Chapter of this Request. FY Target Result 2017 Construction Project Monitoring: For all (100 percent) MREFC facilities under construction that are over 10 percent complete, keep negative cost and schedule variance at or below 10 percent. Not achieved (2 of 3 projects were within cost and schedule variances) .

NSF set a goal of retaining 70 percent of the permanent workforce that was onboard at the end of FY 2015 through its move, which concluded at the end of FY 2017 (Target 2). The two -year retention rate of permanent staff through the end of FY 2017 was 86 percent. Portfolio Stat NSF's IT governance bodies (the Enterprise Architecture Working Grou p, Capital Planning and Investment Control Working Group, and the IT Resou rces Board) prepared the FY 2019 IT budget request and prioritized the IT investment portfolio (Target 3) . To inform their investment decisions, cost and schedule data (Target 4) wer e presented to the governing bodies throughout the course of the fiscal year. Major investments reviewed included Enterprise Business Intelligence ( BI), Public Access, and Proposal Management Efficiencies.

FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 25 Goal 6: Make Timely Award Decisions Lead Organization: Office of Integrative Activities. Goal Statement Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within 182 days, or six months, of deadline, target, or receipt date, whichever is later. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion Time to decision or \"dwell time\" is the amount of time that passes between receipt of a proposal and notification to the principal investigator about the funding decision. One of the most significant issues raised in customer satisfaction surveys is the time it takes NSF to process proposals. Too long a time period inhibits the progress of research as it delays the funding process, but too short a time period may weaken the merit review process by forcing premature decisions. The six -month target seeks to strike a balance between the need of the investigator for timely action and the need of NSF for a credible merit review system. Explanation of Unmet Goal NSF staff were directed to prioritize processing award decisions ahead of decline decisions in FY 2017 to facilitate an early close -out in advance of NSF's move to new headquarters in Alexandria. The FY 2017 result reflects this delay in decline processing. Goal Change History In FY 2015, this target was raised from 70 percent to 75 percent to be more i n line with the historical trend of achievement at or above this level. The exception of FY 2014, in which NSF exceeded the 70 percent target by a historically low margin, was likely due to Foundation- wide delays in proposal processing after the lapse in funding authority in October 2013. FY Target Result 2017 75 percent. Not a chieved. Result = 71 percent. Decision Trends, FY 2012- 2017Performance Performance - 26 Goal 7: Foster a Culture of Inclusion Lead Organization: Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI), Office of the Director. Goal Statement Foster a culture of inclusion through change management efforts resulting in change leadership and accountability . 4 Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion Fostering inclusive work environments and realizing the full potential of the workforce's diversity requires agencies to employ effective management practices. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs, developed the New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) in FY 2013 to measure and drive inclusive intelligence in the federal workplace. Inclusive intelligence is defined as intentional, deliberate, and proactive acts that ensure that people feel they belong and a re uniquely valued. OPM has recently developed a process to supplement use of the New IQ by using change management tools to help agencies support diversity and inclusion more fully. The expected outcome of the process is that the leaders will improve th e employee engagement levels of their employees, resulting in an increase in the overall New IQ scores and corresponding FEVS scores over time. NSF recognizes that having a workforce comprised of a mix of permanent and temporary rotator staff requires targ eted efforts. In addition, NSF's workforce is challenged on another inclusion front with the administrative and scientific staffs' feelings about uniqueness and belongingness. NSF anticipates that implementing the New IQ process in several of 4 NSF has had a performance goal relating to diversity and inclusion since FY 2011. Former goals were largely focused on NSF's efforts to attain \"Model EEO Agency\" status. For information on earlier versions of this goal, including full goal language, refer to the FY 2015 Performance Report in FY 2017 2017 By September 30, 2017, ODI will conduct the New IQ process with three a dditional organizational units. NSF will improve the three units' New IQ Self -Survey Scores by seven percent above established baseline. No targets achieved. Trend Information 2016 1. By September 30, 2016, ODI will conduct the new IQ process with two NSF organizational units. 2.

Achieved FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 27 NSF's organiz ational units will initiate a set of behavior changes that can become habits throughout the Foundation. Explanation of Unmet Goal NSF's plan to implement the New IQ in FY 2017 was delayed due to potential distractions related to the relocation to Alexandria. In FY 2018, results from the 2017 FEVS will be used as the initial pulse survey for participating units. NSF is also implementing the Workforce Inclusiveness Assessment (WIA) in FY 2018, a survey instrument that will provide a deeper dive into the culture of the agency. Data from the WIA will be used to implement additional interventions and initiatives to supplement behavioral change , which should increase sustained change within the organization. Performance Performance - 28 Goal 8: Evaluate NSF Investments Lead Organization: Office of Integrative Activities. Goal Statement Enable consistent evaluation of the impact of NSF investments with a high degree of rigor and independence. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion The Evaluation and Assessment Capability (EAC), housed in the Office of Integrative Activities, provides NSF with the independent capacity to operate from a basis of evidence in program and policy decisions. The EAC has three multi -year goals: ( 1) encourag e a culture of evidence- based planning and policy - making ; (2) encourage increased rigor, independence, and consistency in all evaluations and assessments ; and ( 3) develop and implement a coordinated evaluation framework. As of the end of FY 2017, EAC has evaluation contracts underway involving all of the seven directorates (see below). Each of these seven new contract statements of work has outlined an evaluation framework. The evaluations are of cross- directorate programs, which entails some directorates being involved in more than one contract and evaluation framework. Each directorate is involved in at least one contracted study. FY Target Result 2017 By September 30, 2017, NSF will have developed seven ad ditional evaluation frameworks. The Evaluation and Assessment Capability will work with at least seven programs (one in each directorate) to develop evaluation frameworks to be included in program management plans. Achieved Trend Information 2016 By September 30, 2016, NSF will have developed three illustrative models of evaluation frameworks in the following three areas: 1. investments in the development of U.S. science and engineering human capital, 2. investments in established NSF -w ide priorities, and 3. long- term strategic investments. All targets achieved 2015 (new goal) 1. By September 2015, the Evaluation and Assessment Capability will have developed evaluation quality principles and disseminated them to all directorates. 2. These quality principles will be followed by all new evaluation projects across t he agency. 3. NSF will have incorporated logic models/theory of change in the language that describes the rationale for all new programs.

Goal Statement Increase the percentage of proposal review panelists that participate virtually while maintaining the quality of the merit review process. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion NSF makes extensive use of panels of reviewers to evaluate proposals, holding around 1900 panels annually. Review panels provide ample opportunity to test new methods and practices. One such practice, the use of virtual meeting technology to supplement or replace in- person panels , 5 was piloted at NSF from the early 2010s under the assumption that face -to-face panels impose a significant time burden on reviewers. NSF has had a performance goal relating to virtual panel usage since FY 2012 .6 Usage of virtual panelists peaked in FYs 2013 and 2014 due to several factors: a response to reductions in travel budgets; development of training materials; and management's encouragement to utilize virtual panels as a viable reviewer participation mechan ism. Explanation of Unmet Goal The 28 percent target was a \"stretch\" level and not in line wit h projections for likely FY 2017 virtual panelist usage. Setting a stretch goal did not play a role in driving performance in this area. 5 The term \"virtual panelist\" refers to a panel reviewer who does not travel to a common location but instead participates via teleconference, videoconference, or an online meeting technology. 6 For four years, the goal tracked a pilot project that measured the number of \"wholly virtual\" panels, i.e. panels that used only virtual panelists. For more information about earlier versions of this goal, refer to the FY 2015 Annual Performance Report in the FY 2017 Request ( By September 30, 2017 , at least 28 percent of merit review panelists will participate virtually.

The management challenges are identified by NSF's Inspector General and announced at the beginning of each fiscal year. In response, the Director issues a memo to acknowledge receipt of the OIG Management Challenges and to provide a report on NSF's progress and achievements made over the prior year. The OIG's challenges, NSF's response, and NSF's progress update towards addressing previously identified challenges are included in the annual Agency Financial Report (AFR) published in November on NSF's website. 1 This section provides NSF's progress report highlighting the significant actions taken in FY 2017 on the management challenges identified by NSF's Inspector General at the beginning of that fiscal year.

The Foundation currently utilizes end- to-end oversight policies and procedures to ensure adequate stewardship over federal funds for the full project life -cycle. These activiti es are carried out starting with the day -to-day oversight by the Science and Engineering Directorates and the Office of Budget, Finance and Award Management (BFA) and extend through the decisional and governing responsibilities of the Office of the Directo r (O/D) and the National Science Board (NSB). The Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction (MREFC) Panel provides additional oversight of the design stage, which includes readiness for advancement and establishing the performance baseline for construction . Within BFA, the Large Facilities Office (LFO) develops policies and procedures related to large facilities, provides assistance to the program offices, and assures that policies, procedures, and good practices are being followed. Other BFA assur ance units include the Cooperative Support Branch within the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS/CSB) and the Division of Institution and Award Support's Cost Analysis and Pre- award Branch (DIAS/CAP), which supports cost analysis and othe r pre-award activities in an advisory capacity to CSB. NSF has been continuously enhancing its pre -award and post -award oversight of major facilities in construction and operations since June 2014. These enhancements are documented in the latest revision of the Large Facilities Manual (LFM) and internal Standard Operating Guidance (SOG). The December 2015 report by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) supported NSF's use of cooperative agreements. However, the report also noted that NSF sh ould \"apply equal emphasis to increased internal management of the business practices critical to the enhanced oversight and project success\" in order to bring them into balance with the science and technical aspects of oversight. Challenge 1 Ensure adequate oversight of large facilities awards, including operations awards. Ensure that the emphasis on science results does not come at the expense of sound business practices, noting NAPA's call for equal emphasis on these two objectives. Progress Made in FY 2017 Revised the Large Facilities Manual (NSF 17 -066) to codify American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) requirements and other newly -strengthened oversight requirements for NSF and Recipients. In accordance with AICA and BOAC Subcommittee recommendations, named the NSF Chief Operating Officer (COO) as the agency \"Senior Accountable Official\" for major facilities oversight . Implemented process for conducting incurred cost audits and accounting system audits led by CSB. Socialized new oversight requirements with major facilities community at annual Large Facilities Workshop (May 2017). Revised the A -123 Major Facilities Oversight Process Narrative. Implemented a new combined annual CSB/LFO major facilities portfolio risk assessment in draft form (June 2017) to increase engagement and collaboration between CSB, LFO, and Programs in assessing risk and selecting cooperative agreement Recipients for review activities including audits. Future Implementation Milestones Finalize internal Standard Opera ting Guidance for joint CSB/LFO annual portfolio risk assessment (Fall 2017). FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 33 Consider OD staffing requirements to support COO as Senior Accountable Official and periodic Directorate- level major facilities briefings with COO. (Fall 2017) Challenge 2 Ensur e access to quality Earned Value Management (EVM) data; validate the EVM report that awardees provide and require that EVM systems be certified. Progress Made in FY 2017 Codified and implemented Earned Value Management System (EVMS) Verification, Acceptance and Surveillance procedures (LFO SOG 17 -2). Completed EVMS Acceptance on DKIST and LSST projects. Completed Verification Review of the Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV) project EVMS. F uture Implementation Milestones Complete acceptance of RCRV proj ect EVMS prior to initiating physical ship construction (Spring 2018). Conduct EVMS Verification Review on the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project (December 2017). Challenge 3 Implement new policy changes based on NAPA and OIG recommendations to ensure effective oversight. Progress Made in FY 2017 Closed nearly 50 of the 55 OIG recommendations (90 percent ) related to oversight of major facilities dating back to 2012. Received BOAC NAPA Implementation Subcommittee Report and began consideration/implementation of recommendations (March 2017). Initiated BOAC Subcommittee on Cost Surveillance to assess NSF's strengthened policies and procedures (June 2017). Developed and implemented revised internal policies and procedures related to \"fee\" (July 2017). F uture Implementation Milestones Develop and implement new internal policies and procedures related to management reserve (Fall 2017). Implement formal Lessons Learned program (preparing pilot for launch at Large Facilities Workshop; May 2018). Enhance documentation and formalization of NSF Communities of Practice (PO Forum Charter; Fall 2017). Implement NSF -wide \"Core Competency\" staff requirements (Standard Operating Guidance) related to major facilities oversight (Fall 2017). Strengthen MREFC Panel oversight role (full life -cycle) based on BOAC subcommittee recommendations (Pilot new \"Major Facilities Panel\" concept in Q1 CY 2018). Revise and implement internal policies and procedures related to NSF cost analysis, and independen t cost estimate reviews based on American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) requirements (Fall 2017). Performance Performance - 34 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Improper Payments Lead: Division Director, BFA/DFM NSF Management Overview NSF Management does not consider improper payments to be a significant risk to NSF's mission, programs, or operations . In May 2017 the NSF OIG issued a report on NSF's compliance with the Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) requirements for FY 2016. The OIG concluded the NSF complied with the requirements of IPERA and had addressed all recommendations from the previous OIG report . This was the second consecutive report finding NSF in compliance with IPERA reporting requirements. The May 2017 OIG report had no recommendations and no resolution tracking requirements . The two reports validate that NSF has taken the steps necessary to demonstrate compliance and effectiveness in the agency's implementation of IPERA . In summary, NSF has: Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support to incorporate risk management concepts into business processes and management functions; Ensured that NSF has the people and resources to effectively comply with IPERA by assigning a senior staff associate responsible for coordi nating and integrating risk management and program integrity activities; Executed an action plan that addressed the root cause of the IPERA reporting issue, implemented solutions, and completed all OIG recommendations; Established processes to monitor and validate the effectiveness and sustainability of the corrective measures; and Incorporated corrective measures into policy and process documentation. The milestones listed below describe NSF's efforts to maintain and monitor IPERA compliance. Challenge i) Address significant limitations in NSF's analysis of six of the nine White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) risk factors, and ii) improve assessment of NSF payments to employees, e.g. payroll testing and interviewing HRM regarding administering salary and benefits. OIG has made eight recommendations to strengthen NSF IPERA risk assessments. Progress Made in FY 2017 Developed and published standard operating guidance (SOG) BFA 2017- 1 on November 10, 2016 for improper payments risk reviews incorporating the nine IPERA risk factors and additional considerations from the OIG review report. Completed an improper payments risk review for FY 2016. The risk review included input from subject matter experts for grants, contracts, charge cards, and payments to employees. Received OIG inspection of the FY 2016 risk review, which found NSF in compliance with the requirements of IPERA. F uture Implementation Milestones Update the improper payments risk review SOG by providing additional details for the p rocess to obtain and group fiscal year disbursements and refine the evaluation of the SME input on the nine IPERA risk factors. Publish the update by November 1, 2017. Complete an improper payments risk review for FY 2017 outlays per the SOG (planned for early FY 2018). Plan and conduct an improper payments risk assessment for FY 2018 by December 31, 2018. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 35 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Information & IT Resources Lead: Division Director, OIRM/DIS NSF Management Overview NSF is aware that the availability of IT resources and security posture of its information technology (IT) systems is of critical importance to the Foundation's ability to carry out its mission, particularly in a year in which NSF is relocating its headquarters . NSF employs tools and technology in its Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) program to continuously monitor the network availability and security posture. As part of the ISCM program NSF implemented the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) tools and technology to monitor the network. The IT security program is evaluated yearly by an independent organization in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). NSF has been proactive in reviewi ng security controls and identifying areas to strengthen the program, including incorporation of information gained and lessons learned from the FISMA report. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) proactively monitors its netwo rk to ensure compliance with security requirements. OPP allocates appropriate resources to the USAP IT security program to address information security requirements and FISMA review findings. Challenge (i) Before the move in FY 2017, NSF should increase the timing and robustness of IT testing, and after the move, NSF should ensure agency information and IT resources remain available, secure, and complete. Efforts may be assisted by using information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) strategies. (ii) Allocate appropriate resources to correct IT weaknesses related to the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) and ensure the systems and information are adequately protected. Progress Made in FY 2017 : NSF Move Continued to maintain a detailed move plan for IT systems and services with comprehensive IT applications testing and validation, including user testing, as IT services are transitioned to the new headquarters building. Completed the electronic move of applications, databases and servers, and validation testin g successfully in June 2017. Completed the physical server move and validation testing successfully in July 2017 . Utilized information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) resources, tools, and strategies to ensure continued availability of services and applications during the stabilization period following NSF's staff moves in late summer/early fall 2017. Progress Made in FY 2017: U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) The Office of Polar Programs (OPP): Completed a thorough review of USAP IT security program controls to ensure compliance with federal guidance and risk management and adequacy of risk management plans. Allocated appropriate resources to the USAP IT security program to address information security findings identified in the annual FISMA review. Documented redundancy capabilities to IG auditors to demonstrate resiliency of the USAP network and re- evaluate a longstanding finding to close the original issue . Initiated a disaster recovery plan to document actions in the event of a contingency. OPP is also planning to complete a business impact analysis to validate their approach to service recovery. Performance Performance - 36 Future Implementation Milestones Continue to monitor the availability, responsiveness, and security of agency IT resources during and after the move to the new headquarters, utilizing information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) strategies in support of these activities . Continue to address identified IT security weaknesses through USAP program funding. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 37 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Transparency & Accountability (DATA Act) Lead: Chief Financial Officer, Senior Accountable Official NSF Management Overview NSF successfully implemented the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) on April 28, 2017. The DATA Act is a government -wide initiative led by OMB and the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) to standardize and publish the federal government's wide variety of reports and data compilations related to spending: financial management, payments, budget actions, procurement, and assistance . NSF senior agency officials were aware of the Act early on, and when the legislation passed, NSF moved immediately to leverage its resources to prepare for implementation . At NSF, the DATA Act has been a cross- agency initiative with early leadership from the NSF Office of the Director supported by subject matter experts in BFA and the Office of Information and Resource Management (OIRM) for implementation support, and an internal governance structure that included an executive -level steering committee, a DATA Act Working Group (DAWG) and a DATA Act Project Management Office (PMO) . The Senior Accountable Official (SAO) is presently the Acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Office Head of BFA. Additionally, NSF collaborated with its OIG around stewardship and supported the OIG in its efforts to publish a DATA Act readiness review by November 2016. OIG staff have consistently had access to all DATA Act -related materials through meetings, interviews and the DAWG SharePoint site. NSF implemented all of the OIG project management -related recommendations and took steps to address ongoing OIG concerns around human resources planning. Government- wide, NSF staff have represented the agency in connection with DATA Act -related activities, including the Financial Assistance Committee for E -government (FACE); the Data Standards Committee, an Executive -level interagency group representing the budget, financial assistance and procurement communities charged with making recommendations on issues o f government -wide data standardization; the Procurement Committee for E -government; and numerous additional DATA Act -related workshops, meetings and small -group strategy sessions with OMB, Treasury, and other CFO Act agencies. These collaborations have been key to NSF's DATA Act implementation success. NSF success is also attributable to its risk -based approach to implementation. The agency actively took steps to identify and mitigate risks and evaluated multiple approaches to ensure on time compliance. No major system changes were required in order for NSF to meet the deadline. Going forward, the agency will work towards operationalizing the DATA Act submission and will continue its successful and on time implementation . The DAWG will continue to foster strong internal, executive- level and government -wide communication, as needed, and will continue to support the OIG as needed in its upcoming DATA Act audit scheduled for publication by November 2017. Challenge Achieve successful implementation of the DATA Act despite evolving federal guidance, the late release of Treasury's production- ready broker, the late release of iTRAK software patches, limited available agency FTE, the potential that NSF's relocation may impact DATA Act activities, and the lack of a clear funding source for NSF's DATA Act implementation efforts. Progress Made in FY 2017 Developed and implemented a Corrective Action Plan in response to OIG Readiness Review. Developed human resources tracking document maintained on SharePoint in response to ongoing OIG DATA Act staffing concerns. Generated and tested Award Submission Portal (ASP) data file per Treasury's evolving specifications from FY 2016 Q3 through FY 2017 Q1. Performance Performance - 38 Developed a business intelligence solution for generating ASP submission and correction files using the award data from the Awards system and System for Award Management (SAM) information from iTRAK data extracts, for submitting NSF's financial assistance data to USASpending.gov. Complied with ASP submission requirements to USASpending.gov starting with January 2017 datasubmission. Implemented initial Oracle patch for award attributes and modified award system interfaces with iTRAK to populate the following attributes: Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID), Parent Award Identifier (PAID), Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN), and Unique Record Identifier (URI). Uploaded financial assistance and procurement files to populate the award attributes in iTRAK. Implemented Oracle patch for main DATA Act functionality to confi gure mappings and generate files that are required to be submitted to Treasury's production- ready broker (Broker) for subsequent public reporting of financial data. [These files are: file A (Appropriations Account Data), B (Object Class andProgram Activity Data), and C (Award Financial Data).] Developed custom solution (alternative, back -up approach) that leverages existing iTRAK reports and NSF tools to generate files A, B, and C, and reconciliation reports to mitigate risk of not having theOracle patches ready for DATA Act compliance by May 2017. Developed Program Activity mappings to crosswalk iTRAK file B data with Program Activity Codes from the Program and Financing (P&F) Schedule in the President's Budget Appendix. Generated files A, B, and C using the custom solution. Performed Broker testing by uploading agency-generated files A, B, and C. Performed Broker testing by extracting data for files D1 (Award and Awardee Attributes forProcurement), D2 (Award and Awardee Attributes for Financial Assistance), E (Additional Awardee Attributes), and F (Sub -award Attributes). Performed Broker testing in order to validate files A through F to facilitate certification of NSF's data. Implemented custom solution to generate files A, B, C, and reconciliati on reports, and submitted files A - F prior to the DATA Act compliance date of May 2017. Achieved compliance with May 2017 DATA Act implementation deadline. Received the Secretary's Certificate of Appreciation from the U.S. Department of the Treasury in recognition of NSF's outstanding commitment to collaboration while implementing the DATA Act onJune 28, 2017. Documented standard operating procedures for generation, certification, and submission of files A- F. Engaged with OIG and responded to the OIG Provided by Client (PBC) List with requested materialsin support of the OIG DATA Act audit report to be published in November 2017. Provided agency source data to Government Accountability Office (GAO) and answered questions tosupport GAO's mandated government -wide DATA Act Data Quality Review; NSF data that had been posted on beta.USASpending.gov was included in the sample of government -wide data GAO pulled to conduct its review. Future Implementation Milestones Transition financial assistance (file D2) reporting from the existing ASP to comply with Treasury's DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) v1.1 and Financial Assistance Broker Submissions (FABS) scheduled in September 2017 and DAIMS v2.0 in Spring 2018. Continue to use the custom solution to generate files A, B, C, and reconciliation reports, and submitfiles A - F on a quarterly basis until a decision is made on how to move forward with the Oracle patches. Continue to refine and document all DATA Act -related business processes and Standard Oper ating Procedures (SOPs). Continue to provide information to GAO and OIG in connection with DATA Act reviews.FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 39 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Government Records Lead: Division Director, OIRM/DAS NSF Management Overview In 2012, OMB and the Nati onal Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued a directive, OMB Memorandum M -12-18, Managing Government Records. This directive is consistent with a 2011 Presidential Memorandum requiring Federal agencies to reform the policies and practices for th e management of physical records and to provide a framework for the management of electronic records. GAO subsequently issued Report 15 -339, dated May 14, 2015, \"Information Management: Additional Actions Are Needed to Meet Requirements of the Managing Government Records Directive\". NSF formulated a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) in response to the GAO report and is on schedule to meet all the planned actions enumerated in the CAP . Additionally, NSF hired a dedicated professional in its Records Management Section to oversee implementation of the CAP and efforts associated with the relocation of NSF's headquarters. Challenge Ensure compliance with the National Archives and Records Administration's 2012 directive to take specific reform actions by designated dates. In particular, meet deadlines associated with relocating NSF's headquarters by: ( i) ensuring appropriate training and guidance for employees; (ii) updating NSF's record retention schedules to classify electronic records as official agency records; and (iii) adhering to established agency schedule to review, scan, and digitize its paper records. Progress Made in FY 2017 Revised the records management training course to comply with NARA Bulletin 2017- 01, Agency Records Management Training Requirements in June 2017 . The revised course will be required training for all staff on an annual basis. Classified the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) electronic records as official records per the OIG Records Schedule (DAA -0307-2016- 0003) as approved by the Archivist of the United States on January 6, 2017. Scanned over 7,000 permanent and temporary records from August 2016 to August 2017 to reduce the footprint of hardcopy files ahead of NSF's move to its new headquarters. Future Implementation Milestones Update the records management policy that is dated October 1988 to comply with current NARA guidance and 36 CFR Chapter XII, Subchapter B - Records Management, and issue by March 31, 2018. Complete an agency -wide records inventory by the end of FY 2018 to provide a foundation for developing file plans and additional records schedules as needed. Create an online training for the Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) and make it available in LearnNSF by December 31, 2017. Destroy all records at the Federal Records Center (FRC) that have met their disposition date and are no longer required by the agency by the end of FY 2018, and continue to scan records to put in ERMS. Both activities will reduce annual storage costs at FRC. Update remaining record schedules and classify electronic records as official agency records, and get approvals from the Archivist of the United States by the end of FY 2019. Performance Performance - 40 Management of the IPA Program Lead: Division Director, OIRM/HRM NSF Management Overview NSF provides the opportunity for scientists, engineers, and educators to rotate into the Foundation as temporary Program Directors, advisors, and leaders . Rotators bring fresh perspectives from across the country and across all fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation, helping influence new directions for research in science, engineering, and education, including emerging i nterdisciplinary fields . In fact, many of these rotators remain involved in their professional research while working at NSF through participation in the Independent Research/ Development (IR/D) program (managed by the NSF IR/D Council) . Because NSF suppor ts fundamental research at the frontiers of science and engineering, NSF relies on the synergy of federal employees and temporary staff for a constant infusion of new knowledge into the broad understanding of science, and a continuously improving structure of systematic and rigorous merit review. Federal and rotating staff and executives partner to ensure NSF stays abreast of and supports the very latest research ideas while ensuring stability and continuity of operations and strong stewardship and accountability of taxpayer resources. For example, federal Deputy Assistant Directors (DAD) provide continuity for rotating Assistant Directors (AD). In April 2016, NSF Director France A. C\u00f3rdova announced the establishment of a Steering Committee for Policy and Oversight of the IPA Program (IPA Steering Committee) . The Steering Committee serves as the primary body for considering IPA -related policies, oversees common approaches to budgeting and implementation of the IPA program, and champions the effective use of IPAs, identifying the benefits they bring the agency and the actions taken by the agency to mitigate risks and costs. The IPA Steering Committee is Chaired by the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) with membership consisting of the Chair of the NSF Executive Resources Board (ERB) and the Independent Research and Development (IR/D) Council; the Head of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and four at -large members, including two IPAs. In June 2017, NSF's OIG issued the audit report, \"NSF Controls to Mit igate IPA Conflicts of Interest.\" The report concluded that NSF had \"implemented internal controls to identify and mitigate IPA conflicts of interest.\" NSF formulated a corrective action plan in response to the OIG's recommendations to strengthen and add a dditional controls. Challenge The challenges that come with NSF's Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) program are as follows: i) Almost constant turnover in staff at NSF, especially in senior leadership positions; ii) Due to IR/D activities, the amount of time IPAs spend at their home institutions raises questions about their ability to fulfill their responsibilities at NSF and be fully engaged in the agency's mission; iii) It is critical that strong controls be in place to identify and mitigate IPA conf licts of interest; and iv) NSF's reliance on IPA's comes with a high cost . The number of IPAs and their cost (i.e., salaries, benefits, travel) have increased in the last 3 years. IPAs are not subject to federal pay and benefits limits. Progress Made in F Y 2017 Issued a memorandum to NSF staff, including IPAs, in March 2017 reminding them of the importance of high ethical standards (Staff Memorandum OD 17 -03); also issued a notice to supervisors, in August 2017, reminding them of their ethics responsibilit ies, specifically the responsibility to ensure the compliance of their subordinates, including IPAs, with the ethics rules (Staff Memorandum OD 17 -17). Initiated a pilot requiring 10% cost sharing by the IPA's home institution of the IPA's academic -year salary and fringe benefits (per NSF Bulletin 16- 11), which applies to all new IPA agreements initiated in FY 2017, including those for executive- and program -level staff . Additionally, NSF will no longer provide for Lost Consulting payments. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 41 Published a rev ised IR/D Guide in January 2017, via the IR/D Council, that includes guidance limiting NSF payment of IPAs' IR/D travel to their home institutions to 12 trips per year . The guidance encourages IPAs to combine other NSF official business and/or telework with these trips to get the most efficient use of those travel dollars. Designed and began data collection for an evaluation, initiated in the Office of Integrated Activities (OIA), to determine the cost implications associated with the 10% cost-sharing pilot and determine to what extent the policy change impacts NSF's ability to recruit strong IPAs. Closed the sole open OIG audit recommendation related to IPA costs. Reviewed and updated core policies relating to IPAs in the NSF Personnel Manual. Strengthen ed communication and implemented regular meetings between the Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Assistant Directors to reinforce and support leadership continuity. Implemented a process for Chief Operating Officer review and AD/DAD discussion of IPA salary cases that exceed the Senior Executive Service cap. Future Implementation Milestones Develop an Integrated Workforce Strategy as part of NSF's Agency Reform activity. This workforce framework will aid in identifying the balance of Federal and Rotator Executive Resources within the Research Directorates . An initial draft will be submitted to the IPA Steering Committee in October 2017. Deliver the cost sharing pilot evaluation to the IPA Steering Committee in November 2017. Clarify and improve enforcem ent of policies on the submission of preliminary and new proposals while serving as an IPA and designation of a substitute negotiator for proposals submitted until one year after departure. Implement an electronic separation clearance process that tracks completion of exit interviews where separating staff will acknowledge their responsibility for being familiar with post -employment restrictions. Performance Performance - 42 Moving NSF Headquarters to a New Building Lead: Senior Relocation Project Officer, OIRM/OAD NSF Management Overview NSF began to occupy its new location in Alexandria, Virginia in August 2017 and is well -positioned to vacate its Arlington, Virginia locations by December 31, 2017. The NSF Relocation Office (NRO) is leading this effort and is charged with ensuring a successful outcome to NSF's expiring lease effort through the delivery of a next -generation NSF headquarters facility. NRO's mission is accomplished through input of the entire NSF staff through Directorate liaisons, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union -Local 3403, the agency Relocation Executive Advisory Group (REAG), the General Services Administration (GSA), and other stakeholders to the project. Through demonstrated leadership and disciplined project management, NRO continues to make significant progress in key areas to ensure project success and mitigate risks relating to scheduling delays, union negotiations, and records management . NRO has developed a detailed relocation plan and has also taken concrete steps to align the project's budget with its estimated cost . Groundbreaking for the new NSF Headquarters was in January 2014, construction on the interior space began in April 2016, and the building was substantially complete to begin occupancy by NSF staff in August 2017. The new building will prominently reflect NSF's role nationally and internationally in the science and engineering community. Challenge Ensure NSF has a complete, accurate, and updated schedule to meet the move deadlines before leases on the existing buildings expire at the end of 2017. Progress Made in FY 2017 Added NSF Relocation to the Director's Watch List in March 2017 and met with the Director six (6) times. Relocated the NSF data center and network from Arlington to Alexandria successfully prio r to the relocation of staff. Installed the majority of NSF personal property designed for the new building (e.g. furniture, audio-visual equipment, information technology, and security equipment) prior to the relocation of staff. Prepared agency staff for the relocation: Conducted numerous town halls and education sessions to advise staff on features and services in the new building as well as detailed packing guidelines and procedures for the physical move. Created a dedicated relocation website on the NS F intranet that included answers to frequently asked questions, completed floor plans, transportation options to the new headquarters, neighborhood information, etc. Shared multiple informational articles and videos on the relocation website and in NSF's w eekly newsletter to keep staff apprised of all relocation -related news and updates. Reached agreement with our union partners on key issues (e.g., parking, physical relocation) during the third and final phase of negotiations. Substantially completed const ruction of the interior space . City of Alexandria has conducted its final inspections of the building. Future Implementation Milestones Complete the relocation to Alexandria successfully. Vacate and return Stafford I & II and the Rosslyn location to the landlords before December 31, 2017. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 43 Management of the U.S. Antarctic Program Lead: Division Director, GEO/PLR NSF Management Overview Through the Office of Polar Programs in the Directorate for Geosciences, NSF funds and manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP), which supports United States' research and national policy goals in the Antarctic. Given the remote location, extreme environment, and the short period of time during which the continent is accessible, significant challenges exist for ensuring the availability of necessary logistics, operations, and science support . There are also unique and internationally -linked environmental, health, and safety issues present at the remote location . In exercising its management responsibilities, NSF relies on internal staff with the requisite expertise as well as a network of contracted support and federal agency partners. Periodically, the program is reviewed by external panels of experts. Challenge 1 Ensure a successful transition from Lockheed Mar tin to Leidos as the Antarctic Support Contractor (ASC) together with their respective subcontractors by having strong cost controls to protect the government against unwarranted increases in ASC costs during a period of reorganization and mergers. Progre ss Made in FY 2017 Held routine executive meetings with Lockheed Martin leadership to understand the strategic rationale for the transition to Leidos and the impact to the Antarctic Support Contract (ASC). Started implementing the Novation Agreement proces sed by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) as the cognizant Federal Agency, which concluded that restructuring was in the best interest of the government. Monitored Leidos' operations on legacy Lockheed Martin systems. The Accounting System, Estimating System, Material Management and Accounting System, Purchasing System, and Property System were approved by DCMA in a letter dated August 25, 2016. The successful transition from Lockheed Martin to Leidos through a Reverse Morris Trust has resulted in decreased costs for ASC. Future Implementation Milestones Continue to monitor the ongoing transfer of business systems from Lockheed Martin to Leidos, which is expected to be complete by January 1, 2018. Subsequently, the Leidos DCMA Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer will review and approve Leidos business systems. Continue to monitor invoices, Annual Program Plans, business system reviews (accounting, estimating, purchasing systems), indirect rates and financial reporting for the USAP contractor to ensure strong cost controls continue with the new entity. Challenge 2 Ensure modernization of McMurdo Station and upgrades to Palmer Station as they proceed to construction projects, capitalizing on lessons learned from NSF's large facility work as appropriate. Progress Made in FY 2017 Continued progress on the 2012 Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) recommendations, including investment in lifecycle acquisitions and infrastructure upgrades. Addressed major infrastructure upgrades recommended by the BRP report for McMurdo Station through the following design efforts: Completed designs for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project, including Core Facility and Utilities packages, and presented the designs to the MREFC Preliminary Design Review (PDR) Panel. Performance Performance - 44 C ompleted designs of the Vehicle Equ ipment/Operations Center using NSF Research and Related Activities Funding. Continued design on the Information Technology & Communications (IT&C) Primary Operations Center, Lodging, and Palmer Pier Replacement Projects. Completed presentation to the National Science Board (NSB), which resulted in the NSB's recommendation that the NSF Director or her designee include the AIMS project in a future budget request. Issued a Sources Sought Notice on FBO.gov to apprise potential offerors on the AIMS project (https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=b1177342be2eaaf94c01809ece0e1854&tab=core&_cview=0 ). Continued internal coordinati on with LFO in order to leverage institutional knowledge pertaining to previous large facilities work, including best practices and considerations outlined in NSF's Large Facilities Manual (NSF 17 -066). F utur e Implementation Milestones Initiate and compl ete necessary solicitation efforts for individual AIMS components. Complete designs for IT&C Primary Operations Center. Conduct advance planning/design for Ross Island Earth Station (RIES). Prepare for AIMS Final Design Review (FDR), anticipated in Q1 of FY 2019. Continue to update the long range capital plan to include lifecycle and real property investments for all Antarctic locations. Challenge 3 Continue to provide oversight of costs incurred for medical expenses under the ASC and its subcontractors by providing guidance on what expenses are eligible for reimbursement. Progress Made in FY 2017 Improved USAP participant guidance for Physical Qualification (PQ) exams by better stating required tests and warning of non- reimbursable costs. Reviewed PQ requirements, along with the contractor, during the May 2017 medical retreat in preparation for the June 2017 medical review panel meeting. Future Implementation Milestones Continue to review and modify PQ requirements, including during the annual medical review panel meetings Receive contractor assessments of PQ non -reimbursable charges and reports of participant confusion with PQ process in order to guide continuous improvement. Challenge 4 Continue to provide investment in the oversight of both small and larger invoiced costs from ASC until NSF is better assured of the USAP contractor's internal controls. Progress Made in FY 2017 Continued to apply invoice processing in accordance with the \"Guidance and Instructions for Invoice Review and Processing\" SOP. Requested periodic, full listings of materials/items of less than $5,000 for review. Future Implementation Milestones Continue to apply invoice processing in accordance with the \"Guidance and Instructions for Invoice Review and Processing\" SOP. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 45 Perform a \"deep dive\" review of a random 10 % of invoices. NSF will continue to evaluate Leidos subcontractor billing processes. Leidos mechanisms to monitor and validate the accuracy of subcontractor billing and subsequent billing to NSF include random sampling, subcontractor rate analysis and bi-weekly and monthly billing reconciliation. Challenge 5 Continue to coordinate with the ASC to identify and control risks (e.g., loss or damage) of Antarctica -bound inventory stored and maintained at Port Hueneme, California; Punta Arenas, Chile; and Christchurch, New Zealand. Progress Made in FY 2017 Conducted two detailed route -cause analyses in response to early FY 2017 failures, followed by process improvements. NSF directed the ASC to develop reports on the damaged science equipment and mishandled science samples explaining how and why the damage occurred, and to implement corrective actions to avoid such damage in the future. NSF then approved the action plans, and monitored contractor activity for effectivene ss. Modified contract policy so that going forward senior ASC management will be directly involved in all high value -science sample shipments to ensure minimum risk . Final approval for shipment must come from the senior transportation manager. Ensured that appropriate mitigation for the risk of loss or damage would be implemented by November 2016. Future Implementation Milestones Direct NSF's annual assessment of ASC performance, which will identify cargo failures and contractor responses. Emphasis will be placed on opportunity costs of mishandled science samples and replacement costs of damaged inventory . Penalties will be considered in the contractor award fee. Continue to monitor the next surge of cargo shipments, which began in August 2017 and will cont inue through February 2018. Weekly NSF -led transportation meetings will continue to emphasize ASC responsibility to protect government property and science samples. Performance Performance - 46 Improving Grant Administration Lead: Division Director, BFA/DIAS NSF Management Overview As of June 30, 2017, the NSF award portfolio consisted of 41,877 active awards, representing $26.6 billion in obligated funds to 2,983 unique awardees. NSF accountability efforts span six award stages (proposal submission, merit review, pre -award financi al review, post -award monitoring, award closeout, and audit follow- up) to ensure financial capability and accomplishment, non- financial administrative and programmatic compliance, and research performance. The foundation of NSF's accountability efforts is its suite of policy and procedural documents that incorporate federal regulations, legislative mandates, and agency -specific requirements; the translation of policies and procedures into business rules that are enforced through NSF's information technology systems; and a risk -based approach to financial and administrative monitoring. Baseline monitoring activities, which are conducted on most awards through standard, recurring, and automated processes, focus on post -award administration and financial transa ctions to identify exceptions and potential issues that may require scrutiny through advanced monitoring. Financial baseline monitoring is used to identify potential anomalies, inaccurate expenditure reporting, or evidence of a possible misunderstanding of, or non- compliance with, federal cash management requirements and/or NSF guidelines. In FY 2017, major accomplishments in strengthening grant administration included: (1) implementation of the restructuring of NSF's Cost Analysis and Audit Resolution Br anch into two separate units focused on pre- and post -award functions to better address continuing growth in complexity and breadth of oversight functions; (2) continuation of a multi -year effort to modernize NSF's Award System, which included implementation of functionality that enables program staff to seamlessly manage $860 million in funding increments to over 4,600 awards; and, (3) successfully piloting a new tool, Targeted Review Assessments (TRAs), that allows NSF to quickly assess areas of grants management and compliance, and to provide targeted necessary business assistance to the awardee community . Challenge 1 Implement controls over spending of grant funds that ensure transparency and accountability without unduly adding to the administrative burden of awardees and federal program officers. Progress Made in FY 2017 Fully implemented inter -agency Research Terms & Conditions (RTCs), in accordance with requirements of OMB's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principle, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). RTCs create greater consistency in the administration of federal research awards and reduce awardee administrative burden. Refined and conducted FY 2017 baseline award monitoring of financial transactions across NSF's grant portfolio; explored feasibility of strengthening integration of baseline and advanced monitoring activities; and initiated baseline monitoring review of grants with little or no NSF's significant financial activity. Continued Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) implementation. Issued the final Standing Operating Guidance for Pre- Award Reviews and Posting Terminations to ensure complianc e in accordance with the Uniform Guidance. Future Implementation Milestones For FY 2018, NSF will initiate a fraud risk assessment within the grants program, continue to refine its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) risk profile, and complete an improper payments risk assessment . As part of the fraud risk assessment NSF will explore opportunities to leverage data analytics to enhance monitoring activities and grants administration. FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 47 Continue to imple ment legislative requirements: 1) standardization and publishing of reports and data on federal sp ending under the DATA Act; and 2) reporting NSF information on undispersed balances in grant awards expired more than two years under the Grant Oversight and New Efficiency (GONE) Act. Challenge 2 Take additional steps to oversee awardees that fall below the OMB Uniform Guidance Single Audit threshold of $750,000 in total federal expenditures. Progress Made in FY 2017 Continued to fully implement the Uniform Guidance that raised the single -audit threshold to avoid duplication of effort across agencies, as well as created cost/time efficiencies and reduced administrative burden for awardees and the federal government. As intended under the Uniform Guidance, NSF focused efforts on organizations exposed to higher risk, reviewing as appropriate awardee records required for review by federal agencies, pass-through entities, and GAO throughout a broad array of pre - and post -award oversight efforts, especially advanced and baseline award monitoring activities. Conducted annual NSF Risk Assessment to assess level of risk associated with awardees' portfolios to identify institutions for advanced monitoring; complemented findings with results from prior institution -based oversight activities as well as concerns identified by NSF program offices and the OIG. Continued emphasis on institutions with $2 million to $15 million in NSF funds that have historically demonstrated more difficulty in administering NSF awards than those managing larger award portfolios. Conducted risk assessments of single audits for institutions receiving NSF funds to identify institutions with highest risk for more effective utilization of resources . Future Implementation Milestones Assess and, as needed, refine risk criteria (i.e., award -specific, institutional, prior monitoring activities and results, award administration, and program feedback) used in the annual NSF Risk Assessment to identify those awardees managing the highest risk portfolios, and targe ting those institutions for advanced monitoring activities. Challenge 3 Ensure prime grant recipients provide oversight of sub- recipients' incurred cost submissions to demonstrate costs are allowable, fair and reasonable. Progress Made in FY 2017 Piloted Targeted Review Assessment (TRA) methodology to assess compliance of 29 prime awardees' oversight of subrecipients per OMB Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200.331). Provided feedback to awardees where minor issues were noted; required formal corrective actions for two awardees with more significant issues. Provided the OIG with a summary of TRA findings; shared 10 TRA results and files with the OIG t o inform its audit of NSF oversight of prime awardees with subrecipients in accordance with the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act. Future Implementation Milestones Review advanced monitoring subaward module for opportunities to upgrade assessment protocols based on TRA findings and Uniform Guidance requirements; as appropriate, incorporate feedback from OIG audit of NSF to enhance the subaward module for future oversight activities. Update DIAS fact sheet on subrecipient monitoring with links to Uniform Guidance requirements for Performance Performance - 48 pass- through entities (including risk assessment of all subrecipients) consistent with above bullets. Continue to require prime awardees to take corrective actions in cases requiring development and/or implementation of in ternal controls for subaward close -out, conduct of subrecipient risk assessments, and review of single audit reports ensuring compliance with OMB Uniform Guidance . FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 49 Encouraging the Ethical Conduct of Research Lead: Office of the Assistant Director, SBE/ OAD NSF Management Overview The responsible and ethical conduct of research is critical to ensure excellence, as well as public trust, in science and engineering . In accordance with Section 7009 of the America COMPETES Act (ACA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a71862o-1) and r ecognizing the importance of ethical conduct of research, NSF requires that each institution submitting a proposal certify, under penalty of perjury, that it has a plan to provide appropriate training and oversight in the ethical conduct of research to all undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who will be supported by NSF to conduct research . The plan must be available for review upon request and to ensure compliance, NSF includes, as a term and condition of its awards, that institutions are responsible for verifying that undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers supported by NSF to conduct research have received training in the responsible and ethical conduct of research. NSF's implementation of the Re sponsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirement recognizes the breadth of research disciplines the Foundation funds, as well as the diversity of the educational levels of the individual researchers the agency supports, to ensure that the training will be effective and appropriately tailored . Specific training needs may vary depending on specific circumstances of research or the specific needs of students intending to pursue careers in basic or applied science after completing their education. Accordingly, i t is the responsibility of each institution to determine both the content and the delivery method for the training that will meet the institution's specific needs . Furthermore, each institution must decide if development of content or pedagogical method is required, or if appropriate content and training can be provided from some existing sources or capabilities, and take appropriate action to implement their decisions. The National Academy of Sciences released a report on Fostering Integrity Research in the spring of 2017 that was supported by the Office of Inspector General of the National Science Foundation under Contract No. NSFCACS11P1173. The OIG Review of Institutions' Implementation of NSF's Responsible Conduct of Research Requirements was issued b y the Office of Inspector General of the National Science Foundation. Both of these reports were discussed at the National Science Board in August 2017. NSF then issued an Important Notice No. 140 to Presidents of Universities and Colleges and Heads of Oth er National Science Foundation Grantee Organizations addressing Training in Responsible Conduct of Research - A Reminder of the NSF Requirement in August 2017. NSF and the NSB are committed to providing appropriate guidance to grantees and to ensuring the sharing of best practices in the responsible conduct of research. NSF has been and continues to be actively engaged in enhancing the awareness of ethical conduct of research issues by NSF staff, as well as the U.S. and international scientific research an d education communities by supporting the development of tools and resources to enhance the ability of research institutions to cultivate cultures of academic and research integrity . NSF's programmatic approach is a broad proactive measure that includes all Directorates in the funding of fundamental research that informs the scientific community and public about best practices in responsible conduct of research . Most notably, the Online Ethics Center (OEC) provides resources, including an Ethics Education Library that institutions can use to deliver effective training that is tailored to meet the needs of their research projects. NSF's cross - directorate program in which all NSF Directorates actively participate, Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM (CCE ST EM), invests in innovative approaches to enhance research into ethical conduct of research issues that can build the capacity of institutions to develop appropriate ethical conduct of research plans as required by the America COMPETES Act . NSF is actively engaged in heightening the U.S. and international STEM community's awareness of these resources. Performance Performance - 50 Challenge Provide more oversight on institutional implementation of Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirements and provide meaningful guidance regarding RCR training. Progress Made in FY 2017 Issued an Important Notice No. 140 to Presidents of Universities and Colleges and Heads of Other National Science Foundation Grantee Organizations addressing Training in Responsible Conduct of Research - A Reminder of the NSF Requirement in August 2017. Continued to support research that provides answers to questions about creating responsible research communities. Funded 28 awards in three Directorates under the Robust and Reliable Science Dear Colleague Letters. Continued to share state of the art understanding of what approaches are most effective in outreach opportunities with NSF staff and the U .S. and international scientific research and education communities. Continued funding of the Online Ethics Cen ter (OEC) website. OEC provides online resources to engineers, scientists, faculty, students and the public to understand and address ethically significant issues that arise in scientific and engineering practice and from new developments in science and engineering. Hosted a CCE STEM Principal Investigators' Meeting for researchers working on ethics and the responsible conduct of research (September 2016). Funded the workshop on \" Qualitative Research Ethics in the Big -Data Era\" in Arlington, VA (December 20 16) held by Pennsylvania State University. The goal of the workshop was to contribute to improved understanding of issues arising from ethical management of big qualitative datasets in academia and in other national and international institutions that fina nce and conduct qualitative research. A special issue is being planned and developed to be published in 2018 in American Behavioral Scientist . The focus of the special issue is to advance a set of recommendations and guidelines for accountable and ethical management of qualitative data. Funded the workshop on \"Positive Research Integrity\" at the University of Notre Dame, IN (March 2017). The goal of the workshop was to assemble researchers and practitioners of positive ethics, research integrity, philosophy , moral psychology, and character education to discuss how research integrity is perceived as both a research and educational area. A workshop summary and white paper will be produced and disseminated. Funded the workshop on \"Enhancing robustness and generalizability in the social and behavioral sciences\" in Arlington, VA (March 2017) held by Northwestern University. The goal of this workshop was to develop some tools and guidelines to help researchers overcome barriers to broader sampling, and to incentiv ize doing so through better institutional support . A Sackler Colloquium entitled, \"Pressing questions in the study of psychological and behavioral diversity\", (September 2017) based upon the workshop will have its papers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Funded an ADVANCE Partnership project designed to transform teaching of research ethics of current and future geoscientists by addressing sexual harassment as scientific misconduct. Funded a proposal, \"RCN -UBE Incubator: Cons ortium for the Integration of Ethical Research Practices into Course -based Undergraduate Research Experiences in the Biological Sciences\", at the University of Texas at El Paso to explore ethics and responsible conduct of research within the biological sci ences. Funded an EAGER proposal on \"Ethical and Methodological Challenges in Social Media Research\" at Texas State University - San Marcos to explore the ethical and methodological challenges of conducting human subjects research when recruitment is solicited through social media accounts. Participated in Responsible Conduct of Research outreach (SBE leadership) at Howard University (July 2017). Continued monitoring and oversight of CCE -STEM program activities, which included responsible FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 51 conduct of research in STEM funding of one workshop at the University of California -Riverside; two institutional transformation grants, one at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the second at Indiana University; and four standard research grants covering scientific research writing; ethical research culture with community engagement; evaluation of RCR training; and different ethical orientations in STEM. Initiated NSF practice requiring the agency's Chief Operating Officer to review research misconduct cases as they are identified. Future Implementation Milestones Continue to support and share research that provides answer to questions about creating responsible research communities, robust and reliable science, and best practices for ethical STEM. Analyz e the outcomes of the three workshops funded in FY 2017, which will include: (1) structured guidance for addressing the well -documented sampling bias that will contribute to broadening the sampling protocols for experimental behavioral science research; (2 ) a white paper on in critical thinking skills, recognizing ethical issues, navigating difficult situations, and cultivating interpersonal and communication skills for supporting positive research integrity; and (3) a set of recommendations and guidelines for accountable and ethical management of qualitative data. Invite an SBE Distinguished Lecturer to NSF to speak on the responsible conduct of research. As more research becomes available on best practices and factors influencing and shaping cultures of research integrity, NSF will develop as needed guidance for institutions concerning the range of appropriate training approaches. Evaluate themes and common threads of identified misconduct cases, and compile and evaluate grantees' common responses to these cases and needs for additional RCR training. Performance Performance - 52 OTHER INFORMATION Management Reviews Each quarter, NSF senior leadership reviews progress towards all performance goals of the agency in a data- driven review meeting led by the Chief Operating Officer and Performance Improvement Officer. The quarterly progress of the Agency Priority Goals (AP Gs) and performance goals are reviewed. Alignment of Human Capital Efforts with Organizational Performance In order to drive individual and organizational performance, NSF requires that the performance plans of all employees, executives, and the general workforce contain individual goals aligned with the agency's mission and strategic goals. NSF provides training and makes tools and templates available for all supervisors and employees on linking performance plans to agency mission, as well as providing assistance and training on the policies, processes, requirements, and timeframes for the development of performance plans and appraisals. NSF also directly aligns its strategic human capital and accountability efforts to the agency goals identified in the NSF Strategic Plan. Agency performance goals currently outline specific human capital goals, and NSF uses HRStat as the agency reporting mechanism to articulate the nexus between NSF's strategic goals/objectives, including agency performance goals, and human capital initiatives at the agency. Senior leaders are briefed quarterly regarding the status of agency performance goals and the human capital initiatives aligned to those goals. Strategies and Collaborations No one standard strategy is used across NSF for achievement of goals. Goal leaders at NSF choose strategies tailored to their stakeholders' needs and their institutional capabilities. NSF goals often involve testing the impacts of new activities or new approaches to existing activities, so feedback mechanisms are built in. Use of analysis, evidence, and evaluation findings is also at the discretion of each individual goal leader, as is the decision to collaborate with other agencies or external entities or to invest in contract support for their activities. Performance at NSF is reviewed quarterly by NSF's Performance Improvement Officer, who reports on goal progress to NSF senior management. Advisory Committees and Committees of Visitors Each directorate and office has an external advisory com mittee that typically meets twice a year to review and provide advice on program management, discuss current issues, and review and provide advice on the impact of policies, programs, and activities in the disciplines and fields encompassed by the director ate or office. In addition to directorate and office advisory committees, NSF has several committees that provide advice and recommendation on specific topics: astronomy and astrophysics; environmental research and education; equal opportunities in science and engineering; direction, development, and enhancements of innovations; polar programs; advanced cyberinfrastructure; international and integrative activities; the agency's merit review processes; and business and operations. Committees of Visitors (COVs) are subcommittees of NSF directorate advisory committees. COV reviews provide NSF with external expert judgments in two areas: (1) assessments of the quality and integrity of program operations and program -level technical and managerial matters pertaining to proposal decisions; and (2) comments on how the outputs and outcomes generated by awardees have contributed to the attainment of NSF's mission and strategic outcome goals. COV reviews are conducted at regular intervals of approximately four years for programs and offices that recommend or award grants, cooperative FY 2019 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 53 agreements, and/or contracts and whose main focus is the conduct or support of NSF research and education in science and engineering. Approximately one-fourth of N SF's divisions are assessed each year. A COV typically consists of up to 20 external experts, selected to ensure independence, programmatic coverage, and geographic balance. COV members come from academia, industry, government, and the public sector. They meet for two or three days to review and assess program priorities, program management, and award accomplishments or outcomes. Each COV prepares a report and the division or program that is being reviewed must prepare a response to the COV recommendations. These reports and responses are submitted to the parent advisory committee and to the Director of NSF. All reports and responses are public and posted on NSF's website. 1 In FY 2017, two directorates convened five COVs, covering all or part of eight divisions. A table of the COVs performed in recent years and planned through FY 2019 is provided on the next page. The chapters of the directorates also contain information on these COVs, as well as information on ad hoc reports. Evaluations and Research Evaluations at NSF are currently performed at the discretion of the individual directorate, office, or program being evaluated. For discussion of how NSF uses planned, current, and recently completed evaluations in its program decisions, refer to individual directorate and office chapters. A list of the evaluations completed in FY 2017 follows. For more details about how the results of these specific evaluations are being used to shape agency decisions, see the chapter of the sponsoring directorate. Directora te chapters also contain a list of selected high -impact events (workshops, symposia, or other meetings resulting in publications) that inform their decision- making. For more information about program evaluation and collection and management of NSF programm atic data, see the Office of Integrative Activities chapter's section on NSF's Evaluation and Assessment Capability. 1 www.nsf.gov/od/oia/activities/cov/covs.jsp Performance Performance - 54 External Evaluations Completed in FY 2017 DIR Name of Evaluation Evaluator Link to report BIO Evaluation of the NSF DEB and IOS Switch to Preliminary Proposal Review: Final Report Abt Associates www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/reports/ABT_repo rt.jsp CISE Toward -21st- century -cyber -physical -systems - education CISE Information Technology and the U.S. Workforce: Where Are We and Where Do We Go from Here?

The guidance from GAO indicates that agencies should \"...describe the means the agency will use to verify its performance data...\" and \"...provide confidence that [their] performance information will be credible.\" 2 In FY 2017, NSF contracted with Nexight Group to perform the independent verification and validation. Nexight assessed the validity of NSF data and verif ied the reliability of the methods used to collect, process, maintain, and report that data. Nexight's FY 2017 report concluded: Based on the FY 2017 full year V&V review, the Nexight Team was able to verify the reliability of the processes used to generate the performance measure results for eight of NSF's nine annual performance goals. Data collection processes for the remaining goal were yet to be implemented at NSF and therefore could not be fully verified. Although some of the measures have issues that should be addressed in future years, the data collection processes for all measures adhere to the V&V criteria of Complete, Consistent, Accurate, Timely, and Valid, and are sufficient to ensure that the results are usable. The Nexight Team was also able to confirm the reported results for performance measures under the eight goals that reported results. Overall, the Nexight Team verifies that NSF relies on sound data collection practices, internal controls, and manual checks of system queries to ensure accurate performance reporting. NSF maintains adequate documentation of its processes and data to allow for an effective V&V review. Based on the V&V assessment, the Nexight Team has confidence in the systems, policies, and procedures used by NSF to calculate results for its performance measures. NSF continues to take concerted steps to improve the quality of its systems and data. The Nexight Team confirms NSF's commitment to ensuring the accuracy of its reported GPRA results, and the reliability of its processes for collecting, processing, maintaining, and reporting data for its performance goals . 3 The data and information required to measure progress towards NSF's performance goals fall into three broad categories. 1. NSF automated administrative systems. Performance monitoring can be a valuable secondary function of such systems. Reporting can include data from systems that: Store and approve publications such as solicitations announcements, and Dear Colleague Letters; Collect transactional data about proposal and award management; Perform financial transactions; Store human resources data; or Permit keyword search of abstract or full texts of proposals and awards. The data were used either directly or for achieving milestones that involve the writing of a report. While not all goals require a high level of accuracy, data from these systems are highly reliable. 2. Data requests of external parties. Qualitative or quantitative information is solicited directly from awardees. 2 GAO, The Results Act: An Evaluator's Guide to Assessing Agency Annual Performance Plans, GAO/GGD-10.1.20 (Washington, D.C.: April 1998), pp. 40-41. 3 Nexight Group and Energetics Incorporated, National Science Foundation Performance Measurement Verificati on and Vali dation Report, Fiscal Year 2017.

These amounts include the obligation of prior year appropriations and other adjustments, and are therefore different from the FY 2017 Enacted Level. The sources of the variation are: Transfer of funds across appropriation accounts. Obligations (of carryover) from prior year appropriations . Recoveries and other adjustments. Unobligated funds carried over from the previous year. Most activities in the R&RA and EHR accounts have two -year funding, so the carry over and the recoveries are associated with the FY 2016 appropriation. Funding for Polar Programs, Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program , and Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction activities have no-year funding, so additional obligations in FY 2017 could also be associated with earlier years.
