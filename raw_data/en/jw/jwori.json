From hand washing to proper sleep routines there are ways to keep your child healthy at this time of year. \"The basics are key, but upping your attention to detail can help safeguard our children from germs - for example, hygiene rituals and [conscious nutrition](https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/healthy-foods-bad-for-you-dietary-claims-reality-2578513?ico=in-line_link). With some education and proactivity, we can keep those pesky germs at bay,\" says [Dr Naheed Ali.](https://www.sleepbubble.com/) Here, doctors give tips on how your child can sail through the new term in good health. Keep children active \"Helping your child move regularly is a great way to support their immune system. Exercise benefits their circulation, which means the substances within their immune system can move more freely around the body and do their job more efficiently and effectively. Research also shows tha [t regular moderate exercise](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/i-injured-myself-from-pelvic-floor-exercises-because-women-are-told-tight-is-right-2576644?ico=in-line_link) is linked to a reduced chance of developing illnesses, better immune system regulation and reducing inflammation. Aim for their activity to be intense enough to get them feeling warmer and breathing a little faster than usual. Once your child reaches the age of five they should aim to be active for at least an hour each day.\" [Dr Robin Clark](https://www.bupa.com/news/press-releases/2021/bupa-launches-mental-health-programme), medical director, [ Bupa UK Insurance](https://www.bupa.co.uk/) Good hand hygiene \"Hygiene is undeniably our first line of defence against germs. We often tell our children to wash their hands, but emphasising the importance of a solid 20-second scrub with soap and water can make a big difference. Introducing nail brushes will unearth germs lurking beneath their nails. Teach them how to avoid touching their face, especially during flu season. And, even though sharing is caring, perhaps encourage them to think twice before swapping markers or crayons with their pals. Additionally, regularly cleaning items like kids' backpacks is a good habit to get into. For younger ones, turning cleaning into a game, such as using glow powder to highlight germs, can foster both fun and fundamental hygiene habits.\" Dr. Naheed Ali, lead writer at Sleep Bubble, [https://www.sleepbubble.com](https://www.sleepbubble.com/) Vitamin D \"Government advice is that everyone should consider [taking a daily vitamin D ](https://inews.co.uk/news/health/vitamin-d-supplements-help-prevent-dementia-women-study-2178305?ico=in-line_link)supplement during the autumn and winter, especially as children are inside most of the day at school.

[Dr Naomi Newman-Beinart,](https://www.instagram.com/drnaomib/?hl=en) chartered psychologist and nutritionist Eat a balanced diet \"Ensuring your child eats at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day helps give their body the vitamins and minerals needed to function properly. Your five portions of fruit and vegetables don't all have to be fresh - [dried, frozen, tinned and juiced fruit and vegetables count](https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/homes-and-gardens/how-harvest-fruit-vegetables-apples-beetroot-2538518?ico=in-line_link), too. Fruit juice and smoothie intake should be limited to 150ml a day, and ideally drunk with meals to limit the chance of developing tooth decay.

Avoid turning to takeaways at this busy time.\" Dr Anita Raja GP, West Midlands, [https://dranitaraja.com/](https://dranitaraja.com/) Set a sleep routine \"Children can be particularly sensitive to the amount of sleep they're getting and its quality can impact their behaviour and emotions. The relationship between sleep and our immune system is well documented, with researchers finding that poor sleep quality and duration can leave our bodies struggling to fight off illnesses and recover effectively. A consistent bedtime and sleep routine will not only allow your child ample time to rest, it is clinically proven to help children fall asleep quickly and improve their overall quality of sleep. Try to consider waking up children using natural light or music, allowing your child time to wake up slowly before getting into the morning school dash.\" Dr Hana Patel, NHS GP, [https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/hana-patel](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/hana-patel) Keep them hydrated \"The saying \"water is life\" couldn't be truer, especially concerning our little ones. Adequate fluid intake aids in flushing out toxins, lubricating membranes that capture germs and ensures cells operate efficiently. It's worth noting that dehydration can impact children's mood and concentration, so ensuring they drink up is essential. Let them pick out a quirky water bottle; it may be all that's needed to encourage increased H2O consumption.\" Dr Naheed Ali Check vaccinations \"Childhood vaccinations are designed to help protect your child against dangerous - and sometimes fatal - infections. Speak to your GP, practice nurse or health visitor if your child has missed any of their vaccinations.\" Dr Elizabeth Rogers Get outdoors \"This is a great way to help children stay healthy and stave off getting sick. Green spaces not only encourage play - a fun way to incorporate exercise into their day - but they also expose children to germs in a controlled way, which can help them develop immunity and get some well-needed germ-fighting practice before heading back to the classroom.\" [Dr Crystal Wyllie, Asda online doctor](https://onlinedoctor.asda.com/uk/dr-crystal-wyllie.html) Be patient \"Wanting to protect your child is natural, whether it's from the playground bully or the germs that make them sick. Unfortunately, there's no way to completely stop your child from being unwell from time to time, so getting a short-lived childhood infection is crucial to developing a strong immune system and building up immunity. If your child falls ill, monitor their condition and make sure they're comfortable until they feel better. Try to avoid letting your child come into contact with other children until they have been free from symptoms for at least 24 hours.\" Dr Crystal Wyllie Seek help \"If your child has developed an infection and appears to be getting more unwell - even after resting and drinking plenty of fluids - make sure to contact a health professional for advice.\" Dr Elizabeth Rogers "}
