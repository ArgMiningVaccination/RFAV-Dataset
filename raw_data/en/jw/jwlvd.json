Referred to Committee on Health & Long-Term Care. 1 AN ACT Relating to creating a career pathway for medical 2 assistants; 5 adding new sections to chapter 18.135 RCW; a new section; and 6 repealing RCW 18.135.025, 18.135.050, and 18.135.055. 7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON: 8 NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds that medical 9 assistants are health care professionals who commonly work in 10 ambulatory settings, such as physicians' offices, clinics, and group 11 practices. Medical assistants are trained to perform administrative 12 and clinical procedures as part of a health care team. Currently, 13 medical assistants are not credentialed, although there is a nationally 14 recognized certifying organization. 15 The legislature further finds that health care assistants are 16 currently credentialed in this state. Health care assistants are 17 certified to perform very specific tasks such as blood draws, 18 injections, limited medication administration, skin tests, and 19 hemodialysis. The existence of these two professions, one with a p. 1 SB 6237 1 commonly used title but no credential, the other with a credential but 2 seldom used title, causes significant confusion for health care 3 professionals. 4 The legislature intends to change the designation of health care 5 assistant to medical assistant. Rather than have multiple disparate 6 categories for medical assistant certification, the legislature intends 7 to provide minimum requirements for entry-level medical assistants and 8 require the department of health to establish a career ladder so that 9 medical assistants can, through experience and education, increase 10 their skills and the procedures in which they are permitted to assist. 11 Sec. 2. RCW 18.135.010 and 2009 c 43 s 2 are each amended to read 12 as follows: 13 It is in this state's public interest that limited authority to: 14 (1) Administer skin tests and subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, 15 and intravenous injections; (2) perform minor invasive procedures to 16 withdraw blood; (3) administer vaccines in accordance with RCW 17 18.135.120; and (4) administer certain drugs, in accordance with RCW 18 18.135.130 be granted to (( health care)) medical assistants who are not 19 so authorized under existing licensing statutes, subject to such 20 regulations as will ensure the protection of the health and safety of 21 the patient. 22 Sec. 3. RCW 18.135.020 and 2009 c 43 s 4 are each reenacted and 23 amended to read as follows: 24 The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter 25 unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 26 (1) \"Delegation\" means direct authorization granted by a licensed 27 health care practitioner to a ((health care)) medical assistant to 28 perform the functions authorized in this chapter which fall within the 29 scope of practice of the delegator and which are not within the scope 30 of practice of the delegatee. 31 (2) ((\"Health care assistant\" means an unlicensed person who 32assists a licensed health care practitioner in providing health care to 33patients pursuant to this chapter.

In assessing 15 whether there is sufficient evidence of the foundational facts, the 16 court or administrative tribunal is to assume the truth of the 17 prosecution's or department's evidence and all reasonable inferences 18 from it in a light most favorable to the prosecution or department. 19 (c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the subject 20 of the test from challenging the reliability or accuracy of the test, 21 the reliability or functioning of the instrument, or any maintenance 22 procedures. Such challenges, however, shall not preclude the 23 admissibility of the test once the prosecution or department has made 24 a prima facie showing of the requirements contained in (a) of this 25 subsection. Instead, such challenges may be considered by the trier of 26 fact in determining what weight to give to the test result. 27 (5) When a blood test is administered under the provisions of RCW 28 46.20.308, the withdrawal of blood for the purpose of determining its 29 alcoholic or drug content may be performed only by a physician, a 30 registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse, a nursing assistant as 31 defined in chapter 18.88A RCW, a physician assistant as defined in 32 chapter 18.71A RCW, a first responder as defined in chapter 18.73 RCW, 33 an emergency medical technician as defined in chapter 18.73 RCW, a 34 ((health care)) medical assistant as defined in chapter 18.135 RCW, or 35 any technician trained in withdrawing blood. This limitation shall not 36 apply to the taking of breath specimens. 37 (6) The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified 38 technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of his p. 15 SB 6237 1 or her own choosing administer one or more tests in addition to any 2 administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The test 3 will be admissible if the person establishes the general acceptability 4 of the testing technique or method. The failure or inability to obtain 5 an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of 6 evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law 7 enforcement officer. 8 (7) Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a test or 9 tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information 10 concerning the test or tests shall be made available to him or her or 11 his or her attorney. 12 NEW SECTION.
