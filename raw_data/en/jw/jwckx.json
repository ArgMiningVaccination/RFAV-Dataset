To make sure you don't miss out on the fun, heed these stay-well tips. Helpful tips to stay well to enjoy vacation fun Fight germs in flight. If you are traveling by air, \"use antibacterial products on your hands and the seat tray and armrests,\" says Dr. Anuradha Seshadri, MD, a UCLA internal medicine specialist in Century City. \"Research shows that tray tables have 20 times more germs than a plane's toilet handles.\" But you needn't worry about catching a bug from a plane's recirculated air. \"Modern airlines use high-efficiency HEPA filters, which trap 99 percent of germs,\" adds Jenny Bao, MD, a UCLA family medicine physician in Santa Monica. Watch your diet. If you are traveling to a developing country, Drs. Seshadri and Bao recommend drinking bottled water (or water that's been boiled for at least three minutes to remove bacteria), eating well-cooked foods and avoiding drinks with ice cubes. \"Depending on your destination, you might want to talk to your doctor about getting prescription medication for traveler's diarrhea before you leave,\" Dr. Bao says. Prevent motion sickness. If you're concerned about getting queasy while traveling by cruise ship, train or car, over-the-counter medications or a prescription scopolamine patch, which should be started prior to travel, can help. \"You can prevent motion sickness on a boat by standing on the deck (rather than in your cabin) and looking at a fixed point, such as the horizon or an island,\" Dr. Bao says. \"In cars or trains, sit in the front seat or a window seat and look out at the horizon or distant objects.\" Be safe from Zika. For a pregnant woman or a woman planning to become pregnant, this mosquito-borne virus increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects that can affect the brain and nervous system. \"Preventing mosquito bites is the best protection,\" Dr. Seshadri says. \"Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants treated with an insecticide called permethrin, apply a repellant to the skin that contains DEET or picaridin, and reapply repellant every four-to-six hours, or more frequently if you're swimming or sweating.\" Because men and women can pass the virus during intercourse \u2014 men for six months and women for two months after exposure \u2014 Dr. Seshadri recommends using condoms. Before traveling, check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for an updated list of affected areas, including within the United States. Prepare for emergencies. \"Always carry prescription medications with you to avoid theft, loss or damage due to extreme temperature changes,\" Dr. Bao says. \"Keep medicines in their original pharmacy containers in case you need to verify the medications, and pack extra doses for unexpected travel delays.\" And check to make sure that your prescription medications are allowed in the country to which you are traveling, Dr. Seshadri says. It's also a good idea to bring an emergency medical kit stocked with bandages; medicines for headaches, diarrhea, nausea and allergies; and creams for rashes, mosquito bites and sunburn. Anuradha Seshadri, MD Jenny Bao, MDFor a complete list of UCLA primary care locations, go to: uclahealth.org/primary-careUCLA primary care physicians are available in: Beverly Hills Brentwood Century City Encino Malibu Marina del Rey Pacific Palisades Santa Monica West Los Angeles Westwood UCLA hospitals have undertaken a new initiative to improve the healing process for patients \u2014 one that involves no medications or procedures. U Sleep formalizes an effort that has been ongoing within individual units at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica to improve the quality and quantity of sleep by reducing nighttime disturbances both in and outside of patients' rooms. \"Sleep is very important in healthy times, but in times of illness it becomes even more so,\" says pediatrician Myke Federman, MD, who is leading U Sleep at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, along with Theresa Kirkpatrick, MSN, RN, a clinical nurse specialist in the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit. Dr. Federman points to strong evidence on how sleep, or lack thereof, can affect the recovery process. She notes that poor sleep can contribute to a weakened immune system, which can reduce patients' ability to prevent or fight off an infection. Research also suggests that lack of sleep may adversely affect cardiovascular and respiratory functions. In more severe cases, disrupted sleep cycles can increase the risk of confusion and even delirium among children and adults in the intensive care unit, Dr. Federman says. It also can interfere with patients' ability to be proactive in their recovery process, such as participating in walks and working with the health care team on healing strategies. Unfortunately, hospitals traditionally have not been known as places that are conducive to solid sleep. In fact, Dr. Federman notes, the most common complaint of hospitalized patients, other than pain, is that disruptions outside their rooms and nighttime interruptions to conduct tests or monitor vital signs keep them from enjoying solid sleep. \"As hospital technology has become more sophisticated and we have introduced all of these beeping monitors and interventions, it's easy to forget that we need to address the basic needs of patients during their recovery, including sleep,\" she says. Evidence of the importance of rest to the healing process was a major impetus behind U Sleep, says Karen Grimley, PhD, RN, chief nursing executive for UCLA Health. \"This is something that individual units within the hospitals have been working on, but U Sleep pulls it all together into one organized program. Every unit now is accountable for developing and implementing processes to improve our patients' ability to rest and get meaningful sleep, especially at night,\" she says. The strategies are wide-ranging, Dr. Grimley notes. They include eliminating minor nuisances, such as squeaky wheels on carts that tend to awaken patients during the night, automatic doors slamming shut, and loud talking at the nurses' station, as well as reducing noises at the bedside from beeping monitors, ventilators and pumps, and the bright lights emanating from computer screens. Each night in UCLA's hospitals, at approximately 10 pm, an announcement reminds visitors and staff that it is bedtime and urges them to refrain from noise. Eye shields and earplugs are made available to patients, as is a station on their television that plays relaxation songs and sounds. Efforts also are being made to bundle nursing services in ways that eliminate unnecessary middle-of-the-night interruptions. \"The health care of the patient is always the highest priority. But we want to make sure that we aren't waking patients up if there is no clinical reason to do so,\" says Vera Lopez, RN, director of the intermediate care unit at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, where the program is known as Quiet Time. Patients are asked about their sleep habits when they are admitted to the hospital in an attempt to individualize their plan of care in a way that ensures their sleep needs are met, adds Lopez, who is leading the program in Santa Monica. \"We hope that by bringing this issue to the forefront of discussions, we will empower our patients to ask for things they know will help them sleep better,\" Dr. Federman says. \"This needs to be as much a part of the conversation as pain management, antibiotics and everything else related to their health and recovery.\" UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)Getting a better night's sleep in the hospital to improve healing \" As hospital technology has become more sophisticated and we have introduced all of these beeping monitors and interventions, it's easy to forget that we need to address the basic needs of patients during their recovery, including s leep.\" SLEEP To view a video about UCLA's program to improve sleep in its hospitals, go to: uclahealth.org/videos/hospitalsleep Vital Signs Spring Americans will develop shingles, a rash of itchy blisters similar but more painful than chicken pox. Usually appearing in a swath on the side of the face or torso, shingles feels, as one sufferer described it, like being pressed against a cactus. A vaccine against shingles has been available for several years, but a new vaccine promises to offer greater protection and significantly limit the suffering from shingles. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration last October, the Shingrix vaccine provides a 90 percent protection rate for older adults, compared with 50 percent for the previously available Zostavax vaccine. And unlike its predecessor, Shingrix can safely be given to those with compromised immune systems.\"The old vaccine is a live vaccine,\" says Daniel Z. Uslan, MD, an infectious diseases physician and director of the UCLA Antimicrobial Stewardship Program. \"It makes your body immune by exposing it to a live but weakened shingles virus. The new vaccine is an inactivated recombinant vaccine, meaning there is no live virus in it. It's a much safer vaccine that we can use in patients with weaker immune systems. And those are the people who need the vaccine because they're most likely to get shingles and have complications from shingles.\" Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. After a person has chicken pox, usually as a child, the virus remains dormant in the nerves. With age, stress or a weakening immune system, the virus can reactivate, producing a similar rash that can cause extreme pain. About 20 percent of people who get shingles \u2014 the majority of them elderly \u2014 will suffer from a complication called postherpetic neuralgia, where the pain continues for months or years after the skin rash clears. Shingles on the face and head can also cause damage to the eyes, ears and brain. And even in people who suffer minimal discomfort from shingles, the virus is new vaccine is an inactivated recombinant vaccine, meaning there is no live virus in it. It's a much safer vaccine that we can use in patients with weaker immune systems. And those are the people who need the vaccine because they're most likely to get shingles and have complications from shingles.\" UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) The Shingrix vaccine provides a 90 percent protection rate for older adults, compared with 50 percent for the previously available Zostavax vaccine. Vital Signs Spring 2018 Vol. 78 7 The new vaccine is recommended for adults over the age of 50, as well as people with weakened immune systems. It has proven particularly effective for adults over age 70. Those who received the older Zostavax vaccine should still get the new Shingrix vaccine, Dr. Uslan says, as should those who previously had shingles. The new vaccine is administered in two doses given at least eight weeks apart. It causes some pain and swelling at the injection site and can trigger flu-like symptoms. Zachary Rubin, MD, infectious diseases physician and medical director of the Infection Prevention Program at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, says fewer cases of naturally occurring chicken pox have resulted in weaker long-term immunity among older Americans. \"It used to be that someone would have chicken pox and then they would produce protective antibodies for some time. Later, when exposed to chicken pox in others, such as their children, their immune system would be jogged and they would produce additional protective antibodies. With the advent of the chicken pox vaccine, there's less naturally occurring chicken pox and, as a result, older peoples' immunities are waning over time. That's why we've seen the number of shingles cases increase, and another reason adults over 50 should strongly consider getting the new vaccine.\"Continued from cover Home DNA testing offers insight, but potential health findings should be treated with cautionGENETICS Dr. Grody points out that much of the genetic information sought from such tests has no value to medical decision making. \"You might learn that you have a 3 percent lifetime risk of Parkinson's disease,\" he says. \"What are you supposed to do with that information? There is no way to prevent Parkinson's. That percentage isn't much higher than the risk for the general population. And we're not entirely sure about the reliability of the genetic markers in predicting this disease.\" While geneticists have learned a great deal about the human genome in recent years, there is far more that is still not understood, Dr. Grody notes. Yet, too many home testing kits offer results stemming from variants in genes that are at the research stage. For example, results might suggest a moderately increased risk of heart disease and stroke based on genetic information that scientists view as far from predictive. \"They'll recommend that you eat more vegetables, which could apply to almost every adult in the United States,\" Dr. Grody says. \"You don't need a DNA test to tell you that.\" In the case of genetic-testing results that are more definitive, such as those pointing to the risk of familial cancers or inherited neurological disorders, Dr. Grody is concerned that consumers will be ill equipped to handle troubling information without guidance of physicians or specially trained genetic counselors. \"When you tell a woman she has an 85 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer, and she is sitting in her home with no options or knowledge about what she can do with that information, it is potentially very harmful,\" he says. Dr. Grody says that any genetic test that may suggest future implications on an individual's disease risk should be preceded by counseling to explain its limitations and to determine whether the test is appropriate, as well as post-test counseling to put the results in perspective and refer the person to a specialist, if needed.UCLA's genomics center has strict criteria before it begins offering a genetic test \u2014 ensuring both that the results will be scientifically reliable and that there is something that can be done for patients who receive concerning results. In addition to conducting single-gene tests, UCLA is among the only centers to offer a comprehensive analysis and diagnostic interpretation of an individual's entire protein-encoding genome, involving more than 20,000 genes, to potentially locate a single DNA change responsible for rare disorders that in many cases have eluded diagnosis for years. In some cases, Dr. Grody says, home DNA tests have provided important information that individuals have brought to the attention of their physician. But he is concerned that the potential harms of such tests outweigh the benefits. \"Our genetics clinic gets an increasing number of calls from people who either don't understand the results or are upset and seeking someone to explain the findings to them,\" Dr. Grody says. \"Just as we don't want someone walking into a pharmacy and purchasing certain medications without a prescription, it makes sense that most of these DNA tests should be ordered by doctors.\"UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)Approximately 5 million Americans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. While there still is no treatment to prevent or reverse the cognitive impairment associated with the disease, research suggests that certain cognitive and memory -boosting strategies can slow the rate of decline. The UCLA Longevity Center has launched Memory Care, a cognitive - training and mind/body fee-for-service program for individuals in the early stages of dementia and their caregivers. Two weekly three -hour programs are offered \u2014 one for people with early -onset dementia (typically ages 45 to 64) and one for those with late -onset dementia (age 65 and older). Karen Miller, PhD, a clinical neuropsychologist who developed Memory Care with UCLA Longevity Center director Gary Small, MD, discussed the program's purpose and goals. Memory \u0007c are aims \u0007to\u0007slow\u0007the\u0007decline \u0007of\u0007dementiaDEMENTIA Why did you create these Memory Care programs? Dr. Small and I have spent the past 20 years researching the impact of memory training on memory and cognition for individuals as they age, including individuals with normal memory, people with mild memory problems and those with dementia. We diagnose many patients with dementia. For many years we have offered programs for people with normal memory or mild memory problems, but we didn't have anything we could offer for our dementia patients. In 2012, we created a program for patients with late-onset dementia, and two years ago we started a similar program for early-onset patients. From the research at UCLA and elsewhere, what is known about the impact of memory-boosting strategies? It's really divided into three areas. Someone with a normal aging brain who participates in memory training can improve in specific Karen Miller, PhD Vital Signs Spring 2018 Vol. 78 9areas such as memory recall, processing speed, language skills and abstract reasoning. These individuals have significant cognitive reserve, and the training can build on that strength. If you have mild cognitive impairment and participate in at least six weeks \u2014 but preferably for six months \u2014 of cognitive training, you can improve your memory and language skills to a mild or moderate degree within that time period. Even individuals in their 80s can benefit from this type of memory training. And for individuals with dementia, research shows that participating in cognitive training can result in a lower rate of decline over the next six-to-12 months. That is one of the most important goals for the individuals in our UCLA Memory Care programs \u2014 to stabilize them so that they don't experience further decline during that initial period, and to combat rapid decline for those with early-onset dementia. Additionally, we aim to provide emotional support for the family and caregivers as they deal with the challenges of providing daily care for their loved ones. What are some of the memory-training techniques used in Memory Care? The first hour of each session is led by a memory trainer from our psychology team, and the focus is on cognitive training. We use techniques we have studied over the years, such as visualization and association, which are designed to help us learn new information in a richer way so that we will have more success in recalling the target information at a later time. We also teach a technique called the Story Method, where the individual learns to create an elaborate or silly story for specific data (such as a grocery list, or the title and author of a book), which in turn helps to jog the memory for the details at a later time. Another strategy is face-name association, in which we create a connection between a person's face and name to make it easier to remember later. We also focus on techniques to improve attention, combat word finding difficulties and exercise our visual spatial skills. Beyond the cognitive training, what do the groups involve?The second hour focuses on the mind-body connection to help lower stress levels, enhance creativity, stimulate the brain and encourage strategies for living better and longer. We have a professional fitness instructor who leads the group through a series of age- appropriate yoga. We also do a series of mindfulness exercises, because we know mindfulness improves attention and improved attention leads to better memory. Finally, at least once a month, we also include art and music to enhance brain functioning. For the third hour, we have two groups \u2014 one for those with memory issues, and one for the family members and caregivers. The patient- oriented group meets with a group facilitator who focuses on socialization \u2014 a chance for the individuals with dementia to get to know one another. We talk about things like pets, travel, favorite foods and, as it comes up, what it's like to have challenges in the area of memory. Meanwhile, the family members (spouses, adult children, siblings) meet as a group with a member of the psychology team for caregiver support. In this group, the loved ones can speak of their challenges, including any anxiety or depression they're experiencing, ideas of how to provide more structure and support for both the patient and the family, and important resources. There is research showing that the caregiver of a person with dementia is also at higher risk for depression and cognitive decline, so one of our goals in Memory Care is to provide support in hopes of facilitating better coping for the family members. So these groups are as much for the caregivers as they are for the people with dementia? Yes, Memory Care is a shared experience between the family member and the person with dementia. It's a place they can both attend where they can be on the same page, and where they can receive both cognitive and social stimulation. They can talk about their stressors and their concerns, share resources, make new friends and discuss the very difficult topic of how to plan for the future.

But while cancer therapies have increased long-term survival rates for this population, they may also cause a loss of fertility by damaging the reproductive system. Today, new reproductive technologies provide options for preserving fertility. A recent development for women involves freezing eggs. This option can enable women who are not yet sexually active or do not have partners to preserve their ability to start a family later in life. \"Egg freezing is best for women who are past puberty,\" says Daniel Dumesic, MD, professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. \"It involves giving medication to stimulate ovary production and then retrieving the eggs. Rather than fertilizing them at that time, we can freeze them alone to save for future use.\" Dr. Dumesic notes that medical technology has been able to freeze embryos \u2014 eggs that have been fertilized by a sperm \u2014 for several years. But until relatively recently, it was not possible to effectively freeze individual eggs. \"Embryos have enough cells to compensate if some cells are damaged in the freezing process, but that's not the case for eggs, which have only one cell,\" he says. \"A breakthrough in the freezing technology now allows us to freeze the eggs without damaging them.\" Egg freezing \u2014 as well as sperm banking and most other fertility preservation options \u2014 is best done prior to undergoing cancer treatment. However, if that is not possible, other strategies can be explored. Having the option to address future fertility can impact psychological well-being, notes pediatric oncologist Jacqueline Casillas, MD, medical director of the UCLA Daltrey/Townshend Teen and Young Adult Cancer Program, which serves oncology patients between the ages of 13 and 25. \"We know that cancer survivors place high importance on fertility and may feel a tremendous sense of loss if they did not have the opportunity to address this issue when they were treated,\" she says. \"Understanding how significant this issue will be to patients down the road, we've made it a priority to train our physicians, nurses and social workers to discuss fertility preservation with our patients.\" While UCLA specialists work closely to expedite treatment, they understand that it may be difficult for patients and families still reeling from a cancer diagnosis to process information about reproductive technologies. \"People can kind of shut off when they're bombarded with information. Working together, we try to give patients and families the time they need to make decisions,\" says Dr. Dumesic. \"The oncology physicians determine whether they can safely delay treatment while our team has worked to safely speed up the egg harvesting process. It used to take three or four weeks, but we can now do it in about 10 days.\" Freezing eggs and other fertility preservation procedures can be costly and may not be covered by insurance. However, UCLA can help patients identify resources such as Fertile Action, a nonprofit organization that helps individuals find ways to pay for such treatment. UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)\" A breakthrough in the freezing technology now allows us to freeze the eggs without damaging 2018 Vol. 78 11Patients with heart disease may benefit from procedures such as cardiac bypass surgery to open blocked arteries and improve blood flow through the heart. However, some patients are considered too \"high risk\" for such measures, and there are few alternatives to alleviate their symptoms. But cardiac revascularization now offers hope for many of these patients. At UCLA, the Complete Revascularization in High Risk Indicated Patients (CHIP) program specializes in caring for the growing number of patients who have complex coronary artery disease and heart failure along with other factors that put them at high risk for surgery. The other factors may include advanced age, diabetes, previous cardiac surgeries and peripheral vascular disease, putting them at increased risk for having a heart attack, stroke or dying during a surgical procedure. \"This is a one-stop, multidisciplinary program for patients who would not be candidates for bypass surgery due to the complexity of their disease and their other ailments,\" says cardiologist Ali Nsair, MD, director of the CHIP program. \"Traditionally, these patients may not receive any treatment. With our aging population, the number of complex heart failure patients is only going to increase.\" While many centers may turn down such patients, UCLA's CHIP program offers a team approach that includes experts in cardiothoracic surgery, interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, heart failure and mechanical circulatory support to evaluate and treat selected high-risk patients. Treatment of these high-risk patients is now possible due to several medical advances and treatments, Dr. Nsair says. These well-established procedures include medical therapies, surgery and percutaneous coronary revascularization, a minimally invasive procedure to open arteries by threading a catheter through the leg and into the heart to open blockage with a balloon-like device or by deploying a stent in the artery. In patients with the most severe conditions, heart transplantation is recommended or patients may be put on left-ventricular assist devices. These pumps are implanted in the chests of patients to help their hearts function. Patients also are treated for other cardiac conditions, such as arrhythmias and valvular diseases. During the evaluation, a team of experts will explore the safest and most effective options with the patient and his or her family, Dr. Nsair says. \"Our objective is to make sure we offer these patients the best therapy we can,\" he says. \"These patients often experience intractable chest pain and are incapacitated by their symptoms. Our objective is to offer the best treatment to improve the quality of life of these patients, so they can live longer and healthier lives.\" CARDIOLOGY At UCLA, the Complete Revascularization in High Risk Indicated Patients (CHIP) program specializes in caring for the growing number of patients who have complex coronary artery disease and heart failure along with other factors that put them at high risk for surgery.
