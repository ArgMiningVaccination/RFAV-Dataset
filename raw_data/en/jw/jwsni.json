GEORGE & CO., In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. [Page III](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/9) INTRODUCTION. N place of the usual formal Introduction, which in this case would be a resume of the principles of Homceopathy, of its early struggles in this country, and of its present proud position, it has been deemed that the most fitting prelude to the record of the life-work of the most prominent homceopathic physicians and surgeons in the United States would be a rapid glance at the chief incidents in the career of their immortal teacherHahnemann. Such a prelude is in strict accordance with the character of the work itself, while it enables the formation of the most adequate conception as to the origin, peculiar character and advantages of homceopathy, with the difficulties attending its early practice and dissemination; just as the succeeding biographies best indicate the obstacles that beset the introduction and establishment of the new system in this country, and trace the rapid progress it has made in public estimation. Accordingly, the following brief but carefully compiled and comprehensive sketch of the career of the great founder of homeopathy is here presented: AHNEMANN, SAMUEL, was born on the Ioth of April, 1755, at Meissen, in Cur-Saxony, one of the most beautiful regions of Germany. Among the papers left behind him is one, dated August, I791, which affords us some interesting particulars respecting his family and early youth. He says in substance: \"My father, Christian Gottfried Hahnemann, who died four years ago, was a painter in the porcelain manufacture, and had written a little work on that art. He had the soundest ideas on what was to be reckoned good and worthy in man, and had arrived at them by his own independent thought. He sought to implant them in me, and impressed on me, more by action than by words, the great lesson of life,' to act and to be, not merely to seem.' When a good work was going forward, there, often unobserved, he ii [Page IV](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/10) iv INTRODUCTION. was sure to be helping hand and heart. Shall I not do likewise?\" His mother's name was Johanna Christian, nee Spiess. His parents taught him to read, and perhaps some other rudimentary education, while he was at play. He passed several years at the Stadtschule, and, at the age of sixteen, began to attend the Fiirstenschule of Meissen. He states that he was beloved by his rector, Magister Muller, as if he had been his own son; that he was permitted by him-on account of the delicacy of his health, induced by over study-to omit some of the regular tasks of the school, and to spend the hours they would have occupied in general reading. He had access to him at all hours of the day, and, strange as it may appear, though thus eminently favored, he was nevertheless a general favorite with the other scholars. His father, he tells us, was opposed to his studies; he wished him to pursue a calling more in accordance with his own income, and frequently withdrew him from school. He was, however, permitted to remain for eight years at the request of his teachers, who allowed him to attend without requiring the usual fees paid by scholars. Anecdotes of the youth of most great men are on record, which would have but little interest did we not know that \"the boy is father of the man,\" and that the bias of mind displayed in youth is usually carried out in after years. Washington had his cherry-tree; Napoleon had his snow-ball matches, and, as the following clearly shows the inherent thirst for knowledge which prevailed in the mind of Hahnemann, we record it. His parents were very poor, and his father, objecting to the extravagant quantity of oil consumed by his son's nocturnal studies, deprived him of the family lamp, except at stated hours. The youth, however, by exercising his ingenuity, contrived to make a lamp out of clay; and then persuaded his indulgent mother to supply him with oil out of her stores. This determination to overcome difficulties remained as a characteristic trait during his subsequent career. The time had now arrived for him to enter upon a university course, and, having obtained the permission of his father, he set out for Leipzig, at Easter, in 1775, with twenty crowns in his pocket; the last money he ever received from his parent. This little capital would have lasted for a considerable time; but, like another Gil Bias, he was unfortunately robbed of the greater portion of it. Thus deprived of the means of existence, he was compelled to support himself at the university by giving lessons and making translations into the German. During the two years of his residence at Leipzig, besides attending lectures the greater part of the day, and giving instruction in the evenings, he translated the following works: \" Steadman's Physiological Essays,\" \" Nugent's Essay on Hydrophobia,\" \"Falconer on the Waters of Bath,\" in two volumes, and \"Ball's Modern Practice of Physic,\" in two volumes. The only time he could devote to these labors was the night, and he was in the habit of sitting up altogether every alternate night. Such indefatigable industry is astonishing and almost unparalleled. Notwithstanding the difficulties in his path, he contrived by his abstemious habits and incredible exertions to save sufficient money to carry him to Vienna, where he studied under Dr. Quarin and practised in the hospitals for two years, when his necessities compelled him to accept the offer of Baron Von Bruckenthal, Governor of Transylvania, to accompany him to Hermanstadt, as his private' physician, librarian, and superintendant of a museum of coins. From Hermanstadt he went to Erlangen, where he took his degree of Doctor of Medicine, on the ioth of August, I779. The real history of his life may now be said to commence, as, after leaving Erlangen, he first began the practice of medicine at Hetstadt, a little town among the mountains; but, that place proving much too circumscribed a sphere of action, he removed to Dessau, where he remained but a short time, being tempted by the offer of a governmental appointment of [Page V](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/11) INTRODUCTION. v District Physician, at Gommern. The position was almost a nominal one, and of little importance in his life; save that in this place he fell in love with Henrietta Biicklerin, whom he married. In I784, he went to Dresden, where he resided for four years, maintaining himself chiefly by his pen. Here he wrote eighteen treatises, the most remarkable one being on a new salt of mercury, which he called me;rcuriuts solubiiis; a name it still retains. We next find him in Leipzig, in I789, ten years after taking his degree. Here he applied himself with his accustomed energy and industry to the study of medicine, chemistry, mineralogy, and other kindred sciences-besides continuing to make translations from foreign languages-making many important discoveries, which gained for him a high and widely spread reputation among the savans of Europe, and also a membership. of the Leipzig Society of Economical Science, and somne others. In spite of all this, he seems at this time to have been inspired by some innate conception of the future. He was dissatisfied with the existing state of medical science, which he considered as imperfect and more the result of guess-work than of positive knowledge. At length, the truth dawned upon him, and an inkling of the theory, which he subsequently elaborated with so much care, toil, and personal suffering, was revealed to him. His attention was drawn to the fact that cinchona, or Peruvian bark-a well known remedy in cases of intermittent fever-when taken by persons in sound health, produced a disorder very similar to that disease; but, as the district where this occurred was malarious, he was not certain that these effects might not have been produced by natural causes. In order to be assured on this point, he took a quantity of the drug, and was inexpressibly gratified to find himself severely attacked by the disorder. He was now in possession of a tangible fact; a remedy that would cure a certain disease, would also produce it in a healthy person, and it was certain that the converse was equally true, i. e. that a drug, which produced a certain disease in a healthy body, would cure it in a sick one. But this was only one instance and might be an exception. He therefore set himself to the task of testing a great number of drugs, and with heroic self-sacrifice took them himself, carefully noting the minutest effects produced, and comparing them with the symptoms of well-known diseases. By this means a species of code was established. He likewise induced some of his friends to join him in these tests orpl ovings, and by mutually comparing notes certain positive facts were established. This was the origin of the famous axiom that sirnilia similibus curantur, which, with his theory of infinitesimal doses, was destined to subvert the existing order of things, and so embittered the medical world, as to draw upon its author ridicule, abuse, and even persecution. In this he merely suffered the fate of most discoverers and inventors. Galileo was forced by the inquisition to recant the heresy of his theory, that the earth revolved around the sun; but on. leaving its halls, he muttered, \"nevertheless it moves;\" Columbus was ridiculed for believing in the existence of a new world, and the man who first proposed to cross the Atlantic by means of steam was laughed at. There is scarcely less folly in denying the motion of the earth, the existence of a new world, or the passage of the Atlantic by steam, than in refusing to give credence to the manifest truths of the Hahnemannian theory. To this new system of cure Hahnemann gave the name of Homceopathia, derived from two Greek words, ihomoios, similar, and pathos, feeling, or suffering. Seven years afterwards he published his first trial of the application of the new system in ]ihfeland's Journal. The case was one of colicodynia in its severest form, and after trying in vain all the usual remedies, he cured his patient by administering veratrum album, a drug which produces similar symptoms. The next case noticed, also a very remarkable one, was inl 1799. The patient was attacked by scarlet fever, and Hahnemann, having observed that children who ate the berries of the belladonna, suffered from eruptions similar to those incident [Page VI](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/12) vi INTRODUCTION. to the disease itself, administered the extract as a remedy with perfect success, and, furthermore, he found that by giving it in proper doses to persons in infected districts, it prevented them from being seized with the disorder. Notwithstanding much opposition, many German physicians tried this preventive; the result being that out of 3747 persons exposed to the infection only 91 took the disease. If belladonna be fairly tried, it may perhaps prove as successful against scarlet fever, as vaccination has shown itself against small-pox. It was Hahnemann who first recommended aconite in cases of pure inflamnatory fevers, with or without eruption; \" and,\" says a recent writer, \" even were we under no other obligation to him, he would, like Jenner, deserve to be ranked among the greatest benefactors of suffering humanity.\" He spent his whole life, after the age of forty-five, in the utmost self-abnegation, giving up everything, denying himself everything, suffering everything, in the cause of humanity. Mathiolus, of old, poisoned criminals, given up to him by the state; the modern Magendie poisoned dogs and cut up horses by vivisection; and some physicians poison their patients by experiments in the interest of science; but Hahnemann poisoned himself to perfect the system he was promulgating. He has left us a record of no less than one hundred and six medicinal substances with which he had experimented on his ownperson. And yet, this man has been called \" an izlmmzoral scoundrel.\" He has, however, left ten volumes of the \" Materia Medica Pura\" to disprove so odious a falsehood. In a letter to Dr. Stapf, not intended for publication, he says: \"' The man who undertakes and carries through with steadfast resolution to benefit humanity-for, in my case, there could be no other motive, since beyond the miserable sum given me by the booksellers, which was no compensation for a life of such self-sacrifice, I met only with persecution-a man that so lives and works must be.good at bottom.\" Jean Paul Richter says: \" His detractors are more given to detest the man than to read his works.\" Such accusations are mere blinds to cover the real causes of animosity against him, which were that, while at Leipzig, he had performed some remarkable cures on persons of eminence, and his promulgation of the theory of minimum doses, which-impressed with his great responsibility-he would only administer when prepared by himself; the former exciting the jealousy of the medical profession, and the latter touching the pockets of the apothecaries. Amongst them they discovered an obsolete law, forbidding physicians to dispense medicines; thus obliging Hahnemann, whose conscience would not allow him to intrust the preparation of his remedies to other hands, to relinquish a profitable practice in Leipzig, and repair to Coethen. The Duke of Anhalt-Codthen became his friend, giving him full permission to practise as he pleased. It is not possible in this place to enter into details respecting his great work, which he called the \" Organon of Rational Medicine,\" and with which the profession is already so familiar; suffice it to say that he incurred much blame for his supposed presumption in endeavoring to assume to himself the position of the Bacon of Medicine. But on reflection this idea will be seen to be erroneous. Bacon introduced a new organ, or instrument, called the \" Novum Organum,\" for the advancement of science, and Hahnemann justly conceived that he had found a new organ for the discovery of specifics, and the results have fully supported his belief. The \"Organon,\" with its four propositions, has ever been, and, doubtless, will continue to be the text-book of the homceopathic profession. We must also summarily dismiss the \" Materia Medica Pura,\" the value of which is so perfectly appreciated by every homoeopathist that, without its aid, all would be at a loss in finding the remedies needed. With its ten volumes it is almost a life study in itself. The \"Fragmenta \" is a work of less importance, though replete, as is every thing from Hahnemann's pen, with useful information. [Page VII](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/13) INTRODUCTION. vii In I805, he published a little work on \" The Positive Effects of Medicine,\" i. e. the effects produced by drugs on a healthy body. This was written in Torgau; but to make the experiments more perfect, he was compelled to return to Leipzig. In I831, the cholera raged with fearful violence in Eastern Europe. Hahnemann suggested the use of camphor as a remedy, which led the way to the trial of the homceopathic system in some of the hospitals of Russia with the most gratifying results. Again, in I836, when a similar epidemic prevailed in Vienna, Dr. Fleischmann adopted that mode of treatment in the hospital of the Sisters of Charity with even greater success. Mr. Wilde remarks, in connection with this fact, that \" on comparing the report made of the treatment of cholera in that hospital, with that of the same epidemic in other hospitals in Vienna, at the same time, it appeared that while two-thirds of those treated by Dr. Fleischmann recovered, two-thirds of those treated by the ordinary methods died.\" Hahnemann resided fifteen years at Coethen, under the protection of the Duke, pursuing one of the most brilliant careers on record. He was constantly perfecting his system by experiments upon himself and his friends, many of them accompanied with extreme suffering. Not only did he enjoy the highest reputation at home, but the fame of his marvellous cures had spread itself throughout the whole of Europe, so that thousands of strangers of the highest rank flocked from abroad to profit by the advice of the illustrious founder of the new school of medicine. Here one of the most romantic marriages we have heard of took place. Mad'lle Marie Melonie D'Hervilly-Gohier, a member of one of the most distinguished families in France, was amongst the number of his patients. She was suffering from an apparently incurable pulmonary complaint and disease of the heart; had consulted almost every physician of eminence in Europe, had tried the climate of Italy, and employed all the ordinary methods of cure without avail, being pronounced by her physicians to be beyond medical aid. Hahnemann effectively mastered the disease in an incredibly short space of time, and, upon her recovery, they were married, when he was in his eightieth year, his wife being some forty-five years his junior. She was charmed with his genius, his manners, and his noble character, and positively adored him till the day of his death. He, on his side, cherished and almost reverenced her; was never tired of speaking of her devotion and her brilliant talents, and regarded her as his ministering angel, as well he might. Shortly after their marriage, he was persuaded by his wife to remove to Paris; not to increase his already oppressive popularity; but, on the contrary, to enjoy that ease and repose his declining years required. They travelled incognito, even his immediate fiiends and pupils being left in ignorance of their destination. His retreat, however, did not long remain undiscovered, and, thenceforward, his doors were daily besieged by throngs of sufferers, anxious to benefit by the skill of the great innovator. Indeed, such was the pressure upon him that, without the aid of his wife, he could not have borne it. We are indebted to the pen of an American lady, Helen Berkley, for a delightful and graphic picture of their joint lives in Paris. She saw them fiequently both in private and during their hours of business. Madame Hahnemann was a woman in every way worthy of her husband, and possessed of most extraordinary talents. Wealthy in her own right, she refused to participate in her husband's fortune; a poetess of no mean order, and an artist, whose paintings had been admitted into the galleries of the Louvre. She spoke and wrote fluently five or six languages, and had studied the homceopathic system under her husband to such advantage, that she took almost the entire burden of consultation from his shoulders. She was always present at his receptions, putting questions, receiving replies, and noting minutely the symptoms of every case, merely appealing to Hahnemann in cases of difficulty, when he would reply, \"yes, my child,\" or, \" good, my child,\" and the consultation proceeded; she was tenderly beloved by her step children, and in short a family so united is rarely to be met with. 1 [Page VIII](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/14) viii INTRODUCTION. At this period he was eighty-four years of age, of a slender and diminutive form. His head was large and beautifully proportioned; his forehead broad and massive, set off by a few silvery locks; his eyes deep set, dark, piercing and animated, and his whole appearance indicative of the highest order of genius. He constantly smoked a long pipe with a painted bowl, even during his hours of reception. He read and wrote without the use of spectacles; his hand-writing was firm and delicate-almost equal to copperplate-and his activity and animation still exhibited some of the traces of youth. Hahnemann continued to reside in Paris till his death, which happened July 2nd, I844. In his last illness, he was waited on by his devoted wife with that loving care which tended so much to alleviate his sufferings. Shortly before his death, his wife, by way of imparting some comfort to the invalid, whispered: \" Surely some mitigation of suffering is due to you who have alleviated the sufferings of so many.\" To this he replied with his latest breath: \" Every man on earth works as God gives him strength, and meets from man with a corresponding reward; but no man has a claim at the Judgment Seat of God. God owes me nothing. I owe him much-yea all.\" With these beautiful sentiments on his lips he departed, and the world was deprived of one of the noblest, purest, and grandest characters that have ever ministered to the good of humanity. [Page IX](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/15) PREFACE. HIS is the first biographical history of Homoeopathy published in this country, and like the pioneers of the new, progressive, and now firmly established school of medicine themselves, it has had to encounter extraordinary prejudice and opposition. Some of this has emanated from members of the profession itself, not a few of them men who it might have been expected from their peculiarly advantageous and responsible position as editors would have unhesitatingly accorded to the undertaking their cordial support and hearty co-operation. More especially has this been the case in Boston and in the Eastern States, where the most expensive means have been employed to obtain desired material. Except that thereby the work was rendered more complete and therefore more saleable in other sections of the country, this expenditure of labor and capital was apparently unwarranted, since not a single homceopathic university or school of medicine has as yet been established in New England. It is to be hoped that the efforts of prominent laymen of Boston, assisted by Dr. I. T. Talbot (editor), may be instrumental'in gradually bringing the East into generous rivalry in this respect with her more progressive sister. of the West. A work of this character necessarily can command, at first, at any rate, a very limited circulation. Nevertheless no consideration arising out of this circumstance has been allowed to interfere with the determination to render the Cyclopmedia as far as possible above criticism. The fullest opportunities have been offered to the profession to make it thoroughly complete and satisfactory, not only to practitioners of, but persons interested in homceopathy, and even the least initiated must know that the successful prosecution of such a work depends upon the active assistance of the members of the school. Every liv3 [Page 4](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/16) 4 PREFACE. ing homceopathic physician in the United States has been requested by letter or by personal application to furnish a resume of his career, and of those of his friends or relatives who may have been members of the profession. In this manner all who could forward the enterprize have been invited to assist in the compilation of the history of the efforts put forth for, and that have resulted in the establishment of homceopathy upon its present broad and enduring basis. This volume is the result of these labors. If any sketch material in the biographical history of homoeopathy is found wanting, its absence is to be attributed either to the negligence or narrow-minded prejudice of those who alone were able to furnish the same, or to the impossibility of meeting with records of the life work of those who had passed away -in other words, to the paucity of homceopathic literature, which the former class are apparently desirous of perpetuating. If there are sketches to which exception may be taken by the hypercritical or the superficially prominent-that is to say, men whom business shrewdness or sharpness rather than professional attainments has forced into positions of prominence outside of the legitimate practice of medicine, either as editors or vendors of homceopathic medicines-it must be remembered to the credit of the subjects thereof that, according to their abilities, they have labored to advance the cause of homceopathy, and have supplied one link to the historical chain. That the future historian may profit by the experience of the Editor of this work, and be informed not only as to the sources from which he may expect help, but those from which he must be prepared to encounter opposition both passive and active, occasion is here taken to tender thanks where due, and to point out the quarters in which no sympathy, encouragement, or assistance can be looked for. Thanks are due to: First, the great majority of regularly'practising physicians; their relatives and friends, who have interested themselves to secure the fulness and accuracy of each biographical sketch, and who have shown commendable pride and liberality in furnishing the expensive portraits on steel that accompany many of the biographies. Secondly, those standard homceopathic journals whose editors, being either successful practitioners or authors of standard homceopathic works, or both, recognized the importance of any literary undertaking having for its object the permanent advancement of the cause, and in their solicitude and anxiety to promote its success and value, [Page 5](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/17) PREFACE. 5 imposed upon themselves labors involving considerable sacrifice of time and money. Among these are especially to be mentioned: The United Slates Medical and Surgical Yournal, Chicago, Drs. R. Ludlam, E. M. Hale, and A. E. Small (professors, authors, and editors); Tihe NVorilf American -7ournal of Homxoopailty, New York, Drs. E. E. Marcy and S. Lilienthal authors, and editors); Tlhe 57ournal of Homxopathic Materia Medica, Philadelphia, Drs. A. R. Thomas and H. N. Martin (professors, authors, and editors); and The AMiczhigan ~ounrnal of Homoeopathy, Detroit, Dr. E. R. Ellis (professor, author, and editor). Thirdly, Mrrs. Emma L. Hudson, of Fitchburg, Mass., a lady of high literary attainments and social position, who, herself a devoted homceopathist, has ably striven to awaken in the physicians of Boston and its vicinity that enthusiasm which has been evinced by their Western contemporaries, as evidenced in the pages of this work. The future historian can expect no sympathy, or aid from: First, those homceopathic journals whose editors, with illiberal, narrow-minded views and principles, jealously, prematurely, and unwarrantably assail the private business operations of a house even before they have anything tangible to criticize, or honorable ground for interference. There were two such encountered by this enterprize. In one, such simply palpable and malicious misstatements were made \u2014 before the work or even its prospectus was issued-that but for the fact that the intended effect was vitiated by their patent imbecility and absurdity, legal steps might have been considered advisable. In the case of the other, there was employed the old and worn-out dodge so well known among newspaper men of the sensational and \"cut-throat\" type, but long discarded even by the least shrewd of these-i. e. the publication of a letter which, in order to carry a weight that the editorial pen, as such, could not convey, purported to emanate from a bonad fide member of the profession, while really concocted by the editor himself. In extenuation of this conduct it may be stated, to the credit of these two editors, and especially of the latter, that they hold with singular tenacity the opinion that homceopathic historical works can only be published by homceopathic physicians, even though those physicians be by force of circumstances writers rather than prescribers, and that they are generally believed to look upon, and write with the kindliest favor of all homceopahic literary enterprizes in which they are personally or pecuniarily interested. [Page 6](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AGU2366.0001.001/18) 6 PREFACE. Of course, the future historian will have to depend somewhat upon homceopathic literature for material. It is to be- hoped, therefore, he may find more public-spirited management of the Hahnemannian Monthly, Dr. R. J. McClatchey (editor) of Philadelphia, and the Medical Investigator, Dr. T. C. Duncan (editor) of Chicago. Secondly, those who, temporarily elevated by their good fortune to positions of journalistic or professional prominence, but of obscure merit, either vain of their modesty, or desirous of aping the scruples erroneously attributed by them to the English aristocracy and some great men, have not only allowed their opportunity of advancing the hemceopathic cause to go by default, but have sought to adversely influence educated, progressive men by the obtrusion of their ignorance and toadyism. This is particularly applicable to some physicians of Boston and its vicinity. Long experience in the collection of biographical material both in Europe and America demonstrates the fact that those who make the greatest parade of their modesty are men whose claims to real prominence and worth are of at least questionable authenticity. Men who have achieved any worthy aim by reason of the very ability which has enabled its achievement, not only are conscious of their superiority to those they have surpassed, but they feel the importance of allowing their careers to be handed down in permanent form as encouragement and incentive to others. This is true in all professions and callings, but it is especially so in such a case as the present, where a new school in a profession has been founded, and where its permanency depends so much upon the generation that is rising to fill the places of the founders. And again, in a word, if the assistance given by the gentlemen whose' sketches are herein to be found can be construed into an exhibition of vanity, we have abundant evidence that a;hundred per cent. of the men of genius, attainments, and moral worth are chargeable with vanity, or, more correctly speaking, possess what is a high virtue in humanity and the true lever of progress-self-esteem. The profession and the public generally must acknowledge that the real merit and value of this, the first effort in biographical history of homceopathy, together with the highly expensive style in which the work has been produced, afford sufficient evidence of the intention and determination to lay the foundation for future editions that shall be entirely above criticism.
