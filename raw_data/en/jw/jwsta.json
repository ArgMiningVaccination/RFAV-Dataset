All collateral services tha t are delivered to a person that is an integral part of the recipient's environment such as medically necessary training, counseling and therapy, must directly support the recipient. Services are based on an intensity of needs determination. The assessed level of need specifies the amount, scope and duration of mental health rehabilitation services required to improve, retain a recipient's level of functioning or prevent relapse. The determination cannot be based upon the habilitative needs of the recipient. Intensity of needs determination is completed by a trained Qualified Mental Health Professional (QMHP) or Qualified Mental Health Associate (QMHA) and is based on several components related to person - and family -centered treatment planning. These components include: A comprehensive assessment of the recipient's level of functioning; The clinical judgment of the QMHP; or The clinical judgment of the case manager working under clinical supervision who is trained and qualified in mental health intensity of services determinations; and A proposed Treatment Plan. A re-determination of the intensity of needs must be completed every 90 days or anytime there is a substantial change in the recipient's clinical status. Nevada Medicaid utilizes an intensity of needs grid to determine the amount and scope of services based u pon the clinical level of care of the recipient. The grid is based upon the current level of care assessments: Level of Care Utilization System (LOCUS) for adults and Child and Adolescent Services Intensity Instrument (CASII) for children. The determined l evel on the grid guides the interdisciplinary team in planning treatment.

All requirements for the licensure are prescribed in Chapter 433 of the Nevada Administrative Code.

Nevada Medicaid PERSONAL CARE SERVICES (PCS) assist, support, and maintain recipients living independently in their homes and in settings outside the home. These services are to be provided where appropriate, medically necessary, and consistent with program utilization control procedures. Personal Care S ervices may be an alternat ive to institutionalization. These services and hours are established based on medical necessity and must be prior authorized by Medicaid and established using a Medicaid defined functional assessment. P ersonal care services cannot exceed hours determined by a functional assessment conducted by State Medicaid staff or their designee. Services may be reassessed when a significant change in condition or circumstance occurs or annually as specified in policy. Personal care services include a range of human assistance provided to persons with disabilities and chronic conditions of all ages, which enables them to accomplish tasks they would normally do for themselves if they did not have a disability. Assistance may be in the form of hands -on assistance (actually performing a personal care task for a person) or cuing so that the person performs the task by him/herself. Such assistance most often relates to performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instr umental activities of daily living (IADLs). ADLs include eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and maintaining continence. IADLs capture more complex life activities and include light housework, laundry, meal preparation, transportation, and grocery shopping. Personal care services can be provided on a continuing basis or on episodic occasions. Skilled services that may be performed only by a health professional are not considered personal care services. Personal care services may be provided by any willing and qualified provider through a Provider Agency (PA), Intermediary Service Organization (ISO), or by an Independent Contractor when a PA or ISO is not available in that area of the state. All providers must meet established qualifications of 16 hours of basic training, background checks, and TB testing. Legally responsible individuals (e.g. spouse, legal guardian, parent of minor child, legally responsible stepparent, or foster parent) may not be reimbursed for providing personal care servi ces.
