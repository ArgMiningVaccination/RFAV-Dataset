Natural Energy Therapy is the science and art of inner healing and balance. It helps us to be more balanced in our body, mind and spirit. This means that while the innermost layers of a person are balanced and energised, a sense of being more at peace with oneself and the world is achieved. This inner balance then positively affects the outer layers of a person - the mind and emotions - effecting more mental poise, more concentration and focus of mind, and settling the emotions. The most outward layer, the physical body, is also very positively affected. As the energy becomes more balanced, so the body chemistry is also brought into a state of better balance. Functions that have been 'forgotten', or conditions that the body has not had the strength to deal with often begin to improve. The improvement can be gradual or dramatic. Many individual factors are at work here, so it is not possible to predict how quickly a particular condition will improve. [See Our Courses For Natural Energy Therapy Training and A Healing Way of Life.](https://openpathwaycentre.org/events/) FAQs Can Energy Therapy help with an emotional problem or a life crisis? Many people seek help from Energy Therapy at times such as divorce, relationship difficulties, bereavement, ill-health, illness of a loved one, or a financial or work crisis. Any family, social or emotional issues can be greatly helped, as the healing aspect within Energy Therapy supports and balances a person's inner resources, helping them to cope better and perhaps to see things in a different way. This is very different from a psychotherapeutic approach, as a person's energy actually helps them to feel better through and through, without necessarily talking much about the situation. (However, some Natural Energy Therapists are also trained as Intuitive Guidance Coaches, and may, in certain circumstances, recommend this approach). Many people with non-specific or hard-to-explain emotional difficulties benefit from Natural Energy Therapy. Often, simply feeling not quite right or unhappy without reason is a good indication that Natural Energy Therapy is needed. Prevention is better than cure Going back thousands of years, the balancing effects of Natural Energy Therapy have been used in a preventative way. By harmonising the energies, small imbalances can be sorted out before they become major illnesses. For similar reasons, many people come to Natural Energy Therapy for help with their personal progress. By unblocking obstructions within the energies, problems in personal life, spiritual progress and meditation practice can all be helped. Thus those who feel 'stuck' often find their life opening up, and things becoming clearer. Natural Energy Therapy following accident or shock Following an accident, the healing aspect of Natural Energy Therapy is very helpful in supporting orthodox treatment to damaged areas, and also in helping to heal the trauma from such an event. Natural Energy Therapists regularly witness clients recovering faster than expected following accidents if they have also received Natural Energy Therapy. Broken bones, muscle and tissue damage, and whiplash all tend to improve faster, as the healing aspect helps the person's energy body to re-align itself more quickly, which results in a quicker physical recovery as well. Apparently 'minor' accident damage such as sprained wrists and dislocated joints can benefit tremendously from receiving Natural Energy Therapy, preferably soon after the event. Even 'old' or long-term damage can be completely helped. Natural Energy Therapy and Medicines Natural Energy Therapists are often asked \"Will I have to stop taking my drugs?\" The answer is no. Whilst sometimes people feel they no longer wish to take the medication prescribed for them, a Therapist will ask the patient to consult with their Doctor if this question is raised. It is often very inadvisable to suddenly stop taking a prescribed drug, and expert help must be sought on this question. If, however, a client is withdrawing from drugs with their Doctor's guidance, the healing aspect of Natural Energy Therapy is extremely supportive in the process, helping to minimise any possible withdrawal effects. If a person is continuing to take their medication, they can still receive Natural Energy Therapy, and may in fact find that any side effects are reduced as a result. A professionally trained Natural Energy Therapist will always respect treatment prescribed by a client's doctor. How often is Natural Energy Therapy needed? This is individual, depending on the severity of the condition and many other factors. However, visits could be once a week, with more time between visits as the client improves. In acute situations, it may be necessary to start with more frequent appointments. Natural Energy Therapy and surgery It is ideal to have Natural Energy Therapy both before and after any surgery, as it so greatly helps the body's own healing process to speed up. Surgery can be very necessary for a person's well-being, and by helping to minimise the shock to the system surrounding this procedure, Natural Energy Therapy can help to reduce any post-operative complications. Once again, this is a situation where recovery is often faster than expected when a client is also receiving Natural Energy Therapy. What illnesses can be helped? Because Natural Energy Therapy works so holistically, there is no limit to what sort of dis-eases of the mind, body or spirit can be helped. This therapy always treats the whole person, as well as the disease, and many patients become truly well. People going through natural times of physical change often have Natural Energy Therapy to help smooth the process and avoid possible complications. These include those in adolescence, pregnancy, mid-life crisis and the menopause, where the natural change can be a time of joy rather than a time of upset. How Natural Energy Therapy works We are deeply connected to the life-force or cosmic energy that permeates the Universe. If our connection with this force becomes weakened or blocked, we eventually show signs of illness or instability. The Natural Energy Therapist is trained to act as a pure vessel, so that the client's own life-force is strengthened and healing takes place. Balancing of the life energies is also done in this way, helping one to feel more centered and at ease with oneself and life. Can Natural Energy Therapy be mixed with other therapies? Yes, it can be compatible with and helpful to other therapies. However, it is a whole therapy in itself and the client is advised to consult the Natural Energy Therapist to decide whether it is necessary to have other treatment, and to decide the time needed between other therapies and Natural Energy Therapy. Natural Energy Therapy and Mental Problems Many people with mental fragility and conditions find help from Natural Energy Therapy. Problems range from mild and severe depression, manic depression to schizophrenia and psychic disturbances. With these conditions, it is once again very important not to withdraw from prescribed drugs, but to liaise with the prescribing doctor if wishing to discontinue medication or change dosage. Is faith necessary? No, but as with everything else we do, the more open minded we are, the faster it works. However, many sceptics have Natural Energy Therapy and find it very effective. A good Natural Energy Therapist will neither press a particular religious view on a client, nor will they hold prejudices against a client's own spiritual beliefs. Children and Natural Energy Therapy Children respond well and enjoy their appointments. Most experienced Natural Energy Therapists are happy to treat children, but if in doubt, do ask. Animals and Natural Energy Therapy All animals can benefit greatly; domestic and farm animals happily receive Natural Energy Therapy. Ask an experienced therapist for more details.
