These therapies were done with a two-fold objective: that the clients might recover and that the therapies really would work. And so it happened! I dedicate this book to my husband, Stephen Van Coops, whose constant belief; support and guidance of me in the USA helped me to achieve my many successes. I acknowledge my Spirit Guides who, in my time of suffering, opened the doors of my awareness into the manifestation of these therapies. Thank you everyone... Dr. Margaret PREFACE Crystal Acupuncturesm evolved over the years because of various ailments I manifested that required treatment. I inherited Parkinson's Disease, a major illness for which there was no cure. My quest for finding the right stones to heal myself opened up my journey of discovery. I carefully selected the stones, now called crystals, and my Spirit Guide, Master Chang, taught me the techniques I ultimately developed. Teragramsm Therapy began in a very unusual way. I was already deeply involved in my research on Crystal Acupuncturesm at the time and was ready to promote it. My first task was to find a wholesaler who could keep me supplied with the crystal points that I had chosen. Hence, my visit to Fred Miller who, at that time, was busy making Agate clocks. During my negotiations with him, I kept being drawn to large Agate slices that his daughter was working on. I watched her carefully sticking the clock numerals on each slice and then placing the hands in position as she attached the clock workings behind. The more I watched her, the more I realized that it was not her clock-making that intrigued me, but rather the Agate slices themselves. After having carefully selected certain crystals for my Crystal Acupuncturesm sets, I asked Fred about the Agate slices. He gave me one to hold while he explained how they had been cut and chemically colored. The slice I held was very heavy, being eight inches in diameter and a quarter inch thick. I was fascinated by the many colors that radiated energy towards me. I felt like a child with a new toy. I didn't know why, but knew I had to have a few of them. So I asked him to sell some to me. He insisted on giving me eight slices of various colors. They were red, blue, green, yellow, purple and pink as well as two others that were multicolored. Together they weighed approximately five pounds. Back home, I studied them. My Spirit Guides had been with me the whole time I had been talking to Fred, but they had said nothing. Now, alone with me, they spoke and confirmed to me that I had a new therapy to begin investigating. My first step was to use them on myself. As soon as circumstances allowed, I found a quiet time to lie down and placed six of the heavy Agate slices on my Chakras. In no time at all, I was experiencing swirling energy in all of my Chakras and a shifting of my Five Bodies. I knew then that this was truly the beginning of a new adventure for me. During my final research, I chose the name Teragramsm Therapy. Within the word Teragram are anagrams. Terra is of the Earth. Gram is a weight and then, of course, Agate are all included. It also is my name spelled backwards. Great! My secret mark! Over the years, I discovered just how effective and important Agate is as a healing stone. When I combined Teragramsm Therapy with Crystal Acupuncturesm, I found my clients recovering from their illnesses at a much faster rate. Many of my clients volunteered to be my guinea pigs and I owe much to them for their trust and support in allowing me to experiment. Since then, I have taught and trained individuals in America, England and Japan to practice Crystal Acupuncturesm and Teragramsm Therapy. These Therapists are happy to report to me from time to time and the response is always the same: The clients are recovering quickly and are emotionally and mentally calmer and happier. Crystal Acupuncturesm and Teragramsm Therapy are effective in conjunction with any traditional medical treatment as well as with any alternative medicine and therapy. These therapies are non-invasive and have no bad side effects. In the pages to come, I intend to help you, the reader, make up your own mind about using Crystal Acupuncturesm and Teragramsm Therapy. I strongly recommend that you also purchase and make ample use of my illustrated book, The Book of Crystal Acupuncturesm and Teragramsm Therapy Diagrams, which provides numerous detailed diagrams and directions for use of the stones described here. Treatments of specific disorders and conditions are described in that book. Margaret Rogers Van Coops' Breakthrough Therapies: Crystal Acupuncturesm and Teragramsm Therapy will be of great value to those who do healing with their own collections of crystals or who purchase our packaged therapy kits.

For as long as we can remember, it has been used for furnishings and jewelry. Early Egyptians used Agate slabs to cover their sacred altars. Craftsmen made fine amulets of Agate and people wore them around the neck to keep themselves safe from harm. Everyone knew that Agate was a holy stone and that it protected users from evil. Thus, they believed they were closer to the Gods. History reveals that ancient cultures respected this stone, yet they were not geologists. They performed no scientific studies, so how then did those ancient ancestors of ours know so much about Agate? The best sources for answers were my Spirit Guides, who taught me that in those ancient days, people were highly receptive to feeling emanations from everything they touched. They were Psychometrists. Psychometry is the psychic sense of touch which, in reality, is our Spirit's own sense of feeling. Because everyone is a spirit living within a body, each of us is capable of using Psychometry. In modern times, we generally use Psychometry to sense unrest in relationships and business affairs. A few use their psychic skills to attune to their environment and the beauty of this Earth that surrounds them. It is only in the past few years that interest has grown, once again, in the use of crystals as healing tools. Using Clairvoyance, my Spirit Guides showed me in a vision how a temple priest would prostrate himself upon an Agate altar in the hope of receiving a command from the gods. He then took the message to the people of his village. I saw how the Agate altar affected the priest's body. His Aura shifted, pulling in as though shrinking and then expanding, as negativity and fear left his body in the form of red, blue and green explosions. His mind emptied and his spirit awakened to his innermost senses. His Aura expanded and took on a golden hue. In this state, I watched as he touched his Spirit Guides and made connections. I saw his Spirit Guides join with him and, as he received their messages, his Aura changed again to a light blue. I knew he had become enlightened. I watched as dark and dull colors surfaced in his Aura and then dissipated as new lighter and brighter colors took their place. Within these colors, I could see a spectacular display of color discharges as his body relaxed. I watched as all his energies began to flow and a general healing occurred. Once the priest had received his message of insight, he left the altar and returned to the people, appearing rejuvenated. His Aura was stronger and his life forces brighter. I watched as the priest's followers, using Psychometry, felt this change in him and placed their trust in him by honoring his words and following his commands. The priest then gave out Agate amulets to bless the people in their times of trouble. I knew that the wearer could feel his own energy improving. He became more positive about his situation and felt more empowered to deal with his problems. My Spirit Guides told me that peoples' recoveries were most often credited to the priest and the power of the amulet, rather than to their own efforts in overcoming their traumas. Finding Lost Truths! What was it, I wondered, that the Agate table really did for the priest? The Teragrams made it possible for me to enter a new research phase. It took me six years to learn the truth. I was already acquainted with the use "}
