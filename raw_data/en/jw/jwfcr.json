The museum reopened in M ay 2019 after 10 months of closure while this work took place . All the public galleries are now looking much smarter for visitors, and the work in the main gallery means that the objects are now on display in a far better atmosphere for ensuring their preservation. The newly renovated main gallery was used at the end of year party to celebrate Professor Liba Tau b's tenure as the Head of Department. Seminar Room 1 also had a more modest refurbishment, being repainted and having a new hard floor to replace the increasingly ropey carpet tiles. The department hosted a number of conferences this year, the largest of w hich was the British Society for the History of Science Postgraduate Conference in April . This was one of the largest conferences the Department has hosted, with 87 panel sessions across three days, a keynote lecture by HPS alumni Dr Sujit Sivasundaram (Un iversity of Cambridge), and over 100 attendees. The conference passed without any issues, a testament to the work of the organisers, HPS PhD students Emilie Skulberg, Laura Brassington, and Jules Skotness -Brown, and their help from department administratio n. This year, the Wellcome Trust -funded, HPS -based 'Generation to Reproduction ' research project oversaw the publication of Reproduction: Antiquity to the Present Day , a major milestone in the project as well as in the history and sociology of reproduction , with a book launch in the old library of Pembroke College . It was another industrious year for publi cations by department members more broadly, with the Whipple Library stepping in to host launch events while the Museum was closed. Joe Martin 's Solid State Insurrection: How the Science of Substance Made American Physics Matter , a history of the institutional changes in the American physics community during the 20th century, was released in November 2018. January 2019 saw the publication of the Cambridge History of Science vol. 1: Ancient Science , co-edited by Liba Taub with Alexande r Jones of NYU, a comprehensive overview of the ancient histories of the sciences in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, China, and India . Finally in March , Worlds of Natural History , the followup to the venerable Cultures of Natural History , was published, co -edited by Helen Curry, Nick Jardine, Jim Secord, and Emma Spary, it offers a a look at Natural History around the world. In keeping with tradition , to mark her promotion to professor in the last academic year, Lauren Kassell gave her inaugural lecture on the 28th of June . Titled 'You Me and The Moon: Magic, Medi cine and the History of Science' , Lauren gave us an overview of the themes and subjects of her research into the entwined history of astrology and medicine, as well as her own story as an academic. After the lecture, guests retired to the Peterhouse Deer Park for a garden party. This year also saw the official release of the Casebook s Digital Edition , a major output of the Casebooks Project, the research group who have been working in the HPS Department for the past 10 years. T his digitised version of the casebooks of early 17th-century astrologist -physicians Simon Forman and Richard Napier has been created to make the full corpus accessible in new ways to researchers, and gives a virtually unprecedented look into the lives and concerns of pe ople in the early modern period. This year also saw the release of Astrologaster , a videogame that takes a humorous look at the life and work of Simon Foreman and his patients, for which the Casebooks Project acted as historical consultants. 3 A major new hire was announced this year; Dr Staffan M\u00fcller -Wille will be joining the Department as University Lecturer in History of Life, Human and Earth Sciences, starting in January 2020. Finall y it was formally decided this year that the next Head of Department will be Tim Lewens, who will take up the mantle at the start of the Academic Year 2019 -2020. 4 Congratulations Lauren Kassell was promoted to a Professorship, and Anna Alexandrova was promoted to a Readership. Jenny Bangam was awarded a Wellcome University Award at Queen Mary University of London for her project Encountering genes: Postwar genetic counselling in the UK and Ireland . She will finish her maternity leave and current research fellowship in HPS before taking up the post, so we will have the pleasure of her company until March 2020. Andrew Buskell has been offered a Levehulme Early Career Fellowship starting in May 2019; this will enable him to stay in the Department until 2022. Agnes Bolinska and Joe Martin were the joint winner s of the the 2019 Essay Prize in HPS offered by the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.

Dawn Kingham left us in November on maternity leave, and we were delighted to hear of the arrival of Sam Glenn Kingham in the early hours of 10/12/2019. Sam and the rest of the family are doing well, and we look forward to welcomin g Dawn back to the team later this year. To assist during Dawn's absence we were happy to welcome Francesco Mannu to the Whipple Library team, on a year -long Secondment from his regular role at the University Library. Francesco comes to us via the Engineer ing Faculty Library, and has a wealth of experience working in Rare Books and Manuscripts at the UL. We also welcomed some new faces to our invigilation team, and Rebecca Charbonneau and Victor Parchment joined returning invigilators Meira Gold and Annie Thwaite, providing staffing during late opening hours in Term time throughout the year. In August we said goodbye to Meira, as she left to take up a Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of History and Civilization at the European University Institute in Florence. During this one -year postdoc Meira will finish her dissertation and write an article on 'long -distance archaeology.' During its second year the Library Management System (known as Alma) has bedded in well, benefiting from numerous b ehind the scenes and under the hood improvements in workflows and processes. Perhaps the change that most library users will notice is that, from August 2019, books borrowed from all Affiliated Libraries will auto -renew. In practice, what this means is tha t users should monitor their library accounts carefully and pay particular attention to recall notices. We suffered from two water ingress events this year, one major, one minor. During a flash downpour, the drainage of the Old Library's flat roof was over whelmed and water began to enter through a skylight at an alarming rate. Thanks to the swift and prompt action of readers in alerting staff to the issue, and everyone pitching in to assist with removing book stock from the affected area, we are very please d to report that only one book was water damaged enough that it had to be removed from stock and replaced. The other slight leak occurred in the roof of the Haycock Wing and has been contained and rectified. We will have the paint and plaster stripped off an area of the Haycock Wing for the entire of 2019 -2020 to enable it to fully dry before it is re -plastered and repainted. Collections 34 The collection has continued to expand this year as we have continued to ensure necessary reading list materials arriv e on time, and to satisfy the vast majority of requests for research materials too. 431 physical items and 22 ebooks added to the working collection. We have also acquired through donation and purchase several new items for the Special Collection over the course of the year. Though not all catalogued yet, they are: Les Merveilles du Corps Humain, ou Adolescens. L.F. Jaufferet. Paris, An VII (1799). No other copy held in a Cambridge library. The Poor Man's Physician or the Receits of the Famous John Moncrief of Tippermalloch... London, 1731. Only copy held in a Cambridge library The Situation in Biological Science: Proceedings of the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the U.S.S.R. Session: July 31 - August 7, 1948. Donation Evening Amusements; or, The Beauty of the Heavens Displayed... William Friend, London 1817. Supplementing our 1805 copy. Computer Programming for Chemists. K. B. Wiberg. W.A. Benjamin, Inc. New York. 1965. Only copy held in a Cambridge library. Donation. Nuclear Physics in Photographs. Tracks of Charged Particles in Photographic Emulsions. C.F. powell and G.P.S. Occhialini. Staffing Library Launcha, Victor Parchment, Annie Thwaite. Training & professional development All staff have undergone continuing training and professional develop ment throughout the year. Both James and Francesco undertook a three -day Cataloguing course at the University Library, which has enhanced and expanded their abilities in cataloguing both monographs and periodicals in MARC 21 using the RDA language to confo rm to the Cambridge Cataloguing Standard. This is a very intensive course and definitely not for the faint -hearted. Francesco also took a course in English Sign Language, while James took courses in mental health first aid, the future of Falcon (our websit e Content Management System) and minute taking. He also proved his skills with an extinguisher and some hi -vis by becoming a Fire Marshal. Jack qualified as a First Aider in December, joined the newly formed University Libraries Staff engagement Group, att ended training on GDPR for librarians, and attended staff development and review training. He attended a two -day 'Book Historians Toolkit' course at the UL, which has proven very useful while cataloguing older material, particularly when deciphering armori al bookplates. User Education Induction Tours This year we offered induction tours on a drop in basis throughout the first two weeks of Michaelmas term, and these were attended well. Jack was also very kindly permitted to gate -crash the end of the very first Part 1b lecture of term in order to persuad e (with cake) the Part 1b students to come and register at the library, and to raise awareness of the term time late opening. Visiting Scholars were all offered one to one tours if they had not visited the department before. There was occasional morale b oosting cake on offer throughout Exam term (and whenever else we felt like it) . Outreach and Public Events. 36 PhD candidates Karollina Pulkkinen and Meira Gold put the finishing touches to their respective displays on installation day. Displays Two displays were curated throughout the academic year, both by current PhD students. In Michaelmas Term, Karollina Pulkkinen kick started the Year of the Periodic Table by putting together a fascinating display entitled Curating the Chemical Elements Juli us Lothar Meyer's Periodic Systems . The year 2019 marks 150 years from Dmitrii Ivanovich Mendeleev's discovery of the periodic system of chemical elements. However, Mendeleev was not alone in discovering the system. In 1862 -1870, seven chemists created sy stems that historians recognise as the \"precursors\" for the periodic table we have today. One of them was Julius Lothar Meyer (1830 -1895). Both Meyer and Mendeleev were awarded the Davy Medal for their discovery of the \"periodic relations of the atomic wei ghts\" by the Royal Society of London awarded in 1882. Meyer is known for his textbook Die modernen Theorien der Chemie. In the book, Meyer argued that theories and hypotheses were helpful aids in chemical investigations. Such an argument was quite bold, as chemistry was marked by its empiricism in the 19th century. Apart from the textbook, Meyer is also known for his graphic curve that shows the periodic relationship between atomic volumes and atomic weights. The curve is perhaps the most vivid early illust rations of the periodicity of the chemical elements. The Virtual Exhibition can be below: https://www.whippleli b.hps.cam.ac.uk/special/exhibitions -and-displays/curating -chemical - elements/curating -chemical -elements We would particularly like to extend our thanks to colleagues in the Chemistry Library for the loan of the very scarce F. W\u00f6hler, J. Liebig, & H. Kopp (E ds.), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, VII. Supplementband, and also to colleagues in Conservation at the UL who carried out conservation and repair work on this volume, and also constructed a beautiful custom display stand, allowing us to exhibit a very fragile fold out opening. 37 Our second exhibition of the year was curated by Meira Gold, and was titled Conflicting Chronologies: Victorian debates about Egyptian prehistory . The deep human past was a key arena for Victorian intellectual controversy. W ere humans older than the biblical tradition of 6,000 years? Where had we come from? Were we one or many species? Above all, who had the expertise to provide authoritative chronologies? The term 'prehistory' first appeared in English in 1851. Ancient Egypt soon emerged as a critical juncture between prehistoric and historic time and became a symbolic place of debate. Egypt was believed to be the source of ancient wisdom and precise measurement, a critical region for linguistic development, and the origin of agriculture and metalworking. For Victorians, the Nile Valley was 'the cradle of western civilisation.' Amid British control of semi -colonial Egypt, the period saw enormous changes to studies of human antiquity. British geologists, philologists, ethnologi sts, anthropologists, archaeologists and astronomers identified traces of the remote human past in the region. All attempted to answer the question: who lived in Egypt before the pharaohs? This exhibit showcased some of the texts that debated the age, orig in and development of early Egyptian civilisation. It illuminates how Egyptian materials and labour informed these cross -disciplinary disputes. Again, the Virtual Exhibition can be seen below: https://www.whipplelib.hps.cam.ac.uk/special/exhibitions -and-displays/conflicting - chronologies/Introduction Several other outreach and public engagement events took place throughout the year. In September we put on a pop up display of library treasures for attendees at the CILIP Rare Books Conference, held in Downing College and, in conjunction with the Museum, ran a successful event for Open Cambridge based on the collections phrenology related holdings. In Michaelmas Term we also hosted two book launches in the Old Library, one for Joseph D. Martin's Solid State Insurrection: How the Science of Substance made American physics matter , and Daniel Margocsy, Mark Somos and Stephen N. Joffe's The Fabrica of Andreas Versalius: A Worldwide Descriptive Cencus, Ownership, and Annotations of the 1543 and 1555 Editions . In January, James took some of our Darwin related special collection material o n the road to Impington Village College with the Whipple museums' learning co -ordinator, to deliver a session on Darwinism. This went down very well and we received lots of complimentary feedback, and James blogged about the experience here: https://whipplelib.wordpress.com/2019/06/11/out -and-about -with-darwin -special -collections -on-tour/. In March we again took some of our Special Collections on the road for an event hosted at Churchill College highlighting Science Archives and Special Collections in Cambridge as part of the Cambridge Science Festival. These experiments in roving with parts of the collection have been very successfu l and we hope to do more in future. This has been made much easier by the purchase of a sturdy and secure Peli -case to ease transport. We have also been busy hosting visits from a variety of libraries and archives both from within and without Cambridge. 38 The Librarian clearly enjoying being photographed at the Churchill College Science Festival event. 39 The Museum Whipple Museum's Annual Report to follow. 40 Annual Reports of Members of the Department Anna Alexandrova This year I served as a Programme Director for Philosophy and Ethics of AI at the Leverhulme Centre for Future of Intelligence.

I spent the year in Cambridge, continuing my research on the history of crop diversity and conservation. The main focus of my activities was writing a book manuscript, Endangered Maize: Indigenous Corn, Industrial Agriculture, and the Crisis of Exti nction , which is under contract with the University of California Press. I also continued my frist -hand observation of crop conservation on research trips to Mexico and the United States. Thanks to an invitation to deliver the 2019 Innes Lecture, I was abl e to share some of this research with a public audience in April 2019 at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. In May 2019 I was elected to the council of the History of Science Society. Publication s Edited books H. A. Curry, N. Jardine, J. A. Secord, and E. C. Spary, editors. Worlds of Natural History .

In offering asymme tric explanations and indulging in simplistic psychologizing, this approach has serious limitations. By contrast, in this talk I examine what Newton's private and public writings say about what he took to be the ideal structure of a truth - seeking scientifi c community. Unlike more democratic proposals for practising natural philosophy, whose core principles were drawn from natural history, Newton's ideal scientific polity was strongly hierarchical, open only to expert subjects who had undergone rigorous trai ning. I link Newton's comments on the structure of scientific institutions to his prescriptions for maintaining a healthy and productive mind and body, and also to his religious and political views. I conclude by considering the explanatory status of such approaches. 1 November Mat Paskins (London School of Economics) Material substitutions in historical perspective: the cases of the British Substitutes and Vegetable Drugs Committees during World War Two In this talk, I discuss two British government committees which were tasked during World War Two with the solution of finding substitutes for materials which had been made scarce by the war: the Substitutes Committee of the Ministry of Supply, and the Vegetable Drugs Committee of the Ministr y of Health. I argue that these bodies cast a suggestive light on problems of 20th -century chemical governance in Britain, and the long history of attempts at material substitution by scientific means. The eminent industrialists and academic chemists who m ade up the Substitutes Committee ended up fighting a war chiefly of quotidian materials, trying to solve problems of degreasing wool, seeking replacements for leather, and worrying over the wide introduction of plastics. At the same time, their committee w as tightly integrated into both government and private sector mechanisms of production and supply, and they boasted of being able to coordinate otherwise unrelated substitution efforts. They also speculated on a number of possible novel uses for colonial s urpluses. The Vegetable Drugs Committee, meanwhile, was a remarkably diffuse entity which was torn between trying to provide support for voluntary collection of wild British plants, and ambitious schemes for complete self-sufficiency in drug production thr oughout the British Empire. 8 November Luke Fenton -Glynn (University College London) Probabilistic actual causation Actual (token) causation - the sort of causal relation asserted to hold by claims like 'the Chicxulub impact caused the Cretaceous -Paleoge ne extinction event', 'Mr Fairchild's exposure to asbestos 67 caused him to suffer mesothelioma', and 'the H7N9 virus outbreak was caused by poultry farmers becoming simultaneously infected by bird and human 'flu strains' - is of significance to scientists, historians, and tort and criminal lawyers. It also plays a role in theories of various philosophically important concepts, such as action, decision, explanation, knowledge, perception, reference, and moral responsibility. Yet there is little consensus on ho w actual causation is to be understood, particularly where actual causes work only probabilistically. I use probabilistic causal models, and associated causal graphs, to cast some light on the nature of probabilistic actual causation. 15 November Denis Wa lsh (University of Toronto) Being human, being Homo sapiens Neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism attempts to characterise human moral goodness as a natural phenomenon. It posits a substantive, essentialist, normative concept of human nature as an explanato ry primitive. Human nature, according to neo -Aristotelianism, is an instance of a generalised organismal nature. Opponents object that no such concept of organismal nature is sanctioned by best scientific practice. I offer a roundabout defence of the natur alistic status of neo - Aristotelianism. I argue that the concept of an organismal nature required by neo -Aristotelians can be found Aristotle's notion of Bios, a central feature of his theory of the organism. I next argue that something quite like Bios is required in contemporary evolutionary biology in order to explain the fit and diversity of organismal form. 22 November Amanda Rees (University of York) Creating citizen history of science: science, fiction and the future of the 20th century If something isn't real, or true - if it's (whisper it) fake - then, other than to debunk it, it can sometimes be hard to see why you should study it. By focusing on the histories of the future, this paper will show how the humanities, and in particular the history of science, can engage with the unreal, the fictional and the imaginary. By doing this, we will show how the idea of 'expertise' and the figure of the 'expert' can be interpreted more broadly, and indicate ways in which non -historians can influence the struct ure and shape of academic histories. We will begin by exploring these ideas in relation to science fiction, the nature of fictional realities and the impact of the imaginary on academic disciplines, and we will end (we hope) with a game in which players ca n reconstruct - and sometimes redirect - the history of the 20th century. Twentieth Century Think Tank The Twentieth Century Think Tank offers broad coverage of 20th - and 21st -century topics in the history, philosophy and sociology of science, technology and medicine. The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place on Thursdays over lunch. Think Tank meetings are held fortnightly on Thursdays, 1 -2pm in Seminar Room 2 . All welcome! Organised by Mary Brazelton, Joseph Martin and Richar d Staley. 11 October Joe Bassi (University of Texas, El Paso) How US science moved west: Boulder, Colorado and the development of US space sciences in mid -20th century America From being considered a 'scientific Siberia' in the 1940s, Boulder as a scienti fic centre represented an important transition of US science as it 'moved west' in the 20th century. The answer to this question lies in the complex confluence of individual scientific ambitions relating to sun -earth connection research, the pre and early Cold War context of science in the US, and political machinations at various levels of government. This presentation lays out the early phases of this 68 transition process, and particularly focuses on the efforts of solar astronomer Walter Orr Roberts, Color ado Senator 'Big Ed' Johnson, the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, and others in bringing sun - earth science to Boulder in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This investigation thereby sheds some light on the process by which scientific/academic centres (or 'peaks ') were created in the US west in the 20th century. 25 October Koji Hirata (Emmanuel College, Cambridge) A city of future past: urban planning and urban construction in northeast China after the Communist Revolution This paper examines how industrial enterprises and ordinary people participated in construction of cities in the early years of the People's Republic of China (1949 to present), especially between 1952 and 1957. Much of the past scholarly literature on urban planning in the early PRC focused on the state bureaucracy. By contrast, I explore how urban -planning policies were implemented at the ground level, by focusing on the case of Anshan - a major steel industrial city in Manchuria (northeast China) that had previously been constr ucted as a Japanese colonial city prior to 1945. To examine the construction and reconstruction of this city, I draw upon a wide range of newly available sources, including interviews, local newspapers, official municipal histories, and confidential govern ment reports. My paper begins with a brief overview of the establishment of the PRC city - planning bureaucracy, which is followed by a discussion of the process and outcomes of urban construction. I then discuss the population movement to Anshan from the co untryside, and how this contributed to issues of housing shortages in the city. Altogether, this re -examination of the Chinese urban political economy demonstrates that local -level negotiations among various actors, including lower -level officials, enterpr ise managers, and even migrant workers, lay at the heart of urban construction in Mao -era China. 8 November Sam Robinson (University of York) Anticipations of the ocean: technological futures of the Cold War ocean The UN Law of the Sea (1968 -1984) was intended to legislate for the new capabilities that developments in underwater science and technology opened up for developed nations. In reality the negotiations became a point when the superpower technological hegemony of the global ocean was challenged by the 'Group of 77' - nations that saw the negative potential of new technologies in terms of the external exploitation of their resources. Science policy was formed in response to the anticipated capabilities of such technologies which fa r outweighed the realities of extracting deep - sea minerals and resource exploitation in remote and inhospitable environments. Thus, the discussion of ocean science and technology within the treaty negotiations were built on anticipatory understandings of t he potential exploitation of the oceans. This paper will argue that international law -building for science and technology can be framed as an anticipatory response to claims made for potential future use. Thereby these negotiations, based on unsettling sc ientific futures, are themselves forms of scientific imaginaries. The navigation of potential uses of science, by diplomats, reveals the role of science communication within complex negotiations, and the importance of the distinction (and sometimes the blu rring) of the real and the imagined in international relations. The Law of the Sea was a site where scientific futures were imagined in several contexts; a uniquely challenging moment in international law creation where lawmakers looked to the future rathe r than responding to their past or present situations. 22 November Cancelled 69 20 December Ksenia Tatarchenko (University of Geneva) The thaw in the Pole: Cold War science and showcasing at the Siberian science - city and Antarctic expeditions (1955 -1964) This paper focuses on the interdependencies in the process of making international science and producing knowledge about extreme environments by establishing connections and comparisons between two historical episodes: the creation of the Siberian science -city and the early Soviet Antarctic expeditions. It reveals how the Cold War framework highlighted a key ambiguity of Soviet science: producing universal knowledge in socialist way. Thanks to recent works on Cold War sciences, we now know that circulating p eople, ideas and artefacts operationalized, breached, and occasionally transcended geopolitical divisions. Scholars working on polar regions also demonstrate how these regions are constructed both as strategic locations and rhetorical forms of domination over nature. This paper adds another dimension to a discussion of such entanglements among several historical sub -disciplines - Big Science as spectacle. It argues that showcasing was a constitutive element, not an accidental byproduct, of Khrushchev -era ma ssive investment into ostensibly civilian scientific infrastructures across Siberia and Antarctica. In 1957, the year of Sputnik, the Soviet press announced the creation of the first Siberian science -city, Akademgorodok, and the images of 'Ob', the flagman of the Soviet expedition sailing south for the third time, proliferated. The aim here is not only to correct misleading historiographic claims conflating remoteness with 'freedom' and de -Stalinization with de -Sovietization, but to explain the very size of historical record associated with these projects. Situated across the globe, Siberian science -cities and Antarctic bases were presented in an unexpectedly similar way, as model scientific communities. In the process, both regions and their natural environ ments became not only the elements of scientific representations as circulating 'mobiles', but the stages for enacting the competing versions of modernity. Both locales enticed numerous visitors to record and share their experiences. Yet such visitors ofte n passed over a key aspect of these sites - the co -dependency between the openness of international science and the secrecy regimes of national defence. Akademgorodok had many ties to 'plutopias', the closed cities of the Soviet nuclear programme, and Antarctica's international 'science and peace' to the Arctic's Cold War frontier. Coffee with Scientists The aim of this group is to explore and enhance the interface between HPS and science. Though many of us in HPS engage closely with science and scientists, we could benefit from more explicit discussions about the relationship between HPS and science itself, and from more opportunities for HPS-scholars and scientists to help each other's work. Generally we meet on Fridays, 3.30 -5.00pm in Seminar R oom 2 . Further information and reading materials will be distributed through the email list of the group; please contact Hasok Chang (hc372) if you would like to be included on the list.

The collection was assembled by Sir William Paston and his son, Robert Paston, both of whom were famed for their hospitality and learning. The collection's core included objects obtained on Grand Tours and fabricated from materials derived from the Americas, Pacific, China a nd India. The full extent of the collection is known only through house inventories and auction lists, since it was dispersed by Robert Paston, 1st Earl of Yarmouth and his son, William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth. Approximately 1% of the collection's ite ms was depicted in a monumental still -life painting of c.1664. The talk will outline the nature of exchanges implied by the collection and its painting. 15 October Emma Spary (History, Cambridge) Putting the pieces together: Canadian ginseng and botanical expertise in the French Regency This paper will examine the complex history of the relationship between French botanical knowledge, commerce and Royal institutions in the 1710s -1730s through the case of Canadian ginseng. Its discovery in 1717, growing in newly -colonised French Canada, was ostentatiously publicised back in the metropolis. The history of how this Canadian plant came to be attributed properties similar to those of the famous Chinese drug which was its namesake has been told several times, most recently as a story of widening separation between the interests of botanists and those of clergy. Using previously neglected archival materials, I will argue, in contrast, for a far more complex response to the new drug, centred on a reconfig uration of the relationship between state power and botanical expertise during the 1710s. These developing connections shifted the scope of botanical practice away from classical humanism and towards a new view of the distant natural world as a source of n ational prosperity; they also placed a new emphasis upon the botanical garden as a space of proof and demonstration. The ways in which Canadian ginseng changed as an object of knowledge can be seen to express these forming and transforming relationships be tween statecraft, natural knowledge and wealth. 22 October Annual Fungus Hunt 29 October Justin Rivest (History, Cambridge) Elite paternalism and exotic drug demand in early modern France: the case of the Marquis de Louvois and quinquina, circa 1685 My talk will explore the links between household medical consumption of prominent aristocratic families and the early bulk consumption of exotic, non -European drugs by the French army in the 17th century. Men of state like the French War Secretary, the Marqui s de Louvois, approached their personal health problems - as well as those of their families and servants - through personal networks of informants, suppliers and experts. Looking specifically at Peruvian cinchona bark (quinquina), I will consider how Louv ois' personal advocacy of the drug helped extend its use to his 71 subordinates, servants, the king and ultimately in bulk volumes to thousands of soldiers during an epidemic of intermittent fevers at the construction site of the Eure Canal. Louvois' drug ne tworks were not in any sense dependent upon traditional 'medical' actors such as physicians or apothecaries: it was in fact Louvois who supplied his physicians with quinquina, not vice versa. His networks of supply and information included reliable familia l clients from many walks of life, from domestics to jewellers and bankers, and other servants scattered strategically through various institutions and settings, both in France and abroad. Drawing on this case and a few others, I argue that the personal c onsumption of \u00e9lites served as a crucial mediator for population -scale consumption of exotic drugs. Far from an economy of individualised consumption, I argue that the state marketplace for exotic drugs originated within a broader culture of paternalism an d charity: it was an extension of the personal care of aristocratic patrons for their clients and servants. 5 November Martha Homfray -Cooper (History, Cambridge) The Curious Martin Folkes (1690 -1754): sociability and collecting in the mid -18th century Martin Folkes, President of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries, has not been treated kindly by historians. He has either been seen as an aristocratic menace to the progress of 18th - century science or else ignored completely. And yet his cont emporaries awarded him prestigious scientific positions. The vast majority of contemporary voices praised him for his involvement in a wide variety of sciences - antiquarianism, numismatics, mathematics, astronomy and natural history. The disconnect betwee n the negative picture of Folkes as drawn by historians and contemporaries' more positive testimonies requires explanation. This talk examines Folkes's correspondence networks, his possessions, and his travels around Europe. Contemporaries had a set of cri teria for what counted as good science very different to that which scholarship presumes. In the first half of the 18th century, good science shifted from being about singular, one -off curiosities to valuing large collections of knowledge. Folkes was funda mental to encouraging and modelling this shift. Science was no longer about finding the unique; it was now about building large collections and ordering them. Folkes simultaneously collected various objects and European -wide correspondents and he himself c onformed wonderfully to the criteria of good science which he helped to shape. This talk seeks to reconstruct how he successfully self -fashioned himself as the Curious Martin Folkes and how this relates to mid -18th century scientific practices. 12 November Marie de Rugy (History, Cambridge) Mountains, rivers and forests: the colonial mapping of southeast Asia, between observation and vernacular cartography in the 19th century During British colonisation of Burma and French rule in Indochina, survey ors were sent throughout the territory to explore, measure, observe and describe it and to draw topographical maps. On the one hand, they used their own techniques and proved to be scientific actors, charting the territory on maps according to European nor ms. On the other hand, they collected indigenous information to help them understand an unknown territory and given that they were not always able to make proper observations themselves. In this paper, I will concentrate on the representation of natural e lements, such as mountains, rivers and vegetation to show how fundamental they have been in the mapping of territory, but also how diversely they have been depicted by different actors. European officers, Indian surveyors, Burmese foresters, Shan traders a nd Vietnamese administrators all have particular ways of drawing a map and describing a landscape. By analysing topographical and indigenous maps, I will try to 72 understand these different perceptions of a territory through its constitutive elements and que stion the integration of vernacular knowledge in European mapping. 19 November Oscar Kent -Egan (HPS, Cambridge) Isaac Van Amburgh the lion tamer: spectacle, education and natural history in Britain, 1825 -1872 In August 1838, an enigmatic American showman by the name of Isaac Van Amburgh arrived in London with a troupe of performing lions. He exhibited daring feats of control over these creatures and helped establish lion taming as a popular and profitable act in theatres and circuses. He toured Europe unt il 1845 and inspired numerous imitators. His shows were the first dedicated exclusively to lion taming and attracted various sections of society, ranging from members of the working classes to Queen Victoria. The question of how Van Amburgh tamed his lions sparked widespread discussion. He was secretive about his training methods and papers speculated on whether rational instruction, brute strength or special knowledge of animal behaviour explained his powers. This talk explores the marketing and press cove rage of Van Amburgh's shows. It considers the complex imagery spun around his performances. Newspaper reports often claimed that the acts revealed social and scientific lessons. They were tied in with Lord Brougham's attempts to reform working class educat ion and debates on behavioural studies of animals. Van Amburgh's show was not merely dismissed as a vulgar spectacle or violent entertainment. I argue that the press transformed it into an illustration of the improvability of nature and the value of practi cal, experiential knowledge of animals. These interpretations influenced the development of lion taming in the second half of the 19th century and help explain the persistence of the practice. 26 November Margot Lyautey (EHESS, Paris/T ubingen) Plant prot ection in France and Germany from the 1930s to the 1950s: the case of the Colorado potato beetle In this paper, I aim at proposing a French -German history of the rise of chemical insecticides from the 1930s to the 1950s using the Colorado potato beetle as a case study. This particular insect was one of the most feared agricultural pests after World War I. Being such a big threat for food supply in France and Germany, especially during World War II, the potato beetle was considered as public enemy number on e in agriculture. It was also one of the first agricultural pests fought at a European level through chemical means, and was contemporary to the advent of chemical pesticides. Originating from the USA, hence the name Colorado , the potato beetle infested Eu rope in the early 1920s, starting in Bordeaux's haven and then spreading year after year until the end of the 1950s. Furthermore, this insect had strong cultural implications throughout the 20th century. In World War II German occupation soldiers were nick named 'Potato Beetles' ('Doryphores') by the French population because they were invaders and were known to eat a lot of potatoes. After the war, the Colorado potato beetle was presented in East Germany in communist propaganda to be a biological weapon use d by the USA, in order to sabotage socialist agriculture with insects supposedly brought on German territory using planes. Through a French -German history of the fight against the Colorado potato beetle, I will try to show what comparative history can brin g to the history of agriculture, which is often studied inside national frames. AD HOC AD HOC (Association for the Discussion of the History of Chemistry) is a group dedicated to history of chemistry.

We argue that (MQ) splits into questions about (a) shared representations of space in different perceptual systems, and about (b) shared ways of constructing higher dimensional spatiotemporal features from information about l ower dimensional ones, most of the technical difficulty centring on (b). So understood, MQ resists any monolithic answer: everything depends on the constraints faced by particular perceptual systems in extracting features of higher dimensionality from thos e of lower. Each individual question of this type is empirical and must be investigated separately. We present several variations on MQ based on different levels of dimensional integration \u2014 some of these are familiar, some novel adaptations of problems k nown elsewhere, and some completely novel. Organizing these cases in this way is useful because it unifies a set of disparate questions about intermodal transfer that have held philosophical and psychological interest, suggests a new range of questions of the same type, sheds light on similarities and differences between members of the family, and allows us to formulate a much -augmented set of principles and questions concerning the intermodal transfer of spatiotemporal organization. 17 October Rune Nyrup (Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, Cambridge) Explanations for medical artificial intelligence (Joint work with Diana Robinson) AI systems are currently being developed and deployed for a variety medical purposes. A common objection to thi s trend is that medical AI systems risk being 'black -boxes', unable to explain their decisions. How serious this objection is remains unclear. As some commentators point out, human doctors too are often unable to properly explain their decisions. In this p aper, we seek to clarify this debate. We (i) analyse the reasons why explainability is important for medical AI, (ii) outline some of the features that make for good explanations in this context, and (iii) compare how well humans and AI systems are able to satisfy these. We conclude that while humans currently have the edge, recent developments in technical AI research may allow us to construct medical AI systems which are better explainers than humans. 75 24 October Karim Th\u00e9bault (University of Bristol) Leibniz, Mach and the C -Series According to Carlo Rovelli the (undirected) time orderings of physical states should be given relationally via reference to internal clocks [1]. Internal clocks do not generically provide an always increasing (or decreasing) pa rameterization of physical states. This means that Rovelli's internal time proposal allows for violations of 'temporal monotonicity'. Alternative proposals that retain temporal monotonicity have recently been shown to lead to physically distinct models for quantum cosmology [2]. The status of temporal monotonicity is thus of potential empirical significance. In this talk we will consider the status temporal monotonicity in a philosophical perspective with reference to three particular historical figures. F irst, we will examine the extent to which this aspect of time features in Leibniz's positive account of time, as reconstructed by Arthur [3]. Next, we will considering the relevance of some suggestive remarks from Mach's Science of Mechanics [4]. Finally, we will consider the extent to which temporal monotonicity is equivalent to McTaggart's C - series, as reconstructed by Farr [5]. We conclude by briefly considering the challenge to various forms of realism about temporal monotonicity posed b y general relativity. [1] Rovelli, C. (2002) Rev. D 65 124013.

However, empirical evidence of this pattern has been elusive, per haps owing to a heavy reliance on singular measures that fail to distinguish between plural, often competing internal motivations for punishment. In this talk I will present a new study that employed a test of the theorized double -edge pattern using a nove l approach designed to separate such motivations. This is the first study of its kind to quantitatively demonstrate the paradoxical effect of neuroscientific trial evidence and raises implications for how such evidence is presented and evaluated. 7 Novemb er Christoph Hoerl (University of Warwick) Temporal binding and the idea of a 'sense of agency': a critical examination Voluntary action gives rise to a temporal binding effect, in which the interval between intentional movements and their causal conseque nces is subjectively compressed. In the current psychological literature, temporal binding is widely conceived of as a measure of a 'sense of agency' involved in voluntary action. I provide an analysis of the explanatory framework that I take to be in play in existing accounts based on this idea. I raise two key problems for such accounts - an empirical and a conceptual one - and argue that the very idea of a dedicated 'sense of agency' rests on a confusion between two different issues. I then outline an al ternative explanatory framework, which 76 instead construes temporal binding as a measure of a belief in causality. I show how such an alternative framework, too, can explain the results of studies in which temporal binding has been shown to be affected by fa ctors that specifically impinge on participants' judgements about the extent to which they are themselves actively involved in bringing about the timed events. 14 November Ali Boyle (Trinity Hall, Cambridge) Memory: what is it good for? Increasingly, mem ory researchers are of the view that memory is not for remembering. That is, we do not have episodic memories (memories of personally experienced events) because being able to remember is itself beneficial, but because it confers some other advantage - most often, the ability to 'project' oneself into the future. This claim has been used to lend support to novel accounts of episodic memory's nature, and to motivate new evidential standards for its detection in animals. In this talk, I aim to show that the a rguments for this claim are unsound, and offer a (qualified) defence of the view that remembering is the function of episodic memory. 21 November Katie Robertson (Philosophy, Cambridge/University of Birmingham) Time -asymmetry in thermal physics The second law of thermodynamics has a lot to answer for. Reichenbach claims it was responsible for the direction of time. Atkins claims that 'the second law is one of the all -time great laws of science, for it illuminates why anything - anything from the cool ing of hot matter to the formulation of a thought - happens at all'. And Hawking claims it is a tautology. In this talk, I discuss the different concepts of time -asymmetry in thermal physics and claim that the second law has less bite than the authors abo ve suggest. Instead of an arrow of time, it is more appropriate to say, as Uffink suggests, that the second law describes the ravages of time. Instead of considering thermodynamics to be the source of the arrow of time, I claim that statistical mechanics is the theory we should focus on. By looking at a particular framework advocated by Zwanzig, Zeh and Wallace, I discuss how the time -asymmetry in statistical mechanics arises out of the underlying time-symmetric dynamics. 28 November Matt Farr (HPS, Cambri dge) The C theory of time Does time have a direction? Intuitively, it does. After all, our experiences, our thoughts, even our scientific explanations of phenomena are time -directed; things evolve from earlier to later, and it would seem unnecessary and i ndeed odd to try to expunge such talk from our philosophical lexicon. Nevertheless, in this talk I will make the case for what I call the C theory of time: in short, the thesis that time does not have a direction. I will do so by making the theory as palat able as possible, and this will involve giving an account of why it is permissible and indeed useful to talk in time -directed terms, what role time -directed explanations play in science, and why neither of these should commit us to the claim that reality i s fundamentally directed in time. On the positive side, I will make the case that the C theory's deflationism about the direction of time offers a superior account of time asymmetries in physics than rival time -direction -realist accounts. HPS Workshop Wed nesdays, 5 -6pm, 7 November Organised by Carter, Katy Duncan, C\u00e9line Henne and Bobby Vos (Philosophy workshops) 77 HPS Workshop seeks to break the isolation of graduate r esearch and encourage collaborative thinking by allowing students to present work in progress in a supportive seminar environment. The workshops will have alternate sessions focusing on Philosophy and History, but interdisciplinary presentations are always welcome. After each seminar, we will head to a local pub. Students are invited to present on any aspect of their research that they are grappling with or desire feedback on, including: Unpacking complicated sources, concepts, or archives Presenting drafts of chapters, conference papers, or publications Proposing new ideas or strategies towards HPS research The session is comprised of two parts: 20 minutes where the speaker outlines their work in progress (indicating areas that they would like feedback to be based upon) and 40 minutes of discussion. Students interested in presenting in a Philosophy workshop should contact Bobby Vos (bfmv2). Those interested in presenting in a History workshop can contact Peter Rees (pr381). Aims and Methods of Histories of the Sciences Mondays, 11.30am -1pm, weekly from 22 October (6 sessions) Nick Jardine, with Geoffrey Lloyd, Hasok Chang, Raphael Scholl and Jeffrey Skopek These graduate seminars will consider aspects of the history, aims, methods and current problems of the history of science. The opening sessions will give an overview of the formation of history of science as a discipline and of the range of recent approaches. There will then be discussion of the educational and polemical uses of his tories of the sciences by scientists; and debate about the problems of anachronism faced by historians of science. Subsequent meetings will address the the roles of sympathy and antipathy in historical biographies, and approaches to the history of cross - cultural communication in the sciences. Aims and Methods of Histories of the Sciences on Moodle Kinds of Intelligence Reading Group The Kinds of Intelligence Reading Group meets biweekly on Thursdays during term time from 11am to 12noon in the Board Room .

Philosophy and History of Physics Reading Group The reading group meets on Tuesdays, 4.30pm to 6.30pm in the Board Room . Organised by Joe Martin (jdm205) and Matt Farr (mwef2). This Michaelmas, we'll be exploring the theme Phy sics and Empiricism. Our ultimate goal is to discuss ongoing debates about the role of empirical data in advancing the forefront of physics, for which we'll use two recent books: Richard Dawid, String Theory and the Scientific Method (Cambridge, 2013) Sabine Hossenfelder, Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray (Basic, 2018) Dawid is currently available as an e -book through the UL, and the Whipple has ordered several copies of the Hossenfelder book, which it will keep on hold. Before we dive into t he contemporary debate, however, we'd like to develop a historical perspective on empirical philosophy as it relates to physics, and to that end, we'll revisit some classics. 9 October For the first session, we'll read excerpts from William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences , in particular book 1, chapter 2 (pp. 16 -50) and book 3, chapter 8 (pp. 245 -54). 16 October W. V. O . Quine, 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism' , The Philosophical Review 60, no. 1 (1951): 20 -43. In addition, try to take a look at one (or both!) of the following: Carl G. Hempel, 'Problems and Changes in the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning' , Revue Internationale de 11 (1950): 41 -63. Rudolf Carnap, 'The Elimination of Metaphysics through Analysis of Language' , Erkenntnis 2 (1931): 219 -41. (Trans. Art hur Pap). Or you might like to brave the original German . 23 October Guest paper by Karim Th\u00e9bault (University of Bristol) : On the Univers ality of Hawking Radiation Sean Gryb, Patricia Palacios and Karim Th\u00e9bault In all major derivations of Hawking radiation there is an exponential red -shift between the late time radiation detected and the black hole horizon, where the radiation originates. Unruh has estimated that the 'frequencies which are needed to explain the radiation produced even one second after a solar mass black hole forms, correspond to energies which are e10^5 times the energy of the whole universe'. What we take to be the essenti al lesson is that, absent a well -trusted theory of quantum gravity, any derivation of Hawking radiation as a phenomena that depends on near horizon physics must be supplemented with an argument for the insensitivity of the effect to short distance physics. That is, we need an answer to the question 'is Hawking radiation universal?' (Jacobson 2005, p.80). We will seek to answer Jacobson's question as follows. In Section 3, we will consider what is meant by a universality argument. To do this we will examine, in some detail, the structure and limits of more 82 familiar Wilsonian universality arguments found in the condensed matter context. Then in Section 4 we will consider three potential arguments for the universality of Hawking radiation that respectively draw upon: i) appeal to the universality of the Unruh effect combined with the equivalence principle; ii) the anomaly cancellation derivation; and iii) our ability to arbitrarily modify the dispersion relation of the scalar field used in the Hawking style deri vation. Finally, Section 5 provides a detailed comparison between the two families of universality arguments. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we will conclude that none of the universality arguments for Hawking radiation that are available measure up to the standa rd set by Wilsonian universality arguments in condensed matter context physics. This largely negative conclusions offers a framework for future development. 30 October Richard Dawid, String Theory and the Scientific Method (Cambridge, 2013), Introduction and Chapter 1 Sabine Hossenfelder, Lost in Math: How Beaut y Leads Physics Astray (Basic, 2018), Preface and Chapter 1 6 November Richard Dawid, String Theory and the Scientific Method (Cambridge, 2013), Chapters 2 and 3 Sabine Hossenfelder, Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray (Basic, 2018), Chapters 2 and 3 13 November Richard Dawid, String Theory and the Scientific Method (Cambridge, 2013), Chapter 5 Sabine Hossenfelder, Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray (Basic, 2018), Chapters 4 and 5 20 November Richard Dawid, String Theory and the Scientific Method (Cambridge, 2013), Chapters 6 and 7 Sabine Hossenfelder, Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray (Basic, 2018), Chapters 7 and 8 27 November The readings for this week are: Sabine Hossenfelder, Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray (Basic, 2018), Chapter 10 George Ellis and Joe Silk, 'Scientific Method: Defend the Integrity of Physics' , Nature 516, no. 7531 (2014) : 321 -23 In addition, the proceedings of the 'Why Trust a Theory?' conference at LMU Munich are online.

These authors included instructions for potential healers to use their hands to think with, for example, by prognosticating based on seasonal cycles, predicting epidemic periods, and differentiating aberrant from norma l pulses. To have something 'within one's grasp' ( zaiwo ), in Chinese as well as in English, metaphorically meant to understand ( liaoran ). Early modern Chinese healers instrumentalized their bodies in complex ways as diagnostic instruments and measuri ng units as well as time -keeping, mnemonic, and calculating devices. Understanding how classical Chinese medical texts recorded the healers' body -as-technology illuminates the range of knowledge about Heaven and Earth early modern healers were expected to use their hands as well as their minds to master. This lecture will use select examples of the healer's body -as-technology in classical Chinese medicine and suggest that the field of extended cognition within cognitive science offers some productive insigh ts into this historical phenomenon. 24 January Lina Jansson (University of Nottingham) Newton's methodology meets Humean supervenience about laws of nature Earman and Roberts [2005a,b] have argued for Humean supervenience about laws of nature based on an argument from epistemic access. In rough outline, their argument relies on the claim that if Humean supervenience is false, then we cannot have any empirical evidence in favour of taking a proposition to be a law of nature as opposed to merely accidentally true. I argue that Newton's methodology in the Principia provides a counterexample to their claim. In particular, I argue that the success or failure of cha ins of subjunctive reasoning is empirically accessible, and that this provides a way of gaining empirical evidence for or against a proposition being a law of nature (even under the assumption that Humean supervenience fails). 31 January Ruth J. Salter (U niversity of Reading) Bathing, bloodletting and bed -rest in the high medieval monastery Focusing on 12th -century English monastic communities, this paper considers three practical applications of healthcare undertaken within medieval monasteries. While th e great monastic libraries would have contained medical manuscripts, the collection of such items varied from house to house and, more importantly, such materials would not have been accessible to the majority of the 86 cloistered community. The practices of bathing and bloodletting, and the allowance for bed -rest, however, would have been experienced and witnessed first -hand by many of the community. As such, these practical applications have the potential to offer us insight into the healthcare within the monastery, and into monastic understandings of health and the body. Within this paper, the three practices will be taken in turn to consider their uses, and concerns about their abuses, in order to draw attention to the practicalities of claustral healthcar e, and to pose questions regarding medical practices within the monastery. The questions raised by this paper are also key to my next proposed research project; a project that intends to consider the experiences, understandings and practicalities of monast ic healthcare within the Anglo -Norman world. 7 February Leah McClimans (University of South Carolina) Patient reported outcome measures are different Since the 1970s epidemiological measures focusing on 'health -related quality of life' or simply 'quality of life' have figured increasingly as endpoints in clinical trials. Before the 1970s these measures were known, generically, as performance measures or health status measures. Relabelled as 'quality of life measures' they were first used in cancer trials. They were relabelled again in the early 2000s as 'patient -reported outcome measures' or PROMs, in their service to the FDA to support drug labelling claims. To the limited degree that the philosophical literature addresses these measures, it tends to associate them with two of the major theories of well -being: subjective well -being and capability approach to quality of life. My general argument in this paper is that philosophers ought to treat quality of life measures/PROMs as distinct from these t heories of well -being with their own theoretical commitments, values and epistemic concerns. The primary reason I will give for this argument is that we cannot separate the rise in popularity of quality of life/PROMs from their role in representing and am plifying patients' perspectives. The nature of this representation is due to a historical context in medicine that emphasizes patient autonomy and patient expertise. I will argue further that these measures are 'patient -centred' to the degree they are pati ent directed and inclusive. Finally, I will end by suggesting that the theory quality of life/PROMs needs is not an attribute theory or a theory of prudential value, but an epistemic theory that governs patient and others contributions to the construct. 14 February Pratik Chakrabarti (University of Manchester) Past unlimited: the canal of Zabita Khan This paper shows how deep time superseded various other forms of historical imaginations in India. In doing so, it critiques the conceptions of deep history , of the ways it overwrites other histories. It traces this process through the history of the canal of Zabita Khan. In the early 19th century, the British began one of their most ambitious irrigation projects in India. As British engineers started to dig the Doab canal, they realised that there existed an medieval system of canal networks. In the course of the excavations, ancient canals appeared indistinguishable from old riverbeds and geomythical rivers and the lines between the monument and the terrain or the 'natural' and the 'historical' become imperceptible. Rivers moved, legends moved with them; dead riverbeds became canals, canals became natural channels of water and mythical rivers were traced in the landscape. In the process, the landscape, the le gends, and the monuments became part of this colonial antiquarianism in which the history of a medieval canal was recounted as one of deep history. 21 February Hasok Chang (HPS, Cambridge) Beyond correspondence: realism for realistic people 87 In this paper I lay down some groundwork for a pragmatist scientific realism, which will be fully consonant with actual scientific practices. Scientific realism demands that our best scientific theories should give really true descriptions of the world. Truth here is u sually conceived in terms of a 'correspondence' between theory and reality - ultimate, metaphysical, and mind -independent reality. However, this idea is useless in practice because such reality is inaccessible to us, and the alleged correspondence only mak es sense as a metaphor based on actual representational activities, in which both the 'model' and the 'target' are accessible. This metaphor appears to make literal sense only because we take part in the illusion of the 'ready -made world', according to whi ch reality, independently of any conceptions we impose on it, already has well -defined parts and relations between the parts. Abandoning the illusory metaphor, I propose that realists should accept pragmatism in relation to 'primary truth', which does not consist in agreement with other things that we already know to be true. Primary truth is based on the 'operational coherence' of activities that we engage in; if some coherent activities rely on a certain proposition, then that proposition is true within the domain of those activities. Once we have some primarily true propositions, then correspondence to them defines the secondary truth of other propositions. However, the picture I propose is not a foundationalist one in the traditional sense: a given propo sition may be true in a primary or a secondary way, or even both. 'Truth happens to an idea' (William James), and the manner of that happening depends on the contingent contexts of truth -making and truth -finding activities. 28 February Cyrus Mody (Maastri cht University) History of S&T need an oil bath: oil, scarcity and technoscience in the 1970s Oil is everywhere in the history of science and technology, yet nowhere. In almost all of our disciplines' subfields one can find stray and often puzzling refere nces to oil firms' contributions, yet few of these have been examined carefully, much less connected together. There is a long history of such 'oil spillovers', but they become more pronounced as one approaches the 1970s and the emerging technologies about which governments and investors were most optimistic in that era: nuclear (fission and fusion) and solar power, biotechnology, microelectronics, and scenario planning/resource forecasting. I argue that oil firms' investments in all of these technologies w ere a response to the resource scarcity debates of the early 1970s. That's perhaps unsurprising, but the involvement of 'oilmen' in the environmentalist organizations propelling that debate is not well known. Oil firms' motivations for intervening in envir onmental debates are generally assumed to be cynical, but I offer evidence that their calculations were more complex, at least before the collapse in the price of oil in the early 1980s. 7 March Sharon Crasnow (Norco College/Durham University) V-Dem: measuring democracy Indices of democracy (measurement of democracy) raise a variety of concerns. First, the latent concept of democracy needs to be clarified in order for coding to proceed and measures to be determined. Second, the multiple purpose s for which we might seek measures of democracy suggest that multiple measures are needed, each differently suitable and dependent on the purposes for which they are needed. Questions of aggregation and disaggregation of the components of democracy - many of which differ among the different indices - depend on decisions about indicators of the concept 'democracy' and vary among indices. Third, the belief that measurement serves only as an intermediate step in the process of testing hypotheses limits discuss ion of the role of measurement in other aspects of knowledge production. V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy), a project that began roughly 10 years ago, explicitly addresses many of these concerns through greater transparency about methodology and a fine -grain ed disaggregation of indicators of democracy. 'We provide a multidimensional and disaggregated dataset that reflects the complexity of the concept of democracy as a system of rule that goes 88 beyond the simple presence of elections. The V -Dem project disting uishes between five high -level principles of democracy: electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian, and collects data to measure these principles' ( V-Dem project website ). In this talk, I explore the claims made for V-Dem, the question of what it means to measure an abstract concept like democracy, and whether this project can tell us about the measurement of such concepts in the social sciences more generally. 14 March Charlotte Bigg (CNRS Paris) The view from here, there and nowhere? Situating the observer in the planetarium and in the solar system The projection planetarium has probably been the most important single device for comm unicating astronomy since the early 20th century. I look at the ways in which early planetariums encouraged the rehearsal by spectators of different spatial positions and bodily relationships with regards to (models of) the solar system. Acquiring a proper understanding of the solar system did not simply require participants to adopt 'the view from nowhere' but involved a spatial, physical and sensory journey through multiple viewpoints that often also rehearsed an idealised history of astronomy. Widely pra ised for its illusionistic rendering of the night skies, the modern planetarium was also a showcase for the precision technology of its maker Carl Zeiss, offering an experience simultaneously of simulated Nature, of astronomy and of technological mastery. Astronomy, the quintessential science of space and time, afforded in the planetarium an occasion for reflecting in broader ways on individuals' and humans' place in the modern world. Planetariums may be understood as materializing and promoting particular epistemological and pedagogical conceptions of the knowing subject; while they partook in the collective reflection on Nature, science and technology in modernity. Twentieth Century Think Tank The Twentieth Century Think Tank offers broad coverage of 20th - and 21st -century topics in the history, philosophy and sociology of science, technology and medicine. The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place on Thursdays over lunch. Think Tank meetings are held fortnightly on Thursdays, 1 -2pm in Sem inar Room 2 . All welcome! Organised by Mary Brazelton, Joseph Martin and Richard Staley. 17 January Mary Brazelton, Simon Schaffer, Charu Singh and Richard Staley (University of Cambridge) Decolonising the history of science curriculum Together with a notorious #ScienceMustFall video circulating on social media, #RhodesMustFall and Fees Must Fall protests in the University of Cape Town of 2015 -16 have helped inspire a widespread movement calling for the decolonisation of education. What does this mean f or science and the history of science? What should it mean for the curriculum and our courses? Here we discuss questions raised by the colonial history of science and the possibility of decolonisation, considering aims, strategies and experiences gained in teaching the history of science in Cambridge and elsewhere. 31 January Freddy Foks (History, Cambridge) Constructing the field: power, persona and paper tools How did inter -war social anthropologists go about trying to understand a 'whole society'? This paper draws on archival sources to reveal the research methods, political contexts and inter -personal 89 relations that contributed to the construction of 'the fiel d' in East and Central Africa during the 1930s. By doing so, the paper contributes to a long -running discussion carried on by historians, philosophers and anthropologists about the nature of observation and understanding in the modern social sciences. The paper argues that knowledge produced 'in the field' led to the formation of a distinctive and authoritative scholarly persona in the British social sciences (the figure of the 'social anthropologist'). This persona was constituted by extending the lessons learnt at Bronislaw Malinowski's seminar at the LSE into the politically and socially uneven terrain of Britain's African colonies. 14 February Audra J. Wolfe (Independent Scholar) A political history of apolitical science The Cold War ended long ago, bu t the language of science and freedom continues to shape public debates over the relationship between science and politics in the United States. From the late 1940s through the late 1960s, the US foreign policy establishment saw a particularly American way of thinking about 'scientific freedom' as essential to winning the Cold War. In this presentation drawn from her new book, Freedom's Laboratory , historian Audra J. Wolfe will focus on a crucial moment of this story, the late 1950s, when US policymakers ex plicitly articulated what it meant to describe science as apolitical, objective and international, all in the name of the intensely political goal of Cold War supremacy. A particularly troubling part of this story involves the government's decision to funnel its propaganda efforts, whenever possible, through nongovernmental organizations of scientists. How should historians understand groups of non -state actors doing the state's work? Does the concept of 'transnational science' even make sense for the Cold War? 28 February Paolo Heywood (Social Anthropology, Cambridge) Making difference: queer activism and anthropological theory This paper examines two paradoxes. The first is ethnographic: queer activists in Bologna, Italy are concerned with defining themselves in opposition to fixed categories of identity and forms of politics based on them. In so doing however, they must engage with the risk that this endeavour of difference -making itself becomes as fixed and uniform as the identities to whi ch it is opposed. The second paradox is theoretical: a range of anthropologists have recently argued that the relationship between theoretical and ethnographic material should be one of identity or correspondence. Yet such arguments, though highly conceptu ally stimulating, often reproduce in form what they refute in content: abstraction and metaphysical speculation, thus re -inscribing the difference between our concepts and our data. This paper simultaneously connects these respectively ethnographic and theoretical questions, whilst also deliberately holding them apart. The beginnings of an answer to both, it suggests, lie in an explicit attention to the boundaries and differences, rather than simply the isomorphisms, between theory and ethnography. Coffee with Scientists The aim of this group is to explore and enhance the interface between HPS and science. Though many of us in HPS engage closely with science and scientists, we could benefit from more explicit discussions about the relationship between HPS a nd science itself, and from more opportunities for HPS-scholars and scientists to help each other's work. We meet on Fridays, 3.30 -5.00pm in Seminar Room 2 . Further information and reading materials will be distributed through the email list of the group; please contact Hasok Chang (hc372) if you would like to be included on the list. 90 18 January Sir Harry Bhadeshia (Dept of Materials Science & Metallurgy, Cambridge) , hosted by Karoliina Pulkkinen The first bulk -nanostructured metal 22 February Prof. Chang -Hoon Nam (DGIST, South Korea; Visiting scholar in HPS, Cambridge) , hosted by Hasok Chang 'Wise reasoning' in science education 1 March Lucy Cheke (Department of Psychology, Cambridge) and Matthew Crosby (Department of Computing, Imperial College London) , hosted by Marta Halina The animal -AI Olympics Cabinet of Natural History This research seminar is concerned with all aspects of the history of natural history and the field and environmental sciences.

In addition, the Cabinet organises a beginning -of-year fungus hunt and occasional expeditions to sites of historical and natural historical interest, and holds an end -of-year garden party. All seminars are hel d on Mondays at 1pm in Seminar Room 1 . Please feel free to bring your lunch. Organised by Laura Brassington (lb685). 21 January Jack Ashby (Museum of Zoology, Cambridge) Tour of the recently re -opened University Museum of Zoology and an insider's guide to natural history museums Meet outside the Whale Hall (main entrance of the Museum of Zoology) by 1pm The Cabinet of Natural History is invited to a private, guided tour of the recently re -opened University Museum of Zoology, led by myself, the Museum Manag er. As well as sharing stories from the history of the museum and highlights from its world -leading collection, the session will explore some of the insights used to develop a critical eye for visiting natural history galleries elsewhere. By using examples from the Museum, I will discuss the relationship between how natural history museums aim (successfully) to inspire wonder in the natural world, and the extent to which museums accurately represent nature in their displays. Exhibits will range from dodos to whales, as well as giant wombat -relatives and four -tonne sloths. I will discuss the research of the Museum and seek to answer questions, such as the extent to which specimens in natural history museums are authentic and represent the species they are in tended to exemplify and what kinds of human biases have been introduced and why. I will argue that museums are a product of their own history and the societies in which they are embedded. Museums are not apolitical or value -free: if we know what to look f or, we might spot evidence of speciesism, the patriarchy and colonialism when we next visit a museum gallery. 28 January Genie Yoo (Princeton University) Advijsen , old and new: the life span of VOC natural -historical information within the Dutch East Indies In the last decades of the 18th century, VOC administrators in Ambon dug deep into their own provincial archive in Casteel Victoria to unearth bundles of natural -historical papers written almost a century earlier. Among these late -17th and early -18th century papers were reports and assessments - often labelled advijs - written by and for individual administrative officials who sought answers to 91 specific questions; in this case, questions pertaining to the controlled extirpation of plants in the Malu ku islands. Georg Everhard Rumphius (1627 -1702) was one among several other 17th -century administrators whose written assessments would come to inform administrative decisions almost a century later, in the last, twilight decades of the Company which witne ssed heightened inter -imperial competition and a severe economic downturn that had far -reaching consequences in Company posts across the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. This paper attempts to historicize how administrators gauged the life span of nat ural-historical information within this context and looks at VOC practices of recording and retrieving information on one island across time. How did officials' own practices of reading and interpreting the papered past inform their understanding of contem porary problems and solutions? How did they register a century's worth of time and practice in the papers of those whose practical urgencies differed from their own? Did they ever consider information to be outdated and how did they assess the risks of res uscitating old natural -historical methods for new use? This paper attempts to answer these broader questions while also reflecting on the power of the archive for historical actors whose own prognostications were based on fragments of mediated information from a wildly different past. 4 February Edwin Rose (HPS, Cambridge) Printing, publishing and circulating books across Joseph Banks's empire The publication Joseph Banks (1743 -1820) is remembered for is the Florilegium , a series of copperplates that represent the plants he and Daniel Solander (1733 -1782) collected during the Endeavour voyage to the Pacific (1768 -1771), which remained unpublishe d until the 1980s. However, from the early 1780s, Banks published and oversaw the production of several works concerning the botany of the West Indies, Japan, India, China, Africa and species cultivated in Kew Gardens. This talk concentrates on two of Ban ks's books, Reliqui\u00e6 Houstounian\u00e6 (1781), on the plants of the West Indies, and Icones Select\u00e6 Plantarum (1791), on the plants of Japan. Initially, I examine the processes employed to produce a work of natural history in the late 18th century. Banks's publications were privately printed, using the highest quality materials and most skilled craftsmen available in London. Secondly, I examine the distribution of these materials. Banks had a small number of copies printed that he circulated to a specific group within the Republic of Letters and to those undertaking fieldwork in Asia and the West Indies. An analysis of these publications from their inception to distribution gives a new understanding of the methods and incentives for producing and circulating a wo rk of natural history in late 18th -century Britain. 11 February Sebestian Kroupa (HPS, Cambridge) Georg Joseph Kamel (1661 -1706): natural knowledge in transit between the Philippines and Europe When stationed in Manila at the turn of the 18th century, th e Jesuit pharmacist Georg Joseph Kamel found himself engaged in encounters between European and local traditions of knowledge. Based on his local experience, he produced extensive treatises of Philippine flora, which were later printed in Europe. Focusing on the practices involved in Kamel's knowledge production, this paper will explore Kamel's strategies in translating Philippine nature from local to European contexts. I will open with an examination of Kamel's plant classification system, which reveals ca tegories of knowledge inspired by Filipino indigenous traditions and shows entanglements between European science and local exigencies. However, upon arrival in Europe, these hybrid categories found little understanding among sedentary European naturalists and became lost in translation. Kamel was more successful in his attempts to transplant Philippine medicinal herbs. Through building associations with plants described by canonical authors of the Old World, Kamel sought to 'Galenise' Philippine medicinal plants - that is, to incorporate them into the Galenic medical tradition. In this manner, Kamel 92 endowed plants with clear theoretical foundations comprehensible to European experts and customers and paved the way for their deployment on both local and glob al scales and markets. 18 February Elena Romero -Passerin (University of St Andrews) Students, tourists and farmers: the publics of botanic gardens in the 18th century This talk will look at the visitors of publicly funded botanic gardens in Edinburgh, Fl orence and Pisa in the second half of the 18th century. Taken together, those three cities hosted five publicly funded botanic gardens. Botanic gardens were originally created to teach botany to university students. However, by the 18th century, the audien ce for botanic gardens in general had diversified. This paper will show the diversity of the publics of botanic gardens. Botany had become a popular hobby for the elite. Botanic gardens were recognised as important attractions for tourists going on their Grand Tour in Italy. Even the lower classes of society were now invited to wander around the gardens. Only two of the gardens studied here were university gardens, two were managed by learned societies, and the last one belonged to a museum of natural hist ory. Each of them had different target audiences and different rules about access. This paper will analyse the rules and testimonies about visitors of the gardens to understand what people wanted when they visited a botanic garden as well as what the insti tutions themselves wanted from their audience. Ultimately it will argue that the gardens' relationship to the public was an important part of what defines them as 'spaces of knowledge'. 25 February John Tweddle (Natural History Museum, London) Building kn owledge of the natural world: the historical and contemporary contributions of citizen science within the UK Since the 19th century, volunteer communities of amateur -expert naturalists have played a central role in generating scientific understanding of the UK's natural environment, through observing and documenting the natural world. This long and illustrious tradition continues today, with much of our knowledge of the plant and animal species that occur in the UK deriving from the exper tise and passion of these long -term networks of volunteer naturalists. Set against this continuity, the first part of the 21st century has seen a rapid expansion of the broader field of citizen science. Driven by the emergence of digital technologies, pre ssing scientific need and rising public interest, citizen science has increased in profile and prominence to become a popular pastime and a distinct academic field. Each year, over a million people from across the UK contribute their time, expertise and en thusiasm to an ever growing diversity of research projects relating to the UK's wildlife and environment. For many contributors, this involvement represents their first direct experience of the process of science. In this talk I will consider the changing landscape of citizen science and highlight some of the opportunities and challenges that this is presenting for both the field of science and the citizen scientists themselves. 4 March Anna Svensson (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm) The 'dye herbarium': capturing colour in botanical collections There is an anomaly among the old herbaria in Uppsala. Tucked away on a lower shelf, a smaller collection yields unexpected contents: page after page present colourful skeins of silk and wool samples dyed from lichens. They are the colour samples of the Johannes annan 93 hush\u00e5llsnytta (Stockholm, 1805). What is this textile collection doing in the herbarium? Pondering the relevance of dye -related collections and specimens to the history of botany brings the role of colour to the fore: colour, that fleeting quality of the plant that is soon lost from the preserved specimen. The question of ho w to capture colour is an old problem, reflected in early modern experiments with different ways of preserving and representing them, including painting specimens and making nature prints. The juxtaposition involved in what we might call the 'dye herbarium ' is an opportunity for comparison that highlights shared challenges of working with plants as distinctly local and temporal organisms. Both are concerned with preserving particular elements of plants, which given their transience requires accurate labels and systematic procedures. These observations are a venture into unfamiliar ground for me as a historian, as they have been informed by my own forays into natural dyeing. Methodologically, this has made me more aware of tensions within hierarchies of know ledge shaping my own interpretive frameworks, broadly informed by the material turn in the history of science. 11 March Patrick Anthony (Vanderbilt University) Meeting nature halfway: Georg Forster, mining, and the aesthetics of artifice In 1784, Georg F orster travelled through mining -landscapes in Germany's Harz and Ore Mountains. There he encountered 'a new and rejuvenated Nature'. Steeped in the teachings of the mining elites who guided him, Forster came to see water -, horse - and man -powered industry a s a noble human effort to participate in the 'workshop of Nature'. His journals oscillate between hubris and humility: keenly aware of the awesome power of nature evidenced by mine collapses, Forster understood mining as a project of 'fitting', even 'compl eting', natural landscapes. Following Forster's journey, this talk elucidates the unfamiliar sentimental world of late -18th-century resource extraction, which beguiles two dichotomous historiographical traditions. While some scholars describe the extractiv e ethos of Forster's generation as a wholesale 'oeconomization of nature', another tradition identifies the turn of the 19th century, with its embrace of holism, as a wellspring of ecological thinking. Indeed, the curious nature of this moment is captured by the fact that so many romantic figures participated in Germany's mining industry - from poets like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Hardenberg ('Novalis') to savants like Henrik Steffens and Alexander von Humboldt. Forster, to whom Humboldt attributed his own holism, helps us dwell in the alterity of a worldview whereby human dominion over nature was to be 'shared with nature'. To that end, this talk grounds the lofty aesthetic meditations of Forster and his contemporaries in the 'working wor ld' of mining, specifically in the hydraulic systems (dams, aqueducts, pumps and hydro -powered ore presses) that epitomized their philosophy of nature. AD HOC AD HOC (Association for the Discussion of the History of Chemistry) is a group dedicated to the history of chemistry.

Seminars are held on Wednesdays, 1.00-2.30pm in Seminar Room 2. 23 January Lina Jansson (University of Nottingham) Explanatory directionality In this talk I will argue that being careful about conditions of application provides a way of recovering explanatory directionality even in the presence of seemingly non -directed physical laws. I will show how this solution can be extended to some unexpected cases such as why we might take certain symmetries to explain conservation laws without taking conservation laws t o explain the symmetries. Finally, I will consider whether this approach can be used in the case of, so -called, distinctively mathematical explanations of physical phenomena and argue that it can. 30 January Agnes Bolinska and Joseph Martin (HPS, Cambridg e) Negotiating history: contingency, canonicity and case studies Objections to the use of historical case studies for philosophical ends fall into two categories. Methodological objections claim that historical accounts and their uses by philosophers are subject to various biases. We argue that these challenges are not special; they also apply to other forms of philosophical reasoning. Metaphysical objections, on the other hand, claim that historical case studies are intrinsically unsuited to serve as evid ence for philosophical claims, even when carefully constructed and used, and so constitute a distinct class of challenge. We show that attention to what makes for a canonical case can address these problems. A case study is canonical with respect to a particular philosophical aim when the features relevant to that aim provide a reasonably complete causal account of the results of the historical process under investigation. We show how to establish canonicity by evaluating relevant contingencies using two pr ominent examples from the history of science: Eddington's confirmation of Einstein's theory of general relativity using his data from the 1919 eclipse and Watson and Crick's determination of the structure of DNA. 6 February James Nguyen (UCL) Non-literal model interpretations I suggest that the representational content of a scientific model is determined by a 'key' associated with it. A key allows the model's users to draw inferences about its target system. Crucially, these inferences need not be a matte r of proposed similarity (structural or otherwise) to its target, but can allow for much more conventional associations between model features and features to be exported. Although this is a simple suggestion, it has broad ramifications. I point out that i t allows us to re - conceptualise what we mean by 'idealisation': just because a model is a distortion of its target (in the relevant respects, and even essentially so), this does not entail that it is a misrepresentation, even with respect to the features i t distorts. Rather, we should focus on interpreting the distorted aspects of such models non -literally. I investigate various ways of doing so, and demonstrate that for at least some idealised models, the result is that they are not misrepresentations afte r all, thereby diffusing various puzzles associated with their use in science. 13 February Peter Epstein (Philosophy, Cambridge) Spatial experience: more than mere structure According to a widely -held view of spatial experience known as structuralism, perceptual representations of spatial features are merely structurally isomorphic to abstract Euclidean geometry; they do not themselves comprise substantive Euclidean concepts. Building off of a distinction between geometrical and merely metaphorical spaces developed by Tim Maudlin, I show that this 96 structuralist view fails to explain the way in which we apply our Euclidean concepts to the spatial features we perceive. For, on th e structuralist picture, the results of Euclidean geometry would be equally applicable in perception to any set of features isomorphic to Euclidean space. Colours are one such set of features: their variations along the dimensions of hue, saturation and br ightness can be used to generate a (metaphorical) colour 'space' that maps onto the structure of Euclidean space. But we do not perceive colours, in spite of their being isomorphic to the features we reason about in Euclidean proof, as instances of Euclide an spatial relations - we do not see groups of objects as, say, square in virtue of their colour properties. It is only when we perceive the literal spatial features of objects - for example, when we see a chessboard as a square - that we take our geometri cal concepts to be applicable. This shows that, unlike in the case of colour, the connection between our spatial experience and our geometrical reasoning is more than merely structural. 20 February Milena Ivanova (HPS, Cambridge) Beauty, truth and underst anding In this paper I explore the epistemic justification of aesthetic values in scientific practice. It is well documented that scientists use aesthetic values in the evaluation and choice of theories they employ. Aesthetic values are not only regarded as leading to practically more convenient theories, but are very often taken to indicate the likelihood of a theory to be true. That is, often scientists place epistemic import on the aesthetic values of theories, deciding whether to commit to a theory in light of its beauty, especially in situation when the empirical data is not available to guide such decisions. The question then arises as to whether beauty can be trusted to be informing our epistemic attitudes towards scientific theories. I outline some timely defences of the idea that beauty can be a guide to the truth and evaluate whether such defences have been successful. I turn to an alternative explanation for the relevance and importance of beauty in science. I argue that the employment of aesthet ic values reflects our own intellectual capacities and provide heuristic guides to achieving understanding. 27 February Inkeri Koskinen (University of Helsinki) Two types of success: epistemic exchange and societal impact in extra -academic research collab orations My aim in this paper is to criticise an assumption that is sometimes made explicitly in science policy, but is usually implicit in the literatures on extra -academic expertise and the democratisation of science. According to this assumption, in re search collaborations breaking the boundaries of science, success in creating the wanted societal impact requires successful epistemic exchange. I argue that this is not the case, and present a case study as a counterexample. It is possible to succeed in c reating the wanted societal impact through extra -academic collaboration while failing in epistemic exchange. I will begin with an overview of a large and complex development: the democratisation of science and the increase of research collaborations with extra -academic experts. After that, I introduce three measures of success relevant in this context, focusing on the latter two. Following Gibbons et al. (1994) I call the first measure scientific excellence as defined by disciplinary peers. The second is the created societal impact. Its importance is emphasised in virtually all of the literature on the democratisation of science and extra -academic expertise - though the understanding of the nature of societal impact varies greatly. The third measure is epis temic exchange. Researchers provide something to the extra -academic participants in a collaborative project, but also gain something: knowledge and skills from extra -academic experts, a better understanding of the values at stake from citizen participants, or new perspectives and useful criticism from stakeholders (e.g. Epstein 1995; Kitcher 2011; Wylie 2015). The creation of functioning trading zones (Galison 1997) or 97 boundary objects (Star & Griesemer 1989) can be seen as indicators of success in epistemi c exchange. It is often assumed in the literature that success in creating the wanted societal impact requires successful epistemic exchange. I have conducted a case study where I followed a two -year research collaboration between social scientists, journ alists and artists. I use the case as a counterexample, and argue that it is possible to create the wanted societal impact through extra -academic collaboration, even if the participants fail in epistemic exchange. 6 March Cancelled 13 March Maarten Steenhagen (Philosophy, Cambridge) On a central puzzle in philosophical catoptrics This paper will address one of the central puzzles of philosophical catoptrics, the philosophical study of the optical properties of mirrors. When you look in your bathroom mirror you see your own face. This seems obvious. However, it is also natural to say that what you see is a mirror image of your face. I will assess whether these claims are ultimately compatible. My main aim is to clarify our conception of the re lation between mirror images and the reality of which they are images. This will contribute to our understanding of the optical properties of mirrors, but will also help refine currently dominant conceptions of images. HPS Workshop Wednesdays, 5 -6pm, week ly from 16 January Organised by Jules Skotnes Eoin Carter, Duncan, C\u00e9line Henne and Bobby Vos (Philosophy workshops) HPS Workshop seeks to break the isolation of graduate research and encourag e collaborative thinking by allowing students to present work in progress in a supportive seminar environment. The workshops will have alternate sessions focusing on Philosophy and History, but interdisciplinary presentations are always welcome. After each seminar, we will head to a local pub. Students are invited to present on any aspect of their research that they are grappling with or desire feedback on, including: Unpacking complicated sources, concepts, or archives Presenting drafts of chapters, confer ence papers, or publications Proposing new ideas or strategies towards HPS research The session is comprised of two parts: 20 minutes where the speaker outlines their work in progress (indicating areas that they would like feedback to be based upon) and 4 0 minutes of discussion. Students interested in presenting in a Philosophy workshop should contact Bobby Vos (bfmv2). Those interested in presenting in a History workshop can contact Peter Rees (pr381). Images of Science Lent Term: Wednesdays, 11am -12.30pm , weekly from 23 Sachiko Kusukawa, with D\u00e1niel Marg\u00f3csy, Nick Jardine, Nick Hopwood and Boris Jardine These graduate seminars will focus on the role of images in the history of science. Images have been central to observational practices, fieldwork, professional identities and scientific arguments. They contribute to our historical understanding of the sci ences within visual culture, material culture, 98 collecting and making, and the history of the book. Each seminar will be led by researchers who have worked extensively with images, and will be an opportunity to examine both primary and secondary sources. Session 1: Historiography (Sachiko Kusukawa) Session 2: Art and Science in the Dutch Golden Age (D\u00e1niel Marg\u00f3csy) Session 3: Comely Frontispieces (Nick Jardine) Session 4: Media (Nick Hopwood) Session 5: Paper Instruments (Boris Jardine) Session 6: Student p resentations/Round -table discussion (SK and others) Images of Science on Moodle Ideologies of Science Lent Term: Mondays, 11.30am -1pm, weekly from 4 February (6 sessions) Nick Jardine, wit h Anna Alexandrova, Mary Brazelton, Stephen John and Richard Staley These graduate seminars will explore rival conceptions of the nature of science and of its educational, social and political roles. Ideological conflicts considered will include: radical a gnostic John Stuart Mill vs conservative Anglican William Whewell on the methods of natural science and its roles in education and politics; liberal Ernst Mach vs conservative Catholic Pierre Duhem on the history and prospects of the sciences; the Society for Freedom in Science vs socialist visions of the functions of science; the 'two cultures' controversy sparked off by C.P. Snow, champion of science education, and F.R. Leavis, champion of literary education; Philip Kitcher and his critics on science and democracy.

Organised by Agnes Bolinska. 25 April Joseph Martin (HPS, Cambridge) Rethinking industrial patronage of academic research in the early Cold War Robert Maynard Hutchins, the University of Chicago's erstwhile chancellor, remarked in 1963: 'My view, based on long and painful observation, i s that professors are somewhat worse than other people, and that scientists are somewhat worse than other professors.' This outlook motivated his efforts to insulate Chicago's scientists from industrial and military influence after World War II. Perhaps un expectedly, Chicago's science faculty embraced Hutchins's plan to fund three ambitious new research institutes with numerous small subscriptions from industry, which Hutchins hoped would diffuse any one corporation's influence, seeing in the plan a way to protect their basic research ideal. The University of Michigan deployed a similar strategy to attract industry funding post -World War II. Michigan pursued industrial partnerships to support a laboratory that doubled as a living war memorial, enlisting busi nesses by appealing to corporate responsibility and suggesting a shared obligation to prevent government control over basic research. In each case, businesses contributed generously, often because they shared concerns about government monopoly on critical sectors of scientific research. Historians have shown how some university -industry collaborations intertwined with the military - industrial -academic complex during the Cold War. MIT and Stanford, for instance, cultivated a cosy relationship with both indus try and government, at times steering their research towards economic and military interests. Studies of this type of relationship have shaped current historical understanding of Cold War science. They suggest that individual institutions possessed little latitude to craft the relationships with industry they thought conducive to their institutional goals. A broader survey of institutions, and engagement with industry's own motives for supporting academic science, will situate existing understanding of acad emia -industry partnerships within a larger, knottier story about American science, technology, academia and industry. I present the Chicago and Michigan cases and describe how they motivate systematic re -evaluation of industrial patronage and its place in Cold War science. 2 May Darrell Rowbottom (Lingnan University) The instrument of science In my recently published monograph, The Instrument of Science: Scientific Anti -Realism Revitalised (Routledge), I develop and defend a position that I call 'cognitiv e instrumentalism'. This involves three core theses. First, science makes theoretical progress primarily when it furnishes us with more predictive power or understanding concerning observable things. Second, scientific discourse concerning unobservable thi ngs should only be taken literally in so far as it involves observable properties or analogies with observable things. Third, scientific claims about unobservable things are probably neither approximately true nor liable to change in such a way as to incre ase in truthlikeness. In this talk I will offer some arguments for each thesis, using examples from the history of science, and hence cognitive instrumentalism as a whole. 105 9 May Liam Kofi Bright (London School of Economics) Du Bois' plan for scientific in quiry Social epistemologists are increasingly coming to appreciate the importance of planning out a schedule of inquiry. How we decide what will be investigated, by who and on what schedule, are hugely influential on what we are capable of coming to know or reliably conclude. Presently one prominent social technology we have for allocating resources to projects of inquiry is the peer reviewed grant competition. In this talk I will review a number of critiques of this social technology, motivate an alternat ive grounded in the historical practice of W.E.B. Du Bois, and point to some relative advantages of the latter course. I end by calling for an integrated HPS project that might help us explore the social epistemic properties of Du Boisian scientific resour ce allocation. 16 May Twenty -Fourth Annual Hans Rausing Lecture Ruth Oldenziel (Eindhoven University of Technology) Whose history of technology? Path dependencies, contested modernities, and pockets of persistence McCrum Lecture Theatre, Bene't Street, at 4.30pm 6 June Ofer Gal (University of Sydney) From Kepler's optics to Spinoza's politics: Descartes' turn to the passions In 1604 Kepler published his Optical Part of Astronomy , dramatically changing the role of optics and the fundamental conc ept of vision. Instead of a window through which visual rays informed reason about its surrounding objects, the eye became a screen on which light painted images of no inherent cognitive value. The naturalization of the senses required a corresponding natu ralization of the mind, which Descartes attempted to offer with a theory of the passions. Kepler's optics turned sensations into purely causal effects, but the passions, indicators of benefit and damage to the individual, could provide them with meaning. T his was a reversal of the traditional epistemological responsibilities of reason and the passions, and for Spinoza this demanded a reversal of their ethical and political roles. 'Desire is the very essence of man' he stated, and concluded: 'society can be established ... not by reason ... but by threats .' Twentieth Century Think Tank The Twentieth Century Think Tank offers broad coverage of 20th - and 21st -century topics in the history, philosophy and sociology of science, technology and medicine. The regul ar programme of papers and discussions takes place on Thursdays over lunch. Think Tank meetings are held on Thursdays, 1 -2pm in Seminar Room 2 . All welcome! Organised by Mary Brazelton, Joseph Martin and Richard Staley. 9 May Ulrika Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n (Clare Hall; Sveriges Radio) How wide and how tall? Genome Wide Association Studies in debate, from height to educational attainment and back In April 2018 a study was published that claimed to have found evolutionary differences between human populations on different continents, with a larger selection in some populations for genes which could be linked to educational attainment (Racimo et al, Genetics , 208, 1565 -1584). A few months later the same research group presented new results calling to question the very foundations of their own methodology (Jeremy Berg et al, BioRxiv, 23 June 2018). In this paper based on a chapter in progress I trace how claims about evolutionary differences 106 between human populations in the selection of complex traits were constructed from 2010 to 2018, starting with the publication of GWAS -data linked to height by the so -called GIANT -consortium in 2010 ( Nature , 467, 8 32-838). This article was considered a breakthrough in GWA -studies of complex human traits, finding hundreds of genetic markers correlating to height differences between individuals. Although the authors carefully noted that these genetic markers could not be used for predictive purposes, but should rather be regarded as indicators of genetic loci suitable for further exploration of functional genetic links to height, this set of markers was subsequently used in a study investigating evolutionary explanatio ns to height differences between different European populations (Nature Genetics , 44, 1015 -1019). The article published in 2012 was hence one of the first to claim to have found active selection for a complex human trait which differed between populations. After these two initial articles were published, several years of similar research followed on ever larger datasets, as the GIANT consortium grew. With the increasing power of new datasets, including genetic data from hundreds of thousands of individuals , the number of genetic markers that could be statistically linked to height differences between individuals also grew. These results were in their turn used as starting points for new studies of the evolutionary background to differences in height between different populations, notably between southern and northern Europeans. Simultaneously, the success of the 2010 -study had sparked a whole new field of research applying GWAS to an increasing number of human traits, including one as complex and highly cult urally dependent as 'educational attainment'. In 2018 the field hence culminated in a study claiming to have found an evolutionary background to differences between human populations in the frequency of genetic markers that could be linked to educational a ttainment. The political implications of this claim sparked a controversy within the population genetics community (Novembre et al, Genetics , 208, 1351 -1355) which led to a reconsideration of earlier results. Comparing the GWAS -results from one data set (G IANT) to another (UK Biobank) researchers found that the statistical link between certain genetic markers and height all but disappeared. The explanation given was that the GIANT -dataset suffered from unknown population stratification. This finding brought to question the methodology as such, since it uncovered a hitherto underestimated sensitivity to confounding factors. Interestingly, the seminal article of the field, published in 2010, included a clear warning of using GWAS -results for prediction. Inste ad it stated that the genetic markers found should only be used as a starting point for further investigations of genetic functionality. This story hence unfolds as a case study of how scientific results take on new meanings as they leave their original se tting and are interpreted by other researchers and implemented as starting points for new studies. Another aspect of this case study is that the original datasets used had a very heavy bias of northern European genetic data. Recent studies have shown that genetic markers found by GWAS in one population cannot necessarily be transferred in a meaningful way to another population. This story hence also serves as a very concrete illustration of how a Eurocentric approach may skew scientific results. 16 May Jenny Bangham (HPS, Cambridge), Marta Halina Ernesto Schwartz Marin (University of Exeter) Thinking/researching/teaching race, genetics and intelligence in HPS and STS This presentation will feature an open discussion expl oring strategies and approaches towards thinking, researching and teaching these controversial topics of long -standing interest, with specialists in the history of genetics and anthropology, philosophy of intelligence, and the ethnography of biomedicine, f orensics and citizen science. Coffee with Scientists 107 The aim of this group is to explore and enhance the interface between HPS and science. Though many of us in HPS engage closely with science and scientists, we could benefit from more explicit discussion s about the relationship between HPS and science itself, and from more opportunities for HPS-scholars and scientists to help each other's work. We meet on Fridays, 3.30 -5.00pm in Seminar Room 2 . Further information and reading materials will be distributed through the email list of the group; please contact Hasok Chang (hc372) if you would like to be included on the list. 26 April Hope Bretscher and Carmen Palacios Berraquero (Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge) , Cambridge) Confined and free: excitons in 2D 10 May Andrew Blake (Chairman, Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge) , commentary by Marta Halina (HPS, Cambridge) Should we trust machines that see? 17 May Jonathon Crystal (Program in Neuroscience, Indiana University Bloomington) , hosted by Marta Halina (HPS, Cambridge) Future planning in nonhuman animals Cabinet of Natural History This research seminar is concerned with all aspects of the history of natural history and the field and environmental sciences.

Political radicals condemned potatoes as a tool of exploitation. Advocates of free trade denounced them as an obstacle to economic rationality (Ireland being a prime example), and nutritionists investigated the deleterious effects of 'sluggish potato blood' on the urban proletariat's productivity. This talk sketches out the ways in which potatoes, and the everyday eating practices of working people, became entangled in debates about industrialisation and economic change in 19th - century Europe, to show how talking about potatoes provided a way to talk about capitalism. 6 May Harriet Ritvo (MIT) When is a cow not a cow? When we think about animals in the 19th and 20th centuries, we notice two conflicting themes. Nineteenth -century breeders carefully policed the behaviour of their animals, in the interests of maintaining and enhancing quality. On the other hand, like many of their contemporaries, breeders were also attracted by quality of a very different, inconsistent kind: the Romantic cachet associated with wildness. The tension between these conflicting attractions produced divergent experiences for cattle and contrasti ng agendas for their proprietors; they also fuelled arguments in taxonomy about the degree of difference required for the recognition of separate species. These tensions continue to 108 shape and inspire efforts to restore lost landscapes and their vanished in habitants. This talk will explore these themes, considering the relationship between the constraints of domestication and an increasing appreciation for wildness. 13 May Luz Fernanda Azuela (Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico) Mexican science at the crossroads of French imperialism and Maximilian's empire (1864 -1867) Mexico, which had been an independent nation since 1821, suffered a colonial takeover by the French between 1864 and 1867. During these years Mexican science was torn between the colonia list aims of the Napoleon III and the Hapsburg Empire of Maximilian that the French Intervention had enabled. Maximilian agreed with local scholars on the urgent need for scientific institutions that would foster practical research to support material and cultural progress. His main objective was his r\u00e9gime's legitimation. Napoleon III, in contrast, wanted to boost France's presence in the Americas, and restrain the expansionism of the United States. Both agreed on the need to exploit Mexican resources by p romoting natural history, geography, geology and medicine. Local advances in those disciplines had been pursued for over three centuries, a tradition of research practically unknown in Europe. This led to a distorted appreciation of Mexican scholarship and qualifications, especially from the French Scientific Commission. Conversely, Maximilian engaged with the local scientific community on several projects, whose excellence contradicted the French evaluation of their expertise. This paper aims to explain the dismissal of Mexican scientific capabilities by the invaders, even when local insight and scholarship proved to be instrumental in achieving the foreigners' goals. It will also point out the asymmetric nature of the conditions in which their collaborat ion took place, as an expression of imperial subjugation and eurocentrism. And it will echo Kapil Raj's statements on the reconfiguration of 'existing knowledges and specialized practices on both sides of the encounter'. Friday 17 May Cabinet Excursion: J ohn Clare Cottage, Swaddywell Pit and Helpston Village Church We will be visiting the village of Helpston, the home of poet, farm labourer and naturalist John Clare (1793 -1864). We will begin by exploring his cottage and garden, before walking or driving about a mile to a local nature reserve, Swaddywell Pit. In addition to viewing its beautiful orchids and hearing about its geological history, we will learn about the site's connection with John Clare through his criticism of the enclosure movement. We wil l then receive a guided tour of the local medieval church, where Clare and his parents are buried. We will depart from the Department at 10am and return to Cambridge by 5pm. Cabinet will provide transport and lunch. Due to the capacity of the minibuses, places will be limited to 18 participants. RSVP to Laura Brassington (lb685). 20 May James Ryan (Victoria & Albert Museum/University of Exeter) Men of eminence: science, photography and biography in the self -fashioning of Robert Hunt in 19th-century England This paper considers the way the one Victorian man of science - Robert Hunt (1807 -1887) - employed biography and the photographic portrait in his wider self -fashioning. A chemist, experimental researcher on light and photography, folk lorist, geologist and writer, Hunt manoeuvred his way from humble beginnings in Devon and Cornwall to the relative heights of metropolitan science in mid -19th century London. He used his talents in chemistry, photography and writing, together with support from powerful patrons, to enter the world of science and social respectability. He is a good example of men who, through their talents, exertions and institutional networks, forged 109 careers in professional science in this period. Like many such men, Hunt la cked the gentlemanly background that had hitherto dominated the world of science. While Hunt's experiments in genres of science writing and his romantic geological interests have recently received scholarly attention, notably from historian of science Mela nie Keane, the connections between his literary exertions and his experiments in visual culture have been little studied. This paper considers Robert Hunt's own photographic image and how he used the art of biography to write himself into the history of sc ience. It pays particular attention to Hunt's work in one particular experimental photographic and biographical publication: photographic portraits of men of eminence in literature, science and art, with biographical memoirs, published in six volumes from 1863 to 1867, with photographs by Ernest Edwards, edited by Lovell Augustus Reeve (1814 -1865) and E. Walford. In doing so the paper seeks to open up questions about the significance of the photographic portrait and biography in the cultural framing of scie ntific, gender and class identities in mid -19th century Britain. Friday 14 June Garden Party, 1-3pm, Caius Fellows' Garden Nick Jardine (HPS, Cambridge) Fungi and feelings Dramatic pronouncements have been made about the transformative impacts of fungi o n human history. My focus will be on the forms of anachronism involved in claims about the foundational roles of the hallucinogenic Fly Agaric in world religions. I shall suggest that these claims are distorted by affective anachronism, inappropriate proje ction onto past agents of our own feelings, concerns and attitudes, this being a form of anachronism that is especially insidious given historians' need to understand and convey past experiences and values. AD HOC AD HOC (Association for the Discussion of the History of Chemistry) is a group dedicated to the history of chemistry. While our main focus is historical, we also consider the philosophical, sociological, public and educational dimensions of chemistry. The group meets on Mondays at 5pm in Seminar Room 1 . Coordinated by Hasok Chang, and funded by the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry (SHAC). 29 April Robin Hendry (Durham University) Trusting atoms 13 May Joe Martin (HPS, Cambridge) Who made the makers? How materials science happened 10 June Special joint session with the Science and Literature Reading Group , co-hosted by Melanie Keene and Hasok Chang The Periodic Table by Primo Levi CamPoS CamPoS (Cambridge Philoso phy of Science) is a network of academics and students working in the philosophy of science in various parts of the University of Cambridge, including the Department of History and Philosophy of Science and the Faculty of Philosophy. The Wednesday afternoo n seminar series features current research by CamPoS members as well as visitors to Cambridge and scholars based in nearby institutions. If you are interested in presenting in the series, please contact Matt Farr (mwef2). If you have any queries or suggest ions for other activities that CamPoS could undertake, please contact Huw Price, Jeremy Butterfield or Anna Alexandrova. Seminars are held on Wednesdays, 1.00 -2.30pm in Seminar Room 2. 110 8 May Riana Betzler (HPS, Cambridge) Follow the measures: conceptualiza tion, measurement and interdisciplinarity in the science of empathy Questions about how empathy should be conceptualized have long been a preoccupation of the field of empathy research. There are several definitions of empathy currently in circulation, as well as significant overlap between empathy and related concepts, such as sympathy, compassion, perspective -taking and mind -reading. This conceptual diversity is widely acknowledged and generally taken to be a problem that needs to be solved. In this pape r, I argue that although there is vast and seemingly intractable disagreement about the meaning of 'empathy' in the psychological and cognitive neuroscience literature on it - as evidenced by stated definitions and conceptualizations - researchers working in the field seldom rely on those stated definitions and instead work within certain experimental 'paradigms' characterized by the use of established measures. Continuity and stability comes from the use of those established measures while progress comes f rom expansion upon those measures. Stated concepts respond flexibly and not always in step with the evolution of research methodologies. By following the measures rather than the stated definitions, we can get clearer on the target(s) of empirical empathy research. Towards the end of the talk, I consider how this 'follow the measures' approach fares when considering interdisciplinary research and the special problems interdisciplinarity might pose. 15 May Aaron Hanlon (Colby College) Early modern history of data and epistemology of form This talk examines several contexts in which the word 'data' entered the English language in the 17th century, and how the usage contexts of the term evolved over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries. A parall el discussion will consider the various forms of evidence privileged within and sometimes across different knowledge domains during the same historical period: Robert Hooke's illustrations, William Petty's interpolated figures, Joseph Priestley's charts, M argaret Cavendish's narrative structures, Abraham Cowley's verse, and others. The talk will address the question of why 'data' was used to describe some forms of evidence and not others as the concept took on life in early modern Britain, as well as why so me forms of evidence carried more epistemological weight than others. This history of 'data' and forms of evidence will then (I hope!) provide a useful context for examining various ongoing assumptions about the credibility of some forms of evidence over others. 22 May Darrell Rowbottom (Lingnan University) Does science progress? HPS C\u00e9line Henne and Bobby Vos (Philoso phy workshops) HPS Workshop seeks to break the isolation of graduate research and encourage collaborative thinking by allowing students to present work in progress in a supportive seminar environment. The workshops will have alternate sessions focusing on Philosophy and History, but interdisciplinary presentations are always welcome. After each seminar, we will head to a local pub. Students are invited to present on any aspect of their research that they are grappling with or desire feedback on, including: Unpacking complicated sources, concepts, or archives 111 Presenting drafts of chapters, conference papers, or publications Proposing new ideas or strategies towards HPS research The session is comprised of two parts: 20 minutes where the speaker outlines their work in progress (indicating areas that they would like feedback to be based upon) and 40 minutes of discussion. Students interested in presenting in a Philosophy workshop should contact Bobby Vos (bfmv2). Those interested in presenting in a History workshop can contact Peter Rees (pr381).
