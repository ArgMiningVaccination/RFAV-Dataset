Introduction 1.1. Description of the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) or combinations thereof flower (Malvae sylvestris flos) the whole or fragmented dried flower of Malva sylvestris L. or its cultivated varieties. The flower consists of an epicalyx with 3 oblong or elliptical- lanceolate parts that are shorter than those of the calyx and situated immediately below it; a calyx with 5 pubescent triangular lobes, gamosepalous at the bas e; a corolla 3 -4 times longer than the calyx with 5 wedge- shaped, notched petals fused to the staminal tube at their base; numerous stamens, the filaments of which fuse into a staminal tube covered by small star -shaped trichomes and occasional simple trich omes visible numerous wrinkled carpels, glabrous or sometimes pubescent, enclosed in the staminal tube and arranged into a circ le around a central style ending with numerous filiform stigmas. In cultivated varieties, the epicalyx is 3 -7 parti te, the calyx 5 -8 partite and species, folium Mallow leaf (Malvae folium) represents whole or fragmented, dried leaf of Ma lva sylvestris L., Malva neglecta Wallr. or a mixture of both species. The leaves of M. sylvestris are up to 12 cm long and up to 15 cm wide with 3, 5 or 7 lobes and sinuate at the base; the leaves of M. neglecta are up to 9 cm long and wide, round or kidn ey-shaped with 5- 7 indistinct lobes. The leaves of both species have irregular dentate margins and are green or brownish -green. The abaxial surface of the lamina bears more hairs and shows a more prominent venation than the adaxial surface. The major vein s on the upper surface of the leaves and the petioles may be violet. The petioles are as long as the leaves, up to 2 mm wide, rounded and somewhat f lattened , longitudinally slightly grooved, green or brownish -green or violet. The fragmented drug consists o f occasionally agglomerated, crumpled pieces of leaves showing prominent veins (European Pharmacopoeia edition, 2391) . Herbal preparation(s) Malvae sylvestris flos Comminuted herbal substance as herbal tea for oral use or for infusion or decoction preparation for oromucosal use. Malvae, folium Comminuted herbal substance as herbal tea for oral use or for infusion or decoction preparation for oromucosal use. Assessment report on found in Malvae sylvestris flowers: Mucilage polysaccharides The basic structural unit of polysaccharides consisting of glucose, galactose and rhamnose occurs in different proportions in both flowers and leaves of Malva sylvestris . It appears that high molecular weight acid polysaccharides are responsible for the viscosity and increase of the swelling index in aqueous solutions. About 10% of mucilage is present in flowers. Classen and Blaschek (1998) in: Flores (20 11), apek (1992), apek and Kardoova (1995) and apek et al. (1999) isolated four polysaccharides from the flowers of Malva sylvestris L. sp.: a linear neutral polysaccharide, a branched neutral polysaccharide, high molecular weight acid polysaccharides and a very branched acidic polysaccharide. The molecular weight of the high molecular weight acidic polysaccharide was in the range of 1.6 x 106 Da. It consisted mainly of glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, rhamnose and galactose. The and glucuronic , in Malva sylvestris is higher in flowers (22.8%) than in leaves (8.2%). apek et al. (1999) isolated from Malva sylvestris sp. mauritiana a neutral heteropolysaccharide with relative molecular weight 3.71 x 106. It consisted of the dominant compound L -rhamnose (42%) followed by L -arabinose (34.3%), D -galactose (23.4%) and traces of D -mannose, D -xylose and L - fucose. The investigations indicated a branched structure of the polysaccharide with 3 .6-linked D - galactop yranose, 5 -linked L -arabinofuranose as well as 4 -linked and terminal L -rhamnopyranose residues as the main building units. Hydrolysis of the mucus polysaccharides results in the release of neutral sugars: glucose, arabinose, xylose and rhamnose (H\u00e4nsel content rang ed from 0. 42 to 7.3% of dry matter (Farina et al. 1995; Takeda . 1989; Alesiani et al . 2007, Vadivel et al. 2016). Other constituents Other flavonoids The following al the main in M. sylvestris identified by Barros et al Additionally, quercetin acetyldihexoside, luteolin -, apigenin and as kaempferol hexoside and kaempferol acety lhexoside were Malvae sylvestris pelargonic acid, stearic acid, -linolenic acid (Loizzo et al. 2016). Other organic acids Other organic acids found by Pereira et al . 0.039% (w/w) of essential oil containing 143 volatile compounds was obtained from dried flowers . The essential oil c onsisted mainly of hexadecanoic E)- the most intense aroma - active compounds (Usami et al . 2013) . Carotenoids (Loizzo et al. 2016, Alesiani et al .2007, Redi et al. 2005) . Chlorophyl A and B (Redi al Tocopherols (Barros et al . 2010) found in Malvae sylvestris leaves: Mucilage polysaccharides Malva leaves contain about 6 to 8% of mucilage according to Wichtl (2004) and Gruenwald et al. (2000). High molecular weight acidic polysaccharides located in epidermal cells of the leaves were found to be of the rhamnogalacturonan type. The weight of the high molecular weight acid polysaccharides of leaves of Malva sylvestris is 1.38 x 106 Da wit h the same basic structural unit consisting of glucose, galactose and rhamnose as in flowers (Classen and Blaschek 1998, in Flores 2011). A mucilage was isolated from the fresh leaves of Malva sylvestris Mill. var . mauritiana in which main constituent is acidic polysaccharide with molecular weight about 6.0x10 6. Quantitative analyses showed that this polysaccharide was composed of 94.4% polysaccharide and 5 % L-rhamnose, 22.2% D -galacturonic acid and 16 % D- glucuronic acid in the molar ratio 6:3:2:2 (Tomoda et al ., 1989). Samavati and Manoochehrizade (2013) crude polysaccharides from the leaves of Malva sylvestris . The experimental yield of polysaccharides was 8.38\u00b10.38%. Go nda et al. (1990) isolated from the leaves of Malva sylvestris. L, var. mauritiana Mill. an acidic polysaccharide with molecular weight of 11 000 Da, composed of L - rhamnose, D -galactose, D -galacturonic acid, and D -glucuronic acid in the molar ratio of 22:6:22:11 and containing 7.7 % peptide. Other constituents Phenolic derivatives The total phenolic compounds were found to be 386.5 mg/g in the leaves (Barros et a l. 2010). Polyphenols Presence of the following polyphenols is reported in the literature so urces: 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 4 methoxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxy- 3-methoxybenzoic acid, 2 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 4 2 methoxybenzoic 4 -hydroxybenzyl alcohol, 4 -hydroxydi hydrocinnamic 4 -hydroxy- 3 4 acid and tyrosol (Cutillo al . 2006), chlorogenic acid (in herb ) (Terninko et al. Flavonoids The presence of sulphate -8-O--D-glucoside (gossypin) an d hypolaetin 3- sulphate the followed by hypolaetin 4 -methyl ether 8- O-D-glucuronopyranoside, hypolaetin was (Billeter et al 1991, and Buddrus 1981). Luteolin, rutin, epic atechin were found kampferol myricetin w ere identified by Alesiani et 2007 al. (2014), 5,7- dimethoxycoumarin by Alesiani et al.

Another species distributed in the same regions is M alva neglecta (neglected mallow) which is also used as a source of leaves for medical purposes. In ancient times, the plant was used by the Greeks and Romans for its emollient and laxatives properties. In current medical practice M. sylvestris is used in a variety of inflammatory conditions. In the Mediterranean area, young leaves and stems are eaten in soups and salads either as raw or as cooked vegetables. Besides use in inflammation of the mouth and throat when is applied in a form of infusions, decoctions as a herbal tea or a gargle, cutaneous use for treatment of cuts, infected wounds and skin burns in a form of poultices and lotions is described in literature (Barros et al . 2010). The medicinal use of Malva sylvestris leaves and flowers has been documen ted continuously in several pharmacopoeias: the first information about mallow flowers in Poland is included in Materia Pharmaceutica of \" flores mucilaginei\" . Also , in the pharmaceutical lexicon published at the turn of the 19th and 20th century flowers of Malva sylvestris are listed (Wiorog\u00f3rski and Zajczkowski \" is DAB 1947) presents common mallow flowers and leaves. Malvae folium and flos was in the in the Czechoslovak Pharmacopoeia first edition 1947, in Austrian Pharmacopoeia (\u00d6sterreichisches Arzneibuch mallow leaf (2391). Mallow is traditionally used due to high mucilage content for treatment of the symptoms of oral or pharyngeal irritations, associated dry cough and gastrointestinal discomfort. In current folk medical practice in Italy Malva sylvestris use is widely used, where a large number of ethnobotanical information from comes . Decoctions of the leaves are used locally in inflammation of the mouth in the region of the northern Italian Ligurian Alps (Cornara et a l. 2014). In Valvestino, near Lake Garda also the frequent use of Malva neglecta was notified (Vitalini et al . 2009). use both Malva sylvestris and recorded as laxative, emollient decoction on wounds and sores (Vitalini et al . 2015). In central Italy, decoctions of aerial parts are used as a laxative and topically applied to the cheek or directly into aching teeth (Guarrera et al. 2005). In the central Appenine area Malva sylvestris leaves, flowers and whole aerial parts are used in bronchitis, sore throat and cough. Aerial parts are applied to aching teeth as analgesic and as a mouthwash (Idolo et al . 2010). In Abruzzo, the plant leaves and flowers are used as emollient, expectorant, diuretic and mild laxative for children (Leporatti and Corradi 2001). In Campania, both aerial parts and leaves are used in throat inflammation, bronchitis and cough (Di Novella et al. 2013; Menale and Muoio 2014; Menale et ., 2016). In southern Italy in Basilicata Region decoctions of aerial flowering parts are used as a mild laxative, against flu, cold and stomach ache (Montesano et al . 2012; Quave et al . 2008 a). In the south of Italy, in the region of Calabria , mallow leaves and flowers in infusions and dec octions are used both locally and systemically in mouth inflammation, toothache as mouthwashes, gargles and as a laxative (Leporatti and Impieri 2007; Passalacqua et al . 2007).

Indication 2) Traditional herbal medicinal product used as a demulcent preparation for the symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort. The topical use is mentioned in several literature sources (H\u00e4nsel et al . 1994; Gruenwald et al al. 1976) ; Wichtl 1984; 1994; Wurzer for Malvae flos and Malvae folium are described to be used in the form of poultices and/or as batch additive; however, no sufficient information on the preparations has been found. Macerate preparation is mentioned in several literature sources. However, information on maceration time differs significantly. Taking into consideration risk of microbial contamination long maceration cannot be recommended and therefore macerate preparation is not included in the monograph. Although historically lower and higher posologies for comminuted herbal substance have been documented, the proposed posology reflects currently applied dosages. Based on the literature data and information received from the Member States, the following posologies are suggested for comminuted herbal substance: Malva sylvestris L. flos Oral use Indication 1) and 2) Adolescents, adults and elderly 1-2 g of the com minuted herbal substance in 250 ml of boiling water as a herbal infusion or in 250 ml of water as a decoction 2 -3 times daily Average daily dose: 5 g Oromucosal use Indication 1) Adolescents, adults and elderly Herbal tea: 1 -2 g of the comminuted herbal substance in 250 ml of boi ling water as a herbal infusion or in 250 ml of water as a decoction 2 -3 times daily Average daily dose: 5 g.

Primary pharmacodynamics 3.1.1.1. Antitussive effects Flowers In vivo experiment and acidic polysaccharide fraction Assessment experiments performed by Nosalova et al . (2005) a mucilage and an acidic polysaccharide fraction (consisting of rhamnogalacturonan) isolated from mallow flowers ( Malva mauritiana) were administered orally to cats at a dose of 50 mg /kg (without an aesthesia). Antitussive effect of the polysaccharides was evaluated by surgically implanted chronic endotracheal cannula into the trachea. It served not only to register the pressure on electromanomet er but also to the irritation of the airway mucous membrane in the desired areas: laryngopharyngeal and tracheobr onchial. These areas were five times stimulated mechanically with nylon fibre and then monitored prior to application of the tested substance as a control value and after 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 hours after the administration of the polysaccharides. Both mucilage and rhamnogalacturonan fraction significantly diminished the number of incidents of cough and its intensity (during inhalation and exhalation). Mucilage decreased frequency of cough, mostly in the laryngopharyngeal area, while the fraction of rhamnogalactu ronan was effective in both areas, also in the trachea and bronchi and resulted in antitussive effects 15% higher than that of the mucilage. Moreover, only a rhamnogalacturonian fraction had an inhibitory effect on the maximum intensity of coughing. The effects of the application of mucilage rhamnogalacturonan fraction and reduction of the number of cough events were compared with the effect of non -narcotic peripherally drug - codeine phosphate (10 mg/kg). Both mucilage substances have had greater inhibitory activity than prenoxdiazine and dropropizine but less than codeine. Depression of respiratory activity, typical of narcotic antitussive drugs was not notified during the experiments with Malva sylvestris mucilaginous substances. 3.1.1.2. Antiinflammatory effects Flowers In vitro experiments Water extract Seiberg et al. (2006) tested the effect of the water extrac ts of Malvae sylvestris flower on enhancing production of the mucus . The a uthors described the effects of the extract on cell cultures tran siently transfected the elastin promoter -luciferase reporter construct, driving the firefly lucifera se gene. The extracts were added to the transfected cells and incubated for 48 hours. An increase i n elastin promoter activity was observed in the presence of increasing doses of the extract (2. 5% an d 5%), as compared to untreated cells. Protection from metalloproteinase degradation was also investigate d: Matrix Metalloproteinase -12 (MMP- 12), also named human macrophage elastase activity was inhibited by water extract in a dose dependent manner. The concentration of the Malvae sylvestris extract as low as 0.6% resulted in approximately 23% reduction in MMP -122 activity, while 5% of extrac t inhibited MMP -12 activity for 80%. This shows that Malva sylvestris flowers water extract can prote ct elastin fiber s from damage and degradation (Seiberg et al . 2006). In vivo experiment s Hydro -alcoholic extract Nasiri et al. (2015) studied activity of topical application of Malvae sylvestris flowers ethanolic extract on second degree burn injury and wounds in rats. Ethanol (70% V/V) wa s added to the powdered flowers and the hydro alcoholic extract of herbal flowers was drie d afterwards to a powder to yield of 9.68% w/w. In experiment 5% (control) and standard silver sulfadiazine 1% were used in rats burned wi th hot metal plate. Wound area, percentage of wound contraction, and histological and bacteriological assessments were evaluated. Assessment report on Malva L. improved histological changes of tissue c omponents in the process of healing when compared with silver sulfadiazine cream. Water extract Afshar et al. (2015) investigated the effects of topical administration of the mallow flowers aqueous extract on cutaneous wound healing in BALB/c mice. Experim ental animals were divided into three groups: the first, second and third group received topical administration of M alvae sylvestris 1% water extract in cream, silver sulfadiazine topical cream and cold cream (positive and negati ve control groups), respectively. On days 4, 7 and 10 wound healing was evalua ted histopathologically. On the 10th day of the experiment, the Malva sylvestris treated mice showed si gnificantly less fibrosis, less scar formation, and fewer hair follicles damage. The number of inflammatory cells in M alvae sylvestris and silver sulfadiazine treated groups were significantly lower than in the control group. Leaves In vitro experiments Ethanolic extract Ethanolic extract ( obtained by mixing 1 part of herbal drug with 6 parts ethanol, for 7 days)of dried leaves of Malva sylvestris was tested for anti- inflammatory activity by Martins et al . (2014). In desferrioxamine- stimulated phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate -differentiated culture of U937 cells influence of the M. sylvestris extract on release of the pro -inflammatory mediators prostaglandi ns PGE 2 and PGD 2 was measured. They mediate acute and chronic inflammatory responses associated with vasodilatation, fever, pa in, and edema. U937- d cells are estimated as an appropriate model to mimic the oral cavity inflammations, against which Malva sylvestris is mainly used. U937- d cells were treated Malva sylvestris ethanolic extract at 10.0 and 50.0 g/mL. dose -dependent reduction of PGE 2 and PGD 2 levels using (10.74\u00b1 respectively). The anti-inflammatory activity attributed to Malva sylvestris may b e dependent on the reduction of as pro -inflammatory mediators . Ethanolic, chloroform and extracts (2015) investigated anti -inflammatory activity of Malva sylvestris extracts in the model mimicking the periodontal structure infected by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. An in vitro dual-chamber model to mimic the peri odontal structure was developed, using a monolayer of epithelial keratinocytes and a subepithelial layer of fibroblasts. The periodontopathogen A. actinomycetemcomitans was applied to migrate through the cell lay ers and to induce the synthesis of immune factors and cytokines in the host cells. Ethanolic extract ( prepared by mixing 8 parts of absolute etha nol) with 1 part of herbal drug and the lyophilized ) (MSE) of the leaves of Malva sylvestris was successively partitioned using liquid -liquid extract ion with hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate. The final residue obtained after ethyl acetate fractionation was totally soluble in water and thus was called the aqueous fraction (AF). The extract (MSE), chloroform fraction (CLF) and aqueous fraction were resuspended in 1% ethanol and used in the biological assays. The extract minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 175 g/mL, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) chloroform fraction (MIC g/mL, MBC 250 g/mL) were found that both MSE and CLF had inhibitory influence on the all four microorganisms tested. CLF was the most potent, and most effective in reducing the bacterial colonization (p < 0.05) with a MIC against A. actinomycetemcomitans of 150 g/mL, a MIC against F. nucl eatum of 500 g/mL and a MIC against P. intermedia of 125 g/mL. The Assessm ent had the lowest MIC against P. gingivalis (15.6 g/ml compared to the positive control 10 g/mL). Moreover, CLF promoted the down -regulation IL-10, CD14, PTGS, MMP -1 and FOS as well the reduction of the IL -1beta, IL -6, IL-8 and GM -CSF protein levels (p < 0.05). In vivo experiment Water extract Chiclana et al. (2009) studied topical antiinflammatory activity of Malva sylvestris L. leaves water extract on carragenin -induced hind paw oedema in rats. A decoction was prepared from 50 g of mallow leaves (yielding extract 50% ). From this extract creams were prepared at 5, 10 and 20% v/w of the extract as a water -soluble cream base. A significative inhibition of edema was obtained with the 5% malva cream compared to placebo, and the effect of mallow extract was higher than that of a 2% indomethacin cream. Hydro alcoholic extract and isolated compounds Prudente et al. (2013) investigated the topical anti -inflammatory action of the hydroalcoholic extract of Malvae sylvestris leaves in vivo on a 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- acetate (TPA)- induced mous e ear oedema model in mice. Oedema was induced on the right ear by topical a pplication of 2.5 g perear of TPA dissolved in 20 l of acetone. Hydroalcoholic extract of Malvae dexamethasone (0.05 mg perear) which was used as a positive control. Th e extracts were dissolved in 2 l of acetone and topically applied immediately after TPA. The thi ckness of the ears was measured before and 6 h ours after induction of inflammation. Topical application of Malvae sylvestris hydroalcoholic extract inhibited ear inflammation and polymorphonuclear cells influx (myeloperoxydase activity -MPO) and interleukin -1b levels in the tissues. Malvidin 3 -glucoside was also able to inhibit ear oedema and leukocytes. The oedema reduction induced by the Malvae sylvestris extract exhibited a mean ID 50 value of 0.36 (0.14- 0.90) mg per ear, with inhibition of 77 \u00b16% (3 mg perear), while malvidin 3 -glucoside caused in oedema of 90\u00b1 3% (0.2 mol perear) value of 0.003 (0.002- 0.004) mol per ear. The extract inhibited TPA increase of myeloperoxydase ac tivity in a dose dependent way: ID50=0.46 (0.3- 0.7) mg/ear and with inhibition of caused a reduction of 70\u00b15% of MPO in the tissue. The increase in the level of IL -1 in the ear was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by topical application of hydroalcoholic extract from Malva sylvestris, presenting a mean ID 50 value of 0.96 (0.92- 1.0) mg per ear and 74.2% of inhibition at 3 mg per ear. The inhibitory activity of dexamethasone was similar. The authors conclu de that hydroalcoholic extract from Malva sylvestris induces strong anti -inflammatory activity and probably malvidin 3 -glucoside is responsible for this effects. In vivo and in vitro experiments Water extract El Ghaoui et a l. (2008) studied the influence water extract of Malva sylvestris leaves on antibody production in mice immunized with egg albumin. The effect of this e xtract on interleukin -4 (IL-4), interleukin -12 (IL -12) and -interferon gene transcription were inves tigated. The extract was prepared by heating the leaves in distilled water until boiling and left to cool at room temperature. The decoction was filtered and lyophilized and solution (50 mg/mL ) was reconstitute d using distilled water. Mallow extract had no effect on anti -egg albumin antibody produ ction but enhanced IL -12 and interferon gene transcription. Authors conclude that Malva sylvestris extract promotes an inflammatory response Assessment report on L. induction of macrophages inducing them for production IL -12, which in turn activates Th1 lymphocytes which produce - interferon. Aerial parts (flowers and leaves) In vivo experiment s Water extract Sleiman and Daher (2009) investigated the aqueous extract of Malva sylvestris aerial parts in acute and chronic inflammation models induced by carrageenan and formalin in rats. Doses of 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg b.w. of the extract were used orally for 1 month . Significant anti- inflammatory activity was observed at most doses used with an optimum inhibition at 100 mg/kg b.w. (60% inhibition) in both models. In other experiment protection against ethanol- induced gastric ulcer was evaluated. After administration of the Malva sylvestris aqueous extract at the dose of 500 mg/kg b.w. the maximum protection (37%) was obtained, a value significantly higher than that observed with a reference drug cimetidine (where it reached 30%) . N-hexane, ethanol and water extracts Anti-inflammatory effects of different fractions of Malva sylvestris were evaluated in acetic acid - induced ulcerative colitis model in rats by Hamedi et al . (2016). A total of 200 g of powdered aerial parts was sequentially extracted with n -hexane, ethanol , and water (3 x1 L and 48 hours for each) at room temperature. The fractions were concentrated by a rotary evaporator at 40C and dried applying a speed vacuum dryer or a freeze dryer and kept at -200C. Colitis in male rats was induced by rectal instillation of a 4% solution of acetic acid. Animals were divided into 8 experimental groups (6 in each) as follows: Normal group : without induction of colitis that received normal saline solution rectally at the day of induction. Negative control group : with in duction of colitis that received distilled water orally. Positive control group : with induction of colitis that received prednisolone at dose 5 mg/kg perday orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group I : with induction of colitis that received aqueous fraction of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg per day orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group II : with induction of colitis that received ethanolic fraction of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg per day orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group III: with induction of colitis that received n -hexane fraction of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg perday orally prior to induction of colitis. Treatment group IV : with induction of colitis that rece ived the isolated polysaccharide of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg per day orally prior to induction of colitis. In groups I to IV treatment was performed for 5 days consecutively before induction of colitis. Treatment group V : with induction of colitis that received the isolated polysaccharide of Malva sylvestris at dose 200 mg/kg per day orally for 5 days after induction of colitis. Twenty -four hours after the last dose of the drug in treatment group V and 24 hours after induction of colitis in othe r groups, rats were subjected to autopsy. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of colitis showed that the aqueous fraction was very effective in preventing the inflammation and therapeutic effectiveness was lower for ethanolic and n -hexane fractions. Polysaccharide was effective in pretreatment reducing signs of inflammation. The protective effect of the water fraction of Malva sylvestris on reduction of microscopic and macroscopic parameters of colitis was significantly higher than prednisolone. Anti- inflammatory effects of the tested fractions in this study seem to be related to their polysaccharide and polyphenol content.

Secondary pharmacodynamics 3.1.2.1. Antimicrobial activity Flowers In vivo experiment Ethanolic extract Delaveau et al. (1980) administered to mice intraperitoneally the dry ethanolic extract(no further detail) of Malva sylvestris flowers in a dose of 50 mg/kg b.w. and registered an increase of survival of mice infected with Escherichia coli. This effect is attributed by the authors to the stimulation of phagocytic activity. Leaves In vitro experiment Water extra ct Quave et al. (2008 b) tested several i talian plants, including Malva sylvestris for inhibition of growth and biofilms in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Water extract of Malva sylvestris was made by boiling 1 g (plant material) in 50 ml water for 30 minutes. It was found, that biofilm formation by the water extract was inhibited at concentration of IC 50=32 g/ml. Aerial parts In vitro experiment s N-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic extracts Razavi et of Malva sylvestris n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic flower and leaves extracts using disk diffusion method. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the extracts were estimated against erichia The MICs of the extracts against the test microorganisms were determined by the agar dilution method. It was found, Assessment report on that both flowers and leaves of M. sylvestris methanol extracts exhibited high antibacterial activity. These effects were compar ablewith effects of erythromycin, gentamycin and amphotericin. Decoction, infusion and assisted microwave extraction Mihaylova et al. (2015) studied different extracts of fresh Malva sylvestris assisted extraction leaves and flowers for their level of total phenolics, antimicrobial activity against Gram -positive, Gram - negative bacteria, molds and yeasts. Moreover, their antioxidant activities were investigated using --picrylhydra zyl -the change in absorbance owing to the formation of a blue coloured Fe (II) - tripyridyltriazine compound from colourless oxidized Fe (III) form), and CUPRAC (cupric reducing capacity) with use of Trolox as a standard and expressed as M of Trolox equivalent (TE)/g fresh weight . Fresh leaves and flowers of Malva sylve stris were subjected of three different types of extract ions: 1) decoction -extraction by boiling of the plant material for 30 min with distilled water; 2) infusion -extraction by boiling water and then pouring it over the plant material, allowing it to steep in the liquid for 20 minutes; 3) microwave assisted extraction - the experiments were performed with water as solvent. The extracts solutions were filtered before analyses. Antimicrobial activity against saprophytic and pathogenic micro organism s: Gram -positive ( cerevisiae ) was determined with the agar diffusion tests. Both flowers and leaves showed antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms . The flowers were found to be more active against pathogenic microorganisms. None of the tested extracts showed antifungal activity. Hydroalcoholic extract Cogo et al. (2010) evaluated antibacterial activity several plants, including the hydroalcoholic extract of inflorescence and leaves of Malva sylvestris against eleven clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori and two reference strains (H. pylori 26695 and J99) . All the strains against clarithromycin, amoxicillin, furazolidone, tetracycline and metronidazole. Disk diffusion test and determination of the miniumum inhibitory concentration were performed by the agar dilution method. Result s demonstrated that the extracts obtained from M. sylvestris L. were capable of inhibiting the in vitro growth of H. pylori in the range of 0.625 to 5.0 mg/ml. Chloroform, water and ethanolic extracts Zare et al. (2012) studied in vitro the antibacterial and antifung al activity of chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of the total aerial parts of Malva neglecta and Malva sylvestris . sylvestris and Malva neglecta extracts Experiments showed that all extracts were active against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. vulg aris. The ethanolic extract had the highest antibacterial activity compared to other solvents. Alcoholic extract Malvae sylvestris antifungal activity was evaluated in vitro against cultures of strains of C. albicans (ATCC minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Malva sylvestris 20% tincture was estimated. As positive control Nystatin 100,000 UI/ml was used. M. sylvestris tinctu re shown MIC at 25 mg/ml for C. krusei Assessment report on mg/ml for C. albicans and C. tropicalis. The authors concluded that antimicrobial activity of products based on M alva sylvestris support their clinical use in the formulations for mouthwashes. In vivo experi ment Hydroalcoholic extract Hydroalcoholic extract of the aerial parts of Malva sylvestris (prepared using 2 g herbal substance to 118 g extraction solvent: ethanol 96% V/V) diluted with sodium chloride 0.9% was investigated for antifungal activity in female NMRI mice by Hajyani and Modaresi (2016). Groups of mice received an i.p. injection of 1\u00d7106 cfu/ml (colony -forming unit) once to induce infection of Candida albicans ATCC 1677. Treatment groups received ten i.p. injections Malva sylvestris hydroalcoholic extract in 50, 100, 200 mg/kg doses for 20 days. Suspension of Candida albicans (1\u00d7106 cfu/ml) was injected between fifth and sixth injections of the extract. The study was carried out to investigate effects of Malva sylvestris extract on the number of viable fungal cells in a sample, plasma proteins and gamma interferon expression. Significant reduction in the amount of albumin in the three treatment groups was found . In turn, the amount of -globulin in groups receiving 50 to 100 mg/kg of the Malva sylvestris extract was significantly increased. Similarly, the amount of gamma interferon for all three treatment groups was also significantly increased when compared to the control group. The a uthors conclude that Malva sylvestris is able to stimulate an immune cellular response. 3.1.2.2. Antioxidant activity Aerial parts In vitro experiment s Water extract , isolated compounds The antioxidant activity of Malva sylvestris water extract was evaluated by Della Greca et al. (2009) by its capability to neutralize anionic DPPH and superoxide anion radicals and to give rise to formation of a phosphomolybdenum complex. The analysis of the water extract by applying the different chromatograph ic techniques resulted in the isolation of eleven compounds: 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 4 - methoxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxy- 3-methoxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, dienoic acid. The isolated compounds were present in the range of 0.3 to 3 g/g in M. sylvestris . The strongest antioxidant activities were noted for 4- hydroxycinnamic acid and a sesquiterpene, N- trans-feruloyl tyramine. Their antioxidant effects were significantly higher than sh owed by the positive standard, - tocopherol. All metabolites presented an anion superoxide radical scavenging activity 15% higher than tocopherol. Ethanolic and acetone extracts Beghdad et al. (2014) studied the constituents of the leaves , flowers , stems and seeds of mallow, Malva sylvestris L., as well as their antioxidant properties using in vitro methods. They used the ferric reducing antioxidant radical and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) based on the reduction of molybdenum (VI) to molybdenum (V). The concentration of phenolic compounds was higher in the extracts isolated from leaves (24.123\u00b1 0.718 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g dried weight) than in flowers (6.978\u00b10.602 mg of gallic acid equivalents). Similarly , the total flavonoids content was 5.694\u00b10.017 mg in the leaves and 0.170\u00b10.033 mg in the flowers (expressed as mg rutin equivalent per 100 g dried weight). Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. and/or Other authors also found a higher phenolic content in leaves than in flowers (Barros et al. 2010) . The evaluation of the antioxidant activity by three methods, including DPPH free radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) showed that ethyl acetate (AcOEt) and n-Butanol (n -BuOH) fractions of leaves have a highest values of antioxidant activity. Concerning DPPH inhibition (%), all the samples proved to have high antioxidant activities (between 98.52 and 62.01%) and the greatest EC 50 (the plant extract concentration of extract necessary t o decrease DPPH radical scavenging by 50%) obtained was that of extracts of flavonoids, especially ethyl acetate (AcOEt -EC50=3.10 mg/ml) showing the highest value of antioxidant activities for almost all parts of the plant . Antiradical activity define d as 1/EC 50 was for the leaves 0.059 and for the flowers 0.071% . At 750 g/ml, the most potent reducing agents were the flavonoid extracts from AcOET (43.110%) and n -BuOH (32.671%) fractions of leaves. In the phosphor molybdenum assay, the extracts exhibited some degree of activity in a dose dependent manner. It was generally observ ed that AcOEt fraction was more active than the n -BuOH fraction with DPPH and FRAP method. Comparison showed a higher antioxidant capacity to reduce molybdenum (VI) to molybdenum (V) reported for AcOEt fraction of leaves (0.138 \u00b10.006 mg of equivalent of ascorbic acid (EAA/g) and n -BuOH fraction of flower (0.118\u00b1 0.018 mg EAA/g) . The ethanol has been more efficient compared to the acetone solvent for extraction of antioxidants from leaf parts of M. sylvestris L. The ethanolic fraction has a better capacit y probably due to higher hydrogen -donating constituents extracted by the solvent. The authors are of the opinion that the increase in antioxidant activity may be explained by the increase of solvent polarity. 3.1.2.3. Other activities: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity Water extract and essential oil Ferreira et al. (2006) tested in vitro several Portuguese plants for AChE inhibitory activity, including aerial parts of Malva sylvestris. Essential oil, ethanolic extract (16.13 mg/mg of dried ethanolic extract, ethanol concentration not specified) and decoction (5 g/100 ml boiled for 20 minutes) were tested for their activity towards acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and their antiox idant activity. Decoction of Malva sylvestris in concentration of 5m g/ml inhibited activity of AChE by 25\u00b15.7%. The essential oil of aerial parts of Malva sylvestris in concentration of 0.1 mg/ml induced inhibition of AChE by 28.1 \u00b12.9%. Ethanolic extra did not had any inhibitory effect. Antinociceptive activity Esteves et al. (2009) evaluated in vivo the antinociceptive activity of the Malvae sylvestris leaves aqueous extract. Initially , the infusion of leaves (10% w/v) was lyophilized yielding 2.4% of aqueous extract. Experiments were performed on mice with use of writhing test, formalin -induced pain test, capsaicin -induced pain test and hot test. Intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg b.w. the aqueous extract induced significant antinociceptive activity in writhing test (76.4% of inhibition) and inhibition of the neurogenic (61.8%) and (46.6%) phases in the formalin model. In capsaicin -induced pain model, the aqueous extract was also effective with inhibition of 62.9%, but it did not cause significant activity against hot- plate model. The authors concluded that the results could suggest that the antinociception caused by aqueous extract is related to the inhib ition of prostaglandins synthesis pathway cyclooxygenase and unrelated to the stimulation of the opioid receptors. Assessment report on Malva activity Kaileh et al. (2007) have shown in vitro no cytotoxicity of Malva sylvestris aerial parts extract (extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol, 1: 1, V/V) on murine fibrosarcoma L929sA cells. Hepatoprotective activity Hussain et al. (2014) studied in vivo the hepatoprotective effects of the whole plant methanol extract of Malva sylvestris L. against paracetamol hepatotoxicity in mice. The whole plant was washed and air dried. . Dried powder (almost 2 kg) was soaked in 6 L of 95% methanol and was kept on a shaker for 7 consecutive days. After that, the extracts were separated by filtration and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator. The desired concentrations were obtained by dissolving the extract in physiological saline. Silymarin (100 mg /kg) was used as a comparator to analyze therapeutic effect s of Malva sylvestris. Two doses (300 and 600 mg kg) were administered i.p. for 7 consecutive days followed by i. p. injection with paracetamol (250 mg /kg). Paracetamol induced a significant increase of plasma levels of the liver enzymes as the liver damage markers: alanine aminotransferase, aspartate of Malva sylvestris significantly reduced elevated concentrations of the liver enzymes in a dose dependent manner. As a result of th e autopsy and histopathological examination of the liver tissue, paracetamol- treated group showed macrophages, plasma cell infiltration, vacuolization and cell necrosis. Treatment with Malva sylvestris followed by paracetamol administration showed few binu cleated cells while most cells were normal, with slight congestion, vacuolization, and infiltration and dose dependently restored normal histological pattern of the liver. In particular, hepatoprotective effect was observed at a dose of 600 mg/kg of the ex tract after which use no necrosis was evident. 3.1.3. Safety pharmacology No data available . 3.1.4. Pharmacodynamic interactions No data available. 3.1.5. Conclusions Available non -clinical data underline the plausibiliy of the traditional use of mallow flowers and leaves for the symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and gastroenteritis. The reported pharmacological effects are not considered contradictory to the oral and oromucosal traditional use of mallow preparations as a demulcent for the symptomatic treatment of irritations of oral and pharyngeal mucosa with associated dry cough and for symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort. None of the repor ted pharmacological studies constitute any cause for safety concern. 3.2.

Repeated dose toxicity No data available. 3.3.3. Genotoxicity No data available. 3.3.4. Carcinogenicity No data available . 3.3.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity No data available. 3.3.6. Local tolerance No data available. 3.3.7. Other special studies Conforti et al. (2008) evaluated the acute toxicity of the hydroalcoholic extracts of Mediterranean dietary plants, including Malva sylvestris. The Microtox acute toxicity test measures the decrease in light emission from the marine luminescent Vibrio fischeri bacteria when exposed to organic extracts. The test is applied in evaluating the toxicity of water soluble substances. The plant leaves were air dried and extracted with 70% aqueous ethanol through maceration (48 h ours for 3 times) at room temperature. The received extract was dried under reduced pressure. Initially the extract in ethanol 70%, with a concentration of 1 mg/ml, was diluted with the diluent solution to obtain both sample concentration and organic solvent concentration no higher than 1%. It was found, that Malva sylvestris , hydroalcoholic extract bioluminescence 5 min utes and 17.32% after 15 min utes of incubation. According to the guidelines ISO (ISO 11348/3, 1998) a toxic sample shows an effect percentage greater than 20%. This means that the hydroalcoholic extract of Malva sylvestris does not show toxicity under the established limit. 3.3.8. Conclusions No relevant data on single dose and repeated- dose toxicity are available. Tests on reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have not been found . Due to lack of genotoxicity data, a list entry for Malvae flos and Malvae folium cannot be recommended. 3.4. Overall conclusions on non -clinical data Despite of published non-clinical data on several activities of the extracts of Malvae flos, Malvae folium and aerial parts of Malva sylvestris , a direct correlation of the se results (type of extract, route of administration , in vitro vs. in vivo ) with the clinical situation is not possible. Results from relevant experimental studies are supportive for the traditional uses of the Malva sylvestris flower and leaves as an infusion/decoction for symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Specific data on pharmacokinetics and interactions are not available. Relevant t oxicological studies are not available. Tests on genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity have not been found. Oral administration and oromucosal use of mallow flowers and leaves infusions/decoctions can be regarded as safe at traditionally used small doses (maximum daily dose of 5 g for flowers and 5.4 g for leaves) and adequate duration of use. 4.

Overview of pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents No data available . 4.2. Clinical efficacy 4.2.1. Dose response studies No data available. 4.2.2. Clinical studies (case studies and clinical trials) Only o ne clinical study was found in the literature (Elsagh et al. 2015). Briefly, Elsagh et al. (2015) described a placebo -controlled randomized clinical trial in adult patients with functional constipation treated with Malva sylvestris flowers aqueous syrup. A total 110 patients participated and started the medication (55 in verum and 55 in placebo group). Preparation of the M. sylvestris flower syrup was done in the Herbal Medicine Laboratory of the Shahid Beheshti School of Pharmacy ( Tehran, Iran). One liter of boiled water (1000C) was added to 100 mg of dry flowers for 4 hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum and sugar solution 50% was added to the extract (50 mg of the extract in each 1 cm3 of the syrup). Herb -to-extract ratio was then 6:1. Patients in the verum group received treatment for 4 weeks, 1 g of extract perday equivalent to 10 cm3 of the syrup twice daily (2 -3 hours after breakfast and lunch). The frequency of defecation per week and frequency of hard stoo l, straining during defecation, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and manual maneuvers to facilitate evacuation Assessment report on Malva sylvestris L. 35/38 were rated. An improvement or worsening in each symptom was assessed (self -rated) at the end of therapy by telephone interview. The primary ou tcome of the study was the changes in defecation and constipation symptoms' frequency after treatment. Changes in stool consistency, overall self -reported improvement in symptoms after treatment, and adverse effects were estimated as the secondary outcome. Comparisons between the two groups were performed with the t -Test, Mann -Whitney U Test, and Chi -Square (or Fisher's Exact) Test. ANOVA with repeated measures test for assessing time effect, treatment effect, and interaction between time and treatment was used. All data were analy sed on the intention -to treat rules. The author's reported that after 4 weeks treatment an increase in defecation frequency was observed (F =18.8, p < 0.001) and more decrease in frequency of all constipation symptoms (F =16.5 to 25.3, all p values < 0.001). The verum group experienced also more reduction in frequency of hard stool forms (45.4% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.001) and reported more improvement in all symptoms (all p values < 0.01) compared to placebo. Side effects occurred i n a few patients from the verum group. In 4 patients diarrhoea has been seen, in 4 patients acid regurgitation was observed, 2 patients experienced nausea and individual patients seen worse constipation, epigastric pain, heartburn and urticaria. Assessor comment: In the study by Elsagh et al. 2015, a M. sylvestris flower syrup preparation was administered to patients with constipation. There are no medicinal products with this herbal preparation used for the treatment of constipation on the EU market. Ther efore, the study cannot be taken into consideration for the establishment of a well- establish use monograph. 4.3. Clinical studies in special populations (e.g. elderly and children) No data available. 4.4. Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology and efficacy There are no published clinical studies on Malvae folium or Malvae sylvestris flos where the active substances of the medicinal product have been in medicinal use within the EU for at least ten years. Well-establish use in accordance with Article 10a of Dire ctive 2001/83/EC is considered not fulfilled folium or sylvestris flos. 5. Clinical Safety/Pharmacovigilance 5.1. Overview of toxicological/safety data from clinical trials in humans No data available. 5.2. Patient exposure Mallow leav es are traditionally used for food purposes in the countries of the Mediterranean basin: in Portugal, Italy and Turkey young leaves are eaten raw in a salad or are cooked as a vegetable. Unripe fruits are eaten raw (Prudente et al . 2013). 5.3. Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths In a placebo -controlled randomized clinical trial in adult patients with functional constipation treated with Malva sylvestris flowers aqueous syrup there w ere a few and moderate side effects. Out of 55 treated patients in 4 patients diarrhoea has been seen, in 4 patients acid regurgitation was observed, 2 Assessment report on Malva experienced nausea and individual patients worse constipation, epigastric pain, heartburn and ur ticaria (Elsagh et al .2015). Literature describes two cases of acute liver and kidney damage, after oral consumption of Malva sylvestris and Malva sylvestris var. grandiflora . In both cases, the patients ate the mallow as a meal, and the nature of organ da mage was acute. Fulminant liver failure and renal failure (Akta et al. 2014) were reported as fatal in a 36 -year-old female patient . Laboratory findings at admission were bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL. Prothrombin time was prolonged to 18 seconds. The case of liver injury associated with Malva grandifolia in 59-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension was described by Ekiz et al. (2010). The woman with history of dyspepsia and long term hypertension treatment drunk Malva grandifolia juice (250 ml per day) for 4 weeks to control dyspeptic symptoms. Her laboratory data were as follows on admission: was notable for liver injury damage. A lbumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time were normal. After stopping drinking the juice, liver enzymes normalized quickly and were within normal limits after 10 days from admission. In both above mentioned case reports the exact amount of mallow consumed as a vegetable was unknown, detailed species were not precisely specified, and the clinical toxicological diagnosis is missing. The causal relationship could not be confirmed. 5.4. Laboratory findings No data available . 5.5. Safety in special populations and situations 5.5.1. Use in children and adolescents Particular use in children has not been reported. 5.5.2. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance . 5.5.3. Special Warnings and precautions for use Indication 1) If dyspnoea, fever or purulent sputum occurs during the use of the medicinal product, a doctor or a qualified health care practitioner should be consulted. Indication 1) and 2) The use in children and adolescent under 12 years of age has not been established due to lack of adequate data . Assessment report on Malva interac and other forms of interaction No data available. 5.5.5. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Safety during pregnancy has not been established. In the absence of sufficient data, the use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended. No fertility data ava ilable. 5.5.6. Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. 5.5.7. Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability No studies on the ability to drive or operate machinery have been performed. 5.5.8. Safety in other special situations Not applicable . 5.6. Overall conclusions on clinical safety Recently, scientific literature describes two cases of poisoning of mallow consumed as food. However, there is no scientific confirmation of its toxicity when used in specified strength/posology and route of administration in the therapeutic indications proposed in the European Union monograph. The experimental toxicological data are limited but given the history of long -term and present use in humans, also as food, it seems that there are no safety concern s for the oral or oromucosal use of preparations of common mallow. 6. Overall conclusions (benefit -risk assessment) There are no published clinical studies on Malvae folium or Malvae sylvestris flos where the active substances of the medicinal product have be en in medicinal use within the EU for at least ten years. Well-establish use in accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC is considered not fulfilled for Malvae folium or Malvae sylvestris flos. The traditional medicinal use of mallow flowers and leaves has been documented in several medicinal handbooks with indications consistent with the existing pertinent pharmacological experiments performed in vitro and in vivo and it is substantiated by the presence of medicinal products on the European market. The traditional use of mal low preparations (Malva sylvestris L., flos and Malva sylvestris L., a mixture of both species, folium) fulfils the requirement for at least 30 years of medicinal use at a specified strength and specified posology, according to Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. All the requirements for traditional use (self-medication character, specified strength/posology, appropriate route of administration, period of traditional use, plausibility and safety) are met. Assessment report on Malva sylvestris and/or 38/38 The relevant toxicological data are not available but given the history of long -term and present use in humans, also as food, it seems that there are no safety concerns for the oral or oromucosal use of preparations of common mallow in the doses proposed in the monograph. The following indications and posologies are proposed for the European Union monographs: Malva sylvestris, L., flos Indication 1) Traditional herbal medicinal product used as a demulcent preparation for the symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and Indication 2) Traditional herbal medicinal product used as a demulcent preparation for the for the symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Posology for adults and adolescents over 12 years: single dose: 1 -2 g of the comminuted herbal substance in 250 ml of water as a herbal tea for oral use (indication 1 and 2) or as a herbal infusion or as a decoction for oromucosal use 2 -3 times daily ( indication 1 ); average daily dose: 5 g. Malva sylvestris L. and/or Malva neglecta Wallr., folium Traditional herbal medicinal product used as a demulcent preparation for the symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough an d for the symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Posology for adults and adolescents over 12 years: single dose: 1.8 g of the comminuted herbal substance in 150 ml of water as a herbal tea for oral use (indication 1 and 2) or as a herbal infusion or as a decoction for oromucosal use 3 times daily ( indication 1 ); daily dose: 5.4 g. The therapeutic areas for browse search with traditional use indications are: ' cough and cold ' and 'gastrointestinal disorders '. As a general precaution related to the therapeutic indication for symptomatic treatment of oral or pharyngeal irritation, associated dry cough and gastrointestinal discomfort, the product information should include a warning text advising the patient to consult a doctor or a qualified health care practitioner if the symptoms worsen or persist longer than 1 week during the use of the product for indication 1) and 2 weeks for indication 2) . Malvae flos and Malvae folium cannot be recommended for oral use in children und er 12 years of age due to lack of adequate data. Safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. In the absence of sufficient data, the use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended. No data on fertility is available. No constituent with known therapeutic activity or active marker can be recognised by the HMPC. Tests on genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity are not available . A European Union list entry is not supported due to lack of data on genotoxicity. Annex List of references "}
