Our original guided meditation incorporates painting and music to encourage mindfulness and to help you achieve inner equilibrium. In this space, \"mindfulness\" is about being present and feeling connection between your heart, your mind and your spirit. We allow our inner child to express, and we call our higher selves to acknowledge. Using movement and music to help facilitate the process of meditation, MediPaint is a practice of mindfulness and creation through intuitive flow. No experience or artistic ability is necessary whatsoever. Allowing the music and spoken word to take you over, negative and stressful energy can flow out, while positive, relaxing and healing energy can be brought inward.. What does a session involve? A classic session is fully guided and involves: Light stretching to help you relax and get comfortable Grounding breathing practice Visual and mindfulness meditation accompanied by a sound bowl Painting, which allows for movement during meditation and is a practice of letting go WHY PAINTING? Art therapy has been used for decades as a form of psychotherapy to help children, those dealing with mental illnesses, traumatic situations, and/or who are struggling with day-to-day life for various reasons. MediPaint is not art therapy, but is similar in the sense that our fully guided sessions are meant to help you subconsciously express yourself and get to YOU. This may sound intimidating, but we promise it's not! The purpose is not to bring up all your deepest fears, anxieties or worries, but rather to practice being \"with yourself\". Together, we breathe into a calm state, refreshing the mind so that we can come back to all the things we face in life - whatever you may be dealing with - to acknowledge and reflect, with clarity and calmness. How long is a MediPaint session? Sessions run about 90 minutes long. What kind of Paint do you use? We use water-based, non-toxic paints. What is required of me for/during a session? An open mind - no experience or artistic skill is necessary. Remember that the end-goal is not what you've painted, but to reap the benefits of meditation! Mandalas & Mocktails Derived from the original MediPaint session, Mandalas & Mocktails is a workshop designed to be relaxing and fun, meditative yet social. WHY MANDALAS? Mandalas traditionally are a symbol of the universe - in this thoughtfully designed session, the mandala you create will truly be a reflection of your \"universe\", your innermost self, on whatever journey you are currently on. Creating (not just colouring) mandala art is a mindful and meditative practice that has been shown to improve focus and productivity, and enhance problem-solving skills. WHY MOCKTAILS? Although it is a fast-growing market trend, there will always be people who don't or can't drink for various reasons - being someone who has become more conscious/mindful about drinking alcohol, I realized it was hard to find adult-only events that were not alcohol-forward. Combining my passion for hosting and my mission with MediPaint, Mandalas & Mocktails was created! What is the Dragon Series? A 4-week program designed to encourage you to dive deep into your psyche. Each session focuses on one of the four different bodies which influence each of our daily behaviours and choices - the Mental, Emotional, Physical, and Spiritual. Each session can be taken individually or as a cyclical journey (you can start and exit at any stage of the cycle). What else do you offer? "}
