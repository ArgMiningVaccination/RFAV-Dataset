No. 11/494,825, filed Jul. 28, 2006, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,790,169, and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 60/703,109 filed Jul. 28, 2005. The complete disclosure of the 11/494,825 application is incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth.FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to providing new ways to administer various vaccines to various animals. It discloses several isolated feline caliciviruses (FCV). It discloses new methods of presenting FCV vaccines to cats. The present invention also relates to nucleic acid clones that encode feline caliciviruses. It relates to FCV capsid proteins, live or killed vaccines, a subunit vaccine comprising the capsid protein, a nucleic acid vaccine, and a recombinant virus vector vaccine comprising nucleic acids encoding the capsid protein of the isolated feline calicivirus. The present invention also relates to a method for identifying a feline calicivirus useful for producing a vaccine composition and assays for diagnosing cats infected with feline calicivirus. The present invention also provides for new ways to administer new and old FCV vaccines to felines.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Caliciviruses are reported to be an important cause of illness in cats. A wide variety of symptoms are observed such as fever, rhinitis, sneezing, mild conjunctivitis, ocular discharge, vesicles in the external nares, oral mucosa or on the tongue, pneumonia, tracheal bronchitis, diarrhea, muscle soreness, stiff gate, and hyperesthesia. Opportunistic bacterial infections often accompany. FCV infections, which complicate treatment and recovery. Severe FCV infections may lead to death, especially in juvenile cats. It should be noted that such signs, although reportedly common in natural cases, are not always prominent in experimental infections. It would appear that various field strains of feline calicivirus (FCV) either differ in their disease-causing potential, or that concurrent infection with other agents influences the disease symptoms. Vaccines against feline calicivirus have been available for more than two decades. Although numerous FCV serotypes exist, certain strains, such as F9, were found to induce antibodies against a broad range of FCV strains. See J. L. Bittle & W. J. Rubic, Am, J. Vet. Res. 37:275-78 (1976). As a result, the earliest vaccines against feline calicivirus employed a modified or attenuated version of the FCV-F9 strain. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,937,812 to J. L. Bittle W. J. Rubic, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. While the vaccines from FCV-F9 and other commercially available vaccines provide protection from many field isolates, it is not true that these vaccines prevent infection from all strains. Moreover, as FCV continues to evolve, FCV-F9 based vaccine provides protection against fewer and fewer field isolates (Lauritzen et al. 1997, Vet Microbiology, 56:55-63). In addition, veterinary practitioners have expressed concerns over the efficacy of vaccines based on a single serotype. Indeed, field studies suggest that vaccines derived from the FCV-F9 strain provide insufficient immunity against many strains of feline calicivirus. See. e.g., N. C. Pederson et al., Feline Pract. 13(1):26-35 (1983); S. Dawson et al., Vet. Rec. 132:346-50 (1993). Practitioners have also raised concerns about the administration of a modified live virus that may, in some circumstances, cause disease in otherwise healthy animals. Researchers have reported that inadvertent oral dosing of a subcutaneously-administered FCV vaccine resulted in acute disease. See R. C. Povey, Feline Pract. 7(5):12-16 (1977). There is, therefore, continued interest in developing a vaccine, which by itself or in combination with other vaccines, would provide the desired protection upon vaccination of a cat. We describe several isolates here which have been isolated from cats and provide a means of providing broad protection in immunized cats.INFORMATION DISCLOSURE U.S. Patent Documents - U.S. Pat.

The present invention provides new strains of and relates to several isolated feline caliciviruses (FCV). It also discloses new methods of presenting vaccines to animals and particularly, FCV vaccines to cats. The present invention also relates to nucleic acid clones that encode feline caliciviruses. It relates to FCV capsid proteins, live or killed vaccines, a subunit vaccine comprising the capsid protein, a nucleic acid vaccine, and a recombinant virus vector vaccine comprising nucleic acids encoding the capsid protein of the isolated feline calicivirus. The present invention also relates to a method for identifying a feline calicivirus useful for producing a vaccine composition and assays for diagnosing cats infected with feline calicivirus.

The vaccine may also additionally comprises or be administered with an adjuvant.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a vaccination regimen that significantly reduces mortality associated with feline calicivirus (FCV) and enhances the safety profile of FCV vaccines. Furthermore, the claimed vaccination regimen induces a broader serum cross neutralization profile than existing FCV-F9 vaccine protocols, which should provide better immunity across different strains of the feline calicivirus. One aspect of the present invention provides a method of immunizing animals with vaccines, in particular, a cat against feline calicivirus. Two other feline diseases. FPV and FHV also have novel treatments described herein. The method comprises administering to the cat therapeutically effective amounts of a first vaccine, a second vaccine, and, optionally a third vaccine administration may also be given either within 120 days as above, or more often, after about a year as an annual booster. The first vaccine is administered parenterally (e.g., subcutaneously, intramuscularly, etc.). The second vaccine is administered orally or oronasally about N days following administration of the first vaccine, and the third vaccine is administered parenterally, orally, or oronasally about M days following administration of either the first or the second vaccines. Here, N and M are independently integers from 3 to 120, inclusive. Also preferred is where N is about 3 weeks and about 2-4 weeks. In addition we present one aspect of the invention where certain identified vaccines may be administered as two oral doses, with no need for a first parenteral administration. Annual boosters are also advised.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCE LISTING \"About,\" when used in connection with a measurable numerical variable, refers to the indicated value of the variable and to all values of the variable that are within the experimental error of the indicated value (e.g., within the 95% confidence interval for the mean) or within 10 percent of the indicated value, whichever is greater, unless about is used in reference to time intervals in weeks where \"about 3 weeks,\" is 17-25 days, and about 2-4 weeks is 10-40 days. \"Active immunity\" includes both humoral immunity and/or cell-mediated immunity against feline viruses induced by vaccinating a cat with the vaccine of the present invention. \"Antibody\" refers to an immunoglobulin molecule that can bind to a specific antigen as the result of an immune response to that antigen. Immunoglobulins are serum proteins composed of \"light\" and \"heavy\" polypeptide chains having \"constant\" and \"variable\" regions and are divided into classes (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM) based on the composition of the constant regions. An antibody that is \"specific\" for a given antigen indicates that the variable regions of the antibody recognize and bind a specific antigen exclusively\u2014e.g., the antibody is able to distinguish a particular capsid protein from other known proteins by virtue of measurable differences in binding affinity, despite the existence of localized sequence identity, homology, or similarity between capsid proteins and other polypeptides. Specific antibodies may also interact with other proteins (for example, Staphylococcus aureus protein A or other antibodies in ELISA techniques) through interactions with sequences outside the variable region of the antibodies, and, in particular, in the constant regions of the molecule. Screening assays to determine binding specificity of an antibody are well known. For a comprehensive discussion of such assays, see Harlow et al. (ed.), Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Chapter 6 (1988). Antibodies may also recognize and bind fragments of FCV capsid proteins, provided that the antibodies are specific for FCV capsid proteins. Antibodies can be produced using methods known in the art. \"Antigen\" or \"immunogen\" refers to a molecule that contains one or more epitopes (linear, conformational or both) that upon exposure to a subject will induce an immune response that is specific for that antigen. An epitope is the specific site of the antigen which binds to a T-cell receptor or specific antibody, and typically comprises about 3 amino acid residues to about 20 amino acid residues. The term antigen refers to subunit antigens\u2014antigens separate and discrete from a whole organism with which the antigen is associated in nature\u2014as well as killed, attenuated or inactivated bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites or other microbes. The term antigen also refers to antibodies, such as anti-idiotype antibodies or fragments thereof, and to synthetic peptide mimotopes that can mimic an antigen or antigenic determinant (epitope). The term antigen also refers to an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide that expresses an antigen or antigenic determinant in vivo, such as in DNA immunization applications. \"Excipient\" refers to any component of a vaccine that is not an antigen. FELOCELL 3 is FELOCELL 4 without Chlamydia but with FCV-21. FELOCELL 3 A is FELOCELL 3 without FCV-F9, but with FCV-21. Felocell\u00ae 4, Felocell 4, or FELOCELL 4 or these words followed by the number \"3\" or \"4\" are vaccines where any variation of the name Felocell is registered and owned by Pfizer. \"First vaccine,\" \"second vaccine,\" \"third vaccine,\" and the like, refer to separately administrable vaccines, which may be the same or different, and which in general may be administered in any order. Thus, a third vaccine may be administered to a subject before or after a second vaccine. \"Identity\" with respect to percent amino acid sequence \"identity\" with respect to polypeptides is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the residues in the target sequences after aligning both sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Percent sequence identity is determined by conventional methods. Briefly, two amino acid sequences are aligned to optimize the alignment scores using the ClustalW algorithm (Thompson et al.; Nuc. Ac. Res. 22:4673-4680; 1994) and PAM250 weight matrix (Dayhoff et al. \"Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure.\" National Biomedical Research Foundation. Washington, DC 5:345-358 (1978) and default parameters as provided by the program MegAlign (DNASTAR. Inc.; Madison, Wis.). The PAM250 weight matrix table is presented as TABLE 1-1 (amino acids are indicated by the standard one-letter codes). \"Immune response\" in a subject refers to the development of a humoral immune response, a cellular immune response, or a humoral and a cellular immune response to an antigen. A \"humoral immune response\" refers to one that is mediated by antibodies. A \"cellular immune response\" is one mediated by T-lymphocytes or other white blood cells or both, and includes the production of cytokines, chemokines and similar molecules produced by activated T-cells, white blood cells, or both. Immune responses can be determined using standard immunoassays and neutralization assays, which are known in the art. \"Immunologically protective amount\" or \"effective amount to produce an immune response\" of an antigen is an amount effective to induce an immunogenic response in the recipient that is adequate to prevent or ameliorate signs or symptoms of disease, including adverse health effects or complications thereof, caused by infection with the disease agent and in particular with feline calicivirus. Either humoral immunity or cell-mediated immunity or both may be induced. The immunogenic response of an animal to a vaccine composition may be evaluated, e.g., indirectly through measurement of antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation assays, or directly through monitoring signs and symptoms after challenge with wild type strain. The protective immunity conferred by a vaccine can be evaluated by measuring, e.g., reduction in clinical signs such as mortality, morbidity, temperature number and overall physical condition and overall health and performance of the subject. The immune response may comprise, without limitation, induction of cellular and/or humoral immunity. The amount of a vaccine that is therapeutically effective may vary depending on the particular virus used, or the condition of the cat, and can be determined by a veterinary physician. \"Intranasal\" administration refers to the introduction of a substance, such as a vaccine, into a subject's body through or by way of the nose and involves transport of the substance primarily through the nasal mucosa. \"Isolated,\" when used to describe any particularly defined substance, such as a polynucleotide or a polypeptide, refers to the substance that is separate from the original cellular environment in which the substance such as a polypeptide or nucleic acid is normally found. As used herein therefore, by way of example only, a recombinant cell line constructed with a polynucleotide of the invention makes use of the \"isolated\" nucleic acid. Alternatively the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment may be used is or as a vaccine thus it would be considered to be isolated because it had been identified, separated and to some extent purified as compared to how it may exist in nature. If the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is produced in a recombinant bacterium or eukaryote expression vector that produces the antigen it is considered to exist as an isolated protein or nucleic acid. Example, a recombinant cell line constructed with a polynucleotide makes use of an \"isolated\" nucleic acid. \"Monoclonal antibody\" refers to antibodies produced by a single line of hybridoma cells, all directed towards one epitope on a particular antigen. The antigen used to make the monoclonal antibody can be provided as an isolated protein of the pathogen or the whole pathogen. A hybridoma is a clonal cell line that consists of hybrid cells formed by the fusion of a myeloma cell and a specific antibody-producing cell. In general, monoclonal antibodies are of mouse origin; however, monoclonal antibody also refers to a clonal population of an antibody made against a particular epitope of an antigen produced by phage display technology or method that is equivalent to phage display or hybrid cells of non-mouse origin. \"N days,\" \"N\" interval or period of time or \"M-days\" following an event refers, respectively, to any time on the N th or M th day after the event. For example, vaccinating a subject with a second vaccine 3 days following administration of a first vaccine means that the second vaccine is administered at any time on the 3rd day after the first vaccine. This description is often applied to the interval between a first and second vaccination. Typically the preferred N interval is about 3 weeks, or 17-25 days, but also common is from about 2-4 weeks or 10-40 days, and the inventions here are effective with \"N\" period of time of between 3 and 120 days. \"Oral\" or \"peroral\" administration refers to the introduction of a substance, such as a vaccine, into a subject's body through or by way of the mouth and involves swallowing or transport through the oral mucosa (e.g., sublingual or buccal absorption) or both. \"Oronasal\" administration refers to the introduction of a substance, such as a vaccine, into a subject's body through or by way of the nose and the mouth, as would occur, for example, by placing one or more droplets in the nose. Oronasal administration involves transport processes associated with oral and intranasal administration. \"Parenteral administration\" refers to the introduction of a substance, such as a vaccine, into a subject's body through or by way of a route that does not include the digestive tract. Parenteral administration includes subcutaneous administration, intramuscular administration, transcutaneous administration, intradermal administration, intraperitoneal administration intraocular administration, and intravenous administration. For the purposes of this disclosure, parenteral administration excludes administration routes that primarily involve transport of the substance through mucosal tissue in the mouth, nose, trachea, and lungs. \"Passive immunity\" refers to the protection against feline calicivirus provided to a cat as a result of vaccinating the cat with a vaccine comprising antibodies against the FCV strain or an immunogenic component or fragment of a component thereof. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable\" refers to substances, which are within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of subjects without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit-to-risk ratio, and effective for their intended use. \"Polyclonal antibody\" refers to a mixed population of antibodies made against a particular pathogen or antigen. In general, the population contains a variety of antibody groups, each group directed towards a particular epitope of the pathogen or antigen. To make polyclonal antibodies, the whole pathogen or an isolated antigen is introduced by inoculation or infection into a host that induces the host to make antibodies against the pathogen or antigen. \"Respiratory\" administration refers to the introduction of a substance, such as a vaccine, into a subject's body through or by way of inhalation of a nebulized (atomized) substance. In respiratory administration, the primary transport mechanism involves absorption of the atomized substance through the mucosa in the trachea, bronchi, and lungs and is therefore different than intranasal or peroral administration. \"Single administrative dosage\" means administered at or about the same day, that is all components administered within about 1 day. The components may or may not be in a single container. \"Specific for,\" when used to describe antibodies of the invention, indicates that the variable regions of the antibodies of the invention recognize and bind a specific virus strain exclusively (i.e., are able to distinguish a particular FCV capsid protein from other known proteins by virtue of measurable differences in binding affinity, despite the existence of localized sequence identity, homology, or similarity between FCV capsid proteins and such polypeptides). It will be understood that specific antibodies may also interact with other proteins (for example, S. aureus protein A or other antibodies in ELISA techniques) through interactions with sequences outside the variable region of the antibodies, and, in particular, in the constant region or/be molecule. Screening assays to determine binding specificity of an antibody of the invention are well known and routinely practiced in the art. For a comprehensive discussion of such assays, see Harlow et al. (Eds.), Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1988). Chapter 6. Antibodies that recognize and bind fragments of the FCV capsid proteins of the invention are also contemplated, provided that the antibodies are specific for FCV capsid proteins. Antibodies of the invention can be produced using any method well known and routinely practiced in the art. \"Specific immunogenic fragment\" is meant a portion of a sequence that is recognizable by an antibody that is specific for the sequence, as defined in detail below. \"Subject\" refers to any animal having an immune system, which includes mammals such as cats. \"Subunit vaccine\" refers to a type of vaccine that includes one or more antigens, but not all antigens, which are derived from or homologous to, antigens from a pathogen of interest, such as a virus, bacterium, parasite or fungus. Such a composition is substantially free of intact pathogen cells or pathogenic particles, or the lysate of such cells or particles. Thus, a subunit vaccine can be prepared from at least partially purified, or substantially purified, immunogenic polypeptides from the pathogen or its analogs. Methods of obtaining an antigen or antigens in the subunit vaccine include standard purification techniques, recombinant production, or chemical synthesis. \"TCID50\" refers to \"tissue culture infective dose\" and is defined as that dilution of a virus required to infect 50% of a given batch of inoculated cell cultures. Various methods may be used to calculate TCID50, including the Spearman-Karber method which is utilized throughout this specification. For a description of the Spearman-Karber method, see B. W. Mahy & H. O. Kangro, Virology Methods Manual 25-46 (1996). \"Therapeutically effective amount,\" in the context of this disclosure, refers to an amount of an antigen or vaccine that would induce an immune response in a subject (e.g., cat) receiving the antigen or vaccine which is adequate to prevent or ameliorate signs or symptoms of disease, including adverse health effects or complications thereof, caused by infection with a pathogen, such as a virus (e.g., FCV), bacterium, parasite or fungus. Humoral immunity or cell-mediated immunity or both humoral and cell-mediated immunity may be induced. The immunogenic response of an animal to a vaccine may be evaluated, e.g. indirectly through measurement of antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation assays, or directly through monitoring signs and symptoms after challenge with wild type strain. The protective immunity conferred by a vaccine can be evaluated by measuring, e.g., reduction in clinical signs such as mortality, morbidity, temperature number and overall physical condition and overall health and performance of the subject. The amount of a vaccine that is therapeutically effective may vary depending on the particular virus used, or the condition of the subject, and can be determined by a physician. \"Treating\" refers to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing a disorder, condition or disease to which such term applies, or to preventing one or more symptoms of such disorder, condition or disease. \"Treatment\" refers to the act of \"treating\" as defined immediately above. \"Vaccine\" refers to a composition that includes an antigen and encompasses so-called \"subunit vaccines\" as defined below. Administration of the vaccine to a subject results in an immune response. The vaccine may be introduced directly into the subject by any known route of administration, including parenterally, perorally, and the like.PART 1 Vaccines, Virus Strains, Capsid Proteins, and Antibodies of the Invention The present invention provides vaccines that are based upon live or killed FCV strains selected from the group consisting of FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV26391-4. The invention additionally provides nucleic acid vaccines encoding an FCV capsid protein from the FCV strains of the invention or specific immunogenic fragments thereof. The invention additionally provides isolated capsid protein derived from the FCV strains of the invention or specific immunogenic fragments thereof. For FCV strains, a good immune response is induced by antigenic determinant arising from the capsid protein. Here we describe and claim several strains of FCV including closely related capsid proteins and variants thereof. Specifically, we describe strain FCV-21 and protein sequence (SEQ ID 13) and sequences having 91.2%, 95% and 99% or more identity; strain FCV-49 and sequence (SEQ ID 15) and sequences having 92.7%, 95% and 99% or more identity; strain FCV-26391-4 and sequence (SEQ ID 17) and sequences having 91.8%, 95% and 99% or more identity. The vaccine of the present invention is generally intended to be a prophylactic treatment which immunizes cats against disease caused by virulent strains of feline calicivirus. However, the vaccine is also intended for the therapeutic treatment of cats already infected with a virulent strain of feline calicivirus. For example, a vaccine comprising antibodies produced by immunizing a heterologous host with FCV capsid or immunogenic component thereof, is used for the therapeutic treatment of a feline calicivirus-infected cat. However, even vaccines that provide active immunity, i.e., vaccines comprising FCV strains selected from the group consisting of FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV 26391-4, or mutants thereof, or capsid proteins derived from the FCV strains of the invention, or a specific immunogenic fragments of their capsid proteins, would be expected to be effective when given as a therapeutic treatment against various diseases. Thus, the immunity that is provided by the present invention can be either active immunity or passive immunity, and the intended use of the vaccine can be either prophylactic or therapeutic. The route of administration for any one of the embodiments of the vaccine of the present invention includes, but is not limited to, oronasal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, well as transdermal or by inhalation or suppository. The preferred routes of administration include oronasal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal, and subcutaneous injection. The vaccine can be administered by any means that includes, but is not limited to, syringes, nebulizers, misters, needleless injection devices, or microprojectile bombardment gene guns (Biolistic bombardment). The vaccine for any one of the embodiments of the present invention is formulated in a pharmaceutically accepted carrier according to the mode of administration to be used. One skilled in the art can readily formulate a vaccine that comprises a live or killed FCV-21, FCV-49 or FCV 26391-4, a capsid protein derived from any of the FCV strains of the invention, or an immunogenic fragment thereof, a recombinant virus vector encoding the FCV-21, FCV-49 or FCV 26391-4 capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, or a DNA molecule encoding the FCV-21, FCV-49 or FCV 26391-4 derived capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof. In cases where intramuscular injection is preferred, an isotonic formulation is preferred. Generally, additives for isotonicity can include sodium chloride, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, and lactose. In particular cases, isotonic solutions such as phosphate buffered saline are preferred. The formulations can further provide stabilizers such as gelatin and albumin. In some embodiments, a vaso-constrictive agent is added to the formulation. The pharmaceutical preparations according to the present invention are provided sterile and pyrogen-free. However it is well known by those skilled in the art that the preferred formulations for the pharmaceutically accepted carrier which comprise the vaccines of the present invention are those pharmaceutical carriers approved in the regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Agriculture, or equivalent government agency in a foreign country such as Canada or Mexico or any one of the European nations, for live feline calicivirus vaccines, killed feline calicivirus vaccines, polypeptide (antigen) subunit vaccines, recombinant virus vector vaccines, antibody vaccines, and DNA vaccines. Therefore, the pharmaceutically accepted carrier for commercial production of the vaccine of the present invention is a carrier that is already approved or will be approved by the appropriate government agency in the United States of America or foreign country. The vaccine can further be mixed with an adjuvant that is pharmaceutically acceptable. In certain formulations of the vaccine of the present invention, the vaccine is combined with other feline vaccines to produce a polyvalent vaccine product that can protect cats against a wide variety of diseases caused by other feline pathogens. Currently, commercial manufacturers of feline vaccines, as well as end users prefer polyvalent vaccine products. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a polyvalent vaccine which immunizes cats against feline calicivirus and at least one other feline pathogen, preferably selected from the group consisting of feline herpesvirus, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline Chlamydia, and feline panleukopenia virus. Inoculation of a cat is preferably by a single vaccination that produces a full, broad immunogenic response. In another embodiment of the present invention, the cat is subjected to a series of vaccinations to produce a full, broad immune response. When the vaccinations are provided in a series, the vaccinations can be provided between about one day to four weeks or longer apart. In particular embodiments, the cat is vaccinated at different sites simultaneously. Additional details about the route and administration are found below in the section titled \"Methods of Immunizing Cats against Calicivirus.\" The vaccine compositions optionally may include vaccine-compatible pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., sterile and non-toxic) liquid, semisolid, or solid diluents that serve as pharmaceutical vehicles, excipients, or media. Diluents can include water, saline, dextrose, ethanol, glycerol, and the Isotonic agents can include sodium chloride, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, and lactose, among others. Stabilizers include albumin, among others. Any adjuvant known in the art may be used in the vaccine composition, including oil-based adjuvants such as Freund's Complete Adjuvant and 109 EP 231 039, aluminum hydroxide, saponin, DEAE-dextran, neutral oils (such as miglyol), as arachis oil), liposomes, Pluronic\u00ae polyols. Adjuvants include, but are not limited to, the RIBI adjuvant system (Ribi Inc.), alum, aluminum hydroxide gel, water emulsions, emulsions Freund's incomplete adjuvants, Block co-polymer (CytRx, Atlanta Ga.), (Chiron, Emeryville Calif.), AMPHIGEN\u00ae adjuvant, saponin, Quil A, QS-21 (Cambridge Biotech Inc., Cambridge Mass.). GPI-0100 (Galenica Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.) or other saponin fractions, monophosphoryl lipid A, Avridine lipid-amine adjuvant, heat-labile enterotoxin from E. coli (recombinant or otherwise), cholera toxin, or muramyl dipeptide, among many others. The immunogenic compositions can further include one or more other immunomodulatory agents such as, e.g., interleukins, interferons, or other cytokines. The immunogenic compositions can also include gentamicin and Merthiolate. While the amounts and concentrations of adjuvants and additives useful in the context of the present invention can readily be determined by the skilled artisan, the present invention contemplates compositions comprising from about 50 g to about 2000 g of adjuvant and preferably about 500 g/2 ml dose of the vaccine composition. In another preferred embodiment, the present invention contemplates vaccine compositions comprising from about 1 g/ml to about 60 g/ml of antibiotic, and more preferably less than about 30 g/ml of antibiotic. The immunogenic compositions of the present invention can be made in various forms depending upon the route of administration. For example, the immunogenic compositions can be made in the form of sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions suitable for injectable use, or made in lyophilized forms using freeze-drying techniques. Lyophilized immunogenic compositions are typically maintained at about 4\u00b0 C., and can be reconstituted in a stabilizing solution. e.g., saline or/and HEPES, with or without adjuvant. In addition, the immunogenic and vaccine compositions of the present invention can include one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers. As used herein, \"a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier\" includes any and all stabilizing agents, diluents, preservatives, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic agents, adsorption delaying agents, and the like. The carrier(s) must be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the components of the invention and not deleterious to the subject to be immunized. Typically, the carriers will be will be sterile and pyrogen-free.Live Vaccines In one embodiment of the vaccine of the present invention, the vaccine comprises a live FCV vaccine, wherein the FCV component is selected from the group consisting of FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV 26391-4. Because these strains were isolated in a non-virulent form they are particularly preferred for the preparation of a live vaccine which stimulates the cat's immune system without causing disease. Methods for attenuating the viruses further are well known in the art and include such methods as serial passage in cell culture on a suitable cell line, or ultraviolet or chemical mutagenesis.Inactivated Vaccines In another embodiment of the present invention, the vaccine comprises an inactivated or killed FCV vaccine comprising an FCV strain selected from the group consisting of FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV 26391-4. The inactivated vaccine is made by methods well known in the art. For example, once the virus is propagated to high titers, it would be readily apparent by those skilled in the art that the virus antigenic mass could be obtained by methods well known in the art. For example, the virus antigenic mass may be obtained by dilution, concentration, or extraction. All of these methods have been employed to obtain appropriate viral antigenic mass to produce vaccines. The calicivirus is inactivated by treatment with formalin, betapropriolactone (BPL), or with binary ethyleneimine (BEI), or other methods known to those skilled in the art. Inactivation by formalin is performed by mixing the calicivirus suspension with 37% formaldehyde to a final formaldehyde concentration of 0.05%. The calicivirus-formaldehyde mixture is mixed by constant stirring for approximately 24 hours at room temperature. The inactivated calicivirus mixture is then tested for residual live virus by assaying for growth on a suitable feline cell line such as CRFK cells. Inactivation by BEI is performed by mixing the calicivirus suspension of the present invention with 0.1 M BEI (2-bromo-ethylamine in 0.175 N NaOH) to a final BEI concentration of 1 mM. The calicivirus-BEI mixture is mixed by constant stirring for approximately 48 hours at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1.0 M sodium thiosulfate to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Mixing is continued for an additional two hours. The inactivated calicivirus mixture is tested for residual live calicivirus by assaying for growth on a suitable feline cell line such as NLFK cells. The aforementioned inactivated calicivirus of the present invention is mixed with any one of the pharmaceutically carriers for formulating inactivated virus vaccines to the appropriate dosage level. The inactivated vaccine further can include, in addition to an FCV component selected from the group consisting of FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV 26391-4 at least one other feline calicivirus strain, preferably selected from the group consisting of FCV-F9, FCV-M8, FCV-255, and FCV-2280. In a preferred embodiment, the vaccine further includes a vaccine for immunizing a cat against one or more other feline pathogens, preferably selected from the group consisting of feline herpesvirus, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline Chlamydia, and feline panleukopenia virus.Recombinant Vaccines In a further embodiment of the present invention, the vaccine comprises a recombinant virus vector containing a nucleic acid encoding an FCV capsid protein disclosed herein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof. In one particular embodiment, the recombinant virus vector is a feline herpesvirus that immunizes a cat against both feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus. In another embodiment, the recombinant virus vector comprises one or more antigens preferably selected from the group consisting of feline herpesvirus, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline Chlamydia, and feline panleukopenia virus, rabies virus and Bordetella bronchiseptica. To make a recombinant virus vector that expresses the an FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, a cDNA encoding the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is inserted into the genome of a virus vector such as herpesvirus, poxvirus, or adenovirus. U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,822 to Wardley et al. describes a method for inserting DNA encoding the feline calicivirus strain CFI-68 FIV capsid protein into the feline herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene. Other recombinant virus vector vaccines embraced by the present invention, include but are not limited to, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, parvovirus, and various poxvirus vectors to express the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof. In particular, the present invention includes recombinant poxvirus vector vaccines that express the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof made according to the methods taught in any one of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,338,683 and 5,494,807 to Paoletti et al. which teach recombinant virus vaccines consisting of either vaccinia virus or canary poxvirus expressing foreign antigens; U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,313 to Esposito et al., which teaches recombinant raccoon poxvirus vectors expressing rabies virus antigens: and U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,703 to Maes et al., which teaches recombinant racoon poxvirus vectors that express the feline herpesvirus gD or gB antigens. For any of the aforementioned recombinant virus vectors, the cDNA encoding the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is operably linked to a eukaryote promoter at the 5 end of the cDNA encoding the antigen and a eukaryote termination signal and poly (A) signal at the 3 end of the cDNA encoding the antigen. As used herein, the term \"operably linked\" means that the polynucleotide of the present invention (as a cDNA molecule) and a polynucleotide (DNA) containing an expression control sequence, e.g., transcription promoter and termination sequences, are situated in a vector or cell such that expression of the antigen encoded by the cDNA is regulated by the expression control sequence. Methods for cloning DNA such as the cDNA encoding the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof and operably linking DNA containing expression control sequences thereto are well known in the art. Examples of promoters suitable for expressing the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof in the recombinant virus vectors are the cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV) promoter, the Rous sarcoma virus long (RSV-LTR) promoter, the simian virus 40 (SV40) immediate-early promoter, and inducible promoters such as the metallothionein promoter. An example of a DNA having a termination and poly (A) signal is the SV40 late poly (A) region. Another example of a viral expression system suitable for producing the antigen is the Sindbis Expression system available from Invitrogen. The use of these commercially available expression vectors and systems are well known in the art.Nucleic Acid or DNA Molecule Vaccine In an embodiment further still of the present invention, the vaccine is provided as a nucleic acid or DNA molecule vaccine that elicits an active immune response in the cat. The DNA molecule vaccine consists of DNA having a nucleic acid sequence which encodes the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof of a FCV-capsid protein disclosed herein. In a preferred embodiment, the DNA molecule vaccine comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 12, 14, or 16, or a fragment thereof encoding SEQ ID NOS: 13, 15 or 17, or a specific immunogenic fragment of SEQ ID NOS: 13, 15 or 17. The nucleic acid encoding the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is operably linked at or near a transcriptional promoter. This enables transcription of the capsid protein, or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, from the nucleic acid when the nucleic acid is inoculated into the cells of the cat. Preferably, the DNA molecule is a plasmid. Promoters that are useful for DNA vaccines are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the RSV LTR promoter, the CMV immediate early promoter, and the SV40 T antigen promoter. It is further preferred that the nucleic acid be operably linked, at or near the termination codon of the sequence encoding the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, to a nucleic acid fragment comprising a transcription termination signal and poly (A) recognition signal. The DNA vaccine is provided to the cat in an accepted pharmaceutical carrier or in a lipid or liposome carrier similar to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,703,055 to Feigner. The DNA vaccine can be provided to the cat by a variety of methods such as intramuscular injection, intrajet injection, or biolistic bombardment. Making DNA vaccines and methods for their use are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,589,466 and 5,580,859, both to Feigner. Finally, a method for producing pharmaceutical grade plasmid DNA is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,064 to Marquet et al. Therefore, using the abovementioned methods, DNA vaccines that express the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof are used to immunize cats against virulent feline calicivirus. The advantage of the DNA vaccine is that the DNA molecule is conveniently propagated as a plasmid which is a simple and inexpensive means for producing a vaccine, and since the vaccine is not live, many of the regulatory issues associated with live recombinant virus vector vaccines are not an issue with DNA vaccines. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the DNA vaccine of the present invention can comprise synthetically produced nucleic acids that are made by chemical synthesis methods well known in the art.Isolated and Purified FCV Capsid Protein In an embodiment further still of the present invention, the vaccine consists of the isolated and purified FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof. In particular, a vaccine wherein the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:13, 15, 17. Preferably, the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is produced in a recombinant bacterium or eukaryote expression vector that produces the antigen that can be isolated and purified to make the vaccine. For example, the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is produced in a microorganism such as bacteria, yeast, or fungi, in a eukaryote cell such as a mammalian or an insect cell, or via a recombinant virus vector such as adenovirus, poxvirus, herpesvirus, Semliki Forest virus, baculovirus, bacteriophage, Sindbis virus. Suitable bacteria for producing the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof include Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, or any other bacterium that is capable of expressing heterologous polypeptides. Suitable yeast types for expressing the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida, or any other yeast capable of expressing heterologous polypeptides. Methods for using the aforementioned bacteria, eukaryotic cells or recombinant virus vectors to produce antigens for vaccines are well known in the art. To produce the vaccine consisting of the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, the nucleic acid encoding the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is cloned into a plasmid, and the nucleic acid is operably linked to a promoter which effects the expression of the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof in a microorganism. Suitable promoters include, but are not limited to, T7 phage promoter, T3 phage promoter, -galactosidase promoter, phage promoter. Expression of the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof in a microorganism enables the capsid protein to be produced using fermentation technologies that are used commercially for producing large quantities of recombinant antigenic polypeptides. Methods for isolating and purifying antigens are well known in the art and include methods such as gel filtration, affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or centrifugation. To facilitate isolation of the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, a fusion poly peptide is made wherein the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is linked to another polypeptide which enables isolation by affinity chromatography. Preferably, a fusion polypeptide is made using one of the expression systems infra. For example, the cDNA nucleic acid sequence encoding the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is linked at either the 5 end or 3 end to a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide. The nucleic acids are linked in the proper codon reading frame to enable production of a fusion poly peptide wherein the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of the capsid protein or portion thereof is fused to a polypeptide which allows for the simplified recovery of the antigen as a fusion polypeptide. The fusion polypeptide can also prevent the antigen from being degraded during purification. While a vaccine comprising the fusion polypeptide is efficacious, in some instances it can be desirable to remove the second polypeptide after purification. Therefore, it is also contemplated that the fusion polypeptide contains a cleavage site at the junction between the antigen and the poly peptide. The cleavage site consists of an amino acid sequence that is cleaved with an enzyme specific for the amino acid sequence at the site. Examples of such cleavage sites that are contemplated include the enterokinase cleavage site which is cleaved by enterokinase, the factor Xa cleavage site which is cleaved by factor Xa, and GENENASE cleavage site which is cleaved by GENENASE (GENENASE is a trademark of New England Biolabs. Beverly, Mass.). The following are methods for producing the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof as a fusion polypeptide or as an isolated antigen free of the polypeptide. An example of a procaryote expression system for producing the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof as a fusion polypeptide for use in vaccines is the Glutathione S-transferase (GST) Gene Fusion System available from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J., which uses the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector plasmid. The cDNA encoding the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is fused in the proper codon reading frame with the DNA encoding GST. The GST part of the fusion polypeptide allows the rapid purification of the fusion polypeptide using glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. After purification, the GST portion of the fusion polypeptide can be removed by cleavage with a site-specific protease such as thrombin or factor Xa to produce an antigen free of the GST polypeptide. The capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, free of the GST polypeptide, is produced by a second round of glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. Another method for producing a vaccine comprising the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is a method which links in-frame the cDNA encoding the antigen and DNA codons that encode polyhistidine. The polyhistidine preferably comprises six histidine residues which allows purification of the fusion polypeptide by metal affinity chromatography, preferably nickel affinity chromatography. To produce the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof free of the polyhistidine, a cleavage site such as an enterokinase cleavage site is fused in the proper reading frame between the codons encoding the polyhistidine and the codons encoding the antigen. The antigen is freed of the polyhistidine by cleavage with enterokinase, followed by a second round of metal affinity chromatography which binds the free polyhistidine. This method was shown to be useful for preparing the LcrV antigen of Y. pestis, which was disclosed in Motin et al. (Infect. Immun. 64: 4313-4318 (1996)). The Xpress System, available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., is an example of a commercial kit that is available for making and then isolating polyhistidine-polypeptide fusion protein. A method further still for producing a vaccine comprising the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof uses a method disclosed by Motin et al., Infect. Immun. 64: 3021-3029 (1995). Motin et al. disclosed a DNA encoding a fusion polypeptide consisting of the DNA encoding an antigen linked to DNA encoding a portion of protein A wherein DNA encoding an enterokinase cleavage site is interposed in the proper codon reading frame between the DNA encoding protein A and the antigen. The protein A enables the fusion polypeptide to be isolated by IgG affinity chromatography, and the capsid protein free of the protein A is produced by cleavage with enterokinase. The protein A is then removed by a second round of IgG affinity chromatography. Another method for producing a vaccine comprising the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is based on methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,863 to Daniels et al, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Daniels et al. method can be used to make the FCV capsid vaccine which consists of enterotoxin molecule wherein each molecule has inserted therein upwards of 100 amino acid residues of the FCV capsid protein. Other methods for making fusion polypeptide vaccines which can be used to make the vaccines of the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,100 to Mond et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,384 to Liscombe. Finally, the pMAL Fusion and Purification System available from New England Biolabs is another example of a method for making a fusion polypeptide wherein a maltose binding protein is fused to the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof. The maltose binding protein facilitates isolation of the fusion polypeptide by amylose affinity chromatography. The maltose binding protein can be linked to the antigen by one of the above mentioned cleavage sites which enables the antigen to be made free of the maltose binding protein. While bacterial methods are used to produce the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof for vaccines, it can be desirable to produce the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof in a eukaryote expression system. A particularly useful system is the baculovirus expression system that is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,293 to Matsuura et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Baculovirus expression vectors suitable to produce the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof are the pPbac and pMbac vectors from Stratagene; and the Bac-N-Blue vector, the pBlueBac4.5 vector, pBlueBacHis2-A,B,C, and the pMelBac available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif. Another eukaryote system useful for expressing the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof for vaccines is a yeast expression system such as the ESP Yeast Protein Expression and Purification System available from Stratagene. Another yeast expression system is any one of the Pichia-based expression systems from Invitrogen. Mammalian expression systems are also embraced by the present invention. Examples of mammalian expression systems are the LacSwitch II system, the pBK Phagemid, pXT1 vector system, and the pSG5 vector system from Stratagene: the pTargeT mammalian expression vector system, the pSI mammalian expression vector, pCI mammalian expression vector, and pAdVantage vectors available from Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.; and the Ecdysone-Inducible Mammalian Expression System, pCDM8, pcDNA1.1, and pcDNA1.1/Amp available from Invitrogen. The present invention further includes an embodiment consisting of vaccines that comprise the FCV capsid protein or particular epitopes of the capsid protein as components of a heat-stable spore delivery system made according to the method taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,821 to Acheson et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Therefore, the present invention provides a genetically engineered bacterial cell containing a nucleic acid encoding the FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof. When the recombinant bacterial spore vaccine is orally administered to the cat, the spores germinate in the gastrointestinal tract of the cat and the bacteria expresses the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof which comes into contact with the cat's immune system and elicits an immune response. The vaccine has the advantage of being heat stable; therefore, it can be stored at room temperature for an indefinite period of time.Passive Immunity Vaccines While the above embodiments of the present invention provide active immunity against feline calicivirus, the present invention further comprises vaccines that provide passive immunity to feline calicivirus. A vaccine that elicits passive immunity against feline calicivirus consists of polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies that are against the FCV capsid protein, a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, or the whole FCV virus. To make a passive immunity vaccine comprising polyclonal antibodies, the FCV capsid protein thereof, or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof is injected into a suitable host for preparing the antibodies, preferably the host is a horse, swine, rabbit, sheep, or goat. Methods for producing polyclonal antibody vaccines from these hosts are well known in the art. By way of example, the capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof or whole calicivirus FCV capsid is mixed with an adjuvant such as Freund's complete or the less toxic TiterMax available from CytRx Corp., Norcross, Ga., which then administered to the host by methods well known in the art. Antibody production is monitored and when sufficient antibody has been produced, the serum is removed from the host and preferably the antibody is recovered from the serum. The passive immunity vaccine can comprise one or more monoclonal antibodies against one or more epitopes of the FCV capsid protein or whole FCV virus. Methods and hybridomas for producing monoclonal antibodies are well known in the art. While monoclonal antibodies can be made using hybridoma technologies well known in the art, the monoclonal antibodies against the antigen can also be made according to phage display methods such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,322 to Marks et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Felinized antibodies against the capsid protein or portion thereof can be made according to methods which have been used for humanizing antibodies such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,762 and 5,693,761 both to Queen et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A phage display kit that is useful for making monoclonal antibodies is the Recombinant Phage Antibody System available from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Antibodies, Polyclonal and Monoclonal This invention also comprises, describes and claims several very important monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies have been developed here in order to rapidly identify and in some cases define the viral strains described herein. Particular examples of monoclonal antibodies and their descriptions can be found in the following examples. In particular see EXAMPLE 1-2 and TABLE 1-2, and especially EXAMPLE 1-8. TABLE 1-4. The following examples are intended to promote but not limit a further understanding of the present inventionPART 1 EXAMPLES Example 1-1 Isolation and Growth of FCV-21 Feline calicivirus (FCV) strain 21 (FCV-21) was collected in June of 1993 from an Ann Arbor. Mich. cat show. It was diluted in 96 well micro-tubes containing 1% media and 1:10 dilutions were made. 100 ul of the diluted sample was added to 100 ul of CRFK cells in a 96 well plate. The FCV-21 virus was purified three times by limited dilution in 96 well plates. The viral supernatant from the final purification was removed and used to infect CRFK cells grown to 75% confluence in a T25 flask. When 100% CPE was observed, the suspension was freeze/thawed three times and aliquoted into freezing vials (1 ml/vial). The titer of this viral stock was determined to be 1.5\u00d7108 TCID50/ml. FCV-21 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va., number PTA-7346.Example 1-2 Immunofluorescence and ELISA of FCV-21 Using Various Commercial or Pre-Existing Monoclonal Antibodies For the immunofluorescense assay (IFA), a viral stock of FCV-21 was used to infect a 24-well plate seeded with NLFK cells grown to approximately 90% confluency. At approximately 20 hours post infection, the plate was washed twice with 1\u00d7PBS, and fixed with 80% acetone. Various monoclonal antibodies were diluted to about 2 ug/ul and added to individual wells of the plate (0.2 ml/well). After a 1 hr incubation at room temperature (RT) with agitation, each well was washed twice with 1\u00d7PBS, and secondary antibody (anti-mouse FITC, 10 ug/ml) was added. After covering the plate with aluminum foil and incubating for 30 min at RT with agitation, each well was washed twice with 1\u00d7PBS, and air dried. Each well was then observed under a fluorescence microscope for its intensity of staining with FITC. For the ELISA assay, a 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 200 ul of an anti-FCV rabbit polyclonal antibody (Pfizer 16), diluted 1:1500 in sodium carbonate buffer (1.59 g of Na2CO3 and 2.93 g of NaHCO3 dissolved into 1 liter of water). The plate was incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The plate was washed three times with 1\u00d7PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% of Tween-20 (PBST), then blocked with 200 ul of 1% Casein in PBST for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. Various monoclonal antibodies were diluted to about 0.1 ug/ml and added to individual wells (100 ul/well). Each sample was done in triplicate. After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr, each well was washed 3 times with PBST, and incubated with 100 No. 715-035-150) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. Each well was then washed 3 times with PBST, followed by the addition of 100 ul of ABTS peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md., cat. No. 50-66-18) to each well. After approximately 10 min at RT, the plate was read at 405-490 nm (dual wavelength) with a ELISA reader. Specific activity was calculated based on the signal/noise ratio. The data sets from the IFA and ELISA assays correlated well with each other (TABLE 1-2), and indicated that FCV-21 is immunologically distinct from F9, a commonly used FCV vaccine strain. Two monoclonal antibodies (FCV 1-43 and MAB791P) reacted with F9, but not with FCV-21 (TABLE 1-2). Total RNA was isolated from the supernatant of a FCV-21-infected cell culture Calif.). primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCR reaction was performed using the XL rTth polymerase (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, Calif.) and DEL-653 (SEQ ID NO. 1) and DEL-651 (SEQ ID NO, 2). The resulting PCR product was sequenced using BigDye chemistry and an ABI377 Genetic Analyzer. The complete capsid sequence is listed as SEQ ID NO. 12 for nucleotide sequence and SEQ ID NO. 13 for encoded amino acid sequence.Example 1-4 Isolation and Growth of FCV-49 Feline calicivirus (FCV) strain 49 (FCV-49, also called PHA-49) was collected in 1993 from a Philadelphia, Pa. cat show. The specimen was diluted in 96 well micro-tubes containing 1% media, and 1:10 dilutions were made. 100 ul of the diluted sample was added to 100 ul of CRFK cells in a 96 well plate. The FCV-49 virus was purified three times by limited dilution in 96 well plates. The viral supernatant from the final purification was removed and used to infect CRFK cells grown to 75% confluence in a T25 flask. When 100% CPE was observed, the suspension was freeze/thawed three times and aliquoted into freezing vials (1 ml/vial). The titer of this viral stock was determined to be 6.8\u00d7107 TCID50/ml. FCV-49 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va., number PTA-7347.Example 1-5 Capsid Sequence Analysis of FCV-49 Total RNA was isolated from the supernatant of a FCV-49-infected cell culture Calif.). primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCR reaction was performed using the XL rTth polymerase (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, product sequenced using BigDye chemistry and an ABI377 Genetic Analyzer. The complete capsid sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO. 14 for nucleotide sequence and SEQ ID NO. 15 for encoded amino acid sequence.Example 1-6 Isolation and Growth of FCV-26391-4 Feline calicivirus (FCV) strain 26391-4 (FCV-26391-4) was collected in 2003 from the Humane Society of Bay County (Panama City, Fla.). It was purified once by limited dilution in a 96 well plate containing DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with 2% fetal bovine serum. The purified virus was then used to infect a T150 flask containing NLFK (Norden Lab Feline Kidney) cells. Once 100% CPE was reached, the suspension was freeze/thawed once and aliquoted into freezing vials (0.85 ml/vial). The viral titer of this stock was determined to be 5.6\u00d7107 TCID50/ml. FCV-26391-4 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10801 University Blvd. Manassas, Va., Capsid Sequence Analysis of FCV 26391-4 Total was isolated from the supernatant of a FCV 26391-4 infected cell culture using a QIAamp Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, Calif.). Approximately 1 ug of viral RNA was used in RT-PCR (SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq; from conditions were: 30 min at 50\u00b0 C.; 2 min at 94\u00b0 C.; followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 94\u00b0 C., 30 sec at 55\u00b0 C., and 2 min at 70\u00b0 C.; followed by a final incubation at 72\u00b0 C. for 10 min, and storage at 4\u00b0 C. The primers used were FCV-N2 (SEQ ID NO. 3) and FCV-primer 2 (SEQ ID NO, 9). The PCR product was then sequenced using various oligonucleotide primers (SEQ ID NO. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11). The sequence of the whole capsid for FCV 26391-4 is shown as SEQ ID NO. 16 for nucleotide sequence and SEQ ID NO. 17 for encoded amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequences of the capsid genes from FCV-21, FCV-49 full-length FCV capsid sequences available in GenBank. The alignment was created using the ClustalW algorithm (Thompson et al 1994), the PAM250 weight matrix (Dayhoff et al., 1978), and default program parameters (MegAlign; DNASTAR, Inc; Madison, Wis.). The identity between the capsid protein sequences of FCV-21 and FCV 213-95, the highest among all FCV-49 91.3% identical to each other. A single capsid sequence is presented for FCV-21. FCV-49, and FCV 26391-4, and is based upon direct sequencing of the PCR products obtained. However, each of these sequences represents the average, or consensus, sequence amongst a population of viral quasispecies, which are known to exist within RNA viral populations (for a review, see Domingo et al., Virus Res. 82:39-44: 2002). Quasispecies are a direct result of errors that occur during RNA genome replication, generating progeny which have mutations within their genome. Therefore, it is expected that minor variants of the capsid sequences for these and other FCV capsid gene sequences naturally exist. However, the distribution of mutations within each is such that they have little/no effect on the overall identity between strains, including FCV-21, FCV-49, and FCV 26391-4.Examples 1-8 Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies Specific for FCV-21 A. Purification of FCV-21. About 200 ml of cell culture supernatant from NLFK cells infected with FCV-21, was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 10\u00b0 C. 25 ml of the supernatant was transferred into Beckman Ultraclear centrifuge tubes, and 10 ml of a 10% sucrose solution was underlayed into the bottom of the tube. The tubes were then centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 2 hours at 15\u00b0 C. Following centrifugation, supernatants were removed and discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 250 ul of sterile water. The protein concentration was determined to be 7 mg/ml using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford. IL).Immunization of Mice and Generation of Hybridoma Cell Clones About 100 ug of purified FCV-21 virus protein was injected into each mouse together with Freund's adjuvant. Eight mice were vaccinated. Two boost immunizations were carried out with 100 ug purified FCV-21 with RIBI adjuvant at 4-week interval. Immune responses for those eight mice were determined to have titer of 31250 or above in ELISA using purified FCV-21. Cell fusion was carried out to create hybridoma clones. Sixty-eight of such cell clones were grown up and supernatant tested for its reactivity with FCV-21. For this ELISA, a 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 100 ul of purified FCV at a concentration of 5 ug/ml, diluted in 1\u00d7PBS. The plate was dried at 37\u00b0 C. overnight uncovered in a non-humidified incubator. The virus on plate was fixed by applying 0.1 ml of methanol and incubating at room temperature for 5 minutes. The plate was then washed 8 times with distilled water, then blocked with 200 ul of 10% house serum in 1\u00d7PBS for at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The plate was washed again for 8 times with distilled water. Various dilutions of mouse serum samples added to individual wells (100 unwell). Each sample was done in triplicate. After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr, each well was washed 3 times with PBST, and incubated with 100 No. 715-035-150) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. Each well was then washed 3 times with PBST, followed by the addition of 100 ul of ABTS peroxidase substrate (KPL. Gaithersburg, Md., cat. No. 50-66-18) to each well. After approximately 10 min at RT, the plate was read at 405-490 nm (dual wavelength) with a ELISA reader. Specific activity was calculated based on the signal/noise ratio.Reactivity of FCV-21 Specific Monoclonal Antibodies The supernatants of above hybridoma cell clones were used to test for its reactivity for FCV-21 as well as F9 in sandwich ELISA assay. Briefly, a 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 200 ul of an anti-FCV rabbit polyclonal antibody (Pfizer #16), diluted 1:1500 in sodium carbonate buffer (1.59 g of Na2CO3 and 2.93 g of NaHCO3 dissolved into 1 liter of water). The plate was incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The plate was washed three times with 1\u00d7PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% of Tween-20 (PBST), then blocked with 200 ul of 1% Casein in PBST for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. The FCV-21 and F-9 supernatants were added to each well at dilution of 1:10. After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour, the plates were washed and various hybridoma supernatants and their various dilutions were added to individual wells (100 ul/well) in triplicate. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr, washed 3 times with PBST, and incubated with 100 No. 715-035-150) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. After washing, 100 ul of ABTS peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md., cat. No. 50-66-18) was added to each well. After approximately 10 min at RT, the plate was read at 405-490 nm (dual wavelength) with a ELISA reader. Specific activity was calculated based on the signal/noise ratio. B. Monoclonal antibodies specific for FCV-21 and not other FCV strains. Eighteen hybridoma cell clones (3, 7, 17, 23, 27, 29, 30, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, 44, 53, 56, 59, 60 and 61) were chosen to be further tested for their specificity for FCV-21. Eleven FCV viruses were used and H). Again, sandwich ELISA was used, as described above. The results are summarized in TABLE 1-4. As demonstrated above, hybridoma cell lines 23, 41, 44 and 56 are specific for FCV-21, and not any other FCV tested. Therefore, those monoclonal antibodies can be used as a diagnostic tool for FCV-21. Moreover, hybridoma 36 seems to react with vaccine FCV strains only (FCV-21, 49, 26391-4) and not any other FCV strains. Hybridoma cell lines 23, 36, 41, 44 and 56 were all deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va., 20110, USA, and assigned numbers: - 23) PTA-7352 (Hybridoma 56) A. Titration of homologous antiserum. Convalescent antiserum against twelve FCV isolates was raised in specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats, and collected after a primary and secondary inoculation. The virus inoculum varied according to stock titers, ranging from 104 to 108 TCID50/cat. The cats were initially inoculated, boosted 3 weeks later, and then bled for serum 2 weeks post-boost. The twelve isolates included F9, CFI-68, LSO12, JOK63, JOK92, and field isolates 18, 21, 49, 50, 54, 27, and 11. The field isolates were selected based on a phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the hypervariable region of each strain's capsid protein sequence. The most divergent isolates were chosen for the study. Sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and titered against their homologous virus using a standard constant virus\u2014varying serum technique (Griest 1979. Mahy 1996). Briefly, media (100-150 l) was added to each well of a 96 well tissue culture plate. Serum (100-150 l) was added to each well of the top row (1:2 or 1:4 initial serum dilution: F9 and LSO12 at 1:4), and 100 l were transferred down the plate after mixing (1:2 dilutions) with a multi-channel pipettor. The last 100 l was discarded. 50 l of titered homologous virus (diluted to 200 TCID50/50 l) was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 2 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. in a CO2 incubator. After incubation, 50 l of a 1:10 dilution of CRFK cells in suspension was added to each well. A virus titer plate was set up using the diluted virus to ensure that an appropriate inoculum was added to each well. 50 l of virus was used in the top row containing 150 l of media; the rest of the plate contained 180 l/well, and 10-fold dilutions were carried out down the plate with 20 l. Plates were incubated for 4 days, and the Karber formula was used to calculate both the serum and viral titers (in the case of serum titers, the proportion of protected wells to unprotected was used in the equation). When titering the sera, the TCID50 was defined as the 50% neutralizing endpoint dilution (Griest (979). One antibody unit (AU) was defined as the highest dilution of that antiserum capable of neutralizing 32-320 TCID50 of the homologous virus in 50% of the test cultures. Therefore, the TCID50 obtained is equal to 1 AU. Virus cross-neutralizations were carried out against serum concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 AU. B. Virus cross-neutralization assay. Each viral field isolate, as well as strains F9, LSO12, JOK63, JOK92, SA113 and CFI-68, was tested the twelve FCV antisera in a cross-neutralization assay. Each virus required five 96 well plates. Each serum was diluted to 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 AU and plated in replicates of eight down the plate (three sera/plate for a total of four plates), and a virus titer plate (set up in the same way as for serum titrations). Antisera dilutions were prepared in DMEM by first diluting the serum to 20 AU, and then carrying out 2-fold dilutions down to 2.5 AU. An aliquot of each dilution (100 l) was then added to each column of wells on the plate. Viruses were quickly thawed at 37\u00b0 C., placed on ice, and then diluted to 200 TCID50/well (kept on ice). In order to maintain consistency, a three-step dilution process was used for most viral stocks, never going higher than a 1:100 in any step. Diluted virus stock (50 l) was added to all wells of the serum plates and titered as previously described. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a CO2 incubator for 2 hr, after which 50 l of 1:10 dilution of a CRFK cell suspension previously grown to confluency was added to each well. Pipette tips and reservoir troughs were changed after each set of five plates. Plates were scored after 4 days. In some cases, pre-titered, pre-diluted virus was used. The cross-neutralization data is summarized in TABLE 1-5. Each data point represents eight replicate wells assayed. \"N\", \"n\", or \"-\" represent the proportion of protected to unprotected wells, which is an indication of the extent of cross-neutralization. The serum neutralization results corresponding to each monospecific serum tested against its homologous virus are highlighted in the TABLE. These sera should neutralize completely: for the most part they do. The few exceptions, most notably JOK63. JOK92 and 11, show complete neutralization at higher AU values, but not at 2.5 AU. This is likely due to dilution errors. The most significant result from this data set is the high degree of cross-neutralization exhibited by sera FCV-21 and FCV-49, particularly the latter. The patterns of cross-neutralization of these sera appear to be similar to that of F9. (It should be noted that the data set for F9, and for FCV-21 and FCV-49 at 20 AU, is incomplete due to insufficient amounts of sera.) Although there are some differences in neutralization patterns between the three sera (FCV-21. FCV-49, and F9), isolates 11, 38 and 39 were consistently not neutralized by any of the three.Example 1-10 Cross Neutralization Analysis of FCV-21 and FCV-49 Antisera Against FCV Viruses Isolated in 2003 FCV antisera in this study were generated by inoculating 105 to 106 TCID50/ml of FCV intranasally into cats (4-5 cats/group). A booster inoculation was carried out 3 weeks later using the same amount of virus. Sera were collected 2 weeks post-boost and heat treated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Serum samples from each of the vaccinated cats were used in the serum neutralization assay against each of 26 FCV strains (TABLE 1-6). Serum samples were diluted at 1:8 and followed by 2-fold serial dilutions out to 1:16384 (12 dilutions total) in ul volume. FCV with titer range between 50-500 TCID50/ml in 600 ul were mixed with diluted serum samples together and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Then 200 ul of sample was transferred into each well of 96-well plates seeded with CRFK cells in quadruplicate. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2 for 6 days and end point neutralization titer was determined. Both serum neutralization (SN) titer and challenge virus back-titer were calculated by the method of Spearman-Karber (Spearman C, 1908, Brit J Psychol exp Path of >23 and >15 and >10. The results are shown in TABLE 1-7. The data suggest that FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV 26391-4 have broader cross neutralization profiles, and are therefore better vaccine candidates than the current FCV vaccine strain. F9. Domestic shorthair cats, about 8 weeks of age, were vaccinated with FELOCELL\u00ae 4 components which contain modified-live feline FCV strain, FCV-21. The vaccination regimens evaluated included: an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by subcutaneous boosts on days 21 (SQ/SQ); an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by one oral booster immunizations on day 21 (SQ/Oral); or an initial oral vaccination followed by a second oral vaccination on day 21. Oral vaccination was achieved by administration of the vaccine into the mouth. On day 42, all cats were challenged with approximately 1 of virulent systemic FCV-33585 (3 log of TCID50/mL). All cats were monitored for clinical signs (temperature, conjunctivitis discharge, conjunctivitis mucopurulent discharge, sneezing, audible rales, coughing open mouth breathing, anorexia, dehydration, one oral ulcer <4 mm, multiple oral ulcers, oral ulcers >4 mm, salivating, nonbleeding external ulcer, bleeding external ulcers) of disease for 14 days post-challenge. Cats exhibiting severe clinical signs post-challenge that were consistent with calicivirus pathogenesis were euthanized. As shown in TABLE 1-8, the addition of the new strain FCV-21 significantly increases the efficacy of FELOCELL 4, with or without the presence of FCV-F9. Both SQ/SQ vaccination and SQ/Oral vaccination seem to be efficacious for preventing FCV infection. Moreover, we have demonstrated efficacy against FCV infection even with Oral/Oral vaccination with addition of FCV-21 and absence of F9 in FELOCELL 4 and FELOCELL 3 (FELOCELL 3 is FELOCELL 4 without Chlamydia psittaci). For TABLE 1-9, the vaccination regimens evaluated included an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by two oral booster immunizations on day 21 and day 42 (SQ/Oral/Oral). We have demonstrated that the addition of FCV-21, with or without FCV-F9 in FELOCELL 4, significantly decreased both mortality and clinical scores. Serum samples from each cat in the study described in EXAMPLE 1-11, were collected following the second vaccination, but before 85 challenge. The samples were heat treated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and evaluated in the serum neutralization assay against each of 26 FCV strains as previously described in EXAMPLE 1-10 (TABLE 1-6). Serum neutralization data were analyzed with cut-off titers of >23 and >15, and an average of the two cut-off titers was calculated (Ave). The results are shown in TABLE 1-10. The data indicate that all of the vaccine formulations containing FCV-21 had broader cross neutralization profiles than the vaccines containing the traditional FCV-F9 strain (60% vs. 40%). This resulted in an approximate 50% increase in the number of the FCV strains neutralized. As also shown in TABLE 1-10, the addition of the new strain FCV-21 significantly increased the cross neutralization profile of FELOCELL 4, with or without the presence of FCV-F9. Broader cross neutralization profiles were observed with both SQ/SQ vaccination and SQ/Oral vaccination. Moreover, we have demonstrated enhanced cross neutralization profiles with Oral/Oral vaccination with the presence of FCV-21, but not F9, in FELOCELL 4 and FELOCELL 3. In TABLE 1-11, the vaccination regimens evaluated included an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by two oral booster immunizations on day 21 and day 42 (SQ/Oral/Oral). The results indicate that the addition of FCV-21, with or without FCV-F9 in FELOCELL 4, resulted in significantly broader cross neutralization profiles (approximate 40% increase).

Described herein are methods and materials for treating and immunizing animals with vaccine and in particular cats against feline calicivirus (FCV). The method includes administering to the cat therapeutically effective amounts of first and second vaccines that are capable of inducing an immune response, and in particular in the cat against FCV. The first vaccine is typically administered parenterally, but in some situations may be administered orally, while the second vaccine is administered orally or oronasally N days following administration of the first vaccine. These vaccines are typically administered parenterally first because they typically cause oral lesions if initially administered orally. Surprisingly, here we disclose strains FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV 26391-4 that are so safe and effective they may be administered as a first oral administration followed by a second oral administration. Here, N is an integer from 3 to 120, inclusive, but is typically an integer from 7 to 42, inclusive, or from 14 to 28, inclusive, preferred is about 3 weeks and also about 2-4 weeks. Alternatively, the second vaccine may be administered after the cat has developed an FCV serum neutralization titer of about 1:6, 1:9, 1:12, 1:15, 1:18, or greater. The method may also include one or more additional parenteral, oral or oronasal administrations of an FCV vaccine M days following administration of the first vaccine or the second vaccine, where M is an integer from 1 to 120, inclusive. Thus, representative vaccination regimens include (1) subcutaneous administration of a first FCV vaccine, followed by oral administration of a second FCV vaccine; (2) successive subcutaneous administrations of first and third FCV vaccines, followed by oral administration of a second FCV vaccine; and (3) subcutaneous administration of a first FCV vaccine, followed by successive oral administrations of second and third FCV vaccines. As described above, the first vaccine is administered orally or parenterally (e.g., subcutaneously), the second vaccine is administered orally or oronasally, and an optional third vaccine may be administered parenterally, orally or oronasally. Any device may be used to administer the vaccines, including syringes, droppers, needleless injection devices, and the like. For oronasal administration, a syringe fitted with a cannula may be used to place drops of the vaccine in the cat's nose and mouth. The method may employ any vaccine that is capable of inducing an immune response in the cat against FCV, as long as the first vaccine is adapted to be administered parenterally and the second vaccine is adapted to be administered orally or oronasally. As noted above, the optional third vaccine is adapted to be administered parenterally, perorally, or oronasally. The first, second, and optional third vaccines may be the same or different and each comprises, independently, an antigen or antigens derived from one or more strains of FCV. Useful vaccines thus include live virus vaccines, modified-live virus vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. Live and modified-live FCV vaccines contain FCV strains that do not cause disease in cats and have been isolated in non-virulent form or have been attenuated using well-known methods, including serial passage in a suitable cell line or exposure to ultraviolet light or a chemical mutagen. Inactivated or killed FCV vaccines contain FCV strains which have been inactivated by known methods, including treatment with formalin, betapropriolactone, binary ethyleneimine, and the like. Exemplary vaccines include those containing non-virulent strains selected from FCV-F9, FCV-M8, FCV-255. FCV-2280, FCV-21, FCV-49, FCV 26391-4, etc., either alone or in combination. Other useful vaccines derived from one or more strains of FCV include recombinant vaccines and DNA vaccines (i.e., subunit vaccines). Recombinant vaccines include recombinant virus vectors, each containing a nucleic acid which encodes an antigen derived from a strain of FCV. Such vectors may be prepared by inserting a cDNA that encodes an antigen derived from an FCV strain (e.g., a capsid protein) into the genome of a non-virulent virus, including strains of herpesvirus, poxvirus, adenovirus, and the like. For virus vectors, the cDNA is operably linked to a eukaryote transcription promoter at the 5 end of the antigen encoding sequence and is operably linked to a eukaryote termination signal and poly(A) signal at the 3 end of the antigen encoding sequence, so that the transcription promoter and termination sequences regulate expression of the antigen. Useful transcription promoters include Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter (RSV-LTR), immediate-early promoter, simian vacuolating virus 40 T antigen promoter, and inducible promoters, such as metallothionein promoter. For a discussion of recombinant FCV vaccines, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,822 to Wardley et al., which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. DNA vaccines include DNA molecules (e.g., plasmids) having a nucleic acid sequence that encodes an FCV antigen, such as an FCV capsid protein or a specific immunogenic fragment thereof, which elicits an immune response in the cat against FCV. The nucleic acid coding sequence is operably linked to a transcriptional promoter that enables expression of the DNA when it is inoculated into the cells of the cat. Useful promoters include the RSV-LTR promoter, the CMV major immediate-early promoter, and the SV40 T antigen promoter. Additionally, the nucleic acid may be operably linked, at or near the termination codon of the sequence encoding the FCV antigen, to a nucleic acid fragment comprising a transcription termination signal and poly(A) recognition signal. For a discussion of DNA vaccines, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,859, U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,466, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,703,055, to Felgner et al. Other useful vaccines include those containing one or more subunit antigens, such as an FCV capsid protein or an immunogenic fragment of the capsid protein, which has been isolated and purified. The subunit antigen may be produced in a recombinant expression vector that produces the antigen in vitro using methods described above. The resultant antigen is subsequently isolated and purified. Useful expression vectors include various microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast and fungi, as well as eukaryotes, such as mammalian and insect cells. Other useful expression vectors include viruses, such as adenoviruses, poxviruses, herpesviruses, Semliki Forest viruses, baculoviruses, bacteriophages, Sindbis and the like. Expression of the FCV subunit antigen in a microorganism permits production of the antigenic protein using commercial-scale fermentation technologies. Various methods may be used to isolate and purify the antigens, including gel filtration, affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, centrifugation, and the like. One or more of the vaccines may also contain antigens for immunizing cats against one or more pathogens besides FCV, including feline herpesvirus, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline panleukopenia virus, and feline Chlamydia. Other components of vaccines may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, including carriers, solvents, and diluents, agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, and the like. Typical carriers, solvents, and diluents include water, saline, dextrose, ethanol, glycerol, and the isotonic agents include sodium chloride, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, and the like. Useful stabilizers include gelatin, albumin, and the like. The vaccines may also include one or more adjuvants which increase the immune response to the antigen. Representative adjuvants include oil-based adjuvants, such as Freund's Complete OK432), BIOSTIM\u00ae (e.g., liposomes, PLURONIC\u00ae polyols. include Calif.), AMPHIGEN\u00ae adjuvant, saponin, Quit A, QS-21 (Cambridge Biotech Inc. Cambridge Mass.), GPI-0100 (Galenica Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.) or other saponin fractions, lipid A, Avridine lipid-amine adjuvant, heat-labile enterotoxin (recombinant or otherwise), cholera toxin, or muramyl dipeptide, among others. Dose sizes of the FCV vaccines typically range from about 1 mL to about 2 mL, inclusive. Each dose contains a therapeutically effective amount of the FCV antigen or antigens that may vary depending on the age and general condition of the cat, the route of administration, the nature of the FCV antigen, and other factors. For vaccines containing modified live viruses or attenuated viruses, a therapeutically effective dose generally ranges from about 106 TCID50 to about 108 TCID50, inclusive. For vaccines containing subunit antigens, such as FCV capsid proteins, a therapeutically effective dose generally ranges from about 10 g to about 100 g, inclusive. The other components of the vaccines may be adjusted to modify the physical and chemical properties of the vaccines. For example, adjuvants typically comprises from about 25 g to about 1000 g, inclusive, of a 1 mL dose. Similarly, antibiotics typically comprise from about 1 g to about 60 g, inclusive, of a 1 mL dose. The FCV vaccines are provided in various forms depending on the route of administration, storage requirements, and the like. For example, the vaccines can be prepared as aqueous solutions or dispersions suitable for use in syringes, droppers, etc. or can be prepared as lyophilized powders, which are reconstituted in saline, HEPES buffer, and the like, prior to use.PART 2 EXAMPLES AND TABLES The following examples are intended to be illustrative and non-limiting, and represent a few specific embodiments of the present invention.Example 2-1 Subcutaneous/Oral Vaccination Regimen with FELOCELL\u00ae 4 and FEL-O-VAX\u00ae Domestic shorthair cats, 4-5 months of age, were vaccinated with FELOCELL\u00ae 4 (Pfizer Inc.; C. psittaci), or with sterile diluent (control group). The vaccination regimens evaluated included: an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by subcutaneous boosts on days 21 and 42 (SQ/SQ/SQ); an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by two oral booster immunizations on days 21 and 42 (SQ/Oral/Oral); or an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by a second subcutaneous vaccination on day 21, and an oral boost on day 42. All doses were 1 mL. Oral vaccination was achieved by administration of the vaccine into the mouth. On day 99, all cats Were challenged with approximately 3.5 mL of virulent systemic FCV-33585 (4.8 log of TCID50/mL). The challenge was performed by administering approximately 3 mL of the dose in canned cat food, and 0.05 mL via nasal instillation. All cats were monitored for clinical signs of disease for 14 days post-challenge. Cats exhibiting severe clinical signs post-challenge that were consistent with calicivirus pathogenesis were euthanized. As shown in TABLE 2-1, the group vaccinated via the SQ/Oral/Oral regimen had a mortality rate of only 10%, while the control group had a mortality rate of 90%. The group vaccinated via the SQ/SQ/SQ regimen had a mortality rate of 50%, while the group vaccinated via the SQ/SQ/Oral regimen had mortality rate of 20%. These results suggest that SQ vaccination followed by an Oral boost significantly enhances the effectiveness of FELOCELL\u00ae 4 vaccination against virulent FCV challenge. Not only did mortality rates decrease from 50% (SQ/SQ/SQ) to 10% (SQ/Oral/Oral) or 20% (SQ/SQ/Oral) when oral vaccination was a part of the regimen, but as shown in TABLE 2-2, the severity of clinical signs such as skin lesions (SL), inappetence (IA), depression (DP), oral ulcers (OU), lameness (LN), sneezing (SZ), nasal discharge (ND) and watery eyes (WE), decreased as well. Blood samples taken from the cats of EXAMPLE 2-1 were collected on study days 0, 21, 42, 63, 98 and 113, and evaluated in a serum neutralization (SN) assay for their capacity to neutralize FCV. Serum samples were diluted 1:8, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions out to 1:16384 (12 dilutions total) in 600 L volumes. Feline caliciviruses with a titer of 50-500 TCID50/mL in 600 L were mixed with the diluted serum samples and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Then 200 L of each diluted sample was transferred into separate wells of 96-well plates seeded with Crandel Feline Kidney (CrFK) cells in quadruplicate. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% CO2 for 6 days at which time end point neutralization titers were determined. Both the serum neutralization (SN) titer and the challenge virus back-titer were calculated using the method of Spearman-Karber See, C. Spearman. Brit. J. Psychol. 2:227-242 (1908) and G. Karber. Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmak. 162:480-487 (1931). As shown in TABLE 2-3, FELOCELL\u00ae 4 administered via the SQ/Oral/Oral or SQ/SQ/Oral vaccination had significantly higher FCV SN titers. These data correlate with the significant reduction in mortality rates described in EXAMPLE 2-1 Serum samples from the cats of EXAMPLE 2-1 were also assayed for their mean FP titers. As shown in TABLE 2-4, all of the cats were seronegative at the beginning of the study. Subsequently, the mean titers of the control group remained at 1 for the duration of the sampling intervals (days 21 and 42). However, the mean titers of the other four vaccination groups increased significantly. Oronasal (ON) administration of FELOCELL\u00ae 4 was achieved by instillation of drops into the nares of the animal. As indicated in TABLE 2-5, groups of 10 cats (T1, T2, T3), 6-7 months of age, were vaccinated and boosted on day 21 according to the regimens shown in TABLE 2-5: subcutaneous vaccination and boost (SQ/SQ); subcutaneous vaccination and oronasal booster (SQ/QN); or oronasal vaccination and boost (ON/ON). Vaccine was subcutaneously administered on the right side of the neck (1 mL); oronasal administration was by delivery of 0.5 mL of vaccine into each nare. Beginning on day 1, all cats were observed daily for general health conditions. As shown in TABLE 2-5, cats receiving both vaccinations oronasally had high levels of clinical symptoms, including nasal ulcers (NU), oral ulcers (OU), persistent sneezing (SZ), nasal discharge (ND), watery eyes (WE) and transient inappetence (IA). Cats vaccinated via the SQ/ON regimen, however, displayed fewer clinical symptoms than ON/ON-vaccinated cats, with no indication of nasal ulcers, oral ulcers, nasal discharge, or watery eyes. Also, subjects in the SQ/ON group exhibited less sneezing than cats in the ON/ON group. The safety profile of the SQ/ON group was similar to that of the SQ/SQ group.Example 2-5 The Effect of Different Vaccination Routes on Serological Responses to Felocell\u00ae 4 Antigens Serum samples from cats enrolled in the study described in EXAMPLE 2-4 were assayed for serological reactivity to various viral antigens present in the FELOCELL\u00ae 4 vaccine. Mean serum neutralization antibody titers to FCV, FHV and FP were determined for study days 0, 21 and 42. As shown in TABLE 2-6, all three vaccination regimens resulted in a strong immune response to FP. The immune response to FHV was barely detectable due to difficulties with the assay. However, serum neutralization titers against FCV were significantly higher in the ON/ON and SQ/ON groups, as compared to the SQ/SQ group. These results suggest that cats in the ON/ON and SQ/ON groups would be protected against a virulent FCV challenge, but that the SQ/SQ group may not be. Six cats per group were vaccinated with the FCV-F9 antigen present in the FELOCELL\u00ae 4 vaccine, either SQ or ON. Three weeks following the initial vaccination, all cats were boosted with the same antigen via the same route as previously. All doses were 1 mL. Serum samples were collected three weeks after the booster immunization. As shown in TABLE 2-7, serum neutralization titers were determined for these samples against a panel of 26 FCV strains. The FCV strains chosen for the panel were selected based upon genetic diversity (as determined by the sequence of their capsid hyper-variable region), as well as geographic distribution. In addition, the virulence phenotype of each strain was also considered. Serum samples from cats vaccinated ON with F9 neutralized more FCV strains in the 26 member panel, as compared to samples from SQ-vaccinated cats. Using 23 as the cut-off value for neutralization titers, ON vaccination resulted in titers at or above the cut-off for 26% of the panel members, while SQ vaccination resulted in only 16% meeting the criteria. For a titer cut-off of 15. ON vaccination yielded 32% of panel members at or above the cut-off; SQ yielded only 17%. Domestic shorthair cats, about 8 weeks of age, were administered vaccines containing modified-live feline rhinotracheitis virus and 4 plus initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by subcutaneous boosts on day 21 (SQ/SQ): an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by one oral booster immunization on day 21 (SQ/Oral); or an initial oral vaccination followed by a second oral vaccination on day 21 (Oral/Oral). Each cat within the different dosing regimens (groups T1 to T10, 10 cats per group) received 1 mL of vaccine. Oral vaccination was achieved by administration of the vaccine into the mouth. On day 42, all cats were challenged with approximately 1 mL of virulent systemic FCV-33585 (3 log of TCID50/mL). For 14 days post-challenge, all of the cats were monitored for clinical signs of disease, including elevated temperature, conjunctivitis serous discharge, conjunctivitis mucopurulent sneezing, coughing, open-mouth breathing, anorexia, dehydration, one oral ulcer <4 mm, multiple oral ulcers, oral ulcers >4 mm, salivating, non-bleeding external ulcer, and bleeding external ulcers. Cats exhibiting severe clinical signs post-challenge that were consistent with calicivirus pathogenesis were euthanized. As shown in TABLE 2-8, when compared to SQ/SQ vaccination, an SQ/Oral vaccination regimen decreased mortality from 44% to 10% and improved the median clinical score from 12 to 5.5 for cats vaccinated with FELOCELL\u00ae 4. Furthermore, adding the FCV-21 strain to FELLOCELL\u00ae 3 and to FELLOCELL\u00ae 4 resulted in no post-challenge mortality. Replacing the FCV-F9 strain of FELLOCELL\u00ae 3 and FELLOCELL\u00ae 4 with FCV-21 strain resulted in efficacy similar to vaccines containing both FCV-F9 and FCV-21, even for an Oral/Oral vaccination regime. Domestic shorthair cats, about 8 weeks of age, were administered vaccines containing modified-live feline rhinotracheitis virus (FEW), panleukopenia virus FCV-21 (FELOCELL\u00ae 4B). In each case, the cats were administered an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by successive oral administrations on day 21 and day 42 (SQ/Oral/Oral). Each cat within the different dosing regimens (groups T1 to T4, 10 cats per group) received 1 mL of vaccine. Oral vaccination was achieved by administration of the vaccine into the mouth. On day 63, all cats were challenged with approximately 1 mL of virulent systemic FCV-33585 (3 log of TCID50/mL). For 14 days post-challenge, all of the cats were monitored for clinical signs of disease as in EXAMPLE 2-7. Cats exhibiting severe clinical signs post-challenge that were consistent with calicivirus pathogenesis were euthanized. As shown in TABLE 2-9, the efficacy of the triple dose regimen, as measured by post-challenge mortality and clinical scores, is comparable to the efficacy of the double dose regimen described in EXAMPLE 2-7. Serum samples from each cat in the study described in EXAMPLE 2-7 were collected following the second vaccination, but prior to challenge. The samples were heat treated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and evaluated in the serum neutralization assay against each of 26 FCV strains as previously described in EXAMPLE 1-10 (TABLE 1-6). Serum neutralization data were analyzed with cut-off titers of >23 and >15, and an average of the two cut-off titers was calculated (Ave). The results are shown in TABLE 2-10. The data indicate that the cross neutralization profile of FELOCELL 4 (containing FCV-F9) remains constant whether the route of administration is SQ/SQ or SQ/Oral. With the addition of FCV-21, however, the cross neutralization profile is greatly enhanced when the vaccine is administered SQ/SQ or SQ/Oral. Moreover, for FELOCELL 4A (containing FCV-21, but no FCV-F9), the cross neutralization profile is enhanced for SQ/SQ, SQ/Oral and even Oral/Oral vaccination routes. In TABLE 2-11, the vaccination regimens evaluated included an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by two oral booster immunizations on day 21 and day 42 (SQ/Oral/Oral). The results indicate that the addition of FCV-21 with or without FCV-F9 in FELOCELL 4, resulted in significantly broader cross neutralization profiles (=proximate 40% increase). We also disclose our finding that with the vaccines described herein as peptides, proteins, and DNA related to FCV strains FCV-21, FCV-49 and FCV 26391-4, oral or oronasal (ON) administration may be carried out in the first instance followed by a second oral or oronasal administration without the previously disclosed side effects mentioned above in EXAMPLE 2-4 and TABLE 2-5.

Described below are novel combinations of vaccines, that when presented to a feline in the manner described allow for effective single oral and oral/oral and subq/oral deliveries of both FPV and or FHV vaccines. Single oral means a single oral delivery that confers effective protection to a vaccinated animal. By oral/oral is meant an oral delivery given twice, similar to the description above in Part 2. i.e. either oral followed by some period of time and then another dose is given via the oral route, and subq/oral is a first dose given subq followed by some period of time and then another dose is given via oral route. What is described here is the delivery of the combination of modified live FPV and/or modified live FHV in combination with modified live Chlamydia vaccine, or any components of modified live Chlamydia vaccine, e.g. growth medium, cell lysate or whole cells, any components of Chlamydia itself. Chlamydia is also referred to as Feline Chlamydia, or Feline Chlamydia psittaci or FCp. When modified live FPV is given by itself or in combination with modified live FCV, or modified live FHV vaccines, the FPV is not effective when delivered in an oral/oral manner, and shows a decreased SN titer with SQ/oral route of administration. Similarly, when modified live FHV is given by itself or in combination with modified live FCV, or with modified live FPV vaccine, FHV is not effective when delivered in an oral/oral manner, and with shows a decreased efficacy with SQ/oral route of administration. Only when either FPV and/or FHV is given in combination with a modified live Chlamydia vaccine, an adequate protection against FPV and/or FHV is provided, when the delivery of the combination vaccines is either through a subq/oral or oral/oral route. According to the above the following Examples are provided. The following examples are intended to be illustrative and non-limiting, and represent a few specific embodiments of the present invention.Example 3-1 Notional FPV AND CHLAMYDIA. and Chlamydia (or any components of modified live Chlamydia vaccine) is provided in a combination vaccine with or without other components. The modified live vaccines may be delivered subq/oral.Example 3-2 Notional ORAL/ORAL VACCINATION REGIMEN WITH FPV AND CHLAMYDIA. and Chlamydia (or any components of modified live Chlamydia vaccine) is provided in a combination vaccine with or without other components. The modified live vaccines may be delivered oral/oral.Example 3-3 Notional and Chlamydia (or any components of modified live Chlamydia vaccine) is provided in a combination vaccine with or without other components. The modified live vaccines may be delivered subq/oral.Example 3-4 Notional and Chlamydia (or any components of modified live Chlamydia vaccine) is provided in a combination vaccine with or without other components. The modified live vaccines may be delivered oral/oral.Example 3-5 Actual SUBQ/ORAL any components of modified live Chlamydia vaccine) is provided in a combination vaccine with or without other components. The modified live vaccines may be delivered oral/oral (Table 3-1).Example 3-6 Actual any components of modified live Chlamydia vaccine) is provided in a combination vaccine with or without other components. The modified live vaccines may be delivered oral/oral. See Table 3-1. Domestic shorthair cats, about 8 weeks of age, were vaccinated with FELOCELL 4A and 3A components included: an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by subcutaneous boosts on days 21 (SQ/SQ); an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by one oral booster immunization on day 21 (SQ/Oral); or an initial oral vaccination followed by a second oral vaccination on day 21. Oral vaccination was achieved by administration of the vaccine into the mouth. Serum samples from each cat were collected post second vaccination, and heat treated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The samples were evaluated in the serum neutralization assay against FPV. The results from TABLE 3-1 suggest that cats responded minimally to the FPV antigen, as reported previously in the literature. (Absence of an immune response after oral administration of attenuated feline panleukopenia virus. Schults R D, Scott F W, Infect Immun. 1973, Apr. 7 (4): 547-9). With the presence of Chlamydia, however, or any components associated with a Chlamydia vaccine, the FPV SN titers were much higher, suggesting in vivo efficacy against FPV challenge. Moreover, we have observed the enhanced FPV immunigenicity not only with SQ/SQ, SQ/Oral, but also FHV and FCV are provided in a combination vaccine with or without other components. The modified live vaccines may be delivered oral/oral. See Table 3-2. Domestic shorthair cats, about 8 weeks of age, were vaccinated with FELOCELL 3A, which contains modified-live included: an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by subcutaneous boosts on days 21 (SQ/SQ); an initial subcutaneous vaccination followed by one oral booster immunization on day 21 (SQ/Oral); or an initial oral vaccination followed by a second oral vaccination on day 21. Oral vaccination was achieved by administration of the vaccine into the mouth. Serum samples from each cat were collected post first and second vaccination and heat treated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The samples were analyzed in the serum neutralization assay against FPV. The results from TABLE 3-2 suggest that the FPV antigen present in the FELOCELL 3A vaccine induced minimal immune response when given Oral/Oral (consistent with results from TABLE 3-1). When the vaccines were given SQ/SQ or SQ/Oral, however, high FPV SN titers were observed, an indication of in vivo efficacy. Numbered description of the invention.
