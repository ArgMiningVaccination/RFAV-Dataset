[Download our guide to see the different benefits each generation cares about the most](https://www.peoplekeep.com/offers/generational-employee-benefits-comparison-chart) What is holistic health? Holistic health works exactly as it sounds. It treats the whole \"you.\" Unlike conventional medicine, holistic medicine considers a person's physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual facets of health. A holistic health practitioner believes treating these components together is the key to optimal health. This holistic approach to health is a practice known as eastern medicine. Let's go over what makes eastern and western medicine different. Eastern medicine vs. western medicine Western medicine is the term used to describe primary healthcare in the United States. This is a system many of us are familiar with since most medical visits follow the same outline. If you feel sick, you call your doctor's office and make an appointment. Then, you briefly meet with your doctor and explain your symptoms. From there, your doctor typically prescribes medicine to alleviate your symptoms or recommends another course of treatment. Eastern medicine isn't seen as standard care in the U.S. Often, it's added to your ordinary course of medical treatment to further improve your condition. This holistic approach is often referred to as complementary, alternative, or natural medicine. Medical News Today1 explains that eastern medicine encompasses traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda techniques, which have existed for far longer than conventional western medicine. Different types of holistic doctors There are several types of holistic doctors with different areas of expertise. According to Cleveland Clinic2, some holistic doctors have formal degrees obtained from a school of medicine. They pair their conventional training in traditional medicine with holistic approaches to health and treatment. Other holistic providers may not have a standard medical degree. However, they have degrees in various forms of complementary or alternative medicine practices. Common types of holistic treatments If you're ready to start offering holistic health benefits to your employees, they'll have a wide range of treatment options to choose from. Each one uses a different method of healing to address physical and spiritual health. The Pacific College of Health and Science3 offers a few examples of effective treatments common to holistic practice: - Accupunture and accupressure. Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine that's often used to treat pain. It involves inserting thin needles into your skin at specific points on your body. Acupressure is similar to a massage and consists of applying only pressure to those specific points. - Aromatherapy. Aromatherapy focuses on your sense of smell. It's the practice of using essential oils for certain benefits. Lavender is the most popular essential oil, although peppermint, lemongrass, and frankincense are also top choices. Breathing in diffused oils is supposed to help you relax, and it can be helpful for people who experience [stress](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/five-signs-of-a-toxic-work-culture), anxiety, or insomnia. - Ayurvedic medicine. The Ayurvedic practice relies on herbal medicine to address your physical and mental health. - Chiropractic care. Chiropractic care is another alternative medicine that focuses on adjusting and manipulating your spine and neck to improve your body's function. Many people see a chiropractor to treat their physical and muscular pain. - Naturopathic medicine. Like the Ayurvedic practice, Naturopathy uses herbal medicine and other natural treatments to help your body heal. A naturopathic doctor may also incorporate exercise and dietary changes into your lifestyle. - Massage therapy. Many holistic health practitioners will use massage in their treatments. While it can be incredibly relaxing to have tight muscles and tissues loosened, it can also support your overall health and wellness. - Nutrition counselors. A nutrition counselor creates a customized meal plan to help heal your body from within using the [right foods](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/how-to-set-up-a-meal-allowance). - Mental health counseling. Since your mental health can directly affect your physical health, holistic practitioners also focus on what goes on inside your mind. Take stress as just one example. According to the American Psychological Association4, knowing how to properly manage your stress can help prevent heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, and heart disease. - Osteopathy. Osteopathy is similar to chiropractic care. However, it focuses on your whole body rather than the spine itself. This involves your muscles, nerves, and bones. The American Osteopathic Association calls this form of alternative medicine one of the fastest-growing healthcare professions in the country. It reports one out of every four medical students is enrolled in osteopathic medical school. - Yoga. Yoga is more than just exercise. This form of stretching can be beneficial to your spiritual health. It goes beyond strengthening your muscles by calming your mind and bringing awareness to the present moment.
