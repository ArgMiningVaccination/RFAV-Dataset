Be-cause currently there is no cure for AIDS, it is a public heal[}, problemof immense proportions, calling for national efforts to control andeventually eradicate this menacing disease. The schools must be partof this effort because every day they serve more than 47 million stu-dents attending about 90,000 elementary and secondary schools.Schools, among all our social institutions, are best suited to carry outthe only means we currently have to prevent the spread of AIDS, andthat is EDUCATION.Our schools are willing to take the lead in education about AIDS,but many are unsure about how to proceed. They face the issues ofwhat, when, and how to teach students about AIDS and of formulat-ing policies for dealing with students and employees who have AIDS.Because of the sexual issues related to AIDS and because of the fearsassociated with contracting the disease, the topic is highly controver-sial, requiring schools to enter into areas they have never dealt withbefore. This fastback is designed to provide educators with someguidelines for developing an AIDS curriculum and for formulatingschool health policies about AIDS.At the present time, the only defense against AIDS is individualpreventive measures. U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, as wellas such prestigious organizations as the Institute of Medicine and the 77 National Academy of Science, conclude that, in the absence of a vac-cine or medical cure, preventive educational programs are the bestdefense against the spread of AIDS. Dr. Koop stressed that informa-tion should be given in schools before young people reach the agewhen they might adopt high-risk sexual and drug abuse behaviors as-sociated with AIDS. Students need to be informed about ways to pro-tect their health before they make behavioral choices that unknowinglyput them at risk.Parents are asking schools to assume a greater role in AIDS educa-tion. A recent Time magazine poll found that 83% of those surveyedagree that schools should teach young people about AIDS.Even though only about 1% of the total current AIDS cases occurin persons under age 20, the risk of AIDS for young people is high.Many adolescents are sexually active and use intravenous (IV) drugs,both of which are behaviors that increase the risk of exposure to theAIDS virus. For example, studies indicate that by age 19, about 63%of females and 78% of males have had at least one coital experience,with about 28% of persons aged 12 to 17 currently being sexuallyactive (National Research Council 1987). An estimated five millionadolescents have used IV drugs. Sexually transmitted diseases (STD),of which AIDS is one, impair the health of more teenagers than doall other communicable diseases combined (about one-half of STDpatients are below the age of 25). Also of great significance is that,since the incubation period for AIDS can be up to five years or more,many of the cases in the 20 to 29 age group an age group currentlyrepresenting about 21 % of AIDS cases may have become infectedwith the AIDS virus during adolescence. Hence, many young peoplewho now are engaged in high-risk behaviors may develop AIDS intheir twenties. Given these facts, it is apparent that adolescents area high-risk group for AIDS,Even if currently there are not any known AIDS cases or personswith the AIDS virus in a school, it is imperative that all schools adoptpolicies for handling persons with AIDS attending school. Develop-88 ing policy in this area is likely to evoke strong and conflicting views.Many issues must be considered and resolved before policies areadopted and implemented. For example, should students with AIDSbe permitted to attend school without restrictions? What precautionsshould be taken if they do attend classes? How do schools protectthe physical and emotional health of the AIDS student? Which schoolpersonnel, if any, should be informed of the identity of students havingAIDS? Should schools conduct mandatory AIDS antibody testing ofentering students and new employees? And, how does a school dealwith parents and students who object to having students with AIDSin the regular classroom? This fastback will deal with these and otherpolicy issues. 9 9 1 What Do Yon Know About AIDS? Because the media coverage of AIDS has been so extensive, thereare few who have not been exposed to some information about AIDS.The almost daily barrage of news items becomes so overwhelmingthat people sometimes tend to ignore the topic and the issues relatedto it. While people do acquire information about AIDS from the me-dia, the learning often is haphazard, providing only bits and piecesof information. As a result, many persons have incomplete informa-tion and many false notions about the nature of AIDS and about whatone must do to prevent the spread of AIDS. In order not to be amongthe misinformed or half-informed, test your AIDS knowledge withthe brief quiz below. The test items cover the basic preventive healthbehaviors related to AIDS, which should be stressed in AIDSeducation.For each statement, circle the letter T, F, or U to indicate whetheryou believe the statement to be True, False, or Undecided. The cor-tect answers, along with related information, are given in AppendixA on page 44.AIDS Knowledge Self-Test*T F U1.

AIDS is a serious publichealth problem affecting many aspects of our society. Students havea right to be informed, and schools have an obligation to provide thefacts that will enable students to protect their health. Students needto know that AIDS is preventable by practicing certain behaviors thatavoid, or at least minim' ze. the risk of exposure to the AIDS virus.Goals of AIDS EducationThere are different views and considerable controversy amonghealth educators and government officials about the most effectiveapproach to AIDS education. Some existing AIDS education curric-ula have a strong medical/technical approach; sex.\" Adding tothe confusion are the differing views of persons in high governmentposts. For example, U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and Secre-tary of Education William J. Bennett have differed on the instruc-tional emphasis that should be given to various AIDS preventionmethods and on specific moral messages that students should receive.The Reagan Administration's policy on AIDS education in schoolsis presented in a February 1987 Domestic Policy Council Memoran-dum. It recommends that the federal governor, it should not mandate1 Z a specific curriculum; rather, the scope and content of AIDS educa-tion curricula should be determined locally. The memorandum alsocontains important s<ltements stressing abstinence and sexual fideli-ty when teaching about specific AIDS prevention techniques. The im-plications of these statements will be discussed later.Despite some initial confusion over the best approach to AIDS edu-cation, most health educators advocate an approach used in dealingwith other health problem areas, which is to provide sufficient infor-mation and guidance for students to practice intelligent, self-directedbehavior. That is, _'allowing classroom instruction, students shouldbe able to make sound decisions about their own behavior in orderto protect themselves and others from the AIDS virus.When developing an AIDS education curriculum using the life be-haviors approach, it is first necessary to identify the specific behaviorsexpected as a result of instruction. Once the behaviors are identified,they serve to guide both the content to be taught and the instructionalmethods to be used. Following is a list of behaviors that can serveas the basis of an AIDS curriculum.Following AIDS instruction, the student will:PRACTICE a sexual lifestyle that avoids exposure to the AIDSvirus.AVOID sharing drug needles and syringes if using intravenousdrugs.BE ALERT to one's health status relative to AIDS symptom. ifone has practiced high-risk behavior.SEEK medical advice if exposure to the AIDS virus is suspected.AVOID exposing others if an AIDS virus infection is suspectedor diagnosed.GET sexual and IV drug-using partners to seek medical care ifone is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus.FOLLOW the physician's directions if one is diagnosed as havingthe AIDS virus or AIDS. 1313 BE HELPFUL to and supportive of a friend who has AIDS.BE AN ADVOCATE of AIDS education, of AIDS research andhealth care, and of the rights of persons infected with the AIDSvirus.SERVE as a resource for accurate information and advice con-cerning AIDS.In reviewing the above behaviors, one can see how accurate infor-mation, appropriate attitudes, and direct action are all necessary com-ponents in an AIDS education curriculum. If these behaviors arepracticed, then much progress can be made in reducing the spreadof AIDS.Providing Appropriate and Accurate InformationHealth educators stress when teaching about sexually transmitteddiseases (STD), of which AIDS is one, that instructional materialsshould be designed to influence voluntary adoption of health-conducivebehaviors related to the prevention, acquisition, transmission, and dis-position of an STD. A recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) pub-lication (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1985) onguidelines for STD education states:Quality STD instruction means that students will be taught ways toavoid STD, to recognize STD symptoms, to access STD clinics or otherhealth care providers, to follow treatment instructions if infected, andto refer all sex partners for medical care. A school curriculum whichfocuses on the teaching of STD biomedical facts detracts from the pur-pose of STD education and does not represent a quality unit ofinstruction.In a recent analysis of current secondary school health science andsex education textbooks, the researchers attempted to find out if theSTD information presented reflected the viewpoint about STD edu-cation expressed in the above quotation (Kroger and Yarber 1984).They found that the health science textbooks tended to omit almost14 all pertinent information about personal STD preventive behavior andconcluded that such textbooks may be contributing little or nothingtoward reducing the incidence of STD and their health consequences.The sex education textbooks provided a greater amount of informa-tion about appropriate health behaviors, but the use of these textbooksis quite limited nationwide. The lack of information in textbooks aboutthe personal behaviors needed to reduce the incidence of STD is aserious shortcoming. In most schools, the textbook is still the mostfrequently used information source for students to learn about STDand AIDS.Instructional Content in Teaching About AIDSThe instructional content for teaching about AIDS should empha-size the personal behaviors that place one at risk of contracting theAIDS virus and the behaviors that help one avoid infection. Discus-sion of these topics can be simple and direct, since the virus is spreadin only a few ways and only a few behaviors are necessary to preventinfection.Students should be informed that the AIDS virus can be transmittedwhen infected semen, vaginal secretions, or blood enters the vagina,rectum, or mouth of a sexual partner, and by use of contaminatedneedles and syringes. Discussion about prevention methods, whichwill be discussed later, should include sexual abstinence and fidelity,use of condoms to avoid exchange of body fluids, careful selectionand limiting the number of sexual partners, and refusal to share needlesor syringes by IV drug partners. Explicit discussion of \"safe sex\" prac-tices suggested for homosexuals and bisexuals is probably inappropri-ate in schools. However, students should be informed that there areorganizations that can be contacted if further details concerningprevention are desired.Students do not need to know a lot of biomedical information, suchas how the AIDS virus breaks down the immune system. Such infor-mation is not necessary for students to understand how to avoid in- 1515 fection. Moreover, teachers cannot be expected to be experts on im-munology. Teachers should take care not to let classroom discussionfocus mostly on biomedical facts. More appropriate instructionalstrategies for AIDS education are discussions of AIDS social/ethicalissues, examination of one's own attitudes about ;IDS, and the re-hearsal of AIDS preventive health behaviors.When students ask detailed biomedical questions that cannot be an-swered in class, the teacher can assign a group of students to recordthe questions. Then the students can call the local AIDS Hotline orthe AIDS National Hotline (1-800-342-AIDS) for the answers andreport back to the class.The instructional focus should not be on the high-risk groups, perse. For example, students need to know that the AIDS virus is trans-mitted through certain risky sexual and IV drug behaviors, and notbecause a person's sexual orientation happens to be homosexual.The major topics that should be covered in AIDS education are:1. Current information on the seriousness of the AIDS problem.2. The cause of AIDS.3. The frequency of AIDS cases by groups of persons.4. How the AIDS virus is transmitted.5, How the AIDS virus is known not to be transmitted.6. Risk reduction related to sexual behavior.7. Risk reduction related to IV drug use,8. What happens when a person becomes infected with the AIDSvirus.9. How an AIDS virus infection differs from having AIDS.10. Symptoms of infection with the AIDS virus.11. Learning if one is infected with the AIDS virus.12. Avoiding the spread of the AIDS virus by infected persons.13. What one can do to help stop the spread of AIDS.14, Supporting a friend with AIDS.15. How to get more information about AIDS.1616 A summary of the topics listed above is found in the AIDS Sum-mary Sheet in Appendix C on page 56. This sheet can be producedfor class use without permission of the publisher.Moral Issues in Teaching About AIDSThe Reagan Administration's Domestic Policy Council Memoran-dum, mentioned earlier, states that educational material developedby the federal .,,overnment \"should encourage responsible sexual be-haviorbased on fidelity, commitment, and maturity within the con-text of marriage.\" This stance is strongly supported by those whouphold the traditional moral view that sex should be confined to ahusband and wife within a marriage relationship. Therefore, they be-lieve that school AIDS educational material should have a strong \"mor-al\" base. In some instances, they have exerted sufficient politicalpressure on state legislators and local school officials to have theirviews incorporated into the AIDS curriculum.Even though health educators advocate and teach sexual responsi-bility, most are not comfortable with the \"sex within marriage only\"stance, because it is unrealistic given the extent of premarital and ex-tramarital sex in our society. From the standpoint of public healthpolicy, they believe that an objective, scientific approach to AIDSas a communicable disease is the best educational approach. Instruc-tion can stress that responsible sexuality is based on several factors,such as maturity, personal values, and one's own religious beliefs.And instruction can stresF the value stance that each person is respon-sible for his or her own health and the health of others.Explicitness of MaterialsCurriculum writers and teachers often struggle over how explicitinformation should be in terms of the vocabulary and descriptionsof sexual activity used to explain AIDS virus transmission and preven-tion. Educational materials produced for special populations such as,1 717 gay men often use explicit terms or sexual slang unique to the gayculture, and they describe \"safe sex\" techniques in detail. This doesnot seem appropriate or necessary in the school setting. However,school AIDS material for young adults should be honest, frank, andobjective. For example, students need to be informed that vaginal andanal intercourse, and probably oral sex, can transmit the AIDS virus.They also should know that, other than abstinence and sexual fideli-ty, the use of a condom is the only prevention method currently avail-able. These terms should be used and defined when necessary.Vernacular, or street terms, are appropriate only when needed to de-fine the formal term.Sometimes teachers underestimate students' ability to deal with sex-ual topics. Most students appreciate and respect teachers who presentsexual information frankly and honestly and who treat their studentsas mature individuals. Of course, teachers must be sensitive to com-munity values when discussing sexual information.Presenting AIDS Prevention MethodsSome vocal groups argue that sexual abstinence and marital fideli-ty should be the only prevention methods emphasized in AIDS edu-cation. Such groups feel that the use of condoms is overemphasized,characterizing AIDS education as the \"condom-mania\" movement.They also want the \"Just Say No\" approach that is used in drug edu-cation to be the basic emphasis in AIDS education programs in schools.Actually, most current AIDS school curricula do state that sexualabstinence is the most effective preventive strategy. However, mostalso include use of condoms, restricting sex to mutually faithful rela-tionships, avoidance of anonymous and multiple sex partners, andavoidance of sharing IV drug needles and syringes as AIDS preven-tion methods. Despite moral proscriptions, throughout history andespecially today, young people have chosen to be sexually involvedwith another person. A recent survey of 500 teenagers and collegestudents revealed that sexual abstinence as an AIDS prevention method1818 was not considered an acceptable option. Therefore, it seems onlyreasonable that the school's role with students whose sexual behaviorputs them at risk is to inform them about what to do to minimizeexposure to the AIDS virus.There are many ways teachers can communicate messages relatedto sexual morality without resorting to an uncompromising \"Don't doit\" stance. For example, when discussing sexual fidelity as one AIDSprevention method, a teacher could say, \"It's safer to wait for sex un-til one can form a mutually faithful marriage or a long-term faithfulrelationship with one uninfected partner.\" This statement is correct,objective, and is applicable to both marital and non-marital relation-ships, such as gay couples. Yet, the message does stress the valueof confining sex within marriage as a preventive strategy. Using thisapproach will help to ensure greater community acceptance of AIDSeducation.The \"Just Say No\" approach used in drug education is inappropri-ate for school AIDS education. Equating sex with drug abuse mayteach adolescents to be unduly afraid of sex. In school we need toacknowledge the positive aspects of sexuality. Young people shouldbe taught to value and respect sex, to use sex wisely, and to under-stand that sexual expression is possible without the risk of STD, preg-nancy, or AIDS. For example, suggesting mutual masturbation as a\"safe\" form of sexual behavior affirms the existence of young adults'sexuality and recognizes their need for some type of sexual outlet.Dealing with Issues Related to SexualityQuestions about sex are bound to come up during an AIDS educa-tion unit. For example, students may ask questions about homosexu-ality, oral sex, or \"safe sex\" methods for high-risk groups. Someteachers reel uncomfortable discussing explicit sexual practices andare therefore hesitant to teach about AIDS because they know suchquestions will come up. Furthermore, in some communities the dis-cussion of some topics, such as homosexuality, would not be accept- 19Is able and could result in the rejection of AIDS education in the school.Although many health educators believe that AIDS and sexual issuesare so closely related that it is imperati /e to discuss both, others be-lieve that AIDS education can be presented without getting into mattersof explicit sexual behavior,For many schools, a prudent approach is to present AIDS in a uniton communicable diseases in a health course without any detailed dis-cussion of sexual issues. However, if a school already has an estab-lished sex education program, it would seem logical to offer instructionabout AIDS in this program, where it could be integrated with dis-cussion about a variety of sexual issues. Teachers prepared as sexu-ality educators are more likely to be qualified to address the sexualissues related to AIDS. If teachers who a:e not qualified as sexualityeducators are assigned to teach a unit on AIDS, they probably shouldlimit instruction to the basic information about behaviors relating toAIDS virus transmission and prevention. When students ask explicitquestions about sexual matters, the teacher can simply say that suchquestions are beyond the scope of the AIDS unit, or refer the stu-dents to qualified professionals w: o can answer their questions. Promoting Attitudes Conducive to Preventive BehaviorAIDS education not only should provide a basic body of informa-tion but also should foster attitudes that reinforce preventive behaviors.Compared to other STD, AIDS carries a stronger stigma because ofits association with homosexuality and IV drug use. The media havecarried many stories of discrimination against people with AIDS, in- own health and the health of others, recognizing the seriousness ofeluding defenseless children. AIDS education should foster healthyattitudes leading to behaviors such as taking responsibility for one'sthe AIDS problem, practicing preventive behaviors related to sex andIV drug use, getting sex partners to seek treatment if infected withAIDS, showing compassion arm providing support to those with AIDS,2 020 and taking an active role in disseminating accurate information andencouraging further research on AIDS.Fostering attitudes that lead to preventive behaviors will requirethat students have opportunities to practice or \"rehearse\" preventivebehaviors through role playing, scenario writing, simulations, andother types of decision - making exercises. In the classroom, such learn-ing experiences might include:Answering imaginary letters from teenagers with questions aboutAIDS in the form of a newspaper advice column.Writing about or participating in a group discussion on one'sown attitudes concerning the social/ethical issues involved inAIDS prevention.Role playing a scene in which a person discusses AIDS preven-tion with a possible sex partner.Simulating a community task force that is charged with develop-ing policy for dealing with a person with AIDS in the school.Practice using the AIDS National Hotline telephone service.Writing an editorial for the school or community newspaper onthe need for an AIDS education program.Serving on a student committee to write a brochure to dis-seminate facts about AIDS and how to prevent it.Serving on a student committee to review audiovisual materialson AIDS for use in school.Practicing the steps of problem solving by using a typical AIDSproblem faced by young adults.These are only a few suggestions for learning activities. Creativeteachers can think of many more. What is important is that the ac-tivities provide opportunities for student involvement in problem-solving and decision-making tasks and in practicing health-promotingskills. Through such involvement students will develop attitudes con-ducive to health behaviors that will prevent or minimize the spreadof AIDS. 2121 Selecting Instructional MaterialsSelecting appropriate and accurate instructional materials is one ofthe major tar s facing schools that want to implement an AIDS edu-cation program. Because of the urgency of the AIDS problem, manygovernment agencies, voluntary hea',...h organizations, and comm'r-cial publishers have responded by producing a wide variety of in-structional materials. Some of these materials anti t'.eir sources canbe found in Appendix B on page 47. And new materials are comingout almost daily.With the massive amount of materials available, the pi 'Hem ;ora curriculum committee is selectirk, those that are both authoritativeand appropriate for use in schools. In general, the most accurate andup-to-date material comes from local or state health departments andfederal health agencies. However, many commercial publishPr, alsohave produced high quality materials, particularly if they haw beenproduced in cooperation with a government health agency. Since hoone curriculum can possibly fit every classroom, teachers will haveto adapt the content and learning activities in AIDS education materialsto fit their local situation.With such extensive coverage in the media, the public is made awareof new information about AIDS almost on a daily basis. Althoughmost information reported in the media is accurate, teachers and stu-dents should realize that some reports sensationalize certain issuesand do not report all the conclusions of, or do not state the limita-tions of, scientific investigations. Also, students often say that theyhave read or heard something about AIDS that contradicts the ac-cepted views of researchers and public health officials. When this oc-curs, teachers have an excellent opportunity to help students learnhow to be wise consumers of health information and how to assesswhich information sources are most reliable.It goes without saying that all AIDS instructional materials shouldbe reviewed before using them in the classroom. Some of the infor-2222 minion may not be current, some of the concepts may not be explainedfully, or some may not be appropriate for the age group.Placement of AIDS Education in the Established CurriculumIn an already crowded curriculum, where is the most appropriateplace for an AIDS education unit? Some schools have placed it insuch courses as biology, health, home economics. sex education, andsocial studies. This arbitrary placement of the AIDS education unitpresents several problems: varying instructional approaches, unevenquality of instruction, and lack of a single strong advocate for AIDSeducation. If AIDS education is placed in the biology course, theretends to be too much emphasis on the biomedical aspects of the dis-ease. If placed in a social studies course, there is likely to be too muchattention given to the social/ethical aspects of the problem. Further-more, instructors of these classes are not likely to have the appropri-ate preparation in classroom strategies designed to influencehealth-conducive behavior.Because AIDS is fundamentally a public health problem, the mostlogical \"home\" for AIDS education is in the communicable diseaseunit in a health course. Such a placement makes sense pedagogicallybecause health educators are prepared in methods to help studentsmake wise preventive health decisions, which is the essence of AIDSeducation. A further advantage for placing AIDS education in thehealth course is that nearly every school requires at least a semestercourse in health. Ideally, AIDS education should be part of a com-prehensive health science curriculum, which includes instruction aboutother STD and human sexuality.Since AIDS involves many sexually related issues, AIDS educa-tion can be incorporated into a course on human sexuality. This isbeing done successfully in many schools. However, in communitieswhere sex education is controversial, the AIDS education programmay be compromised if it is perceived as sex education. Actually,the AIDS education program can stand alone, since its primary goal 2323 is to promote preventive behavior. Nevertheless, AIDS education canbe more complete as part of a sound sex education program, wheresexually related issues can be discussed if raised by students.Because AIDS receives enormous media coverage, elementaryschool children hear about it and are likely to raise questions. U.S.Surgeon General Koop has made the controversial recommendationthat AIDS instruction be included as part of the health and hygieneprogram as early as third grade. Actually, very few schools offer AIDSeducation below grades six or seven; although teachers do get ques-tions about AIDS from elementary school children. It is more likelyto be offered at the junior and senior high school level.What can be done in AIDS education at the lower elementary schoollevel is to alleviate children's excessive fears about the AIDS epidemicand contraction of the virus. Younger children also can be told thatAIDS is difficult to get and that one cannot be infected simply bybeing near someone who has the virus or AIDS. By the fourth or fifthgrade, when children have a greater interest in and understanding ofhuman sexuality, teachers can provide basic information about howthe AIDS virus is transmitted and how AIDS can be prevented. 24 24 4.: Instructor Qualifications for AIDS Education If inadequately prepared persons arc assigned to teach AIDS educa-tion, the program can be seriously compromised. Such persons arelikely to use inappropriate instructional approaches and to respondawkwardly to student questions and concerns. Since competent healtheducators have the skills needed to teach preventive health behaviors,they would be the most logical choice to teach AIDS education. AIDSinstructors should be able to create a \"safe classroom environmentin which students can discuss AIDS without fear of censorship or rid-icule. They should be able a lead group discussions and values-clarification exercises and be able to communicate with students withease and sensitivity, providing factual information in an c.5jcctivc,unbiased manner.A school system that initiates an AIDS education program shouldprovide inservice education on teaching strategies and basic sc :ntif-ic concepts related to AIDS. Most teachers even health educatorswho completed their professional preparation several ye rs agodo not have an adequate understanding of the goals, content, and meth-odology of AIDS education. In a workshop setting, teachers can gainconfidence in dealing with the AIDS content, especially those whothink they need extensive biomedical Information in order to teachabout AIDS. Actually, the basic concepts teachers need to know con-cerning AIDS virus transmission and prevention are quite simple. 2525 Some schools have used physicians, nurses, and local health depart-ment personnel to provide AIDS instruction. This usually is done toadd credibility to the program or because no one on the faculty feelscompetent to teach about AIDS. Use of medical or public health per-sonml to provide AIDS education on a regular basis is not recom-mended, although .hey certainly can be used as resource speakersoccasionally to supplement classroom instruction. Most of them arenot educators and do not have the skills for working with young peo-ple on AIDS preventive behaviors. Also, they have a tendency to dwelltoo much on biomedical information, which is not necessary. Becauseregular classroom teachers know their stt.Jents and have the instruc-tional skills to carry out the goals of AIDS education, they shouldbe the ones to provide the bulk of AIDS instruction. 26 26 Community Involvement in AIDS Education Most communities support AIDS education in the schools, althoughopposition groups have emerged in some locales. In fact, because ofthe severity of the AIDS problem, many communities are willing toaccept more discussion of the explicit details of AIDS transmissionand prevention than they had previously accepted for other topics inSTD and human sexuality. Nevertheless, teachers still must exercisesome discretion. Generally, community involvement provides strongendorsement for the program.Each community ahould develop its own AIDS education program.The local curriculum committee should include teachers, parents, med-ical personnel, clergy, and students.With the vast amount of AIDS instructional material now availa-ble, a curriculum committee does not need to start from scratch. Oneof the functions ( f the committee might be to review the materialsand select those that seem most appropriate for the community An-other function of the community-based curriculum committee mightbe to handle questions, concerns, and complaints about the programfrom parents and other community members. This relieves teachersand building principals from having to defend the program when criti-cism comes.The need for parental consent for students to participate in the AIDSeducation program is likely to be an issue in many communities. Arecent U.S. Conference of Mayors study of AIDS education in 73 272 of the country's largest sch )ol districts found that 45% of the schooldistricts did require parental permission (U.S. Conference of Mayors1987). In this writer's opinion, AIDS is such a serious public healthproblem that schools should have the authority, and indeed the obli-gation, to provide AIDS education to all students, regardless ofwhether they have parental permission. The final decision, of course,rests with local school officials, who know the political climate oftheir communities.There is an alternative to requiring permission for AIDS educa-tion. At the beginning of the term, teachers offering a unit on AIDScan send parents a letter that provides a general description of thecourse in whichAIDS unit occurs. The letter should describe allthe course topics and include an invitation for parents to come to dis-cuss the course if they so desire. This approach, often used in healthclasses that include sex education topics, does not single out AIDSinstruction as being especially sensitive or controversial. 2S 28 School Health Policies for Persons with AIDS L1985 the Centers for Disease Control issued guidelines to helpschools develop policy for persons in the school environment withAIDS. The guidelines were made in consultation with such organiza-tions as the National Association of Elementary School Principals,the National Association of State Nurse Consultants, the National Con-gress of Parents and Teachers, and the Children's Aid Society. Boththe National Education Association and the National Association ofIndependent Schools have endorsed the CDC guidelines. The Ameri-can Academy of Pediatrics developed nearly identical guidelines in1986.The CDC guidelines state that students who have developed AIDSor are infected with the AIDS virus should be permitted to attendschool in an unrestricted manner, except under certain conditions asdescribed below. It has been interpreted that the guidelines also ap-ply to faculty and staff. Despite the widespread acceptance of the CDCguidelines, efforts to bar persons with AIDS from school continuein some communities.Many states and cities have developed their own policies since theCDC guidelines were published. A review of such policies indicatesthat schools will not automatically bar AIDS-infected persons fromschool; some are us;ng review boards to deal with individual cases;and most are adopting the language used in the CDC guidelines. Sever-al states have passed laws concerning schools and AIDS. For e xam- 2929 pie, Indiana has a law that gives the county health officer, not theschool officials, the authority to decide whether the student is fit toattend school. School districts yet to adopt guidelines should contacttheir state departments of health and education for assistance.The NEA has made a strong policy statement on teachers and staffinfected with the AIDS virus. It states that \"educational employeesshall not be fired, non-renewed, suspended (with or without pay),transferred, or subjected to any other adverse employment action sole-ly because they have tested positive for the AIDS antibody or havebeen diagnosed as having AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC).\"A 1987 Supreme Court ruling appears to provide strong support tothe NEA position. The Court ruled that a federal law protecting hand-icapped persons from discrimination (Section 504 of the 1973Rehabilitation Act) covers persons with contagious diseases.CDC GuidelinesThe CDC guidelines were published in the 30 August 1985 issueof Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, and the American RedCross published them in less technical language in AIDS and Chil-dren: Information for Teachers and School Officials. The reprint ofthe guidelines below is taken from the American Red Cross publi-cation.Not onecase of AIDS is knowntohave been transmitted in a school,day care, or foster care setting. AIDS is not spread through the kindof contact children have with each other, such as touching, hugging,or sharing meals and bathrooms. This is supported by long-termstudies of family members of both adults and children with AIDS. Notone household member has become infected through routine, non-sexual contact with a family member with AIDS.Is Going to School Risky for the Child with AIDS?Children who have damaged immune systems, either from AIDSor other illnesses, risk suffering severe complications from infections3 030 commonly picked up in school or day care centers, such as chickenpox, tuberculosis, herpes, measles and othid diseases.The child's doctor should evaluate the risk of infection, based onthe child's immune status. The risk of acquiring some infections, suchas chicken pox, may be reduced by prompt administration of specificimmune globulin following exposure.Public Health Service Guidelines for Local AuthoritiesThe Public Health Service has developed recommendations to helpstate and local health and education departments formulate their ownguidelines for the education and foster care of children with AIDS.These recommendations are designed to protect and promote the well-being of all children in school and day care settings.Decisions about education and care for children infected withthe AIDS virus should be made by a team including the child'sphysician, public health personnel, parents or guardian, andschool or day/foster care workers.Most infected school-age children should be allowed to attendschool and after-school day care and, if needed, to be placedin a foster home. The benefits of an unrestricted setting outweighthe risks of their acquiring harmful infections. The risk of trans-mitting the virus to others is almost nonexistent.A more restricted environment is advised for infected preschool-age children, for children who cannot control their bowels or blad-der, for children who display such behavior as biting, and forinfected children who have uncoverable, oozing sores. Thesechildren should be cared for and educated in settings that mini-mize the exposure of other children to their blood and body fluids.Persons who are oxposek.: to an infected child's body fluids andexcrement (when changing diapers, for example) must know thatthe child is infected and must know procedures to follow to pre-vent transmission. Disposable diapers should be used, and soileddiapers should be placed in a plastic bag betore discarding.Feces can to flushed down the toilet. Hands should be washedafter exposure to blood and body fluids and before caring for 31al another child. Gloves should be worn if open sores are presenton the caretaker's hands. Any open sore on the infected childshould also be covered.Blood and body fluids on surfaces should be cleaned with onepart household bleach diluted in 10 parts water.The hygienic practices of an infected child may improve as thechild moures, or they may deteriorate if the child's condition wor-sens. For these reasons, the need for a restrictea environmentshould be re-evaluated regularly.Adoption and foster care agencies should consider screeningfor AIDS virus infection before a child is placed in a foster or adop-tive home. Foster and adoptive parents should be aware thatthey will need to learn about special care for the child.There is no reason to screen all children before they begin school.The records of children with AIDS should be kept confidential.The number of people who are aware of the child's conditionshould be kept to the minimum needed to assure proper careof the child and to detect situations, such as a bleeding injury,that may pressot a potential for transmission.All educational and public health departments are strongly en-couraged to inform parents, children, and educators about AIDSand its transmission. Questions and Answers About Children with AIDS in SchoolThe Indiana State Board of Health has produced a flier that providesanswers to frequent questions asked by school officials about studentswith AIDS or who have the AIDS virus. Portions of the text arereprinted below with permission of the Indiana State Board of Health,1330 W. Michigan St., P.O. Box 1964, Indianapolis, IN 46206.Question: What is the nature and degree of risk to a student withAIDS who attends a public school? To his or her fellow students? Tostaff?Answer: It is reasonable to believe that a child with AIDS in a schoolsetting may be at some increased risk of acquiring certain infections3,232 from the other students. This would be similar to the situation encoun-tered by children with defective immune systems due to other causes.The degree of risk would need to be assessed by the child's physi-cian, who along with the child's parents and local health officials canthen decide whether the child will attend school.With respect to possible risk to other students and staff, the Centersfor Disease Control (CDC) to date has no evidence that the AIDS vi-rus has been transmitted among school children or through casualcontact with infected persons. No cases of AIDS or AIDS virus infec-tion have been reported to date in the classmates or teachers of in-fected children who have attended school.Question: Is AIDS transmitted by saliva, coughing, sneezing, tears,perspiration?Answer: There is no current evidence indicating that transmissionof AIDS occurs by casual contact. There have been no reported in-stances where AIDS virus transmission could be attributed to saliva,or to coughing, sneezing, tears, or perspiration.Question: If a student with AIDS coughs or sneezes, what meas-ures should be taken to safeguard others in the room? On how smallan airborne particle of body fluid can the AIDS virus be transported?Over what distance can the AIDS virus be transported by an airborneparticle of body fluid? How long can the AIDS virus live when trans-ported by an airborne particle of body fluid?Answer: If a student with AIDS coughs or sneezes, they should covertheir mouth or nose (as should any individual who is coughing or sneez-ing). However, this covering of the mouth or nose is not s3en as a wayto prevent the transmission of the AIDS virus, since evidence to dateindicates that coughing or sneezing are not involved in transmission.The answers to the questions regarding airborne particles are notknown. However, again, the evidence to date does not implicate air-borne spread as a way in which the AIDS virus can be transmittedto other persons.Question: What constitutes \"casual contact?\" Is there a \"casual contact\" at home and at school? 33 Answer: In general terms, casual contact refers to contact otherthan sexual contact, and other than the contact that takes place be-tween a mother and her infant during the birth process and duringbreast feeding.Casual contact at home might be expected to be closer than thatoccurring in a school setting, and it could probably be expected thatin the home a person would likely have some contact with other fami-ly members' body fluids. This means that if the AIDS virus could bespread by casual contact, it would be more likely to occur in a familysetting than in a school. However, CDC and other investigators havefollowed family members of AIDS patients and found no instanceswhere any of these persons have become infected, unless they weresexual partners of the AIDS patient or were infants born to an alreadyinfected mother. This is strong evidence to date against transmissionof the virus through casual contact. Question: What disinfectants will effectively inactivate the AIDS viruson environmental surfaces?Answer: 'There Are a number of disinfecting agents which inacti-vate the AIDS virus. Prior to using one of these disinfectants on a con-taminated surface, the spilled blood or other body fluid should becleaned up with disposable towels or rags and soapy water. Then thedisinfectant should be put on the surface and allowed to air dry.Effective inactivators of the AIDS virus include household bleachsuch as or Purex (5.25% EDTA 0.76%).Question: May an AIDS student share a drinking fountain withothers? If so, what cleanliness measures mu3t be taken?Answer: There is no evidence to date that the AIDS virus is trans-mitted through drinking fountains. There currently is no reason whya student with AIDS should be prohibited from using a drinking foun-tain. The current evidence of how AIDS is transmitted does not neces-sitate any extraordinary cleaning measures.34\u00b034 Question: May an AIDS student share cafeteria/eating facilities withother students? What measures are necessary to insure that utensilsare free from the AIDS virus?Answer: There is no known reason a student with AIDS cannot sharecafeteria/eating facilities with other students. The current evidenceof how AIDS is transmitted does not necessitate special cleaning proce-dures for eating utensils. These utensils should be washed in a properlyfunctioning dishwasher, or if washed manually they should be sani-tized with a hypochlorite solution, as described above.Question: Is the chlorine present in the water of a swimming poolsufficient to kill the AIDS virus? May an AIDS student share swimmingfacilities with others?Answer: No studies have beer Jone which specifically evaluate theability of chlorine, at the levels found in sw; nming pool water, to inac-tivate the AIDS virus. It currently seems highly unlikely that the AIDSvirus infection could be transmitted in a swimming pool.Question: May an AIDS student participate in physical educationactivities? May an AIDS student share shower facilities with other stu-dents? If so, what cleanliness measures must be taken?Answer: There is no known reason why a student with AIDS maynot participate in physical education activities with his or her physi-cian's approval. The student with AIDS can share shower facilities withothers. The current evidence of how the AIDS virus is transmitted doesnot necessitate any extraordinary cleaning measures.Question: May an AIDS student participate in musical activities usinga wind instrument? If so, what cleanliness measures must be taken?Answer: There is no known reason why a student with AIDS can-not use a wind instrument. He or she should not share the use of theirmouthpiece with others (as would be the case for any student witha wind instrument). The current evidence of how the AIDS virus is trans-mitted does not necessitate any extraordinary cleaning measures.Question: With what provisions may an AIDS student participatein home economics classes which involve cooking? In industrial artsshop classes in which cutters and abrasives are used? 3535. Answer: Them is no known reason why a student with AIDS maynot participate in home economics classes and industrial arts classesas long as his or her physician and parents approve. AIDS is not con-sidered to be a food-borne disease. In an industrial arts shop class,the student with AIDS should follow the same safety practicesprescribed for other students. If an accident with blood spillage oc-curs, this should be handled as described in the CDC guidelines.Question: Should the child with AIDS be removed from school whenother students have, for example, impetigo, colds, mononucleosis, per-tussis, or fungal or bacterial infections? What degree of illness suchas colds or flu must be present in other students or staff before anAIDS student should be sent home?Answer: Prior arrangements should be made between the child'sphysician, the parents, school officials, and the school nurse regard-ing the types and degrees of illnesses that would have to be presentin the school to necessitate sending the child home.Question: What added risks are present and what precautions arerecommended for an adolescent female student with AIDS regardingthe disposal of [menstrual] sanitary items?Answer: There should be no increased risk as long as \"sanitaryitems\" are disposed of properly (flushable items should be flusheddown the toilet; nonflushable items should be placed in a receptaclewhich is lined by a leakproof bag). If bloo-' would happen to get onthe toilet, floor, etc., this should be handled as described in the CDCguidelines. The student with AIDS should wash her hands immedi-ately after handling \"sanitary items,\" as should any other female ina similar circumstance.Question: What extraordinary measures and precautions must aschool nurse take to protect herself? Between contact with a studentwith AIDS and other students?Answer: The school nurse should take precautions not to come intodirect contact with the AIDS student's body fluids. For example, if shewere cleaning a laceration, she should be wearing gloves. She shouldtake care that she does not get body fluids on her clothing (under some3636 circumstances she might want to consider a disposable gown). If herclothing becomes contaminated with body fluids from the child withAIDS (or from any other child), she should change into other clothing.The contaminated clothing should be placed in a leakproof bag forwashing. In washing clothing grossly contaminated with body fluids,reasonable steps would be to use hot water, household bleach suchas Chlorox or Purex (5.25% NaOCI), and run the clothing throughtwo consecutive wash cycles. If she has contact with the child's bodyfluids, she should wash her hands as soon as possible. Otherwise,no additional steps need be taken before she has contact with otherstudents.Question: What guidelines should be followed for transportation ofthe student with AIDS to and from school? What extraordinary meas-ures should be taken in case of an accident causing bodily injury andbleeding?Answer: The same guidelines that apply to any student should befollowed. In case of injury involving bleeding, care should be takennot to come into direct contact with the blood (see CDC guidelines),a precaution which should be taken in the case of any student withbleeding. In confidence, emergency medical personnel and othersproviding assistance should be informed that the child has AIDS.Question: What guidelines should apply to brothers and sisters ofa student with AIDS?Answer: Evidence currently available indicates that brothers andsisters of children with AIDS are not at increased risk of acquiring theAIDS virus infection from their infected sibling. Therefore, no addi-tional precautions need be taken with brothers and sisters of an AIDSpatient.Question: How long is the AIDS virus able to survive outside thehuman body?Answer: Evidence indicates that small amounts of the AIDS viruscan probably survive in dried body fluids for several days. However,contact with a contaminated environmental surface has not to datebeen demonstrated to play a role in infection with the virus. Question: Does the student with AIDS require a daily physical ex-amination or a daily temperature determination when attending school?Who is responsible for monitoring the child with AIDS?Answer: A daily physical examination or a daily temperature de-termination should not be necessary. The child's teacher should noti-ti the school nurse of signs of illness in the child, just as would bedone with any other ill student in class. The nurse can then evaluatethe situation and, if it is felt to be necessary, contact the child's par-ent and/or physician.Question: What precautions should be taken regarding rest roomfacilities?Answer: The student with AIDS can use regular rest room facili-ties. According to the current evidence of how the AIDS virus is trans-mitted, no precautions beyond those listed in the guidelines arerequired. Rest rooms which may be used by menstruating femalesshould have a receptacle lined with a leakproof bag where used \"sani-tary items\" may be disposed.Question: How should towels used by the student with AIDS belaundered?Answer: Tower should be laundered in the usual manner unlessthey become grossly contaminated with blood or other body fluid. Ifsuch contamination occurs, they should be placed in a leakproof bagfor washing. In washing a towel grossly contaminated with body fluid,reasonable steps would be to use hot water, household bleach suchas Chlorox or Purex (5.25% NaOCI), and run the towel through twoconsecutive wash cycles.Question: What steps should be taken by an individual who comesinto direct contact with body fluids from a student wit'n AIDS?Answer: Persons who come into direct contact with body fluids froma person with AIDS should immediately wash the area thoroughly withsoap and water (Just as they should if they come into contact with anyother person's body fluids).Question: If a student with AIDS also has hemophilia and frequentnosebleeds, of what concern is this since other students might possi-3838 bly come into direct contact with hip blood? Could infectious bloodcoming into direct contact with an open sore or wound result in infec-tion? What about blood spillage in classrooms and hallways?Answer: If a child with AIDS has a nosebleed, the main concernwould be that others do not come into direct r:ontact with the blood.Blood spillage in a classroom or hallway should be handled asdescribed in the guidelines.Question: Given the fact that the AIDS virus has been isolated fromthe saliva of some patients with AIDS, what concern is there that stu-dents, or the items they use at school, might come into contact withthe saliva of the student with AIDS? What precautions should be taken?Answer: Although the AIDS virus has been found in saliva, its con-centration in this body fluid is less than that found in blood or semen.This leads to the conclusion that if saliva could serve as a means ofInfection, there would likely have to be direct contact with relativelylarge amounts of it, especially in light of evidence which indicates thatexposure to relatively large amounts of virus may be needed beforeinfection can occur. The possibility of coming into contact with quan-tities of saliva sufficient to result .,, infection under the conditions ofcontact that occur in a school setting would seem to be minimal. Nospecific precautions are felt to be necessary in this regard. :3 9,39 Conclusion Schools have a responsibility and an obligation to help young peo-ple protect themselves from the AIDSvirus The projection of thenumber of young people that AIDSwill claim in the future leavesno alternative. People who will have AIDSin 1991 are in high schooltoday; those who will have AIDSin 1995 are in grade school.TodayAIDSrivals cancer as the most feared disease in the nation.Yet many young people live with illusion that they are invulnei abletoAIDS.A recent survey of 500 teenagers and college students foundthat only 3% would curtail their sexual activity because of fear ofcontractingAIDS.Certainly, not all students are at risk; but othersare because of their sexual behavior and IV drug abuse. Allstudentshave the right toAIDSinformation.Every school district must develop ..h AIDSeducation curriculumand establish policies on persons who have AIDSor are carrying theAIDSvirus The CDC guidelines can serve as a model for such poli-cies. There must be a unified approach to AIDSeducation, with honestand frank discussion and quality educational materials that empha-size health-conducive preventive behaviors. AIDSeducation can beincorporated into the health curriculum, which includes education insexually transmitted diso.ases and human sexuality.Educators must take the lead in guaranteeing that every young per-son knows how to prevent contracting the AIDSvirus.

Most health experts believe that from about 10% to 30%of those infected with the AIDS virus will develop AIDS.2. The AIDS virus itself usually does not kill the personTrue. People with the AIDS virus acquire a variety of diseases thatare not usually caught by healthy people, because their immune sys-tem has been weakened. The persons die from these diseases, notusually from the AIDS virus, per se.3. A person having the AIDS virus can pass it on even though thatperson shows no AIDS symptoms.True. Persons with the AIDS virus can transmit it to others evenif symptoms do not develop. Also, one cannot determine if anotherperson has the AIDS virus from the person's appearance4. During sexual activity, exchange of such body fluids as semenis one way of transmitting the AIDS virus.True. Intimate sexual contact is the most common way the AIDSvirus is transmitted. It can be passed when infected semen, vaginalsecretion, or blood enters the vagina, rectum, or mouth of a sexualpartner.,4444 5. Drug users who share needles and syringes are at high risk forgetting the AIDS virus.True. When IV drug users have the AIDS virus, their infected bloodis exchanged when they share their needles and syringes.6. A person can get the AIDS virus from giving blood.False. One cannot get the AIDS virus from donating olood sinceall equipment used to take blood donations is sterile,7. Only homosexual and bisexual males get AIDS.False. Anyone, heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, who en-gages in risky sexual or IV drug use behaviors can acquire the AIDSvirus. It is the risky behaviors, not one's sexual orientation, that placesthe person at risk.8. Women can transmit the AIDS virus to sex partners.True. Male partners of infected women have become infected withthe AIDS virus. There have been very few woman-to-woman trans-missions.9. A positive antibody test for the AIDS virus means that the per-son has developed or will develop AIDS.False. The presence of the antibodies does not mean that the per-son has or will develop AIDS; some become very ill and others do not.10. Students who have engaged in high-risk sexual or IV drug-usingbehaviors can get confidential AIDS testing and counseling.True. Local or state health departments provide AIDS testing siteswhere confidential testing and counseling is available for all persons,including teenagers.11. The AIDS virus can be spread through everyday social con-tact, such as touching or being near a person with AIDS.False. No one should be afraid of getting the AIDS virus by casual,social, or family contact. People can, for example, work with others,attend school and public evtnts, eat at restaurants, and be around mem-bers of high-risk groups without the fear of getting the AIDS virus.4545 12. A person who either practices sexual abstinence or restricts sexto an uninfected partner and remains faithful to that partner and whodoes not use IV drugs has almost no chance of getting the AIDS virus.True. The surest way of not getting the AIDS virus is to abstainfrom sexual intercourse and other intimate sexual acts. Further, itis nearly impossible for a couple practicing sexual fidelity to get AIDS.This is true unless Gne partner is already infected at the start of therelationship, or if either partner uses IV drugs and shares needles orsyringes.13. The use of condoms when having sex is an effective way toreduce the risk of getting the AIDS virus.True. The use of condoms prevents body fluids, such as semen,vaginal secretions, or blood, from entering one's body. However, thereis still some risk since the condom is not 100% effective,14. A person infected with the AIDS virus through IV drug usecan pass the virus to a sex partner even though the partner does notuse IV drugs.Ti ue. The infected person can transmit the AIDS virus during in-tercourse or other intimate sexual contact.15. There is a national, toll-free, telephone hotline that providesAIDS information.True. In the United States the number is 1-800-342-AIDS. 4 6 46 Appendix BSelected Resources for AIDS Educationand Health Policy Space permits only a selective listing of the many AIDS educationmaterials currently available.

The numberof cases is increasing in the United States and many nations of theworld. One to two million persons a the U.S. may have become in-fected with the AIDS virus. In addition, five to ten million personsworldwide may have the AIDS virus. Only a fraction of these peoplehave developed AIDS. There is no cure for the condition. Hence,most persons who develop AIDS finally die. Experts believe that54,000 people in the U.S. will die from AIDS in 1991. Further, thereis no vaccine that can protect persons from getting the virus. Preven-tion is now the only way to control AIDS. AIDS is prevented by avoid-ing behavior that results in infection.What is AIDS? AIDS is caused by a virus that weakens the im-mune system. Therefore, the person with the AIDS virus may ac-quire severe infections. A person is considered nailing AIDS onceone or more of several infections develop. The disease acquired, notthe AIDS virus, usually kills the person. The percent of persons in-fected with the AIDS virus that will develop AIDS or become ill is *This AIDS Summary Sheet may be reprinted without permission of thepublisher for use with secondary school students and others. Adapted fromAIDS: What Young Adults Should Know by William L Yarber (AmericanAlliance Publications, 1987).,-,tib56 not known for sure. The virus can be transmitted soon after a per-son becomes infected. This is true even if the person never developsAIDS.How is the virus transmitted? The AIDS virus is present in se-men, vaginal secretions, and blood. The AIDS virus is not highly con-tagious. It is mainly transmitted by sexual contact and by sharing IVdrug needles and syringes. There are no known cases where AIDShas been transmitted by saliva. The virus can also be passed froma woman to her unborn or newborn child. Anyone heterosexual,homosexual, or bisexualengaging in risky sexual or drug-use be-havior with an infected person can get the AIDS virus. The AIDSvirus is not spread by casual, social, or family contact. You cannotget the AIDS virus by touching or being near a person with AIDSor who is infected with AIDS virus.Currently in the U.S., the AIDS cases have been: homosexual orbisexual men (about 66%); heterosexual IV drug users (about 17%);homosexual and bisexual men who are IV drug users (about 8%);heterosexuals (about 4 %); undetermined (about 3 %); and recipientsof AIDS contaminated transfused blood or blood-clotting factor (about3%). Some health authorities believe that the percentage of infectedheterosexual men and women will increase in the U.S.How AIDS is diagnosed. A person should be concerned about be-ing infected with the AIDS virus if engaging in risky sexual or IVdrug-use behaviors. There is a test for antibodies to the AIDS virus.Positive test results mean that the person has been infected with thevirus, but the person may not have or may not even develop AIDS.The development of certain serious illnesses is how physicians deter-mine if a person has AIDS. The antibody is also used to screen do-nated bloct semen, and body tissues am! organs. Persons engagingin high-risk behaviors should consult with a physician, an AIDS or-ganization, or the health department about taking the test. Local orstate health deFartments and many AIDS organizations have confiden-tial testing for all persons, including teenagers.5757 The incubation period for AIDSranges from a few months to manyyears. Symptoms of infection with the AIDSvirus include: swollenlymph glands, night sweats, extreme tiredness, weight loss, and di-arrhea. Only a physician can diagnose AIDS.Preventing AIDS. To help prevent getting the AIDSvirus: 1) avoidsexual intercourse and intimate sex; 2)practice sexual fidelity in mar-riage or in a long-term relationship with an uninfected partner;3)use condoms during all sexual contact; 4)avoid mouth contact witha partner's semen, blood, vaginal secretions, or body waste; 5) avoidanonymous, high-risk, and multiple sex partners; and 6) avoid shar-ing IV drug needles and syringes, preferably by not using IV drugsexcept by physician's order. Acondom should be used when havingsex with anyone other than a faithful and uninfected partner. Eventhen, there is still some risk since the condom is not 100% effective.Aperson should discuss personal health responsibilities with a sexu-al partner.Promoting AIDS prevention efforts. One can help fight AIDSby:,1) correcting misinformation; 2)providing financial support to AIDSorganizations; 3)voicing concern to government officials; and 4)giv-ing moral support to those with AIDS.Keeping informed about AIDS. For the latest information ormaterials onAIDS,contact the local or state health department, aphysician, anAIDSorganization, or a local AIDStele;tone hotline.These sources can tell a person about the location cf AIDStesting,health care, and support services in your community. Also,theAIDSNational Hotline(1-800-342-AIDS)can be contacted.Final Note. Even though there is no cure or vaccine for AIDS,infection with theAIDSvirus can be prevented.
