Copies of the legislation can be obtained from the Department of Health website <http://www.doh.gov.za> or the SAHPRA website www.sahpra.org.za This guideline provides the classification rules for the classification of medical devices (Non- IVDs) and IVDs in South Africa. The aim of this Guideline is to assist manufacturers, importers, distributors and wholesalers of medical devices and IVDs in the classification of medical devices and IVDs required for the licensing of manufacturers, distributors and whol esalers and registration of medical devices or IVDs. The types of medical devices or IVDs include all products classified as per the different Classes based on a risk assessment and intended use. The Guideline is meant to provide guidance in meeting the requirements of the Act. It is acknowledged, however, that in some instances scientific developments may dictate alternative approaches. When a deviation from a guideline is decided on, a detailed motivation giving the reason(s) for the deviation and justification for the alternative approach should be included in the expert report submitted with the application. Whenever there is doubt, applicants are advised to consult The Authority (SAHPRA ) for confirmation and/or clarification before completing and submit ting the application form; refer to the website for contact details. Applicants should always refer to the current version of the relevant Classification Rules for Medical Devices and IVDs and the Addenda thereto. Guidelines are constantly evolving as a result of scientific developments and harmonization of the requirements of regional and international regulatory authorities. The Authority (SAHPRA) endeavors to regularly update the guidelines to reflect current thinking and keep its technical requirements and evaluation policies in line with \"best international medical device and IVD regulatory practice\". 2 CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES (Non - IVDs) 2.1 OVERVIEW The medical devices regulatory framework has a classification system for medical devices and IVDs, as per the regulations of Act 101 of 1965. A medical device, other than an IVD medical device, has the medical device classification applying under the classification rules set out in the Classification Rules for Medical Devices. An IVD medical device has the medical device classification applying under the classification rules set out in the Classification Rules for IVDs. 8.5 _Classification_Medical_Devices_IV Ds_Jul16_v1_for_finalisation July 2016 Page 4 of 43 Back to ToC NOTE: This guideline presents the classification rules for a Medical Device or IVD, and should be read in conjunction with the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965), and the Regulations to this Act Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices _IVDs_Nov 19_v2_for_finalisation Nov 2019 Page 5 of 43 The classification levels for medical devices are: Classification Level of risk Class A Low risk Class B Low-moderate risk Class C Moderate - high risk Class D High risk Where risk relates to the patient or to public health The manufacturer or distributor is responsible for determining the classification of a medical device using a set of classification rules supplied by The Authority , based on the: manufacturer's or distributor's intended use of the device or IVD level of risk to patients, users and other persons (the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm) degree of invasiveness in the human body duration of use and exposure. Identical medica l devices may be classified differently if they are to be used in different parts of the body. This is why the original manufacturer's intended use of the device is critical to determining the appropriate classification. The intended use can be obtained fr om the: instructions for use label original manufacturer's advertising materials technical documentation Note: There may be medical devices or IVDs where the classification in South Africa is different to the classification in other countries. The applicant should take into account the South African requirements when determining the classification of a device that is to be supplied in South Africa. 2.2 PRINCIPLES FOR APPLYING THE CLASSIFICATION RULES The classification rules are outlined in technical r ules for medical devices and technical rules for IVDs. The classification process is based on the manufacturer's intended purpose, taking into account the design and how the medical device or IVD works. In some cases, classification is inconclusive and more than one rule can apply. If this happens the higher classification applies. All the classification rules must be considered to determine the classification of the medical device or IVD. Accessories are classified separate to the medical device they are used with. If the device is to be used in combination with another medical device, the classification rules must be applied separately to each device. For groups, systems and procedure packs, the classification for the entire group, system or pack is the highest classification of any individual device in the group, system or pack. The presence of a registered medicine in a procedure pack does not affect the classification. For example, if there is a device in the pack that is classified as Class C, then the entire pack is classified as Class C. Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices _IVDs_Nov 19_v2_for_finalisation Nov 2019 Page 6 of 43 Manufacturers & Distributors should pay particular attention to Rules 13, 14, 15 & 16\u2014 Additional rules , as these rules may not be applied consistently internationally. Software: that fits the definition of a medical device is also an active medical device since it relies on an energy source for its operation; that is intended to mak e a device operate, control a device, or influence the functions of a device generally falls in the same classification as the device; intended as an accessory to a medical device should be classified separately from the device with which it is used; and is considered an accessory when it is not essential to the operation of the device. If the intended purpose of the medical device or IVD is not clear, The Authority will request further clarification from the manufacturer or Authorised Representative. If t he documentation requested is not provided within the required period or is unclear, then The Authority will assume an intended purpose consistent with the purpose generally accepted in current clinical practice. If a medical device is intended to be used in more than one part of a patient's body, the medical device is classified on the assumption that it will be used in the part of the body that poses the highest risk. For invasive devices, this may be the central circulatory or central nervous systems. In the event of a dispute resulting from application of the classification rules, The Authority shall determine the classification. 2.3 MEDICAL DEVICES WITH A MEASURING FUNCTION A medical device is considered to have a measuring function if the device is intend ed by the manufacturer to a) measure quantitatively a physiological or anatomical parameter, or b) measure a quantity or a qualifiable characteristic of energy, or c) measure substances delivered to or removed from the human body. The measurements given by a medical device must: display in South African legal units of measurement or other units of measurement acceptable to The Authority , or be compared to at least one point of reference indicated in South African legal units of measurement or other units of measurement acceptable to The Authority , and be accurate to enable the device to achieve its intended purpose. The medical device with a measuring function must meet each of the above requirements. Manufacturers of medical devices that have a measuring function must prepare evidence that the device complies with the relevant Essential Principles, particularly Essential Principle 10. For more information, see Guideline 8.02 Essential Principles of Saf ety and Performance.

Absolute measurement units/reference Measurement critical to intended purpose Clinical thermometer that displays patient temperature in \u00baC Yes Yes Yes Measuring function Forehead patch that indicates temperature via colour change Yes No Yes Does not have a measuring function Time -of-day clock (HH:MM) No Yes Yes Does not have a measuring function Medicine measuring cup with ml or defined Units marked Yes Yes Yes Measuring function Medicine cup with no scale Yes No No Does not have a measuring function \"Biofeedback\" electromyography (relative scale) Yes No Yes Does not have a measuring function Diagnostic electromyography Yes Yes Yes Measuring function 2.5 MEDICAL DEVICES REQUIRED TO BE STERILE Some medical devices are required to be sterile when used to minimize the risk of infection. Such medical devices should be terminally sterilized to a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of at least 10- 6, unless this is not possible due to device material incompatibility with the proposed sterilization process. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine the most appropriate method for achieving the required SAL for a particular device after due consideration of the design and construction of the device. Some common sterilization methods are: moist heat or steam dry heat ionizing radiation ethylene oxide liquid chemical sterilization Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices _IVDs_Nov 19_v2_for_finalisation Nov 2019 Page 8 of 43 Devices that are required to be sterile, but cannot be subjected to terminal sterilization, can be manufactured aseptically, for example by sterile filtration. Devices manufactured in this manner have a lower SAL than those subjected to terminal sterilization . Manufacturers of medical devices that are required to be sterile must prepare evidence that the device complies with: Essential Principle 8.3 for devices that are supplied sterile Essential Principle 8.1 for devices that are able to be reprocessed For more information, please see Guideline 8.02 Essential Principles of Safety and Performance. For manufacturers of Class A devices that are required to be sterile, in addition to preparing a South African Declaration of Conformity, they must supply The Authority with conformity assessment evidence to demonstrate that the relevant Essential Principles have been met.

A medical device, other than an IVD medical device, has the medical device classification applying under the classification rules set out in the Technical Rules for Classificat ion of Medical Devices. An IVD medical device has the medical device classification applying under the classification rules set out in the Technical Rules for Classification of IVDs. The classification levels for IVDs are: Classification Level of risk Class A no public health risk or low personal risk Class B low public health risk or moderate personal risk Class C moderate public health risk or high personal risk Class D high public health risk The same classification rules apply to both commercial IVDs and in- house IVDs. The manufacturer or distributor is responsible for determining the class of an IVD using the classification rules and having regard to: the manufacturer's intended use of the device; and the level of risk to the patient and the public (taking into account the likelihood of harm and the severity of that harm). Identical devices may be classified differently if they are to be used for different diagnostic purposes. This is why the manufacturer's intended use of the device is critic al to determining the appropriate class. The intended use can be obtained from the: Information provided with the IVD (including Instructions for Use and labelling) Advertising materials Design dossier (if applicable). Note: There may be medical devices or IVDs where the classification in South Africa is different to the classification in other countries. The manufacturer or distributor should take into account the South African requirements when determining the classification of a device that is to be supp lied in South Africa. Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 30 of 43 3.2 PRINCIPLES FOR APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFICATION RULES The classification rules are based on the manufacturer's intended purpose, taking into account the degree of risk involved to the patient and the public. The c lassification must be consistent with the information accompanying the IVD including the labels, Instructions for Use, brochures and operating manuals. If the intended purpose of the device is not clear, The Authority will request further clarification from the manufacturer and may also consider the purpose generally accepted in clinical and laboratory practice. All the classification rules must be considered to determine the classification of the IVD. In some cases, more than one classification rule may be applicable to an IVD, but if this occurs the higher risk classification applies. There are exceptions to thi s principle, whereby a number of the classification rules state that despite certain other rules, a particular risk classification should always apply to a type of IVD. These include for example, Rule 1.5 which specifies that IVDs that are non assay -specif ic quality control material are Class B IVDs. A number of IVDs are supplied with, or are required to be used in combination with other IVDs, non- IVD medical devices or accessories to medical devices. The classification rules must be applied separately to each device. An accessory to an IVD is described as an item that its manufacturer specifically intends to be used together with an IVD, to enable that IVD to be used as intended. Accessories are classified independently of the IVD that they are to be used with. Materials that are intended to be used for the calibration or quality control of a particular named assay are considered to be part of a single assay with a common intended purpose. Therefore, they have the same risk classification as each of the other assay components based on the common intended purpose of the assay, even if these materials are sold separately. If one or more IVDs are supplied as part of a system or a procedure pack, the class for the entire pack is the highest class of any individual IVD in the pack. For example, if a procedure pack contains a selection of Class A, B and C IVDs, then the entire pack is classified as a Class C IVD. If a procedure pack contains a mixture of IVDs and non- IVD medical devices, the individual component of the highest Class will determine the overall classification of the procedure pack. The individual device of the highest Class will also determine if the procedure pack is to be included in the IVD Register as an IVD medical device or a non- IVD medical dev ice. For example, a procedure pack contains a portable prothrombin time meter (Class A IVD), test strips or cartridges for prothrombin time self-testing (Class C IVD), and a lancet (Class B medical device) for obtaining a blood specimen. The procedure pack would take on the highest classification assigned to any individual component, namely Class C IVD, and is required to be included in the IVD Register as an IVD medical device. When an IVD and a medical device within a procedure pack are of the same classi fication level (equivalent risk class) the primary intended purpose of the device is to be considered to determine whether the pack is included on the Register as an IVD or a medical device. Where components of a procedure pack are also supplied separately , they need to be separately included in the Register E.g. Medical devices such as lancets. In the event of a dispute resulting from application of the classification rules, The Authority shall determine the classification Software: that fits the definition of a medical device is also an active medical device since it relies on an energy source for its operation Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 31 of 43 3.2 Principles for application of the classification rules continued that is intended to make a device operate, control a device, or influence the functions of a device generally falls in the same classification as the device intended as an accessory to a medical device shou ld be classified separately from the device with which it is used is considered an accessory when it is not essential to the operation of the device. 3.3 CLASSIFICATION RULES FOR IVDS 3.3.1 Classification Rule 1 - Detection of transmissible agents posing a high public health risk An IVD medical device intended to be used for any of the following purposes is classified as a Class D IVD medical device: a) to detect the presence of, or exposure to, transmissible agents in blood, blood components, blood products, cells, tissues or organs or any derivatives of these products of human or animal origin, in order to assess their suitability for transfusion or transplantation; b) to detect the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent that causes a serious disease with a high risk of propagation. 3.3.2 Classification Rule 2 - Detection of red blood cell antigens and antibodies and non -red cell typing (1) An IVD medical device is classified as a Class C IVD medical device if: a) The device is intended to be used for detection of biol ogical markers in order to assess the immunological compatibility of blood, blood components, blood products, cells, tissues or organs that are intended for transfusion or transplantation; and b) The device is not one of the devices mentioned in subclause (2).

Note: For paragraph (f) an IVD medical device would fall into Class B under clause 3.3.5 if: k) a therapy decision would usually be made only after further investigation; or l) the device is used for monitoring. (2) Despite subsection (1) an IVD is classified as a Class C IVD medical device if it is used to test for transmissible agents included in the list of Notifiable conditions as published from time to time. 3.3.4 Classification Rule 4 - IVD medical devices for self-testing An IVD medical device for self -testing is classified as a Class C IVD medical device unless: a) the result of the examination is not determining a serious condition, ailment, or defect; or b) the examination is preliminary and follow -up additional testing is required. 3.3.5 Classification Rule 5 - Non assay- specific quality control material Despite rules 1 to 4, an IVD medical device that is intended to be used as non assay -specific quality control material is classified as a Class B IVD medical device. 3.3.6 Classification Rule 6 - Reagents, instruments etc. (1) A reagent or other article that possesses specific characteristics, intended by the manufacturer, to make it suitable for in vitro diagnostic procedures related to a specific examination is classified as a Class A IVD medical devices. (2) Despite rules 1 to 5, the following IVD medical devices are classified as Class A IVD medical devices a) an instrument, intended by the manufacturer, specifically to be used for in vitro diagnostic procedures; b) a specimen receptacle; c) a microbiological culture medium. In this clause: \"examination\" means a set of operations having the object of determining the value or characteristics of a property. Note 1. In some disciplines (for example, microbiology) an examination is the combination of a number of tests, observations or measurements. Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 33 of 43 3.3.6 IVD Classification rule 6 continued \"specimen receptacle\" means a device, whether vacuum -type or not, specifically intended by its manufacturer for the primary containment and preservation of a specimen derived from the human body for the purpose of in vitro diagnostic examination. Note 1. A specimen receptacle is considered to be an in vitro diagnostic device. Note 2. A product for general laboratory use is not an in vitro diagnostic medical device unless the product, in view of its characteristics, is specifically intended by its manufacturer to be used for in vitro diagnostic examination. 3.3.7 Classification Rule 7 - Other IVDs are Class B IVD medical devices An IVD medical device not mentioned in rules 1 to 7 is classified as a Class B IVD medical device. 3.3.8 IVD Classification Flow Chart IVD MEDICAL DEVICE CLASSIFICATION FLOW CHART RULE 1: Detection of transmissible agents posing a high public health risk RULE 3: Detection of agents posing a moderate public health risk or high personal risk RULE 7: IVDs not covered elsewhere in the classification rules RULE 2: Detection of red blood cell antigens and antibodies and non red cell typing RULE 4: IVD for self - testing for serious condition, ailments or defect RULE 6: Instruments, reagents, etc. RULE 5: Non assay - specific quality control material CLASS D CLASS C CLASS B CLASS B Determination of ABO, Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy systems IVD for self -testing that is preliminary & follow -up testing is required CLASS C CLASS A CLASS C CLASS D CLASS B Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 34 of 43 3.4 RATIONALE AND EXAMPLES FOR CLASSIFICATION RULES FOR IVDS 3.4.1 Classification Rule 1 - Detection of transmissible agents posing a high public health risk An IVD medical device intended to be used for any of the following purposes is classified as a Class D IVD medical devic e: a) to detect the presence of, or exposure to, transmissible agents in blood, blood components, blood products, cells, tissues or organs or any derivatives of these products of human or animal origin, in order to assess their suitability for transfusion or transplantation; b) to detect the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent that causes a serious disease with a high risk of propagation. Rationale: Devices captured by this rule pose a high public health risk. Rule 1 is presented in two parts - paragraph 1 (a) describes IVDs that are used to establish the safety of blood and blood components for transfusion, or cells, tissues and organs for transplantation. In most cases, the result of the test is a major determinant as to whether the donation or product will be used. Paragraph 1 (b) describes IVDs that are used to diagnose clinical infections that cause serious diseases with a high risk of transmission from person to person in the population. Serious diseases are those: that may result in death or long- term disability; and that are often incurable or require major therapeutic interventions; and where an accurate diagnosis is of vital importance to mitigate the public health impact of the condition. Rule 1 applies to all assays used to deter mine suitability for transfusion or transplantation as part of the laboratory's infectious disease testing algorithm, and includes front -line or screening assays, confirmatory assays, supplemental assays, and IVDs that detect structural components or surrogate markers of transmissible agents that cause serious disease. Some IVDs are intended only to be used in a diagnostic setting but are identical to those intended to be used for screening blood and tissue donations. These IVDs may be classified according to other rules if Rule 1 (b) does not also apply, provided the Sponsor can provide assurance that the IVD is marketed in accordance with the alternate classification. For example, a syphilis assay can be classified as a Class D IVD if it is intended to scr een blood and tissue donations, but is a Class C IVD as per rule 3 (1) (a) if it is intended for diagnostic purposes only. Examples : All tests used by the Blood Service for testing of the blood supply are Class D IVDs, including screening and confirmatory assays for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis B virus, HTLV I/II and syphilis. Any additional assays that are performed on a supplementary basis, such as those use to determine Cytomegalovirus status or suitability for Z oster immunoglobulin production, are also Class D IVDs. All tests used by hospital -based laboratories that screen for infectious disease markers to determine suitability for organ or tissue transplantation under the requirements of their licence are Class D IVDs, including screening and confirmatory assays for HIV, HCV, Hepatitis B virus, HTLV I/II and syphilis. Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 35 of 43 3.4.1 IVD Classification Rule 1 continued. Pyrogenicity tests (endotoxin activity assays) marketed for detection of bacterial contamination of blood components are Class D IVDs if the result of the test is a determinant as to whether or not the product will be used. By contrast, if the test is used for quality control purposes to measure the rate of contamination in a sample of products as part of the manufacturing process, then the test would be considered a manufacturing step and not an IVD. All assays for the clinical diagnosis of infection by HIV 1 & 2, Hepatitis C virus, Hepatitis B virus and HTLV I/II are Class D IVDs. Assay s for the clinical diagnosis of Hepatitis B virus are taken to include the following infectious disease markers: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core IgM antibodies (anti -HBcore IgM), Hepatitis B core total antibodies (anti -HBcore tot) and Hepatitis B virus nucleic acid detection (HBV NAT). Tests for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome- associated coronavirus (SARS -CoV), highly virulent pandemic influenza, Variola virus (Smallpox virus) and viral haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus or Marburg virus are Class D IVDs. 3.4.2 Classification Rule 2 - Detection of red blood cell antigens and antibodies and non -red cell typing (1) An IVD medical device is classified as a Class C IVD medical device if: a) The device is intended to be used for detection of biological markers in order to assess the immunological compatibility of blood, blood components, blood products, cells, tissues or organs that are intended for transfusion or transplantation; and b) The device is not one of the devices mentioned in subclause (2). (2) An IVD medical device intended to detect the following markers is classified as a Class D IVD medical device: a) ABO system - ABO1 (A), ABO2 ABO3 b) FY2 (Fyb). Rationale Devices captured by this rule present a high individual risk, where an erroneous result would put the patient in an imminent life- threatening situation. Classification rule 2 divides blood grouping IVDs into two subsets depending on the nature of the blood group antigen the IVD is designed to detect, and its importance in a transfusion setting. Essentially, all IVDs for testing for antigens or antibodies for any of the r ed blood cell markers not specifically mentioned in Rule 2 (2), and all IVDs used in tissue typing to test for human leukocyte antigens and antibodies, are Class C IVDs. The red blood cell markers captured by rule 2 (2) are critical to ensuring safe transf usion of blood and blood components, or transplantation of cells, tissues and organs, and are Class D IVDs. Examples IVDs for testing for red blood cell antigens or antibodies from Blood Group A, Blood Group B, or Blood Group AB, within the ABO blood group system are Class D IVDs. Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 36 of 43 IVDs for testing for red blood cell antigens or antibodies for Cw or V from the Rhesus system; Cellano (k) from the Kell blood group system; or any markers from MNS or Cartwright blood group systems are Class C IVDs. All IVDs used in tissue typing, to detect antigens and antibodies for any human leukocyte antigens are Class C IVDs. 3.4.3 Classification Rule 3 - Detection of transmissible agents or biological characteristics posing a moderate public health risk or a hi gh personal risk (1) An IVD is classified as Class C IVD medical devices if it is intended for any of the following uses: a) detecting the presence of, or exposure to, a sexually transmitted agent; b) detecting the presence in cerebrospinal fluid or blood of an infectious agent with a risk of limited propagation; c) detecting the presence of an infectious agent where there is a significant risk that an erroneous result would cause death or severe disability to the individual or foetus being tested; d) pre-natal screening of women in order to determine their immune status towards transmissible agents; e) determining infective disease status or immune status where there is a risk that an erroneous result will lead to a patient management decision resulting in an imminent life- threatening situation for the patient; f) the selection of patients; i. for selective therapy and management; or ii. for disease staging; or iii. in the diagnosis of cancer; g) human genetic testing; h) to monitor levels of medicines, substances or biological components, when there is a risk that an erroneous result will lead to a patient management decision resulting in an immediate life- threatening situation for the patient; i) the management of patients suffering from a life- threatening infectious disease; j) screening for congenital disorders in the foetus. Note: For paragraph (f) an IVD medical device would fall into Class B under clause 3.4.5 if: k) a therapy decision would usually be made only after further investigation; or l) the device is used for monitoring. (2) Despite subsec tion (1) an IVD is classified as a Class C IVD medical device if it is used to test for transmissible agents included in the list of Notifiable conditions as published from time to time. Rationale IVDs captured by this rule present a moderate public health risk or a high individual risk, where an erroneous result could lead to a patient management decision resulting in a significant impact on patient outcome. T hese IVDs usually provide the critical or sole determinant for correct diagnosis. 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 37 of 43 Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 3.4.3 IVD Classification rule 3 - continued The Department of Health publishes a list of diseases that are required to be notified nationally. A case definition is provided for each disease or disease group and a number of the case definitions rely on laboratory definitive evidence, laboratory suggestive evidence, clinical evidence (probable cases), or a combination of various markers to be present to require their notification. Contribution to the diagnosis of a particular disease through the results of testing for any of the markers menti oned as either suggestive or definitive evidence, are taken to be Class C IVDs. Where information presented in the Instructions for Use for a particular assay represents that an additional marker (beyond those specified in the case definitions) may also be used to diagnose a notifiable disease, these too are taken to be Class C IVDs. IVDs that are used to detect the presence of, or exposure to, sexually transmitted agents are Class C IVDs. Tests for HIV, HCV and Hepatitis B virus and Tuberculosis, which are regarded as serious diseases (and are therefore Class D IVDs), Examples: Tests to detect the presence or exposure to a sexually transmitted agent such as C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoea are Class C3 IVDs. Antibodies to C. trachomatis may be used to indicate either current or previous infection and therefore are also regarded as a Class C IVD under Rule 3 (1) (a). Tests for the detection of Chlamydia species to the genus level and for Chlamydia pneumoniae only are not captured by this r ule, and would be regarded as Class B IVDs. IVDs used to detect in cerebrospinal fluid or blood, the presence of an infectious agent that has a risk of limited propagation include the following as Class C IVDs : tests for the direct detection of N. gonorrhoea or Cryptococcus neoformans antigens; tests for the detection of Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) antigen; tests for the detection of IgM antibodies to malaria parasites. Tests that are used to detect the presence of an infectious agent, whereby an erroneous result would cause death or severe disability to the individual or foetus being tested are Class C IVDs. This includes tests for emerging serious diseases such as Hendra virus, or tests to confirm the presence or identity of methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), either directly from a clinical specimen or from a cultured isolate (note that microbiological culture media is a Class A IVD under Rule 7). This rule also applies to other serious infectious diseases such as prion diseases or malaria. Prenatal screening tests include a number of different analytes which together generate a testing profile for infections that may cause illness in pregnant women, and birth defects or serious infections in newborns. These tests are sometimes collectively referred to as a TORCH screen and are regarded as Class C IVDs. Tests usually include detection of antibodies Measles virus and Treponema pallidum. Tests th at are used to select patients for selective therapy and management are Class C IVDs and include viral genotyping assays to establish a suitable course of therapy, or Her2/neu testing to select patients with breast cancer for treatment using the drug Herceptin. Tests for tumour markers such as free prostate specific antigen (free PSA), or tests where results are expressed as a percentage or ratio against total PSA for use in differentiating between benign or malignant tumours are Class C IVDs. Rule 3 (f) includes a note which describes tests where a therapy decision is only made after further investigation, or that are used for monitoring. Tests intended to be used for initial screening, such as a faecal occult blood screening test (FOBT) for bowel cancer, r equire further investigation if a positive result is obtained; and tests used only for monitoring disease status, such as a total PSA which may aid in the management of a prostate cancer patient are regarded as Class B IVDs under Rule 7. 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 38 of 43 Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 3.4.3 IVD Classification rule 3 - continued Pharmacogenetic tests to predict metabolism of warfarin, or tests for other cytochrome P450 oxidative enzymes which may be used to gauge the metabolism rate of drugs are Class C IVDs. All tests used for human genetic testing are Class C IVDs, for example tests for detecting the Philadelphia chromosome, Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis. Tests for therapeutic monitoring of immunosuppressive medicines such as cyclosporin and tacrolimus are Class CIVDs, due to the impact of an erroneous result on a patient and the potential for adverse transplantation outcome. Other tests for monitoring substances or biological components that are regarded as Class C IV Ds include acute cardiac markers such as Troponin I, Troponin T and CKMB. Class C IVDs used for the management of life- threatening infectious disease include viral load and genotyping assays for HIV and Hepatitis C virus. Class C IVDs used for screening for congenital disorders include pre- and post -natal tests for trisomy 13, trisomy 18, trisomy 21 or Klinefelter's syndrome; tests for alpha- fetoprotein (AFP) when used in the detection of foetal open neural tube defects. Software that is supplied as a \"st and-alone\" IVD, for use in the interpretation of a series of results obtained as part of a first trimester screening assessment, in order to determine foetal risk of trisomy 21 is a Class C IVD. Software that is supplied as a \"stand- alone\" IVD, for use in staging or predicting severity of disease by means of an algorithm based on a combination of anthropometric measures and non-invasive biomarkers is a Class C IVD. 3.4.4 Classification Rule 4 - IVD medical devices for self-testing An IVD medical device for self -testing is classified as a Class C IVD medical device unless: a) the result of the examination is not determining a serious condition, ailment, or defect; or b) the examination is preliminary and follow -up additional testing is required. Rationale Self-testing I VDs are intended to be used by individuals with no scientific or technical expertise, or formal training in a medical field or discipline to which the test relates. Self -test devices can pose a low, moderate or high personal risk and can therefore fall int o Class A, Class B or Class C IVD. The definition of IVD medical device for self -testing includes IVDs intended for use in the collection of a sample by a lay person and, if the sample is tested by another person (e.g. a laboratory) the results are returned directly to the person from whom the sample was taken without the direct supervision of a health professional who has formal training in a medical field or discipline to which the test relates. The Authority interprets 'direct supervision' to mean writte n or verbal communication from a health professional who is personally treating the person and therefore has already established a professional relationship with their client, or verbal communication with the person by a health professional who is able to explain the significance of the test and answer questions that the person may have regarding the interpretation of the result. This applies regardless of the nature of the result, e.g. positive, negative, quantitative value. Rule 4 classifies IVDs for self-testing as Class C IVDs if the condition, ailment or defect to which the test relates is generally considered to be: inappropriate to be diagnosed or treated without consulting a health professional beyond the ability of the average person to evaluate accurately, or be treated for safely without adequate supervision. 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 39 of 43 Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 3.4.4 IVD Classification rule 4 - continued In situations where use of the self -test does not determine a serious condition or the result is purely preliminary, other classification rules apply. For example, a posi tive result from a pregnancy self -test kit will generally be followed up with a visit to the user's medical practitioner therefore a pregnancy self- test kit is not regarded as a Class C IVD, rather it is classified as a Class B IVD using rule 7. Examples System for self -monitoring of blood glucose - Class C IVD. Each of the individual components of a self-testing blood glucose monitoring system is classified individually, with the highest overall class applying to the system. So a glucose meter, as an inst rument for in vitro diagnostic procedures, is classified as a Class A IVD as per rule 6, the glucose reagent test strips for use in self -testing are classified as Class C IVDs since an erroneous result obtained when self -testing for blood glucose may lead to a life- threatening situation and the lancet for obtaining a blood sample is classified as a Class B medical device. As a system intended for self -testing, a glucose meter, glucose reagent test strips and lancet would be classified as a Class C IVD. Urine self -test strips to detect glucose and other general urine chemistry analytes - Class B IVD. Pregnancy and fertility self -testing kits - Class B IVD. 3.4.5 Classification Rule 5 - Non assay- specific quality control material Despite rules 1 to 4, an IVD medical device that is intended to be used as non assay -specific quality control material is classified as a Class B IVD medical device. Rationale Devices in this class pose a low public health risk or moderate personal risk. Quality control material is taken to be controls, calibrators and standards, and as a subset of this, non assay -specific quality control materials are those that are not assigned for use with a specific assay. This rule does not apply to quality control materials that are assigned for use with a specific assay, or where the manufacturer of the quality control material has provided detailed information (e.g. references ranges) relating to a particular assay - these are taken to be the same risk class as the parent assay based on the comm on intended purpose, even if they are sold separately. Examples Non- assay specific control plasmas for use in coagulation Non- assay specific control serum, for use as an independent control for HCV antibody assays. A DNA or RNA probe supplied for use as a non- assay specific control for in situ hybridisation of targeted gene polymorphisms. Although an ISH probe is intended for use in human genetic testing and could therefore be regarded as a Class C IVD, under rule 5 despite any other classification rule, non- assay specific quality control material is a Class B IVD. 3.4.6 Classification Rule 6 - Reagents, instruments etc. (1) A reagent or other article that possesses specific characteristics, intended by the manufacturer, to make it suitable for in vitro diagnostic procedures related to a specific examination is classified as a Class A IVD medical devices. (2) Despite rules 1 to 5, the following IVD medical devices are classified as Class A IVD medical devices Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 3.4.6 IVD Classification rule 6 - continued 8.05_Classification_Medical_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 40 of 43 a) an instrument, intended by the manufacturer, specifically to be used for in vitro diagnostic procedures; b) a specimen receptacle; c) a microbiological culture medium. In this clause: \"examination\" means a set of operations having the object of determining the value or characteristics of a property. Note 1. In some disciplines (for example, microbiology) an examination is the combination of a number of tests, observations or measurements. \"specimen receptacle\" means a device, whether vacuum -type or not, specifically intended by its manufacturer for the primary contai nment and preservation of a specimen derived from the human body for the purpose of in vitro diagnostic examination. Note 1. A specimen receptacle is considered to be an in vitro diagnostic device. Note 2. A product for general laboratory use is not an in vitro diagnostic medical device unless the product, in view of its characteristics, is specifically intended by its manufacturer to be used for in vitro diagnostic examination. Rationale Devices captured by this rule present a low individual risk and minim al or no public health risk. Products for general laboratory use are not IVD medical devices unless such products, in view of their characteristics, are specifically intended by their manufacturer to be used for in vitro diagnostic examination. For example, pipettes, test tubes and general consumables which are not specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used to perform a particular test are not considered IVD medical devices. Stains are generally considered to be IVDs if they are intended by the manufacturer to be for a diagnostic purpose. Single staining solutions for diagnostic use are classified as Class A IVDs under rule 6 (1) only if they are supplied separately and without instructions on how to perform a particular staining procedure, because they are regarded as general purpose reagents. If staining solutions are supplied either individually or as a kit, together with instructions linking that stain to a particular staining process, the staining solution or kit must be classified accor ding to the overall intended purpose of the stain. Stain powders or base ingredients used to prepare stains for use in a diagnostic setting are not considered to be IVDs because they are not finished products. However, once a powder or base ingredients hav e been made into a stain by a laboratory, the finished staining solution/s would be regarded as an IVD and an appropriate risk classification applied according to the overall intended purpose of the stain. Due to their interdependence, an instrument or sof tware that is specifically required to be used to perform a particular test will be assessed at the same time as the test kit even though the instrument itself is classified as Class A IVD. Examples Grams iodine solution which is individually supplied by a manufacturer without specific instructions for use in a Gram staining procedure is a Class A IVD because it may be used in multiple disciplines (e.g. clinical microbiology, histology, cytology). Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 3.4.6 IVD Classification rule 6 - continued 8.05_Classification_Medic al_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 41 of 43 Conversely, a foetal cell staining kit, supplied with instructions for performing a Kleihauer stain to identify candidates required to receive more than one dose of anti -D immunoglobulin is a Class B IVD under rule 7. A ready -to-use Romanowski staining kit supplied for use in haematology for staining peripheral blood sme- rs to perform white cell di fferentiation and evaluation of red cell morphology is also a Class B IVD under rule 7. A separately supplied reagent labelled as intended for use with a specific microbial identification testing kit, in order to determine the biochemical identification of a clinical isolate is a Class B IVD, in line with the classification of the microbial identification IVD, e.g. 3 % hydrogen peroxide for use in a catalase test or tetra methyl -p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) for use in an oxidase test. Conversely, a general rea gent labelled simply as 3 % hydrogen peroxide or TMPD, which is not manufactured and supplied specifically for in vitro diagnostic use, is not considered to be an IVD. Microscope counting chambers such as haemocytometers and chambered urinalysis slides labelled as being intended for the microscopic examination of urine and other body fluids are Class A IVDs because they are suitable for use across multiple disciplines or in several different diagnostic applications. Plain ground- glass microscope slides, alt hough intended for an application related to microscopic analysis, are not generally intended to be used expressly as an IVD medical device. Except for specimen containers intended for use in self testing, evacuated or non- evacuated blood collection tubes, and specimen containers intended for the collection of urine, faeces, cell or tissue specimens for subsequent in vitro examination are Class A IVDs. General laboratory tubes that are used to contain reactions or to contain and store processed specimens are not considered to be specimen receptacles. Manual, automated or semi -automated instruments such as an enzyme immunoass ay analyzer, an analyzer cycler for performing nucleic acid amplification in a clinical specimen are Class A IVDs. General laboratory equipment such as water baths, centrifuges, balances and automatic pipettes are not considered to be IV Ds unless they are specifically intended by the manufacturer (in product labelling or accompanying literature) to be used for an in vitro diagnostic examination e.g. blood bank tube centrifuge for spinning of blood grouping reactions. Prepared (ready to use) microbiological culture media, including agar containing selecting agents, antimicrobials, chromogenic agents or chemical indicators for colony differentiation are Class A IVDs. Dehydrated powders and agar bases are not considered to be IVDs. Class A IVD General Laboratory reagents are those that are suitable for use across multiple disciplines or a broad range of different purposes. Standard buffers (e.g. PBS) and saline solutions are not considered to be an IVD unless supplied specifically for use as an IVD. Non- assay specific instrument consumable reagents are considered to be Class A IVDs. For example a wash solution for use on instrument XYZ. The wash solution is not specific to a particular analyte, however is specified for use on instrument XYZ. When a separately supplied reagent is intended for use in determining a specific analyte or parameter, or it is for use with a particular IVD, or it has a clearly defined purpose relating to its use with a group of similar or closely related tests, the r eagent will be classified according to the class of the analyte or parameter it is intended to be used with. For example, a diluent or lyse solution intended for use when performing a full blood count (FBC) will be classified according to the class of the FBC assay, that is, a Class B IVD; a kit or individually supplied reagents intended to be used for the in- situ hybridisation of targeted gene polymorphisms, are classified under rule 3 as Class CIVDs for human genetic testing. Medical Devices and IVDs Classification 3.4.6 IVD Classification rule 6 - continued 8.05_Classification_Medic al_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 42 of 43 A non -assay specific bacterial or viral RNA nucleic acid extraction kit intended for the extraction of pathogenic nucleic acid from a clinical specimen is a Class B IVD; a kit with a similar intended purpose of non- assay specific bacterial or viral RNA extraction, but which is dedicated for use on a specific instrument would be a Class A IVD. 3.4.7 Classification Rule 7 - Other IVDs are Class B IVD medical devices An IVD medical device not mentioned in rules 1 to 7 is classified as a Class B IVD medical device Rationale Devices captured by this rule present a moderate individual risk or a low public health risk.An erroneous result is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on patient outcome. The devices captured by this rule rarely provide the sole determinant for the correct diagnosis. If it is the sole determinant other information is available such as presenting signs and symptoms or clinical information, which may guide the physician. This class also includes IVDs that detect infectious agents that are not easily propagated in a population. Examples Most biochemistry tests for blood gases, hormones, vitamins, enzymes, metabolic markers and substrates are Class B IVDs. IVDs for performing coagulation testing are generally regarded as Class B IVDs, including activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), factor assays and prothrombin time testing (other than prothrombin time for self -testing, which is captured as a Class C IVD by rule 4). Biochemical tests for establishing the presumptive identification of microbiological culture isolates, or for determining antimicrobial susceptibility of microbiological culture isolates, are Class B IVDs; however, confirmatory identification or serotyping reagents for microbiological culture isolates are classified according to the analyte being detected, e.g. Salmonella poly -O antisera or Haemophilus influenza serotype b typing reagent are Class C IVDs Cell c ulture lines for the culture of viruses present in clinical specimens are Class B IVDs. Tests to detect for self -testing are Class B IVDs. 8.05_Classification_Medic al_Devices_IVDs_Nov19_v2_for_finalisation.do Nov 2019 Page 43 of 43 Medical Devices and IVDs Classification Update history Date Reason for update Version & publication Aug 2014 First publication for comment (as part of 8.01 General Guideline Medical Devices and IVDs) Version 1 for comment, Sept 2014 12 Dec 2014 Due date for comment August 2015 Second publication for comment (as part of 8.01 General Guideline Medical Devices and IVDs) Version 1, Aug 2015 July 2016 Separation of Classification Rules from 8.01 General Guideline Medical Devices and IVDs Medical Devices required to be sterile: Standard version dates removed in the standards table Non - IVD: Rule 8(a) All implantable devices and surgically invasive devices for long- term use and implantable devices \u2014amended to Class D (and not Class C) - to align with international classification.
