Auricular therapy is widely used for many conditions that can affect the entirety of the body. Ear acupuncture embodies a holistic approach to medicine, an approach that treats the whole person just as in Acupuncture. The points found on the ear help to regulate the body's internal organs, structures, and functions. Ear acupuncture is generally incorporated into a regular acupuncture treatment. In addition to using acupuncture points on the rest of the body, your acupuncturist may select a few ear acupuncture points that they feel will be helpful for your particular condition. Additionally, ear acupuncture can continue post-treatment with the use of ear seeds that are held in place on the ear to continue to stimulate the points for a longer period of time. "}
