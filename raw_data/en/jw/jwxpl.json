Glossary 3511Foreword The Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals first met in 1999 to consider the safety in long-term use of vitamin and mineral supplements sold under food law with a view to recommending maximumadvisable levels of intake. Since then it has endeavoured to work as openly as possible. Thus, its agendasand working papers have been freely available, and observers, nominated by Interest groups, took a fullpart in reviewing pertinent evidence, all with the objective of ensuring as full and balanced a review ofevidence as was practicable. In keeping, the draft report was then made freely available for comment,so giving a second opportunity to ensure all relevant evidence was addressed, and addressed properly. As a result of that consultation in the autumn of last year significant modifications were made to the draft. The determination of Safe Upper Levels or if that was not possible, Guidance Levels of intake had,of necessity, to take account of the possible effects on potentially susceptible individuals who couldfreely obtain vitamins and minerals and take them on a long-term basis. This implied that good qualitylarge studies of appropriate duration were needed. The group could only work within the confines ofexisting evidence, and robust conclusions depended on the availability of adequate and relevant data,but in many cases the necessary information was incomplete. The final version of the report was agreed unanimously by members, it will be for others to decide if our recommendations, which are, in essence, risk assessments, should be followed by the adoption ofaltered risk management strategies. In this context it should be emphasised that our recommendationsdo not address the medicinal uses of vitamins and minerals, which lie within the remit of the Medicinesand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. I am extremely grateful to the members of the group for bringing us to logical and consistent conclusions, to the observers for their support in ensuring that all relevant data were properlyconsidered, and to the secretariat for their unflagging contribution in bringing to completion a task thatwas more complex and took far longer to complete than expected. PROFESSOR MICHAEL LANGMAN CHAIRMAN 34Executive Summary and ConclusionsExecutive Summary and Conclusions The Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM) is an independent expert advisory committee which was asked to advise on safe levels of intakes of vitamins and minerals infood supplements and fortified foods. The EVM was asked to consider only vitamins andminerals sold under food law. Review of nutritional or non-nutritional beneficial effects ornon nutritional use in medicines was outside the terms of reference of the group. The use ofvitamins and minerals in medicines is within the remit of the Medicines and Healthcareproducts Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The EVM considered a detailed review of the relevantevidence for each substance and then a risk assessment which was based on this evidence.The detailed reviews covered both nutritional and toxicological information. Thirty-foursubstances were assessed in detail. Safe Upper Levels (SULs) were recommended for eightvitamins and minerals and guidance was issued for twenty-two. Recommendations for SULs made by the EVM depend on the availability of good data on both the nature and the frequency of adverse effects detected at different levels of intake.The database supporting the safety-in-use of vitamins and minerals is generally poor. There isa particular lack of reasonable-sized, well-designed comparative human studies of significantduration at different levels of intake, and with adequate assessment of possible adverseeffects. Moreover, there has rarely been adequate consideration of potentially vulnerablepopulation sub-groups such as children or older people. For some nutrients the EVM had torely on animal data, with the use of empirical uncertainty factors in order to allow theextrapolation of the data to humans. For some vitamins and minerals the animal data weretoo limited for this purpose. As a consequence, the ability to give clear advice on SULs wasoften compromised and, in many cases, the EVM considered the evidence base inadequate toset a SUL. In such cases, and where possible, Guidance Levels have been given instead. Theseare based on very limited data; Guidance Levels must not be confused with, or used as, SULs. The determination of SULs or Guidance Levels entails the determination of doses of vitamins and minerals that potentially susceptible individuals could take daily on a life-long basis,without medical supervision in reasonable safety. The setting of these levels provides aframework within which the consumer can make an informed decision about intake, havingconfidence that harm should not ensue. The levels so set will therefore tend to beconservative, and it is possible that for some vitamins and minerals larger amounts could beconsumed for shorter periods without risk to health. However, there would be difficulties inderiving SULs for shorter term consumption because the available data are limited and relateto differing time periods. Although less susceptible individuals might be able to consumehigher levels without risk to health, separate advice for susceptible individuals would beappropriate only if those individuals could recognise their own potential susceptibility. The data were adequate to establish SULs for vitamin B 6 (page 81) \u00df-carotene (page 127), vitamin E (page 145), boron (page 164), copper (page 187), selenium (page 232), zinc (page 253)and silicon (page 306). Guidance was given for biotin (page 36), folic acid (page 42), niacin (page 52), pantothenic acid (page 62), riboflavin (page 68), thiamin (page 74), vitamin B 12(page 93), vitamin C (page 100), vitamin A (page 110), vitamin D (page 136), vitamin K (page 154), chromium(page 172), cobalt (page 180), iodine (page 203), manganese (page 213), molybdenum (page 219),nickel (page 225), tin (page 240), calcium (page 264), iron (page 275), magnesium (page 287),phosphorus (page 293) and potassium (page 299). 6The data were inadequate to establish either SULs or guidance for germanium (page 197), vanadium (page 246) and sodium chloride (page 313). Two minerals were not considered indetail: sulphur was excluded because intake is mainly as amino acids; fluoride was excluded assupplements are only available as licensed medicines, and fortification of food as a publichealth measure was not within the terms of reference of the EVM. The EVM was not asked to consider the beneficial effects of the vitamins and minerals. Nutritional need was noted and SULs were not set at a level below dietary requirements.Some trace elements available in food supplements are unnecessary for human nutrition. Food supplement products are used by consumers in a number of ways; these may include a desire to improve the perceived nutritional quality of their diet or self-medication (either asprophylaxis or treatment) for a range of symptoms or conditions. The remit of the EVM was toconsider supplements sold under food law, thus, the non-nutritional efficacy of vitamins andminerals has not been considered since such effects would be classified as medicinal andwould be within the remit of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. It has been argued that since vitamins and minerals are essential for human health, it is not appropriate to assess them in the same way in which other chemicals added to food areassessed. However, since there is much evidence that excessive intakes of some vitamins andminerals can cause harm, it is not appropriate to exclude essential nutrients from the safetyassessment that is applied to other chemical substances which are added to foods. The terms of reference of the EVM included the opportunity to advise on fortified foods. However, the EVM considered it preferable to frame its advice in terms of additional intake,which would cover both supplements and fortified foods. The SUL for a nutrient is expressedin two ways, depending upon the evidence base from which it was derived. In some cases theSULs are expressed as total intake, with an estimated safe margin for intake from bothsupplements and fortification within current high level dietary intake. In other cases, the SULis expressed as a supplemental intake with an estimated safe total intake. This inconsistencyarises from the nature of the data available on different vitamins and minerals, and the limitednature of the evidence base. The data used for the dietary exposure assessments were generally taken from a National Diet and Nutrition Survey conducted in UK adults in 1986/7, which, despite its age, is the mostcomprehensive data set currently available 1. The market for both fortified foods and food supplements is changing and expanding. Where intake data are available these may now besomewhat outdated. It was not possible for the EVM to estimate how the market is likely toexpand in the future, although this will be an important consideration for risk managers whenproviding advice based on the SULs that have been established. As the market and thus theexposure changes, risk managers giving advice based on these SULs will need to considerscenarios where individuals may be exposed to high levels of certain micronutrientsdepending on the combinations of products consumed. This changing pattern ofmicronutrient addition to different foods and of levels of consumption should thus be keptunder review.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1The most recent NDNS of adults aged 19-64 years was carried out in 2000/2001. The first report of the findings from this survey , covering the types and quantities of foods consumed, was published in December 2002. Reports on macronutrient and micronutrient intakes are due to be published in June 2003 with a further report on nutritional status and a summary report expected later in 2003. 7Executive Summary and Conclusions In the context of assessing intake, the EVM wishes to draw attention to the practice of using 'overages' within the food supplement industry. 'Overage' means the formulation of a productwith more than the declared content of a particular nutrient to ensure that there is asufficient level of the vitamin or mineral throughout the shelf-life of the product. This isparticularly common with the fat soluble vitamins (for example vitamins A, D and E) as theyare prone to oxidation. It should therefore be borne in mind that some supplements may havesignificantly higher levels of the vitamins and minerals at the start of their shelf-life than isindicated on the product label. Data on typical levels of overage are given in Annex 4. It isalso essential that consistent, validated methods for the analysis of levels of vitamins andminerals in supplements and fortified foods are available, enabling the quoted levels to beindependently verified. 8Introductory ChaptersIntroductory Chapters Chapter 1 - Background to the establishment of EVM Chapter 1 - Background to the establishment of EVM UK regulation of products containing added vitamins and minerals In the UK, products containing added vitamins and minerals can be regarded in law as either foods or medicines2. Those products for which claims are made for the treatment or prevention of disease, or which are administered to restore, correct or modify physiological functions, fall within thedefinition of a 'relevant medicinal product' and are subject to the requirements of theMedicines Act 1968, Directive 65/65/EEC. Such products require a marketing authorisation(licence) before they can be sold or supplied and are regulated in accordance with theMedicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations, etc.) Regulations 1994 [SI 1884/3144].Products that are licensed as medicines are excluded from the definition of food in the FoodSafety Act 1990. The control of medicines is the responsibility of the Medicines andHealthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is an executive agency of theDepartment of Health. In Great Britain, products that are not regulated as medicines may be regarded as foods and, as such, are subject to the general provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990, the Food LabellingRegulations, 1996 (as amended) and the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. Northern Ireland hassimilar but separate legislation. Food products containing added vitamins and minerals can bedivided into two categories: fortified foods, such as margarine and breakfast cereals, and foodsupplements. At present there are no rules on voluntary fortification of foods at EU or at UK level. Voluntary fortification of foods is permitted in the UK provided that the final foodstuff is safeand appropriately labelled. Similarly, until the EU Food Supplements Directive is implementedin national law in 2003, there is currently no definition of the term 'food supplement' in UKfood law and there are no specific regulations that apply to food supplements. Fortified foodsand food supplements fall within the scope of the Food Safety Act 1990, which makes it anoffence to sell any food that is not safe for consumption, not of the nature, substance orquality demanded by the consumer or that is falsely or misleadingly described or labelled. At present there are no specific limits on the levels of vitamins, minerals or other micronutrients which may be contained in supplements or fortified foods sold under foodlaw, nor are there rules on the range of vitamins, minerals or other nutrients 3that they may contain. Food supplements can be sold without restriction, subject to the general provisionsof the Food Safety Act, and, as for other foods, manufacturers are not required todemonstrate their efficacy before marketing, and food supplements are not subject to prior-approval unless genetically modified or otherwise 'novel'. 2The regulation of products containing added vitamins and minerals is considered in working paper EVM/99/2/P which is available on the EVM website or from the Secretariat. 3The exception to this is the amino acid tryptophan which, under the terms of the Tryptophan in Food Regulations 1990 may not be added to food. 10Harmonisation of controls within the EU Food supplements Until July 2002, when EU Directive 2002/46/EC on food supplements came into force, there were no harmonised controls on food supplements within the EU and each Member Stateapplied its own rules. For example, many EU Member States, such as France, Spain and Italy,did not have specific legislation but usually treated products containing more than a certainmultiple of the Recommended Daily Amount (RDA) (equivalent to the UK Reference NutrientIntake (RNI)) as medicines. In other Members States, such as Denmark and Germany, productscontaining the RDA or a small multiple of it were acceptable as foods, but higher dosesrequired licensing. EU Member States such as the Netherlands, with liberal safety-basedregimes similar to that in the UK, were in the minority. In these Member States, some limitswere applicable to particular vitamins and minerals, and these were generally based on riskassessment. Directive 2002/46/EC on food supplements was adopted on 30th May 2002 and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 12th July 2002. Article 15 states that itmust be implemented into Member States' law by 31st July 2003. The Directive establishes aframework for harmonised legislation covering the composition (at present limited to thevitamins and minerals that can be used) and labelling of food supplements. It also establishesa framework for setting maximum limits of vitamins and minerals in food supplements,although no such limits have yet been set. In 1998, the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF), a committee of independent scientific experts which advises the European Commission, established a Task Force on Upper Levels toundertake a series of evaluations similar to those conducted by the EVM. Those opinionsadopted by the SCF plenary group are published the SCF website (http:/ / europa.eu.int/ comm/food/fs/ sc/ scf/index_en.html). The European Commission will base its futureproposal for EU rules on maximum limits of vitamins and minerals in food supplements onthe advice of the SCF and its interpretation of Article 5 of the Food Supplements Directive. Fortified foods The European Commission published an informal draft proposal for a Directive relating to the addition of nutrients to foods in June 2000, which was discussed by Member States at aCommission working group in September 2000. The Commission followed this up in January2003 by publishing a preliminary draft proposal for a Regulation on the addition of vitaminsand minerals and of certain other substances to foods.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1112Introductory Chapters Chapter 1 - Background to the establishment of EVM Establishment of the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals In view of the expanding market for food supplements, as well as the developments taking place within the EU with regard to harmonisation, the UK Government considered that it wastimely to review the available data on the safe intake of vitamins and minerals from foods andfood supplements. Thus in 1997, the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals was established. References The Medicines Act 1968 The Medicines Directive 65/65/EECMedicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations, Etc.)

Preliminary draft proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods.SANCO/329/03, Brussels, 17 January 2003.Chapter 2 - About the EVM Terms of reference The terms of reference of the EVM were to: establish principles on which controls for ensuring the safety of vitamin and mineral supplements sold under food law can be based; review the levels of individual vitamins and minerals associated with adverse effects; recommend maximum levels of intakes of vitamins and minerals from supplements if appropriate; report to the Food Advisory Committee (FAC)4. The EVM also agreed to advise on the levels of vitamins and minerals in fortified foods where appropriate. Membership Membership of the EVM is given at Annex 1. EVM Members were drawn from the Committeeon Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), theCommittee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Foodand Nutrition Policy (COMA) and the Food Advisory Committee (FAC). The membershiprepresented a range of expertise in toxicology, pharmacology, epidemiology, medicine andnutrition as well as a non-specialist Member to represent consumer interests. Two furtherEVM Members with nutritional and toxicological expertise were also nominated by the maininterest groups. The first meeting of the EVM took place in January 1999. Four observers, nominated by the main interest groups (food, health food, consumers and complementary medicines), were alsoappointed to act as a link between EVM and its main stakeholders. The observers were able tocontribute to discussions of general issues, the individual reviews of the nutrients andsubsequent draft sections of the report, but did not contribute to the risk assessment processuntil the final meetings of the group, when the consistency of the decisions reached atprevious meetings was considered. Secretariat The Secretariat for the EVM was initially provided jointly by the Department of Health and theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Secretariat was transferred to the FoodStandards Agency on the 1st April 2000. Details of the Secretariat are provided in Annex 1.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 4The FAC was stood down on 31stDecember 2001. The recommendations will now be presented to the Food Standards Agency board. 13Introductory Chapters Chapter 2 - About the EVM Code of Practice and Declarations of Interest The Members and, where applicable, observers agreed to abide by the Code of Practice (document EVM/99/11) including the seven principles of public life as established by theCommittee on the Standards in Public Life (i.e. the Nolan Committee). The Code of Practicecovers matters such as the roles of the Chair, Members and Observers, and dealing withconflicts of interests. Members were required to declare any interests prior to the discussion of the item concerned. Where a direct, personal interest was apparent, the Member concerned was notpermitted to contribute to the risk assessment process. This was recorded in the minutes ofthe meeting. The observers were not required to declare interests since they were presumedto be representing interest groups. They were therefore unable to contribute to the riskassessment process. Openness The EVM agreed that its working methods should be as open as practicably possible.Accordingly, the agenda, minutes, draft scientific reviews of the individual nutrients and otherworking papers were made available in hard copy and were published on the EVM website(http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin), subject to issues of copyright or confidentiality. Interested parties were invited to provide information in response to thesepapers, to be considered in updated versions at the end of the review process. However,preliminary risk assessments were not released because it was agreed that the riskassessments would need to be considered as a whole at the end of the EVM task in order toensure consistency of approach in hazard characterisation and the use of uncertainty factors.Following this, the draft risk assessments and sections of the draft final report were releasedfor public consultation. Involvement of interested parties The EVM has been keen to involve interested parties in its work. It has sought to achieve thisthrough the activities of the observers and by issuing a call for information at the beginning ofthe task. As described above, the draft reviews concerning the hazard identification andcharacterisation were posted on the EVM website soon after completion for theconsideration of interested parties, with a request for details of any relevant data notconsidered in the review. Since very limited data were available concerning the effects of highintakes of some micronutrients, the EVM particularly sought additional relevant informationfrom a wide audience to ensure identification of as complete an evidence base as possible.Very little information or comment was received until the draft report was published forconsultation. 14Chapter 3 - Methods Vitamins and minerals considered The EVM agreed to review the data on vitamins and minerals which were either essential to human health or which were available in dietary supplements. The exception to this policywas germanium, which is not known to be essential and has been withdrawn from the marketin the UK due to toxicity. However, since germanium supplements can still be obtained by mailorder, the EVM reviewed the data on germanium. The list considered was: Water Soluble Vitamins Fat Soluble Vitamins Biotin Vitamin AFolic acid \u00df-CaroteneNiacin Vitamin DPantothenic acid Vitamin ERiboflavin Vitamin KThiaminVitamin B 6 Vitamin B12 Vitamin C of the EVM's task, some alterations were made to this list. It became apparent that, as there were no relevant data available, chloride could not be consideredalone; it was thus agreed that it would be considered as sodium chloride. It was also agreedthat it was not possible to assess sulphur, since intake was largely in the form of amino acidsrather than as elemental sulphur. Sulphur was excluded from the EVM's consideration and anexplanatory statement prepared to set out the background to the decision (see page 320). Itwas agreed that fluoride was not within the remit of the EVM, because fluoride supplementsare available only as licensed medicines and assessment of fluoride fortification involved aconsideration of the risks and benefits which was not within the terms of reference of theEVM; therefore an explanatory statement was prepared (see page 274).Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1516Introductory Chapters Chapter 3 - Methods The EVM considered a detailed review and risk assessment for each vitamin and mineral. The reviews and risk assessments were prepared either by the Secretariat or external contractors.The EVM discussed these, making changes and requesting further information as appropriate.Once all the reviews had been initially considered, they were updated with any newlypublished data (up to September 2001 5) and any data submitted by interested parties as appropriate. The thirty-four risk assessments were then considered as a whole to ensure that aconsistent approach had been taken in the evaluation of all the micronutrients. Copies of thereviews are on the EVM website (http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin) and on a compact disk accompanying this report. This report contains the individual riskassessments, which describe the key data assessed by the EVM in reaching its provisionalconclusions. When the various sections of the report were brought together and reviewed forclarity and consistency, any new data considered likely to have significant impact onconclusions were added. Types of evidence considered Hazard assessment and characterisation The EVM has considered data from both human and animal studies. The types of information used are considered in more detail in Annex 2. Determining the weight of evidence as a wholerequires assessment of the adequacy of each relevant study. The assessment could not be asimple addition of studies for or against a particular point but had to be based onconsideration of the validity of the whole of the evidence. Hierarchy of evidence The EVM agreed that data from human studies would take precedence over data from animal investigations. The 'gold standard' for human studies is the double-blind placebo-controlledtrial, particularly where there is reasonable evidence that those exposed are likely to berepresentative of the general population. Where available, such studies would haveconsiderable weight; unfortunately very few of these are available for vitamins and minerals. Itwas considered appropriate to give greater weight to good quality animal data for bothnutrition and toxicity where the human data were sparse or of poor quality. In assessing the available evidence from all sources, validity of evidence depends not only on the appropriateness of the study type but also on the quality of its design, execution andanalysis. The relationship between a micronutrient and an adverse event can be demonstratedby a number of different types of studies and designs. Sound conclusions will depend onsound evidence. 5The exceptions to this were vitamins A and E, where new data relevant to the risk assessment became available in January 2002 a nd July 2002 respectively.17Human studies The human database on the non-nutritional effects of vitamins and minerals is generally limited. This may be due partly to the difficulty of assessing the effects of micronutrients inisolation from the rest of the diet. Some epidemiological studies exist, for example wherepopulations are exposed to high levels of minerals such as selenium or boron due to the localgeology or other such circumstances. There are also some large-scale intervention trials,e.g. the Alpha Tocopherol Beta Carotene (ATBC) Prevention study in Finnish male smokers orthe \u00df-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), also in smokers, but these have tended toassess specific end points, such as the incidence of different cancer types or stroke. Othersupplementation trials have been conducted, but these have usually been designed to assessthe beneficial or metabolic effects of nutrients and there is often limited reporting of adverseeffects. It is frequently unclear whether this was because they did not occur, because theevidence of adverse events was not specifically sought or because the events were notreported. Where reports of adverse effects are included, it is generally not clear whether theywere obtained in a systematic and objective manner, or were self-reported. The therapeutic use of high doses of some vitamins for the treatment or prevention of illness has been an important contributor to data on human exposure. Examples include \u00df-carotene,nicotinic acid, nicotinamide and pyridoxine (B 6), but inadequate dose-response data make assessment of the likely risks associated with lower non-therapeutic intakes difficult toquantify. Case reports of accidental or deliberate poisonings are sporadic and uncontrolled,and thus can be difficult to interpret. Nutritional studies A range of nutritional studies in both human volunteers and laboratory animals has been considered. These studies have included investigations of the effects of deficiency or excess,nutrient balance, bioavailability or metabolism. The quality of these studies has varied. Animal toxicity and in vitro toxicity data The animal toxicity data considered by the EVM have included a range of repeat and single dose studies. Generally these have involved oral exposure. The animal database is alsofrequently of inadequate standard, many of the available studies being poorly conductedand/ or reported, although these studies may have reflected the standards of the time. Few ofthe micronutrients have the extensive toxicity database comprising short and long termstudies as well as reproductive, carcinogenicity and genotoxicity studies that would berequired for the registration of other 'synthetic chemicals' 6such as drugs or food additives. Data from in vitro studies have also been considered.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 6Although some vitamins and minerals may be extracted from natural sources, many will be chemically synthesised and in some case s differ from the chemical forms found in food.Exposure assessment Nutritional surveys Three different types of nutritional surveys were considered by the EVM. The National Food Surveys and Total Diet Studies provide nutrient intake data for the population, whereas theNational Diet and Nutrition Surveys are detailed dietary surveys for individuals from specificpopulation age groups. Further details on exposure assessment are provided in Annex 2. The National Food Survey (NFS) 7reports annually on household food purchases. The NFS provides information on population trends in food consumption and nutrient intakes at thehousehold level. The Total Diet Study (TDS) is a continuous study in which foods representingthe average UK diet are analysed. The results are widely used to estimate exposure to non-nutrients, such as contaminants, as well as the intake of some nutrients. It is particularly usefulfor estimating intakes of some nutrients where food composition data are lacking. TheNational Diet and Nutrition Surveys (NDNS) are a rolling programme of detailed dietarysurveys of individuals divided into specific population age groups: children aged 1 12-412 years; young people aged 4-18 years; adults aged 19-64 years; adults aged 65 years and over.The mean and high level intakes for adults have been considered when estimatingexposure/intake levels in the risk assessments. These detailed data are included in the EVMreview of each individual nutrient. However, to simplify the maximum exposure estimates inthe risk assessments, the intake data have been summarised to provide a single figure for meanand high level intakes of each nutrient from food sources only (excluding supplements),usually taken from the 1986/7 NDNS adult survey (see Table 1). Where NDNS data were notavailable, information on mean and high level consumption has been taken from the NFS.Where survey data were not available, exposure data from the published scientific literaturehave been used in the EVM assessments. The NDNS is the most comprehensive databaseavailable; however, in most cases, exposure information was taken from the 1986/87 surveyand thus it may not accurately reflect current intakes in all cases since consumption patternsof food supplements and fortified foods have changed over recent years. Dietary intakeincludes intake from beverages such as tea but does not include exposure from drinking water,which has been considered separately where appropriate. Data on the ranges of vitamin and mineral contents of food supplements available in the UK as well as their sales were supplied by the manufacturers and are given in Annex 4. Potentialexposure to vitamins and minerals from food supplements was also estimated from the OTCDirectory 2001-2002. These sources of information were used to provide a single estimate ofmaximum exposure from supplements, which is included for comparative purposes. Uncertainty In order to avoid an impression of precision that would be inappropriate in view of theuncertainties involved in deriving estimates of nutrient intake and safe upper levels, the EVMagreed that the values for intakes, Safe Upper Levels and Guidance Levels should be expressedto a maximum of two significant figures. 7Since April 2001, data from the NFS are used in the Expenditure and Food Survey. 18Introductory Chapters Chapter 3 - Methods19Table 1: Mean and high level intakes of vitamins and minerals Nutrient Daily exposure estimates from food Source of data sources, excluding supplements, for men and women (in mg) Mean 97.5%ile Water-soluble vitamins Biotin 0.0340.067 Gregory et al ., 0.26 \" \" Niacin equivalents 3457 \" \"Pantothenic acid 5.49.7 \" \" Riboflavin 1.8 3.3 \" \"Thiamin 1.5 2.6 \" \" Vitamin B62.0 3.9 \" \" Vitamin B120.0062 0.020 \" \" Vitamin C 64160 \" \" Fat-soluble vitamins Vitamin A (median) 1.1 (0.52) 6.0 \" \" Total carotene 2.3 7.0 \" \" Vitamin D 0.003 0.009 \" \"Vitamin E 8.5 18 \" \" Vitamin K 0.068 - DEFRA, 2001 Trace elements Boron 1.5 2.6 MAFF, 1997 Chromium 0.1 0.17 MAFF, 1999 Cobalt 0.012 MAFF, 1997 Iodine 0.22 0.43 Gregory et al. 1990 Manganese 4.9 8.2 MAFF, 1997 Molybdenum 0.13 0.21 \" \"Selenium 0.10 MAFF, 1999 Tin 1.8 6.3 \" \"Vanadium 0.013 - MAFF, 1980 Zinc 9.8 17 Gregory et al ., 1990 Major minerals Calcium 830 1500 \" \" Chlorine 4400 7800 \" \" Iron 12 24\" \"Magnesium 280 510 \" \" Phosphorus 1300 2100 \" \"Potassium 2800 4700 \" \" Sodium 2900 5100 \" \" Notes: Data are expressed as two significant figures.

Where food is consumed with similar frequency, children are inevitably exposed to higher levels of vitamins or min erals than adults because of their lower body weights.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 200320Introductory Chapters Chapter 3 - Methods References DEFRA (2001).

The balance between deficiency and toxicity is often expressed as below: Figure 1. Theoretical dose-response relationships in humans Within the acceptable range of intake, neither deficiency nor toxicity would occur in normally susceptible people. The margin between necessity (that is, the prevention of deficiency) andtoxicity can range from a few fold for trace elements such as selenium, to orders of magnitudefor some of the B group vitamins such as biotin or pantothenic acid. In practice, themagnitude of the adverse effects attributable to either deficiency or toxicity may differ, givingthe curve, for example, a J shape. Where the margins between necessity and toxicity are narrow, application of conventional methods of risk assessment, such as would be used in the establishment of an AcceptableDaily Intake (ADI), could result in recommended safe levels which would be below those thatare essential. This would occur because of the use of uncertainty factors, which are appliedwhen extrapolating data from laboratory animals to humans or from small human studies tothe general population.Effect Effect Acceptable Range of Intake Deficiency Toxicity NOAEL LOAEL NOAEL = No Observed Adverse Effect Level LOAEL = Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level DoseExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003Introductory Chapters Chapter 4 - The assessment of micronutrients Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for energy and nutrients were most recently set for the UK in 1991 (COMA, 1991). They take account of the biological variation between individuals, whichdetermines the different nutrient needs to meet specific criteria. Normal metabolic needs forhealthy individuals such as growth are taken into account, although the DRVs make noallowances for the different energy and nutrient needs imposed by diseases. For most nutrients, the DRVs comprise three levels of intake. The RNI is the amount of a nutrient which is adequate for nearly all (97.5%) of a population group, the Estimated AverageRequirement (EAR) is the average requirement for the population (i.e. adequate for 50% of thepopulation) and the Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) is the amount of a nutrient whichis adequate for only 2.5% of a population group, those with the lowest needs. In establishingthe DRVs it is assumed that requirements for a nutrient follow a normal distribution (see Figure2, below) so that the RNI is notionally two standard deviations above the EAR and the LRNI istwo standard deviations below it. Figure 2. Nutritional requirements Where the acceptable range of intake is narrow, a level of intake necessary for an individual with a high requirement may be excessive or result in adverse effects for individuals with alower requirement. The Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy could not set an RNI for some nutrients as there were insufficient reliable data on human requirements to do so. Insome instances COMA set a Safe Intake 8.EAR RNI LRNI 8A level or range of intake at which there is no risk of deficiency, and below a level where there is a risk of undesirable effe cts. 22A variety of approaches has been taken in the assessment of the safety of high intakes of nutrients9, ranging from schemes where the upper level is a set multiple of the population reference intake (for example, three-fold) or where a set fraction (such as 10%) of an identifiedundesirable chronic dose is deemed acceptable. More detailed formulae have also beenproposed; these have involved the use of fixed and/ or variable safety factors whilst takinginto account a population reference intake of the nutrient concerned (such as the USRecommended Dietary Allowance). As a result of the variable quality of the available database, as well as the differing margins between necessity and toxicity, the EVM concluded that no single scheme was satisfactoryand that it was more appropriate to consider each nutrient individually. Safe Upper Levels (SULs) were established where supported by adequate data and guidance was given on safe levels of intake where establishing SULs was not possible. The EVM SUL represents an intakethat can be consumed daily over a lifetime without significant risk to health on the basis ofavailable evidence. Where Guidance Levels have been established, these should not be usedas SULs. Guidance Levels have been given as an approximate indication of levels that wouldnot be expected to cause adverse effects, but have been derived from limited data and areless secure than SULs. Situations in which a SUL could not be set are discussed further inChapter 6. As described above, SULs or Guidance Levels are the doses of vitamins and minerals that susceptible individuals could take daily on a life-long basis, without medical supervision. Thelevels have been derived so that the consumer can have confidence that harm should notensue from daily intake up to that level. The risk assessments, as outlined in this report, haveusually focused on one or two adverse effects, which were identified as the critical effect(s)after consideration of all available safety data. The SULs set by the EVM may be considerably lower than might be appropriate during medical treatment, where the balance between therapeutic benefit and safe use can bemonitored. It also follows that exploration of potential benefits during clinical research wouldnot necessarily be limited by the SUL or the guidance, which applies to unsupervised use bythe general population. Uncertainty factors Safety or uncertainty factors are applied to allow for uncertainties in the use of data obtained from human or animal studies in order to establish the amount of a particular substance thatcan be consumed without harm. Typically, the intake level at which no adverse effects areobserved in animal or human studies (i.e. the No Observed Adverse Effect Level or NOAEL -see Figure 1) is divided by an appropriate uncertainty factor, with the result representing a levelof intake that can be consumed by the general population daily over a lifetime withoutsignificant risk to health. Uncertainty factors are empirical values used in the absence of moredetailed data. Safety or uncertainty factors have a long history of use by national andinternational regulatory bodies in order to establish safe levels of intake of compoundspresent in the human diet (IGHRC, 2003). The terms 'safety factor' and 'uncertainty factor' arelargely interchangeable, but the latter is being used more in recent years.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 9Previous approaches to the assessment of nutrients are considered in working paper EVM/99/13 which is available on the EVM webs ite or from the Secretariat. 23Introductory Chapters Chapter 4 - The assessment of micronutrients The numerical value of the uncertainty factor used varies in size depending on the nature of the database and the various uncertainties that have to be taken into account. The factorsvary in size according to the type of data being considered, and could range from a value of 1if adequate data were available for potentially vulnerable human subjects up to 100 or more ifthe safe intake had to be based on a study in animals, because adequate human data were notavailable. The most commonly used factors are to allow for inter-individual and inter-speciesvariations. These factors allow for differences in sensitivity between individuals and betweenspecies that may result from differences in, for example, absorption, metabolism or biologicaleffect of the substance under consideration. Uncertainty factors can also be applied toaccount for uncertainties due to: database deficiencies, such as the absence of a NOAEL requiring extrapolation from a Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL); a poor database, such as the absence of adequate data on chronic or reproductive toxicity; a study involving few subjects; the severity of a particular adverse effect. It is common practice in risk assessments to use separate factors for each area of uncertainty, with typical values being 10 for inter-individual variation, 10 for species differences and 3 forextrapolation of a LOAEL to a NOAEL. The separate factors are multiplied on the assumptionthat they are independent variables. The use of more refined values requires data specific tothe chemical under consideration to support the use of a smaller or larger chemical-specificfactor (Renwick, 1991, 1993). The use of uncertainty factors has evolved since their introduction in the early 1960s 10 (Lu, 1988). They were first used in the establishment of an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). A NOAEL from a study in animals was divided by a factor of 100, which was subsequently splitinto a factor of 10 for possible inter-species differences multiplied by a second factor of 10 forinter-individual (person to person) variation. That is: ADI = No Observed Adverse Effect Level 10 x10 Since then the process has been developed to allow the use of chemical-specific adjustment factors by sub-dividing the 10-fold factors into separate components representingtoxicokinetic 11and toxicodynamic12differences and, incorporating suitable chemical-specific experimental data where available (IPCS, 2001). There are no a priori reasons why species differences and human variability would be any different in relation to the toxicity of highdoses of micronutrients, compared with any other form of chemical toxicity. 10More detail on the history and use of uncertainty factors is contained in working papers EVM/99/14 and EVM/01/05, which are ava ilable on the EVM website or from the Secretariat. 11Toxicokinetics is the uptake of potentially toxic substances by the body, the transformation they undergo, the distribution of the substance and its metabolites in the body tissues and the elimination of the substance and its metabolites from the body. 12Toxicodynamics is the action of a potentially toxic substance in living systems, including reaction with or binding to cellular constituents and the biochemical and physiological consequences of these effects. 24Use of uncertainty factors in assessment of micronutrients It has been suggested that very low uncertainty factors are required in the assessment of vitamins and minerals because large numbers of people consume vitamin and mineralsupplements without apparent harm. Whilst an uncertainty factor would not be necessary if aNOAEL were available from comprehensive studies in sensitive human populations, the simpleconsumption of a vitamin without adequate health monitoring cannot be used as the basis forrisk assessment. Relevant data from adequately conducted studies in humans given the vitaminor mineral and from epidemiological studies have been considered as part of the database.However, for most vitamins and minerals there is a lack of data to support the view thatuncertainty factors are unnecessary, whereas there is clear evidence that excessive intakes ofvitamins and minerals may be harmful. The EVM agreed that it was appropriate to use uncertainty factors in assessing nutrients but the assessment should also take account of the lower advisory levels below which intake shouldnot fall. The EVM also agreed that it was appropriate to use chemical-specific adjustmentfactors where possible, but recognised that extensive information on toxicokinetics and/ ormode of toxicity was necessary for the calculation of such adjustment factors, and that therewere few substances where the available database actually allowed this. Where extrapolation from a LOAEL to a NOAEL was necessary, it was agreed that the size of the factor should vary depending on the available dose-response data and the severity of theadverse effect. For example, a severe or irreversible effect such as reproductive toxicity wouldresult in a factor of 10, whereas a small change in biochemical parameters without associatedclinical effect, such as changes in enzyme activities, would attract an uncertainty factor suchas 3 or lower. The factor of 3 is commonly used when extrapolating from a LOAEL to a NOAELfor data derived from studies in experimental animals. This is because the dose levels used insuch studies are commonly at 3-fold intervals. In deriving SULs or Guidance Levels fromhuman data, the EVM similarly used the 3-fold factor unless the available data indicated thatan alternative value was more appropriate. The Interdepartmental Group on Health Risks from Chemicals (IGHRC, 2003) is currently undertaking a review of the use and application of uncertainty factors by different UKGovernmental Departments and the relevant Scientific Advisory Committees. This review (inpreparation) has shown that there is general consensus, both nationally and internationally, onthe use of the usual 100-fold factor when using data from a study in animals to predict a safelevel of exposure for the general population.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 25Introductory Chapters Chapter 4 - The assessment of micronutrients References COMA (1991).

These generalprinciples can be summarised as follows: Nutrients should be assessed on an individual basis . The lack of complete and coherent bodies of evidence, particularly based on human studies, makes it appropriate that micronutrients areconsidered individually. However, it is important that where the quality and quantity of dataare comparable they are handled consistently. Where the database is inadequate to establish a SUL, guidance should be given. For the majority of vitamins and minerals, the available database is inadequate to establish Safe UpperLevels. For these nutrients, guidance has been given on the levels that would not be expectedto be associated with adverse effects but acknowledging that such Guidance Levels may notbe applicable to all life stages or for life-long intake. Where no adverse effects have been identified, SULs are not necessary but some guidance should be given . For some nutrients, the available data indicate that known consumption levels are not associated with any adverse effects, that is, an effect level has not been established.However, the database for the nutrient may be sparse. It is clearly only possible to considerthe available data and unwise to speculate about the possible effects at higher levels.Therefore guidance should be given for such nutrients in order to ensure that the highestlevels at which no adverse effects have been identified are stated and the reliability of thedatabase is described. Uncertainty factors should be used when necessary in the assessment of SULs. There is no evidence that essential micronutrients should be regarded as inherently safe at high doses andmuch evidence, varying according to the substance concerned, that excessive intakes cancause harm. It is appropriate to use uncertainty factors in assessing nutrients, provided thatthe assessment takes into account the levels below which intake should not fall. Anuncertainty factor to allow for human variability may be necessary if the safety data inhumans is restricted to a small group of individuals, and where study data do not include allpotentially vulnerable groups. Where evidence from studies in humans is limited, and/ or thereis evidence from animal studies that suggests possible risk, there is a need to apply an inter-species uncertainty factor to the animal data. The uncertainty factors used should be replacedby factors specific to the chemical concerned wherever possible. Where the database isinadequate, the numeric values of the uncertainty factors should be considered carefully toensure that they are appropriate. The recommended intakes of the nutrients should be taken into account. Recommended intakes do not need to be formally or numerically included in any calculations but should beconsidered in making the assessment, formulating guidance and in considering vulnerablegroups, since some groups will be vulnerable to deficiency as well as to toxicity.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 27Intakes from all sources should be taken into account. In assessing the nutrients, intakes from all sources should be considered, except where the data demonstrate that adverse effects arespecifically due to the effects of supplemental dosing. For example, a large dose of aparticular nutrient might overwhelm physiological mechanisms resulting in effects that wouldnot occur where exposure was through food and thus more gradual. In this case it should beclear that the Safe Upper Level applies to supplemental doses only. The EVM also identified a number of more specific principles that apply to their assessment of the data. These are considered within the text as appropriate but have also beensummarised below: The most important studies in the risk assessment should be identified . These studies have been described in the assessments, with the relevant strengths and weaknesses of the studiesbeing noted. Gaps in the database should be acknowledged. Gaps in the database are inevitable and in many cases are large enough to hinder assessment. The claimed benefits of individual nutrients at levels in excess of the recommended nutritional intake should be noted, but not taken into account . It is often claimed that some nutrients have benefits over and above their nutritional role. However, risk/benefit analysis is not withinthe remit of the EVM. Therefore, benefits have not been considered, but such claims havebeen noted for completeness. Where the reported benefit has been endorsed by an officialbody such as COMA, this has also been noted by the EVM. Where benefits are claimed by theauthors of published studies or in marketing information, these have been neither evaluatednor endorsed by the EVM. Good quality human data should be given more weight than data from laboratory animals . Although good quality animal data may provide valuable information on hazard identification,mechanisms and dose-response relationships, good quality data from humans are preferablebecause of the innate metabolic differences between laboratory animals and humans. Wherehuman data are poor, animal data may be more valuable in establishing SULs. The use of datafrom studies in humans avoids the need for an inter-species uncertainty factor; if there is alarge study of potentially vulnerable group(s) this would remove the need for an uncertaintyfactor for human variability. Vulnerable groups should be identified . Some groups of the population may be particularly susceptible to the effects of a particular substance. Such groups might include children, olderpeople or genetically diverse groups and should be specifically considered. The vulnerablegroups are generally sub-groups of the healthy general population rather than individualsmade vulnerable through disease, but, where necessary and where supporting evidence wasavailable, consideration was given to groups made vulnerable through disease. SULs should be expressed as total intakes where possible. Where possible, SULs or Guidance Levels should be expressed in terms of total micronutrient intakes (from all sources, includingfoods that are currently fortified). By inference, the difference between high level currentdietary intakes of the nutrient and the SUL is an indication of the maximum potential range for 28Introductory Chapters Chapter 5 - General principles for assessing micronutrientsadditional intakes by means of additional supplementation or fortification. However, for the majority of nutrients considered by the EVM, the data were inadequate to establish totalintakes. This generally occurred because many studies considered by the EVM had investigatedthe effects of supplemental intakes of the micronutrients without specifying the level alreadypresent in the diet. SULs or guidance for supplemental levels are given and a maximum totalintake for the micronutrients can be estimated by adding the estimated dietary intakes to thesupplemental SULs. SUL (total intake) - (intake from dietary and other known exposures) = available margin for additional intake exposure from supplements or new sources of fortification. SUL (supplemental intake) + (dietary and other known exposures) = estimated SUL (total)The EVM noted that these calculations used the most recent available information on dietary intake. This was primarily from the 1986/87 dietary and nutritional survey of British Adults (seeChapter 3), which may not accurately reflect current intakes. Additional fortification ofprocessed foods could result in increased dietary exposure to some vitamins and minerals,such that the total SUL could be exceeded.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 29Introductory Chapters Chapter 6 - EVM risk assessments and how to interpret them Chapter 6 - EVM risk assessments and how to interpret them Approaches to risk analysis13 Risk analysis is conventionally considered as three separate processes: risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. Approach taken by EVM The EVM is concerned solely with risk assessment, which comprises: hazard identification; hazard characterisation (including dose-response assessment); exposure assessment; and risk characterisation. The available database is reviewed and hazards (adverse effects) identified and characterised. The hazards are compared to known levels of exposure and the risk determined. Risk-benefit analysis The EVM has not conducted risk/benefit analyses of the nutrients since beneficial effects in excess of the nutritional value of the vitamins and minerals are not within its remit. How to interpret EVM risk assessments The available data have been summarised and a risk assessment conducted. The risk assessments have been set out in a standardised format. The studies to which EVM paidparticular attention in the risk assessment have been identified. Following the section settingout the SUL or the guidance, a section of text has been included to explain the EVM view andprovide any necessary qualification or aid to interpretation. Risk managers should bear in mindthat where uncertainty factors are used they reflect a judgement on the uncertainty inherentin characterising the risk. Although the risk assessments provide a brief summary of the available data and have been designed to stand alone, they are best read in conjunction with the detailed reviews. Inparticular it should be noted that the reviews contain the full reference list with only aselection of the references being included in the risk assessments. The individual reviews areavailable on the compact disk supplied with this report, on the EVM website or from theSecretariat. 13The risk analysis paradigm is considered in more detail in working paper EVM/99/10, which is available on the website or from t he Secretariat. 30Setting a Safe Upper Level (SUL) Where the database was sufficient to establish a SUL, the NOAEL or LOAEL identified has been given, together with any uncertainty factors that have been used and the reason for their use. The SUL applies to chronic/lifetime intake by the general population. It is expressed in terms of mg per person per day (mg/person/ day) and mg per kg body weight per day (mg/kgbw/ day), assuming a body weight of 60 kg, in accordance with procedures defined by theWorld Health Organisation. SULs are given for both total and supplemental intake dependingon the nature of the database. Estimates of upper levels of total intake are given whereappropriate. The fraction of the SUL which is not accounted for by known dietary or otherexposures can be taken to indicate a safe level of additional intake, bearing in mind changingeating patterns and the potential for some consumers to have intakes above the populationintake value indicated. The SUL does not apply to high doses of vitamins or minerals usedunder medical supervision. The SULs apply to healthy individuals in the general population and represent lifetime exposure. They can be applied to children by scaling for body weight or body surface area asappropriate, unless it is specifically indicated that children are particularly vulnerable to theeffect concerned or have a greater requirement. However, it should be noted thatinappropriate scaling may lead to a child's recommended intake not being met. Extrapolationof SULs based on studies in adults, to infants and children needs careful consideration,especially in relation to ensuring adequate nutritional intake of those vitamins and minerals forwhich the SUL in adults is close to the RNI. Other vulnerable groups have been identified insome cases and, where appropriate, have been accounted for in the SULs established orguidance given. In some cases, the data are inadequate to do this and other risk managementstrategies might be necessary. Situations in which a SUL cannot be set There are three situations where SULs for nutrients have not been established: For some nutrients, the available data indicate that known consumption levels are not associated with any adverse effects; that is, an effect level has not been established. Forthese nutrients, the text specifies the levels at which data are available. It should be notedthat the effects of consuming the nutrient at levels in excess of this are unknown, may notbe safe and that the database for such nutrients may be limited. Uncertainty factors havenot been used in deriving guidance in such situations, unless the database is particularlylimited. In contrast, where adverse effects have been identified but data are limited, suggested maximum intakes are given using appropriate uncertainty factors. However, these values areconsiderably less secure than the SULs and should be interpreted with caution. As with theSULs, Guidance Levels have been given as total or supplemental intakes. In a very few casesthe database was so limited that it was not possible to provide guidance.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 31Introductory Chapters Chapter 6 - EVM risk assessments and how to interpret them For some nutrients, such as sodium chloride, the adverse effect concerned does not have a defined threshold, but is a continual graded response such that risk increases with increasingintake i.e. there may be a small risk of an adverse effect at current levels of intake. As with SULs, guidance is given for both total and supplemental exposure depending on the database. However, although guidance for total intakes has been estimated, margins foradditional intake have not been since the database is too limited to allow this. 32Chapter 7 - Public consultation on the EVM draft report A draft report on the Safe Upper Levels for Vitamins and Minerals was issued for a 12 week public consultation on 29th August 2002. Responses were invited from interested parties on: scientific evidence that may have been missed; the interpretation of the scientific evidence by the EVM; and any additional supporting scientific evidence that was considered appropriate. One hundred and three responses were received in total, which covered a range of topics including the individual vitamins and minerals as well as more general points. Only fourvitamins and minerals did not attract comment; these were: cobalt, potassium, thiamin and tin.The majority of respondents disagreed with the SULs and Guidance Levels set by the Group.Many of the respondents commented on the application of uncertainty factors. A list ofrespondents can be found in Annex 6. A consultation summary is available on the FoodStandards Agency website: http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin. Full copies of the consultation responses are available on request from the Food StandardsAgency library. The majority of respondents who sent in comments were interested members of the public (38%), followed by academics (20%), industry and complementary health practitioners (12% each), the remainder coming from Local Government, NHS, consumer groups andthe media. The EVM met in early February 2003 to discuss the comments made during the public consultation and to review the draft report in light of comments received. All 103 submissionsreceived from interested parties during the consultation were considered. However therewere certain scientific issues for some vitamins and minerals that required more detailedassessment. Of the 103 submissions, thirty-seven respondents commented on the scientificcontent of the draft report as requested. Additional evidence, in the form of peer-reviewedpapers published in scientific or medical journals, covered the following vitamins and minerals: folic acid: 7 additional papers. vitamin C: 1 additional paper. vitamin A: 1 additional paper. beta carotene: 1 additional paper. vitamin E: 2 additional papers. chromium: 5 additional papers. molybdenum: 1 additional paper. selenium: 1 additional paper. zinc: 1 additional paper. sodium chloride: 5 additional papers.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 33The following risk assessments in this publication represent the final opinions of the EVM following its deliberations on all of the comments received. Some respondents commentedon the general approach adopted by the EVM in the risk assessments. Many responderscommented on issues outside the remit of the EVM. The majority of these related to the EUFood Supplements Directive. Other general issues such as the efficacy of high level nutrientintake and EVM structure were also raised. 34Introductory Chapters Chapter 7 - Public consultation on the EVM draft reportPart 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 1Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 36General Information Chemistry D-Biotin (biotin, coenzyme R, vitamin H) is a water-soluble vitamin. It has a bicyclic ring structure. One ring contains a ureido group and the other contains a heterocyclic sulphur atom and a valeric acid side-group. Natural occurrence Biotin is derived from de novo synthesis by bacteria, primitive eukaryotic organisms including yeasts, moulds and algae, and some plant species. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Biotin is widely distributed in natural foodstuffs but at very low levels compared to other water-solublevitamins. Foods relatively rich in biotin include egg yolk, liver, kidney, muscle and organ meats, and somevegetables. Liver contains approximately 1 mg/kg biotin, whereas fruits and most other meats containapproximately 0.01 mg/kg biotin. Biotin, usually either in the form of crystalline D-biotin or brewer's yeast, is included in many dietary supplements, infant milk formulas and baby foods, as well as variousdietetic products. The maximum dose in supplements sold in the UK is 2 mg. Several medicinescontaining biotin, which are available only from pharmacies, are licensed for the prevention andtreatment of nutrient deficiency, supplementation of special diets and malabsorption. The maximumdaily dose of biotin in licensed medicines is 0.50 mg. Recommended amounts Due to insufficient data, COMA was unable to set Dietary Reference Values for biotin, but consideredthat intakes between 0.010 and 0.20 mg/ day are both safe and adequate (COMA, 1991). Analysis of tissue levels and biotin status Measurement of biotin in plasma is not a reliable indicator of status. Changes in urinary excretion ofbiotin, or its goodindicators of biotin status. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Biotin has been claimed to be beneficial in the treatment of brittle nails, hyperinsulinaemia and impairedglucose tolerance and in sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis. Biotin supplements are also indicated inthe management of inborn biotin-associated enzyme abnormalities such as deficiency of biotinidase,holocarboxylase individual carboxylase enzymes.Risk Assessment Biotin propionyl-CoA, \u00df-methylcrotonyl-CoA and pyruvate carboxylase enzymes, which are important in the synthesis of fatty acids, the catabolism ofbranched-chain amino acids and the gluconeogenic pathway. Biotin may also have a role in theregulation of gene expression arising from its interaction with nuclear histone proteins. Deficiency Biotin deficiency has been observed in individuals maintained on total parenteral nutrition, peoplewho consume large amounts of uncooked egg white, sufferers from inherent or acquired biotinmalabsorption, haemodialysis patients, and individuals receiving some forms of long-termanticonvulsant therapy. Pregnancy may be associated with marginal biotin deficiency. Signs of biotindeficiency include a fine scaly desquamating dermatitis and characteristic skin rash frequently observedaround the eyes, nose and mouth, hair loss, conjunctivitis and ataxia. Biotin deficient infants show signsof hypotonia, lethargy, developmental delay and withdrawn behaviour, all of which are characteristic ofa biotin deficiency-related neurological disorder. 'Egg white injury' may be associated with glossitis,anorexia, nausea, hallucinations, depression and somnolence. Inherited deficiencies in biotinidase andholocarboxylase synthetase result in multiple carboxylase deficiency. These deficiencies and those ofspecific carboxylase enzymes may produce the same or similar disorders and manifestations of biotindeficiency. Clinical manifestations of biotin deficiency are generally thought to result, directly orindirectly, from deficient activities of the carboxylase enzymes. Biotin deficiency has been shown tocause abnormal foetal development in animals. Interactions Some anticonvulsant drugs and alcohol may inhibit intestinal carrier-mediated transport of biotin.Steroid hormones and some anticonvulsant drugs may accelerate the catabolism of biotin in the tissues.Peroxisome proliferators have been shown to accelerate biotin catabolism in rats. However, the humanrelevance of this finding is questionable. Pantothenic acid and biotin may share common carrier-mediated uptake mechanisms in some tissues but at present there are no known clinical implications ofthis interaction. Absorption and bioavailability Biotin uptake from the small intestine occurs by a carrier-mediated process that operates with a highcarrier affinity and also by slow passive diffusion. The carrier is driven by an electron-neutral sodium(Na +) gradient, has a high structural specificity and is regulated by the availability of biotin, with up- regulation of the number of transporter molecules when biotin is deficient. The colon is also capable ofabsorbing biotin via a similar transport mechanism. Approximately 80% of biotin in plasma is in the freeform and the remainder is either reversibly or covalently bound to plasma proteins. The existence of aspecific biotin carrier protein in plasma is a subject of debate. Factors determining the bioavailability of biotin present in the diet are uncertain. The bioavailability of biotin that is covalently bound to protein is reduced in individuals suffering from biotinidase deficiency.There are few data concerning the bioavailability of crystalline biotin supplements, but a recent studyhas suggested that doses as high as 22 mg may be completely absorbed. The nutritional significance ofbiotin synthesis by bacteria present in the lower gut is a subject of controversy.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 371Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 381Distribution and metabolism Uptake into tissues occurs by specific transport mechanisms dependent upon Na+gradients. Transplacental transport is thought to involve the active accumulation of biotin within the placenta followed by itspassive release into the foetal compartment. Biotin is metabolically trapped within the tissues by itsincorporation into carboxylase enzymes. In the normal turnover of cellular proteins, carboxylase enzymesare broken down to biocytin or oligopeptides containing Biotin may be by the hydrolytic action of biotinidase. Liberated biotin may be reclaimed in the kidney against aconcentration gradient. Biotin not incorporated into carboxylase enzymes may be metabolised oxidativelyat the sulphur present in the heterocyclic ring and/ at the valeric acid side chain. Excretion Biotin metabolites are not active as vitamins and are excreted in the urine. Very little biotin is thoughtto undergo biliary excretion and the substantial amounts of biotin that appear in the faeces are derivedfrom colonic bacteria. Toxicity Human data Anecdotal reports suggest that typical daily doses of 10 mg are without adverse effects and toxicity hasnot been reported in individuals receiving as much as 200 mg per day. Clinical data are limited butstudies have reported no biotin-related adverse effects following the administration of 9 mg/ day for upto 4 years, 10 mg/ day for 15 days, 4 mg/ day for 3 weeks or 2.5 mg/ day for 6-15 months. Animal data The database on the toxicity of biotin in laboratory animals is limited. Acute toxicity in mice and ratsafter intravenous or oral dosage appears to be low. There is controversy as to whether high doses ofbiotin given sub-cutaneously cause adverse effects to the reproductive system in laboratory animals.Biotin-related disturbances in oestrus cycle, atrophic changes in ovaries, inhibition of foetal andplacental growth and the increased resorption of foetuses were reported following administration ofbiotin (50 mg/kg) by injection to female Holzman rats, up to 3 weeks prior to mating. These effectswere not observed in a similar study conducted in Ibm:RORO f rats or ICR mice. These studies were not appropriate for risk assessment of oral doses. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No carcinogenicity data are available for biotin. It has been shown to be negative in the Ames test.However, further data on the mutagenicity testing of biotin are not available. Genetic variations No relevant genetic variations have been identified.Mechanism of toxicity No relevant data are available. Dose-response characterisation No relevant data are available. Vulnerable groups No potential vulnerable groups have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment: (For full review see http://www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Human data Maebashi et al., 1993 Biotin (9 mg, in combination with 3 g of an anti-microbial drug, Miya-BM) was administered daily, by the oral route (in three divided doses), for up to 4 years, to 20 patients (sex and age unspecified) sufferingfrom non-insulin dependent diabetes. The number of patients followed up after 24, 30, 36 and 48months was 15, 15, 10 and 5, respectively. There was no control group included in the study. Fastingblood glucose levels decreased to normal within 2 months and remained normal thereafter withcontinuing treatment. Serum insulin levels were not significantly changed. The authors reported thatthere were no observed clinical aggravations or undesirable side effects. This study cannot be used forrisk assessment because of the unusual design and the small number of subjects. Velazquez et al., 1995 In a double blind placebo controlled study, protein deficient children (n=22) were administered 10 mg biotin/ day for fifteen days. Plasma biotin concentrations and lymphocyte carboxylase enzymes weremeasured. The authors reported no adverse effects. This study cannot be used to define the safety ofbiotin in children with a normal protein intake.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 391Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Exposure assessment day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake: 0.066 + 2 = 2.07 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified. Risk assessment There are relatively few human data available on the oral toxicity of biotin. The data available are in the form of anecdotal case reports or from clinical trials or supplementation studies designed primarily toinvestigate beneficial effects of biotin. The latter rarely specifically report on the presence or absenceof adverse effects. The animal toxicity database for biotin is very limited, especially when given by the oral route. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL The data from studies in humans and animals are not adequate for the establishment of a Safe Upper Level.The numerous clinical case reports in the literature describe the outcome of oral biotin administration to patients (infants, juveniles and adults) with biotin-responsive inborn errors of metabolism and otherforms of biotin deficiency. Furthermore, in cases where foetal biotin-responsive disorders have beensuspected, biotin has been administered prenatally, via the mother. Typically, doses of 10 mg/ day (250 xthe average intake of the adult male in the UK) have been studied for therapeutic effects, withoutreported adverse side effects. Supplemental doses of 9 mg/ day given to human volunteers for up to 4 years have not been associated with adverse effects. The study is limited in that it was performed in diabetics, there was no controlgroup and only a few individuals remained in the study after 4 years. The authors concluded that therewere no adverse effects related to the biotin treatment, although they reported a tendency for thetreatment to lower blood sugar. Due to the low number of individuals studied, and the small proportionof volunteers followed up long term, an uncertainty factor of 10 for inter-individual variation has beenapplied in this case to allow for inter-individual variation. Thus, for guidance purposes only, asupplemental daily intake of 0.9 mg biotin (equivalent to 0.015 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult) wouldnot be expected to produce adverse effects, although this value may not be applicable to all life stages.Assuming a maximum intake of 0.066 mg/ day from food, an estimated total intake (from all sources) of0.97 mg/ day biotin (equivalent to 0.016 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult) would not be expected toresult in any adverse effects. 401References COMA (1991).

Within this assessment, in accordance with the guidelines of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUPAC-IUB) advisorypanel, the term folic acid is used to indicate the parent compound, pteroylglutamic acid, and folate isused generically, to indicate one or a mixture of pteroylglutamates. Natural occurrence Folic acid (PGA) per se is not present in significant quantities in foods or in the human body. The derivatives of PGA which are predominantly present in the human body, and in plant- and animal-derived foods, are reduced folates, mostly 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolates (THF), and also 7,8-dihydrofolate(DHF). Other modifications also occur. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Folates are present in the majority of natural foods. Liver, yeast extract, green leafy vegetables, legumesand some fruits are especially rich sources. Dietary forms are broken down to monoglutamates duringstorage, processing and cooking. The synthetic pharmaceutical form used for food fortification and insupplements is folic acid (PGA), as this compound is more stable in comparison to other forms of thevitamin. Folic acid is widely available as a nutritional supplement, either alone or as a component ofB complex or multivitamin preparations, in daily doses of up to 0.80 mg. Preparations providing a dailydose of 5 mg are available on prescription only. Recommended amounts RNI for folate are 0.05, 0.07, 0.10 and 0.15 mg/ day for infants and children /H3289512 months, 1 - 3 years, 4 - 6 years and 7 - 10 years, respectively. The RNI for adults and children /H3289711 years old is 0.200 mg/ day. Recommendations to allow for increased requirements during pregnancy and lactation areincrements of 0.10 and 0.060 mg/ day, respectively, i.e. 0.30 mg/ day for pregnant women and 0.26mg/ day for breastfeeding women. The UK Department of Health (COMA) also recommends that'women who could become pregnant' should take 0.40 mg/ day folic acid, in addition to normal dietaryfolate intake, and until the 12th week of pregnancy. An additional dose of 5 mg/ day is recommended forwomen at high risk of a neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancy.Risk Assessment Folic Acid 1Analysis of tissue levels and folate status Folate status is usually measured by determination of serum and/ or red cell folate levels, in which the predominant species is 5-methyl-THF. Serum folate is a short-term indicator of 5-16 ng/mL nmol/L folic acid activity). Red cell levels are morestable and reflect long term intake, levels /H11021140 ng/mL (317 nmol/L) indicate reduced body stores. Thus, negative folate balance is indicated by a serum folate concentration /H110213 ng/mL, whilst folate deficiency and liver folate levels /H11021120 ng/mL or 1.6 mg/kg (wet weight), respectively. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Randomised controlled trials and observational studies indicate that peri-conceptional folic acidsupplementation in women is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of foetal NTDs. Ithas also been shown that folic acid supplementation is associated with a reduction of serum levels ofhomocysteine, but commensurate benefits for cardiovascular health are uncertain. Function Folate coenzymes within the cell are involved in one-carbon transfer reactions, including those involvedin phases of amino acid metabolism, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, and the formation of the primarymethylating agent, S-adenosylmethionine. Deficiency Folate deficiency results in reduced de novo DNA biosynthesis and thus, impairment of cell replication, with the most obvious effects relating to rapidly dividing cell-types, such as erythrocytes and othercells generated by the bone marrow, enterocytes and skin cells. The condition causes megaloblastic andmacrocytic anaemia. Vitamin B 12deficiency also causes a macrocytic megaloblastic anaemia and should be excluded before folate treatment alone is given. Nutritional folate deficiency may develop during pregnancy, infection, malignant disease, malabsorption syndromes (e.g. coeliac disease) or alcoholism, during some drug treatments and in the older people onrestricted diets. Interactions Folic acid supplementation can interfere with a number of drugs (anti-folate drugs, drugs used to treatepilepsy, anti-inflammatory drugs). Folate, synthase (which requires vitamin B12as a cofactor). Some authors have reported a negative effect of folate supplementation on zinc status. Some animal studies have suggested that irondeficiency may cause folate depletion.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 431Absorption and bioavailability The majority of dietary folate is absorbed within the proximal region of the small intestine by active, carrier-dependent mechanisms, and also by passive diffusion. Polyglutamate forms are first hydrolysedto monoglutamates by conjugase (hydrolase) the Ingested folicacid is enzymatically reduced and methylated within the enterocytes, althoughingestion of high concentrations ( /H110220.20-0.30 mg/meal) result in the direct appearance of the compound, unmodified, in the plasma. The absorption of natural folate from a typical North American diet has been suggested to be in the range of 50 to 75% of the amount ingested. Synthetic folic acid, as a food fortificant or supplement ismore highly bioavailable than natural food folate. Distribution and metabolism Absorbed folate is carried viathe portal blood to the liver, where a proportion (approximately 0.1 mg/ day) is excreted into the bile and undergoes enterohepatic circulation and reabsorption. The liver isalso the main storage site, containing approximately half of the total (5-10 mg) body folate. The majorityof plasma folate is present as 5-methyl-THF-monoglutamate. Within cells, folate is retained in thecytoplasm by polyglutamation. 5 Methyl-THF is not a good substrate for polyglutamation, and must befirst converted, viaa vitamin B 12-dependent reaction, to THF. Alternatively, folic acid can be converted to polyglutamate (i.e. metabolically active) forms viaa vitamin B12-independent pathway. Excretion Folate is excreted in the urine, either as the metabolically active form or as breakdown products, and in the faeces. Toxicity Human data Therapeutic use Folic acid is generally considered safe for medicinal use, even at doses of about 10-20 mg/ day. 'Indirect toxicity' may occur due to folic acid reversal of the haematological signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency; this masking effect could allow the neuropathy associated with vitamin B12deficiency to develop untreated. Vitamin B12deficiency is most prevalent in older people and, in general, in those with impaired absorption. Adverse effects may, potentially, occur in specific groups, such as individualsbeing treated with drugs that interact with folic acid metabolism. A small number of case reports have described hypersensitivity reactions to oral folic acid therapy (generally /H328971 mg/ day). One short-term, uncontrolled supplementation trial reported adverse symptoms (mental changes, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal symptoms) in healthy volunteersgiven very high doses of folic acid (15 mg/ day) for 1 month, but other studies have not observed similareffects.Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 441 11Supplementation trials A substantial number of supplementation studies have been carried out or are ongoing to assess the effectiveness of folic acid therapy in disease prevention (generally, either for the prevention of foetalNTD-pregnancies or cardiovascular disease, in high-risk groups). Many of these trials have shownbeneficial effects associated with folic acid supplementation at levels up to 10 mg/ day for periods ofseveral weeks or months. Very few adverse effects have been reported, although the majority of studieshave not specifically addressed this issue. Trials have shown that peri-conceptional supplementation with folic acid, or folic acid-containing multivitamin supplements, is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of foetal NTDs.Consequently, COMA recommended that, for the prevention of foetal NTDs, women who couldbecome pregnant should take a 0.40 mg folic acid supplement daily, in addition to normal dietary folateintake. Women in high risk groups may be advised to take up to 10 times this level of supplementation.Such therapy is generally considered to be without adverse reproductive or developmental effects,although it has been noted that human trials carried out to date were not sufficiently powerful toidentify rare or possibly slight adverse effects. One large study of peri-conceptional multivitamin supplementation (including 0.8 mg/ day folic acid) in Hungary (1992) showed reduced incidence of NTDs, but with a significant increase in spontaneousabortions. Thus, it has been suggested that folic acid may prevent NTDs by causing spontaneousabortion of affected foetuses. However, this theory is not supported by recent studies using agenetically-predisposed NTD mouse model, in which the administration of folic acid to embryos in vitro normalised neural tube development without stimulating abortion. In two studies of the effects of folic acid supplementation in early pregnancy, statistically significantly increased numbers of multiple births were reported 14. The effect appeared to be limited to dizygotic twinning and the theory proposed by the authors of one of the studies was that this effect is due toincreased survival of multiple pregnancies, rather than increased ovulation, as multiple pregnancies havegreater micronutrient requirements. Animal data Data from toxicological studies of folic acid in experimental animals are limited. A number of reportshave described nephrotoxicity associated with the parenteral administration extremely high doses ( /H3289775 mg/kg bw) of folic acid in rodents. Additionally, direct injection of high doses of folic acid or folates into the brain or spinal fluid has been shown to produce seizures in rats and mice. One studyshowed that high-dose dietary folic acid supplementation decreased the dose of pentylenetetrazolrequired to induce seizures in rats.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 14However, a recent study was published after 31 December 2002, the EVM's cut-off date for studies to be included in the risk ass essment, which showed no association between folic acid supplementation and risk of multiple births (Li et al ., Lancet 2003; 361: 380). The study was a population-based cohort study of 242,015 women, 127, 018 of whom who took 0.4 mg folic acid/ day as a supplement before and/ or during the first trimester of preg nancy. The relative risk for multiple births in the supplemented group was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00). 451Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Oral folic acid supplementation, alone has generally not shown reproductive or embryotoxic effects in animal models, although studies have shown that supplementation is associated with increased foetalfolate levels. One group reported that the foetuses of rats fed diets containing approximately 2 mg/kgbw/ day folic acid for 3 weeks during pregnancy showed reduced body weight and vertex-coccyx lengthcompared with a control group of animals given a basal diet, although the validity of the reportedstatistical analysis is uncertain. Additionally, folic acid treatment has been reported to enhance theembryotoxic effects of certain drugs (pyrimethamine, valproic acid), and of zinc deficiency. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There are limited data to suggest that folic acid supplementation, in comparison to deficiency, may beassociated with the promotion of tumours in animals that develop spontaneous tumours or areexposed to chemical carcinogens. However, this may be related to the role of folic acid in supportingcell replication. Data from in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that folic acid is not genotoxic. Vulnerable groups Groups vulnerable to adverse effects associated with folic acid supplementation include: 1] Individuals at risk of vitamin B12deficiency (most prevalent in the older people), in whom folic acid supplementation may mask the haematological signs and symptoms of this deficiency, allowing theassociated myeloneuropathy to develop. 2] Patients treated with drugs which interfere with folate metabolism, and in whom folic acid supplementation may be associated with reduced effectiveness of the therapy or increasedincidence of side effects. Genetic variations Population groups with a genetically determined increase in susceptibility to folic acid toxicity have notbeen identified. In contrast, some individuals have a genetic predisposition to deficiency. Subjectshomozygous for a variant of the tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) showreduced activity of this in altered cellular distribution of one-carbon units, andassociated with low plasma folate status and hyperhomocysteinaemia. Defects of enzymesinvolved (e.g. cystathionine \u00df-synthase, methionine synthase) associated with pathology related low folate intake/ status. In addition, congenital errors ofvarious enzymes involved in folate metabolism have been described, associated with functionalfolate-deficiency. Mechanisms of toxicity Folic acid is generally considered safe and no likely mechanisms for toxicity have been hypothesised.The metabolism of folate and vitamin B 12are linked by the enzyme methionine synthase, which is vitamin B12dependent and results in polyglutamate synthesis. High levels of folate can result in the production of polyglutamates by a vitamin B12independent mechanism, which may reverses the megaloblastic anaemia caused by vitamin B12deficiency. This complicates the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency and allows the neurological damage associated with it to continue. 461Dose response characterisation Few systematic data exist regarding the level of folate intake required to mask vitamin B12deficiency (Koehler et al. , 1997). The majority of available information relates to early case reports of folic acid therapy for the treatment of pernicious anaemia (mostly high doses, for example /H328975 mg/ day) et Ellison and and & Weinfeld, 1962; Vilter et al. , 1963). In general, data taken from these reports suggest that supplementation with /H328951 mg/ day folic acid does not mask vitamin B12-associated anaemia in the majority of subjects. The effects of doses of between 1 and 5 mg/ day are unclear ( cited by Chanarin, 1994; Wald, 1995). Supplementation with /H328975 mg/ day folic acid is reported to reverse the haematological signs of vitamin B12-deficiency in at least 50% of subjects (discussed by Chanarin, 1994; Bower & Wald, 1995; Savage & Lindenbaum, 1995). Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Weissberg et al., 1950 This was a non-controlled study of the neurological effects of 20 mg/ day folic acid supplementation for 6-12 months, in 26 normal volunteers and 22 patients with non-pernicious anaemia. Prior to therapy,6 of the normal subjects and 7 of the anaemic subjects showed some abnormal neurological signs (butnot those of subacute combined spinal cord degeneration), which were not significantly altered duringthe therapy. Four subjects (1 normal, 3 anaemic) developed central nervous system changes during thefolic acid treatment, but these changes were not considered to be related to the therapy. Harvey et al., 1950 In this open, uncontrolled study, oral folic acid supplementation (20 mg/ day for 3 - 12 months) produced no indications of spinal cord or peripheral nerve damage in 40 healthy subjects withoutpernicious anaemia (13 subjects had mild hypochromic anaemia). MRC Vitamin Study Research Group, 1991 This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out in the UK, in which a total of 1817 women with a previous NTD-affected pregnancy were assigned to 1 of 4supplementation groups: A] mg/ day folic acid + multivitamins (daily - 4000 IU vitamin A, 400 /H9009U vitamin D, 1.5 mg each vitamins B1 and B2, 1.0 mg vitamin B6, 40 mg vitamin C, 15 mg nicotinamide) C] placeboD] multivitamins (as B], without folic acid)Expert Group Vitamins and Minerals 2003 471Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 The duration of therapy was from the date of randomisation until the 12th week of pregnancy. Statistical analysis showed a significantly reduced relative risk for NTDs associated with folic acid supplementationcompared with no folic acid supplementation, i.e. groups A and B compared with groups C and D (RR =0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.71). The authors also reported that possible adverse effects of folic acid to the foetusand the mother were examined. The authors concluded that there was no demonstrable harm from thefolic acid supplementation, although the ability of the study to detect rare or slight adverse effects waslimited. The incidences of general side effects (e.g. infertility, irregular menses, vomiting in pregnancy,upper respiratory illness) reported by women taking part in the trial were similar in all 4 groups. Animal data Chung et al., 1993 In a study of the synergistic effects of folic acid and the anti-malarial drug, pyrimethamine (an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase), groups of 10 pregnant female rats were supplemented withcombinations of the anti-malarial drug, pyrimethamine, and/ or folic or folinic acid, from days 7 - 17 ofgestation, by gavage. Folic acid treatment (50 mg/kg bw/ day) alone showed no significant maternal orembryotoxicity, as compared with vehicle-only treatment. Exposure assessment Total (1986/87 NDNS) Supplements up to 0.50 mg in OTC supplements for males (OTC, 2001) up to 0.80 mg in OTC supplements for females (Annex 4) Estimated maximum intake: 0.99 mg/ day for males 1.29 mg/ day for females No potential high intake groups have been identified. Implications of food fortification of wheat flour During the 1990s, the public health policy with regard to preventing NTDs aimed to ensure that women of childbearing age were aware of the importance of acquiring sufficient folic acid in the diet at the timeof conception to minimise the risk of NTDs in their offspring. In the UK, as in the US, there have beencalls for more active public policy, including food fortification to address this. The Committee on MedicalAspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA) reviewed the links between folates, including folic acid,and disease (COMA, 2000), and:confirmed the link between low folate status and the risk of NTDs concluded that there is insufficient evidence on which to establish a conclusive link with cardiovascular disease 481acknowledged that increasing the intake of folic acid might pose a risk to people with undiagnosed vitamin B12deficiency, particularly older people, and advised clinical vigilance to avoid any delays in diagnosis recommended that the current policy of encouraging women who could become pregnant to take 0.40 mg folic acid as a supplement should continue COMA further concluded that universal fortification of flour at 0.24 mg per 100 g in food products as consumed would result in:a significant effect in preventing NTD-affected births and pregnancies without resulting in unacceptably high intakes in any group of the population. It is estimated that this would reduce theincidence of NTD-affected pregnancies by 41% and would have, for example, prevented 38 of the 93NTD-affected births in England and Wales in 1998, 30 of the 74 in Scotland in 1997, and 6 of the 14 inNorthern Ireland in 1998 The average intake of folic acid of women aged 16-45 years would increase by 0.201 mg/ day, leading to a total folate intake of 0.405 mg/ day Approximately 7% of women in this age group would have total folate intakes in excess of 0.600 mg/ day Approximately 0.6% of people aged over 50 years would be exposed to levels of folic acid intake greater than 1 mg/ day Risk assessment Folic acid is generally considered as safe in therapeutic use. Adverse effects may, potentially, occur inspecific groups, such as individuals being treated with drugs that interact with folic acid metabolism.Women at risk of a NTD-affected pregnancy appear to be able to take folate supplements at up to 4mg/ day, without adverse reproductive or developmental effects. Folic acid may lead to reversal of the symptoms of vitamin B 12deficiency, potentially allowing the neuropathy associated with vitamin B12deficiency to develop untreated. Vitamin B12deficiency is most prevalent in older people. Few data are available from toxicological studies of folates in animals. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from animal or human studies to establish a Safe Upper Level for folic acid.COMA recommended that, for the prevention of foetal NTDs, women who could become pregnant should take a 0.40 mg folic acid supplement daily, in addition to normal dietary folate intake, until the12th week of pregnancy. Women in high risk groups may be advised to take up to 10 times this level ofsupplementation. We are aware of evidence that increased folate acid intake lowers serum homocysteine levels and may potentially help prevent adverse cardiovascular events. However, consideration of such effects is notwithin the remit of the EVM. We are also aware of recent studies which have suggested that increasedfolate intake may increase the incidence of multiple births. We note that this is an area of potentialconcern, but that there is currently no substantive evidence for such an effect.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 491Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 The main concern regarding ingestion of excess folic acid is the consequential masking of vitamin B12 deficiency. A general consistency of data indicates that supplementation with /H328951 mg/ day folic acid does not mask vitamin B12-associated anaemia in the majority of subjects, whereas supplementation with /H328975 mg/ day folic acid does. The effects of doses of between 1 and 5 mg/ day are unclear. No other significant adverse effects have been associated with ingestion of folic acid. For guidance purposes only, in the general population a supplemental dose of 1 mg/ day (equivalent to 0.017 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult) would not be expected to cause adverse effects. Because of theconsistency of the data, from a large number of studies in humans, no uncertainty factors have beenapplied. Assuming a maximum intake from food of approximately 0.49 mg/ day, a total dose of 1.5mg/ day (equivalent to 0.025 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult) would not be expected to have anyadverse effects.

Nicotinamide is the active form, whichfunctions as a constituent of coenzymes, their reduced states(NADH/NADPH) are the principal forms of niacin that exist in animal tissues. Natural occurrence Free nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are present in nature in only small amounts. Nicotinic acid is mainlybound to macromolecules in plants, while nicotinamide is usually a component of NADP in the animalworld. Nicotinic acid can be formed in humans from the metabolism of dietary tryptophan, and soniacin is not really a vitamin providing adequate tryptophan is available. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Important sources of preformed niacin include beef, pork, wheat flour, maize (corn) flour, eggs andcows' milk. Human milk contains a higher concentration of niacin than cows' milk. In unprepared foods,niacin is present mainly in the form of the cellular pyridine nucleotides NAD and NADP. Enzymatichydrolysis of the coenzymes can occur during the course of food preparation. In the UK there is mandatory fortification of flour (except wholemeal and certain other specified types) with nicotinic acid at a level of not less than 1.6 mg/100 g flour for restoration purposes. In the UK, niacin supplements are generally in the form of nicotinamide. Levels range from 0.25 to 150 mg per daily dose in multi-nutrient supplements and up to 250 mg per daily dose in single nutrientproducts. Nicotinamide products with a maximum daily dose of 500 mg are only available frompharmacists, and those preparations used to treat specific metabolic disorders are only available onprescription. Nicotinic acid is present in some General Sales List multivitamin preparations at levels upto 100 mg, and is available from the pharmacist to treat muscle cramp, and on prescription for use inhyperlipidaemias. Other sources of exposure No other sources of exposure have been identified.Risk Assessment Niacin (Nicotinic Acid and Nicotinamide)Recommended amounts The UK RNI for niacin is 6.6 mg niacin equivalent/1000 kcal, equivalent to 17 and 13 mg/ day in adult males and females respectively (COMA, 1991). An increment of 2.3 mg/ day niacin was recommended forlactating women. Under normal conditions, for an adult, the amount of tryptophan present in dietaryprotein provides adequate niacin without the need for any preformed vitamin. Analysis of tissue levels and niacin status There is no established laboratory method for the assessment of niacin status. In experimental animals,measurement of whole blood NADP can provide a sensitive indication of niacin depletion, while thedetermination of the urinary and its metabolite methyl pyridone carboxamide offers the only other method available. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects High dose treatment with nicotinic acid has been shown to reduce plasma cholesterol levels (by anaverage of 20 to 35%). In the Coronary Drug Project, nicotinic acid was observed to reduce mortalitydue to a reduction in lethal coronary events. Supplementation studies have been shown to increaseNAD +concentrations in lymphocytes. DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes exposed to oxygen radicals were shown to decrease proportionately to NAD+concentrations. High dose nicotinamide treatment has also been claimed to offer protection against the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Function Niacin is the functional factor of two important coenzymes, NAD and NADP, which activate over 200dehydrogenases essential to electron transport and other cellular respiratory reactions. Despite theirstructural similarity, NAD and NADP have quite different metabolic roles. NAD functions as an electroncarrier for intracellular respiration as well as a co-factor for enzymes involved in the oxidation of in reductive biosynthesis, such as in fatty acidand steroid synthesis and like NAD as a cofactor for enzymes, such as in the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate in the pentose phosphate pathway. Deficiency The most common symptoms of niacin deficiency are changes in the skin, mucosa of the mouth,stomach and intestinal tract and the nervous system. The changes in the skin are among the mostcharacteristic in human beings. They are called 'pellagra', which means 'raw skin' and are mostpronounced in the parts of skin exposed to sunlight. Other signs and symptoms include dizziness,vomiting, constipation or diarrhoea, and inflammation of the tongue and gastric mucosa. The neurological symptoms can include fatigue, sleeplessness, depression, memory loss andvisual impairment.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 531Interactions Interactions of niacin with drugs have been identified. Prolonged treatment of tuberculosis with isoniazid may lead to niacin deficiency due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate, a co-enzymenecessary for the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Nicotinic acid-induced vasodilation, presenting as skin flushing, is inhibited by clonidine, and may exacerbate the vasodilatory effect of ganglion blocking agents. However, ganglion blocking anti-hypertensives are used extremely rarely now. Absorption and bioavailability In humans, niacin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and intestine by a sodium carrier-mediatedmechanism at low concentrations. Distribution and metabolism Niacin circulates in the plasma in the unbound form as both the acid and the amide. Each entersperipheral tissues by passive diffusion, followed by metabolic trapping by conversion to the pyridinedinucleotides, NAD(H) and NADP(H). Most is found as NAD(H) and the oxidised form NAD. The plasma half-life of nicotinic acid is relatively short, approximately one hour. Animal studies have shown that nicotinic acid rapidly disappears from the blood and is mainly concentrated in the liver, butalso in adipose tissue and in the kidneys. The main metabolites in humans are N-methylnicotinamide, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide. Excretion The pattern of niacin products excreted after ingestion of the vitamin depends largely on the amount and form of niacin ingested and on the niacin status of the individual. However, the two major excretionproducts in humans are N-methylnicotinamide and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, with minor amounts of the unchanged vitamin, nicotinamide- N-oxide and 6-hydroxynicotinamide also being excreted. Toxicity Human data Reports of nicotinic acid toxicity in humans stem, in the main, from its use in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Most adverse effects are dose related and generally subside with a reduction indose or the cessation of treatment. Symptoms of acute toxicity include flushing, itching of the skin,nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal be seen withingestion of high levels of nicotinic acid (generally intakes of 3,000 mg/ day or more) for long periods ofPart 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 541 1time. In a small number of cases, anorexia, ophthalmological effects, skin hyperpigmentation and precipitation of incipient psychosis have been reported as side effects of nicotinic acid therapy.Sustained release preparations are reported to be more hepatotoxic than the crystalline form. Evidence is sparse, but there have been case reports of liver dysfunction following long-term high dose (3000-9000 mg) nicotinamide therapy. Supplementation trials Hoffer (1969) reported a range of adverse effects, including headaches, heartburn, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances and fatigue at doses of 3000 mg supplemental nicotinamide/ day for 3-36months. However, few details were provided and comparison with controls was lacking. Othersupplementation trials (Vague et al ., 1987; Mendola 1995; Lampeter et al ., 1998) have reported no adverse effects at intakes of nicotinamide up to 3000 mg/ day. However the studies in which the highest doses were given were primarily of beneficial effect in Type 1diabetes mellitus patients and it is unclear how information on adverse effects was ascertained.Gastrointestinal effects and flushing have been reported at intakes of 50 mg supplemental nicotinicacid/ day and above. Doses of up to 2000 mg/ day of nicotinic acid have reportedly been administered during pregnancy to niacin deficient women in developing countries, without evidence of foetal toxicity (Moghissi, 1981). Animal data Few data are available concerning the ingestion of nicotinic acid. Acute effects in dogs, associated withintake of 2000 mg/ day for less than 20 days, included weight loss, blood in the faeces and convulsionsresulting in death with associated gastrointestinal and central nervous system changes. Withadministration of lower doses (up to 1000 mg/ day) for 8 weeks dogs gained weight and appeared in goodhealth. Traces of albumin and sugar were found in urine. Chronic administration of 1% nicotinamide in the diet to rats has been shown to inhibit growth. Reproductive toxicity In rats, ingestion of nicotinamide has been shown to cause growth retardation, which may be due, in part, to the reduced intake of food and water due to the palatability and in part to a deficiency inmethionine, which is expended during the methylation of nicotinamide into its metabolites. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No carcinogenicity data are available for nicotinic acid. In lifetime studies in the mouse, nicotinamide alone was not carcinogenic. However, in combination with streptozotocin, nicotinamide has been shown to cause islet cell tumours in rats. The resultingoncogenicity is likely to be the result of an imbalance between the degree of DNA damage and thelevel of inhibition of DNA repair. No genotoxicity data are available for nicotinic acid or nicotinamide.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 551Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Dose response characterisation Few data are available, but supplemental intakes of nicotinamide of up to 3000 mg/ day appear to be well tolerated. Flushing has been reported with bolus doses of nicotinic acid of 10 mg or higher, butflushing is more consistently associated with supplemental intakes of nicotinic acid of 50 mg/ day andabove. Mechanisms of toxicity No relevant data have been identified. Vulnerable groups Individuals with hepatic dysfunction or a history of liver disease, diabetes mellitus, active peptic ulcerdisease, gout, cardiac arrhythmias, migraine headaches and alcoholism may be particularly susceptibleto nicotinic acid effects. Genetic variations No data on genetic variations that increase vulnerability to niacin toxicity have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Human data - nicotinic acid Spies et al., 1938 In an uncontrolled study, 100 adult subjects were given single oral doses of 50 or 100 mg nicotinic acid on an empty stomach. Flushing, burning and itching was reported in 5% of those receiving the 50 mgdose and 50 % of those given 100 mg. Flushing occurred in the majority of subjects receiving 200 mgdoses of nicotinic acid and was present 'to some extent' in all subjects receiving 500 mg doses. It isunclear how the subjects were divided between dose groups. By studying cutaneous temperatures, itwas determined that the increase was most marked over the ears and neck and less pronounced overthe trunk, with the extremities being least affected. Sebrell and Butler, 1938 In an uncontrolled study, groups of six subjects were given 10, 30 or 50 mg nicotinic acid daily for three months. Flushing was reported intermittently in 0, 2 and 4 individuals, respectively. The subjectsreceived an identical diet. The authors noted that there was considerable inter-individual variation,which was not accounted for by body weight. 561The Coronary Drug Project, 1975 The study was conducted to investigate the possible use of nicotinic acid in coronary heart disease to reduce the incidence of a second myocardial infarction. The study demonstrated little immediatebeneficial effect, but considerable toxicity. One third to one half of the 1119 patients taking 3000 mgnicotinic acid/ day for at least five years had increased serum levels of liver enzymes. An elevation inserum uric acid levels was noted in the nicotinic acid treated group (44% of nicotinic acid treatedindividuals) and an increased incidence of acute gouty arthritis (6.4% of nicotinic acid treatedindividuals), compared to controls (4.3% of individuals). Consistent with other reports, side effectsincluded dermatological problems of flushing, itching and rash. Other significant complaints in nicotinicacid-treated individuals included gastrointestinal and urinary tract problems. Knopp et al., 1985 A study in 71 patients compared the effects of regular nicotinic acid (37 individuals) and sustained release nicotinic acid (34 individuals). Treatment was for six months and subjects received an initial doseof 1500 mg/ day, increasing to 3000 mg/ day from the second month. However, due to a higherfrequency of side effects among those receiving the sustained release formula, the daily intake wasreduced to 2000 mg/ day for this group. Subjects treated with sustained release nicotinic acidexperienced a significantly higher rate of gastrointestinal effects, compared with those on regularnicotinic acid. Dermatological problems were reported for both treatments. Fraunfelder et al., 1995 In a retrospective survey, 102 patients taking nicotinic acid medication (3000-8000 mg/ day) for hyperlipidaemia were more likely than those taking other lipid lowering agents to report blurredvision (26%), effectswere all reversible if treatment was discontinued and the authors reported the severity of effects to bedose dependent. For one patient, a reduction in dose from 3000 mg/ day to 1500 mg/ day was stated tohave reversed the effects on her vision. Human data - nicotinamide Vague et al., 1987 In a study published as a letter, no adverse effects were reported in a double-blind trial in 16 Type 1 diabetics who received 3000 mg nicotinamide per day or placebo for six months. The average age of thesubjects was 22.1 years in the treatment group and 24.8 years in the placebo group. No adverse effectswere noted but it is unclear how this was ascertained. Mendola et al., 1989 In a single-blind trial, twenty newly diagnosed Type I diabetics, received 1000 mg nicotamide/ day or placebo for 45 days. The average age of the subjects was 18.3 years in the treatment group and 15.5 yearsin the placebo group. No adverse effects were observed when physiological, biochemical andhaematological parameters were assessed.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 571Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Chase et al., 1990 In a double-blind study in 35 newly diagnosed Type I diabetics, aged between 6 and 18 years, individuals received 100 mg nicotinamide per year of age per day, up to a maximum of 1500 mg/ day for 12 months.The authors stated that no significant adverse effects were encountered with the use of nicotinamide,although it is unclear how information on side effects was ascertained. Pozzilli et al., 1995 In a double-blind trial following up the work of Mendola, a further 56 newly diagnosed Type I diabetics aged 5-35 years were given 25 mg/kg bw/ day or placebo for 12 months. It was stated that biochemicaltests including liver and kidney function were normal during follow up and that no adverse effects werenoted in either treated or placebo patients. Lampeter et al., 1998 The Deutsche Nicotinamide Intervention Study (DENIS) evaluated the clinical efficacy of high doses of nicotinamide in children at high risk of developing Type I diabetes. Fifty-five children were randomisedinto two groups and received either placebo or supplemental nicotinamide (1200 mg/m 2/ day) for a maximum duration of 3.8 years. Mean treatment time was 2.1 years. If it is assumed that the children inthe study were of average height and weight, a total nicotinamide intake, including the contribution ofthe diet, of 1260 mg/ day or 42 mg/kg bw/ day can be estimated in subjects receiving the nicotinamidesupplement. The rates of diabetes onset were the same throughout the observation period in bothgroups. All biochemical and and lactate dehydrogenase) were within the normal range, and means did not differ between the groupsthroughout the study. Exposure assessment The exposure data below for intake from food are for niacin equivalents. These are defined as the niacincontent of the food plus 1/60th the content of tryptophan, as nicotinic acid is formed in the bodyfrom the metabolism of tryptophan. It is not possible to distinguish the two forms of niacin in thissurvey data. Food Mean: NDNS) percentile: 57 day Supplements up to 250 mg/ day (as nicotinamide, or up to 150 mg/ day as nicotinic acid) (Annex 4; OTC, 2001) Estimated maximum intake of niacin equivalents: 57 + 250 = 307 mg/ day. No potential high intake groups have been identified. 581Risk assessment Nicotinic acid Large doses of nicotinic acid are associated with a number of adverse effects in man. These have been identified from the use of nicotinic acid in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. The effectsreported include flushing, skin itching, nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal disturbance. The effects aredose related and reversible on cessation of treatment. At higher intakes of nicotinic acid over long periods of time, liver dysfunction has been reported. Symptoms such as elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin levels and jaundice have been observed.Other adverse effects reported include hyperglycaemia and adverse ophthalmological effects such asblurred vision and cystoid macular oedema. No relevant animal data have been reported and themechanism for nicotinic acid-induced toxicity is unclear. Nicotinamide Fewer data are available on the safety of nicotinamide. Studies in Type I diabetics have suggested that doses of up to 3000 mg/ day nicotinamide are not associated with adverse effects, although theseinvestigations involved small numbers of subjects and it is unclear from the studies in which the highestdoses were given how adverse effects would have been ascertained. Since the studies were undertakenin diabetics or in individuals at high risk of developing diabetes the applicability of the results to thegeneral population is unclear. No relevant animal data have been identified. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL - NICOTINIC ACID There are insufficient data from human or animal studies to establish a Safe Upper Level for nicotinicacid. Numerous reports exist, including both case reports and controlled clinical trials, in which doses of approximately 3000 mg/ day nicotinic acid have apparently caused hepatotoxic effects. For example, ina randomised double-blind study, one third or more of 1119 patients who received 3000 mg nicotinicacid/ day for up to 5 years were reported to have elevated levels of liver enzymes. Elevations in serumuric acid levels and an increased incidence of gout were also reported. Flushing has been consistently reported at intakes of 50 mg/ day and above (Spies et al ., 1938; Sebrell and Butler, 1938). If 50 mg/ day is taken as a LOAEL and an uncertainty factor of 3 is applied toextrapolate to a NOAEL, then a guidance level, for supplementation only, of 50/3 = 17 mg/ day(equivalent to 0.28 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult) for nicotinic acid is derived. This guidance level isgiven for supplements only, as adverse effects appear to be related to acute, bolus intakes of nicotinicacid, rather than more sustained exposure as would occur with ingestion of nicotinic acid via food. Freenicotinic acid levels in food are low. It should be noted that this guidance level is based on intakes of conventional formulations of nicotinic acid and, therefore, would not be applicable to sustained release preparations. Nicotinic acid containedin dietary supplements is not in the sustained release form, which is thought to be more hepatotoxic.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 591Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL- NICOTINAMIDE There are insufficient data from human or animal studies to establish a safe upper level for nicotinamide. From the limited existing database the occurrence of nicotinamide toxicity appears to be quite low. Large doses of nicotinamide (up to 3000 mg/ day for periods of up to 3 years) appear to be welltolerated, as reported in numerous trials on the possible benefits of nicotinamide in patients with, or atrisk of developing, diabetes. These trials, however, usually studied only one dose level, and the numbersof subjects involved in the trials was small. Two of the best conducted studies are those by Pozzilli et al . (1995) and Lampeter et al . (1998) and we have used these for guidance purposes. In these studies, doses of 25 and 42 mg/kg bw/ day did not affect a range of biochemical parameters, including liver and kidneyfunction tests in small groups of Type 1 diabetics (or those at high risk of developing the condition).Although no adverse effects were detected, the nature of the study population and the small numbersinvolved mean that these findings may not be applicable to the whole population. Although no adverseeffects were identified, it is prudent in this case to apply a UF of 3 to account for inter-individualvariability because of the nature of the study population. Thus, 25/3 results in a guidance value, forsupplementation only, of 8.3 mg/kg bw/ day for nicotinamide. This is equivalent to 500 mg/ daysupplemental nicotinamide in a 60 kg adult. Assuming a maximum intake of 57 mg/ day from food, a total dose of 560 mg/ day (equivalent to 9.3 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult) would not be expected to result in any adverse effects. There is a lackof data on the safety of nicotinamide in pregnancy, and no relevant animal data. This level does nottherefore apply to pregnant women.

Lancet 1, 619-620.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 611General information Chemistry Pantothenic acid consists of a pantoic acid amide-linked to a \u00df-alanine subunit. Pantetheine consists of pantothenic acid linked to a \u00df-mercaptoethylamine group. In living systems, the compoundis a component of coenzyme A (CoA), which is composed of 4'-phosphopantetheine linked toadenosine 5'-monophosphate, modified by a 3'-hydroxyl phosphate. 4'-Phosphopantetheine is alsofound covalently linked to various proteins, particularly those involved in fatty acid metabolism. Natural occurrence The active vitamin is present in virtually all plant, animal and microbial cells. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines The majority of pantothenic acid within foods is present as CoA. Chicken, beef, potatoes, oat cereals,tomato products, liver, kidney, yeast, egg yolk, broccoli and whole grains are reported to be majorsources of the vitamin, whilst very high levels are present in royal bee jelly (511 mg/kg) and in theovaries of tuna and cod (2300 mg/kg). Cooking is reported to destroy 15-50% of pantothenic acid inmeats and 37 to 78% of pantothenic acid is lost from vegetables during processing. Breakfast cerealsmay be fortified with 5-6 mg pantothenic acid/100 g. Pantothenic acid derivatives sold as supplements or medicines are prepared synthetically as calcium pantothenate or panthenol, which are more stable than pure pantothenic acid. In the UK, dietarysupplements generally contain up to 550 mg pantothenic acid; licensed medicines may contain amaximum of 50 mg/ day pantothenic acid. Other sources of exposure The pantothenic acid derivative, panthenol, is added to some cosmetic products. Recommended amounts Dietary reference values for pantothenic acid have not been established in the UK. There is nodetectable evidence of pantothenic acid deficiency within the general population, even duringpregnancy and lactation. Therefore, human requirements for pantothenic acid are considered to beadequately provided by the diet.Risk Assessment Pantothenic acidPart 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 621Analysis of tissue levels and pantothenic acid status Blood, urine or tissue pantothenic acid levels may be measured by yeast or lactobacillus assay, or by radio-immunoassay. Assays of pantothenic acid in biological materials other than urine require that thecompound be first hydrolysed from CoA. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects It has been claimed that supplementation with pharmacological doses of pantothenic acid may alleviatethe symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. Function Pantothenate, usually in the form of CoA-containing species (e.g. acetyl CoA, succinyl CoA), fulfilsmultiple roles in cellular metabolism and in the synthesis of many essential molecules. Deficiency Deficiency of pantothenic acid in humans is extremely rare. Pantothenic acid deficiency has been inducedexperimentally in human subjects by a diet virtually devoid of the vitamin, or by the administration of ametabolic antagonist (omega-methyl pantothenic acid). Signs and symptoms exhibited by subjects giventhe antagonist (not all of which were necessarily due to the deficiency) included irritability andrestlessness, fatigue, apathy, malaise, sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal complaints (such as nausea,vomiting and abdominal cramps) neurological and other clinical effects such as numbness, paraesthesia,muscle cramps and staggering gait, hypoglycaemia and an increased sensitivity to insulin. Historically,pantothenic acid deficiency has been implicated in the 'burning feet' syndrome experienced by severelymalnourished prisoners of war. Interactions Reports have indicated a sparing effect of some other vitamins, such as ascorbic acid and other B-vitamins, on pantothenic acid within the body. Biotin and pantothenic acid may share a commoncarrier-mediated uptake mechanism in the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues, although thephysiological relevance of this is unknown. Some earlier reports have suggested that high dietary fat andlow dietary protein may exacerbate pantothenic acid deficiency. Absorption and bioavailability Pantothenic acid is readily absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested CoA is hydrolysedwithin the intestinal lumen, via the formation of dephospho-CoA, phosphopantetheine and pantetheine, to pantothenic acid. Uptake of these latter two compounds into intestinal tissues hasbeen demonstrated, and subsequently the enzyme, pantetheinase, can hydrolyse pantetheine topantothenic acid. Uptake into intestinal cells occurs both by a sodium-dependent active transportmechanism and by passive diffusion. Limited data are available regarding the bioavailability of dietarypantothenic acid. One study found that pantothenic acid in natural foods was approximately 50%bioavailable compared with calcium pantothenate given in a formula diet, as assessed by subsequenturinary excretion of the vitamin.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 631Distribution and metabolism Absorbed pantothenic acid is transported to body tissues viathe blood, primarily as bound forms within erythrocytes. Plasma levels do not correlate well with dietary intake. The majority of tissuesimport pantothenic acid viaan active sodium co-transport mechanism. Analysis of rat tissues has shown high concentrations of pantothenic acid in the heart and kidneys. CoA is synthesised from pantothenicacid within cells, with the first, and apparently rate-limiting, step catalysed by pantothenate kinase. Excretion Catabolism of CoA leads to the formation of pantothenate, which is excreted in the urine. Excretionlevels correlate well with dietary intake. Toxicity Human data Case reports and some much earlier non-controlled studies describe a lack of acute or chronic toxiceffects of pantothenic acid compounds (calcium or sodium pantothenate, panthenol) at very high doses(approximately 10,000 mg/ day in some cases for a number of years), although such levels have beenassociated with diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disturbances. In more recent, controlled studies (generallycarried out to assess the potential benefits of pantothenic acid supplementation in specific subgroups,for example, arthritic patients) no side effects have been reported for pantothenic acidsupplementation at levels up to approximately 2000 mg/ day, for periods of several days to severalweeks. However, the small numbers of participants and short duration of these studies limit the valueof the data regarding any potential rare or long-term toxic effects. One non-blind, non-randomised, non-placebo-controlled trial, designed to investigate the effectiveness of megavitamin therapy in improving the behaviour of 41 children with attention deficit disorder,showed significant increases in serum aspartate transaminase levels (indicative of liver damage) in 17children after 12 weeks of multivitamin therapy (including doses of calcium pantothenate increasingduring the study period to a maximum of 1200 mg/ day). This effect may have been associated with thenicotinamide component of the multivitamin supplement, although this could not be confirmed as thevitamins were not given separately. Animal data Data regarding the toxicity of pantothenic acid and its commonly-used pharmaceutical forms inexperimental animals are limited because of the small numbers of animals used in the studies. In theearly 1940's Unna & Greslin reported acute and chronic toxicity tests with D-calcium pantothenate inmice, rats, dogs and monkeys (Unna and Greslin, 1940, 1941). Acute oral LD 50values were very high /H32897 10,000 mg/kg bw, mice and rats), with lethal doses producing death by respiratory failure. An oral doseof 1000 mg/kg bw produced no toxic signs in dogs or in one monkey. Oral dosing (500 or 2000 mg/kgbw/ day to rats, 50 mg/kg bw/ day to dogs, 200-250 mg/kg bw/ day to monkeys) for 6 months producedno toxic signs or weight loss, or evidence of histopathological changes at autopsy. The offspring of ratsPart 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 641 1supplemented with 500 mg/kg bw/ day mg/kg bw/ day calcium pantothenate from weaning; no evidence of toxicity or reduced weight gain, orhistopathological changes were observed. The available data do not indicate reproductive ordevelopmental toxicity of pantothenic acid or its commonly used pharmaceutical forms. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Calcium pantothenate, sodium pantothenate and panthenol were not mutagenic in bacterial tests. No in vivo genotoxicity or carcinogenicity data have been found. Mechanism of toxicity No data have been identified. Dose response characterisation No data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations in the metabolism or effects of pantothenic acid have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). 1950; Welsh, 1952, 1954 Supplementation of lupus erythematus patients with doses of pantothenic acid of 10,000 mg/ day or more led to gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. The General Practitioner Research Group, 1980 This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out to assess the effects of high- dose pantothenate supplementation in alleviating symptoms of arthritis. A total of 47 (31 completed thetrial) patients were treated with calcium pantothenate (total daily dose - 500 mg on days 1-2, 1000 mgon days 3-5, 1500 mg on days 6-9, 2000 mg from day 10 onwards) and 47 (34 completed the trial) withplacebo for a period of 8 weeks. The patients were suffering from a variety of arthritides, including 27patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The authors stated that '... no side effects were recorded in 43patients (91%) on calcium pantothenate as compared to 37 (79%) on placebo.' Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 651Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Animal studies Unna & Greslin, 1940, 1941 These were reports of sub-chronic toxicity studies of D-calcium pantothenate in rats, dogs and monkeys (strains not specified). Y oung rats (10 males and 10 females per group) were fed doses of 50 or 200mg/ day (approximately 500 or 2000 mg/kg bw/ day) D-calcium pantothenate, for 190 days. Growth anddevelopment were normal and did not differ significantly from those of a control group fed a standarddiet. The authors reported that autopsies at the end of the feeding period did not reveal any gross ormicroscopic changes in the organs (not specified). Six adult dogs and 4 monkeys were fed 50 mg/kgbw/ day and 1000 mg/ day (approximately 200-250 mg/kg bw/ day) D-calcium pantothenate, respectively,for periods of 6 months. None of the animals showed any toxic signs or weight loss during thesupplementation period, and again the authors reported that histopathological examination at the endof the supplementation period did not reveal any changes. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 5.4 mg/ day (1990 NDNS) 97.5th percentile: 9.7 mg/ day Supplements up to 550 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake 9.7 + 550 = 560 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified. Risk assessment The available toxicological data on pantothenic acid are limited. However, case reports and some earlier, uncontrolled human studies suggested a lack of acute or chronic toxic effects of pantothenic acidcompounds (calcium or sodium pantothenate, panthenol) at very high doses (approximately 10,000mg/ day, in some cases for a number of years). However, doses at such levels have been associated withdiarrhoea and gastrointestinal disturbances. In more recent, controlled studies, no side effects havebeen reported with pantothenic acid supplementation at levels up to approximately 2000 mg/ day, forperiods varying from several days to several weeks. These studies were generally designed to assess thepotential benefits of pantothenic acid supplementation in specific subgroups, for example patientssuffering joint disease. Data regarding the toxicity of pantothenic acid and its commonly-used pharmaceutical forms in experimental animals are also limited. However, doses of 500 and 2000 mg/kg bw/ day in rats and 200-250 mg/kg bw/ day in dogs and monkeys, given in the diet for periods of six months, were notassociated with adverse effects. 661ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from human or animal studies to establish a Safe Upper Level for pantothenic acid. There are relatively few human data available on the oral toxicity of pantothenic acid from controlled trials. The limited available data have not identified target organ toxicity and the adverse effects thatwere noted were transient. The apparent low toxicity of pantothenic acid is supported by the availableanimal data. The General Practitioner Research Group study suggests that doses of 2000 mgpantothenic acid/day are without effect, although this study investigated relatively few individuals,suffering from a variety of clinical conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout and spondylitis).Adverse effects were not a primary outcome measure, and though the authors specifically noted theabsence of side effects in fewer placebo than treated individuals, the method by which these data werecollected and the specific nature of the side effects noted are not discussed. An uncertainty factor of10 is applied to allow for inter-human variability because of the small numbers of individuals involved,of which one third failed to complete the study, and the incomplete investigation of possible adverseeffects. Based on these data, for guidance purposes only, a supplemental daily intake of 200 mg(equivalent to 3.3 mg/kg bw/ day for a 60 kg adult), in addition to that present in the diet, would not beexpected to produce adverse effects in the general population. Assuming a maximum dietary intake of10 mg/ day, this would equate to a total intake of 210 mg/ day, or 3.5 mg/kg bw/ day for a 60 kg adult.

It is stable to mineral acids in the dark at 27\u00b0C. Decomposition occurs in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Natural occurrence Riboflavin is present as an essential constituent of all living cells, and is therefore widely distributed insmall amounts in foods. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines The major sources of riboflavin are milk, eggs, enriched cereals and grain, ice cream, liver, some leanmeats, and green vegetables. Because riboflavin is degraded by light, loss will occur if foods are left outin sunlight, or any UV light. Riboflavin is stable when heated but will leach into cooking water. Thepasteurisation process causes milk to lose about 20% of its riboflavin content. Alkalis, such as bakingsoda, also destroy riboflavin. Riboflavin is a permitted colouring agent in foods and pharmaceuticals. It is permitted at quantum satis level in most processed foods, but due to its instability when exposed to light, its use tends to be restricted to relatively few foods, such as salad dressings, confectionery and powdered drinks. It is included in multi-nutrient supplements available over the counter at levels up to 100 mg/ daily dose. It is also present in some multi-constituent products which can only be soldin pharmacies because other constituents cannot be sold without the supervision of a pharmacist.These are used for the prevention or treatment of nutrient deficiencies and contain up to 25 mgriboflavin per daily dose. Other sources of exposure No other sources of exposure were identified. Recommended amounts The minimal requirement for riboflavin to prevent clinical signs of deficiency appears to be less than0.35 mg/1000 kcal. COMA recommended a RNI of 1.1 mg/ day for women and 1.3 mg/ day for men(COMA, 1991). Turnover of riboflavin appears to be related to energy expenditure, and periods ofincreased physical activity are associated with a modest increase in requirement, but COMA saw nojustification for reducing the RNIs for older people below those for younger adults.Risk Assessment Riboflavin 1Analysis of tissue levels and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), can be detected with high sensitivity using high pressure liquid chromatography. Riboflavin statuscan be assessed using the erythrocyte test, in which an activitycoefficient (EGRAC) /H110221.30 is indicative of biochemical riboflavin deficiency. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Riboflavin has been suggested for the treatment of migraine, carpal tunnel syndrome, cataracts and a variety of skin conditions (acne, dermatitis, eczema, ulceration), and for muscle cramps. However, thereis no firm evidence that it is effective in any condition that is not related to riboflavin deficiency. Function Clinically, riboflavin promotes normal growth and assists in the synthesis of steroids, red blood cells,and glycogen. FAD also play a role in oxidation-reduction reactions, interacting with a group of enzymesknown as flavoproteins. Riboflavin helps to maintain the integrity of mucous membranes, skin, eyes andthe nervous system. It supports the activity of antioxidants and is involved in the production ofadrenaline by the adrenal glands. It is thought that riboflavin also aids the body in absorbing iron, sinceit is common for iron deficiency to accompany a deficiency in riboflavin. Deficiency Individuals who have inadequate food intake are at risk of deficiency, particularly children in developingcountries. Other groups prone to riboflavin deficiency include older people with poor diet, chronic'dieters', patients taking tranquillisers, persons who use fibre-based laxatives regularly, patients withhypothyroidism and women who exercise excessively. Riboflavin deficiency may arise in neonates duringphototherapy for jaundice. It has also been associated with the development of cataracts and ofrheumatoid arthritis. Riboflavin deficiency may occur as a result of inadequate nutrition or intestinalmalabsorption. Riboflavin status can markedly influence the activity of hepatic microsomal drugmetabolising enzymes. Deficiency signs and symptoms include dry and cracked skin, sensitivity to bright light, itching, dizziness, insomnia, slow learning, weakness, sore throat, hyperaemia and oedema of with pure red cell hypoplasia of the bone marrow. The anaemiathat develops in riboflavin deficiency is normochromic and normocytic and is associated withreticulocytopenia; leukocytes and platelets are generally normal. Administration of riboflavin todeficient patients causes reticulocytosis, and the concentration of haemoglobin returns to normal.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 691Interactions The absorption of iron, zinc and calcium is impaired in riboflavin deficiency. Riboflavin impairs the antibiotic but or neomycin. Thyroid hormones, corticotrophin andaldosterone enhance the formation of FMN and FAD from riboflavin, while phenothiazines and possiblytricyclic antidepressants inhibit FAD formation. Ingestion of boric acid increases the excretion ofriboflavin. Prior administration of probenecid decreases the renal clearance and gastrointestinalabsorption of riboflavin. A single report (Florsheim, 1994) has found riboflavin to increase the response of mice to ionising radiation. However, Pacernick et al. (1975) found that oral riboflavin had no effect on UV-induced skin tumours in hairless mice. Similarly, oral administration of riboflavin did not affect the sensitivity ofhomozygous or heterozygous Gunn rats to UV light. Absorption and bioavailability Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the small intestine, primarily by a specialised transport mechanism involving phosphorylation of the vitamin to FMN. Passive diffusion plays only a minor role at levelsingested in the diet. Riboflavin has been shown to undergo active secretion into, and saturablereabsorption from, the kidney tubules in rat, dog and human. Distribution and metabolism Riboflavin is distributed to all tissues. It is present in red blood cells, and appears to bind toa subfraction of immunoglobulins in plasma. Very little riboflavin is stored. Free riboflavin is transformedin the liver to form flavin coenzymes, (FAD and FMN), which are utilised as electron transfer factors inenzymatic reductions. Excretion When riboflavin is ingested in amounts approximately equivalent to the minimal daily requirement, onlyabout 10-20% appears in the urine. As the intake is increased above minimal requirements, largerproportions are excreted unchanged. Riboflavin is also found in faeces, sometimes in quantities exceeding that ingested. This probably represents the riboflavin synthesised by intestinal microorganisms, which is not absorbed. Toxicity Human data No toxic or adverse reactions to riboflavin in humans have been identified. A harmless yellowdiscoloration of urine occurs at high doses. However, there has been at least one unconfirmed report ofdermatitis following oral ingestion of a vitamin B complex that included riboflavin. Because riboflavin isa water-soluble vitamin, excess amounts are excreted.Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 701 1Supplementation trials Few human data are available. However, no toxic symptoms have been reported at doses of up to 400 mg per day for at least 3 months, other than occasional minor side effects that were not clearlyattributable to the compound. Animal data On the basis of the limited data available, riboflavin appears to be of very low toxicity whenadministered orally or by injection to animals. It has been reported that administration of an acute oraldose of 10,000 mg/kg to rats resulted in no toxic effects. There are a few studies in which riboflavin hasbeen administered orally to experimental animals (rats, mice, rabbits, dogs) for periods of up to 22months at doses of up to 25 mg/kg bw per day. No obvious toxicity was observed. However, only alimited number of endpoints was investigated and, overall, the information available on the toxicity ofriboflavin in experimental animals is limited. Riboflavin has been reported to be of very lowdevelopmental toxicity in experimental animals. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Riboflavin has not been shown to be carcinogenic, although deficiency of riboflavin may predispose to the development of some tumours. In a limited study in rats, oral administration of 1.5 mg/kg per day ofriboflavin for 22 months was not carcinogenic. Riboflavin was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella test. One report found no evidence of mutagenesis in the umu or SOS chromotest. In another report, riboflavin had no effect on polyploidy in Chinese hamster lung cells. No other adequate reports on the genotoxicity of riboflavin in other testsystems could be located. Mechanism of toxicity No relevant data have been identified. Dose response characterisation No relevant data have been identified. Vulnerable groups There is a theoretical possibility that neonates undergoing phototherapy for hyperbilirubinaemia may beat risk at this time from photoactivation of riboflavin. Genetic variations No relevant genetic variations have been identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 711Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human Zempleni et al., 1996 The pharmacokinetics and utilisation (flavocoenzyme synthesis) of orally and intravenously administered riboflavin were assessed in a study in healthy adults. After the determination of circadian rhythms ofriboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine of four males and five females (control period), eachsubject received three different oral riboflavin doses (20, 40, and 60 mg) and one intravenous bolusinjection of riboflavin (11.6 mg). Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated using a two-compartmentopen model. No adverse effects were reported at any of the dose levels studied. Schoenen et al., 1998 In a prophylactic study of migraine in 28 patients with placebo control, high doses (400 mg per day) of riboflavin for at least 3 months were well tolerated, only two minor, non-specific adverse events beingreported. These could not be attributed unequivocally to treatment. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 1.8 mg/ day (from 1986/87 NDNS) 3.3 day up to 100 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake: 3.3 + 100 = 103 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment In several human studies riboflavin was well tolerated with no reports of adverse events.Data on the toxicity of riboflavin in experimental animals are sparse. Acute oral administration of riboflavin to rats produced no adverse effects. Riboflavin has also been administered orally to rats, mice,rabbits and dogs for long periods without obvious toxicity. However, in none of these studies was a fullevaluation performed, and in most cases only a very limited number of endpoints was investigated. 721ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from human and animal studies to establish a Safe Upper Level for riboflavin, although the available data indicate that it is of low toxicity. No toxicological hazard has been identifiedfor riboflavin from animal studies. The balance of evidence suggests that ingestion of riboflavin overprolonged periods of time is without harmful effects, even at many times the normal level of exposure.In a prophylactic study of migraine, doses of 400 mg riboflavin per day for at least 3 months were welltolerated (Schoenen et al ., 1998). Only two minor non-specific adverse effects, which could not be unequivocally attributed to the treatment, were reported in the 28 patients. Although there is noevidence of hazard at higher levels, an uncertainty factor of 10 is applied to allow for inter-humanvariability because of the small numbers of individuals involved, who may not be representative of thegeneral population, and the incomplete investigation of adverse effects. This suggests that, for guidancepurposes only, supplemental intakes of 40 mg riboflavin/ day (equivalent to 0.67 mg/kg bw for a 60 kgadult) would be unlikely to result in adverse effects. This is in addition to riboflavin provided by thediet. Assuming a maximum dietary intake of 3.3 mg/ day, a total daily intake of 43 mg riboflavin(equivalent to 0.72 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult) would not be expected to result in any adverseeffects. The available database is insufficient for us to comment on the safety of higher intakes,although these may be without adverse effects. References COMA.

Derivatives of thiamin include themono-, pyro- and triphosphate forms and the synthetic hydrochloride and slightly less water-solublemononitrate salt. Synthetic non water-soluble derivatives of thiamin are available but these are not usedin food supplements. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Foods providing rich sources of thiamin include unrefined grain products, meat products, vegetables,dairy products, legumes, fruits and eggs. In the UK there is mandatory fortification of white and brownflour with thiamin, to a level of not less than 0.24 mg/100g flour, to replace losses during production;thus, cereal products are also a rich source of thiamin. Mononitrate or hydrochloride derivatives of thiamin are present in multi-constituent medicinal products for the prevention (dose 1 - 5 mg daily) or treatment (dose 10 - 35 mg daily) of nutrient deficiencies.Supplements containing thiamin alone are also available (daily doses up to 300 mg). Recommended amounts Body stores of thiamin are limited and a regular intake is necessary. Thiamin requirement is related toenergy consumption. The RNI for adults and children /H328971 year is 0.4 mg/1000 kcal and 0.3 mg/1000 kcal in infants (COMA, 1991). Assuming food intakes of 2000 kcal/ day and 20% losses through cooking,this can be estimated to be 1.4 and 1 mg/ day for adult males and females respectively. In pregnancy andlactation, thiamin requirement increases to approximately 1.6 - 1.8 mg/ day. Analysis of tissue levels and thiamin status Thiamin status may be assessed by measurement of thiamin levels in blood or by urinary excretion,before and after loading. Erythrocyte transketolase (ETK) activity or its activation coefficient (ATK-AC) inhaemolysed red blood cells is a functional measure of thiamin status. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects No reports of non-nutritional beneficial effects have been identified. Established therapeutic uses ofthiamin supplements are largely related to the treatment or prophylaxis of deficiency. The effects ofthiamin on spasmodic dysmenorrhoea, exercise performance, ventricular function, Alzheimer's disease,and leg cramps during pregnancy have been investigated, with inconclusive results.Risk Assessment Thiamin (Vitamin B1) 1Function Thiamin co-enzyme TPP may also have a non- co-enzymic function during stimulation of neuronal cells and other excitable tissues, such as skeletalmuscle. Deficiency The biological half-life of thiamin is approximately 10 - 20 days and marginal deficiency can developquite rapidly. Symptoms of sub-clinical deficiency include headache, tiredness, anorexia and musclewasting. A regular daily thiamin intake of /H328950.2 mg/1000 kcal results in clinical deficiency and the disease known as beriberi, which affects the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Thiamin deficiency can result ina disorder of the central nervous system known as Wernicke's encephalopathy, characterised byconfusion, ataxia and coma. This condition is sometimes accompanied by a syndrome known as Korsakoffpsychosis. Both conditions are typically found in alcoholics and co-exist in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.In developed countries, most cases of thiamin deficiency are associated with chronic alcoholism wheredietary intake of the vitamin may be low and absorption and utilisation impaired. Thiamin deficiency may also be involved in foetal alcohol syndrome, characterised by growth retardation, psychomotor abnormalities and congenital malformations, in the offspring of alcoholic mothers. Interactions Alcohol can impair the uptake and utilisation of thiamin and these effects may contribute to theprevalence of thiamin deficiency in alcoholics. Alcohol also reduces cellular thiamin diphosphokinaseactivity. Thiamin is an acetylcholine antagonist, and thus may enhance the effect of neuromuscularblocking agents. 5-Fluorouracil appears to be antagonistic to thiamin, possibly through competition forphosphorylation, which is required by both entities for their activation. Absorption and bioavailability Thiamin in food appears to be highly available for absorption. Absorption of thiamin hydrochloride andother water-soluble forms of thiamin is dose-dependent. At physiological concentrations, intestinaluptake occurs mainly via a carrier-mediated transport mechanism. However, this process is saturable andat higher concentrations, uptake is predominately by slower passive diffusion. Distribution and metabolism In the blood and tissues, thiamin is present as the free form and mono-, di- (pyro) and triphosphorylatedforms, which are interconvertible. Free and phosphorylated forms are transported within theerythrocytes, but plasma and cerebrospinal fluid contain only the free and monophosphorylated forms.Within the tissues, most thiamin present is converted to the pyrophosphate form. Liver contains thehighest concentration of thiamin. Catabolic metabolism amounts to approximately 1 mg/ day, and mostof this occurs in the liver. The mean thiamin content of human breast milk in the UK has been reportedto be 0.16 mg/L. Excretion Thiamin metabolites and thiamin in excess of requirements are excreted in the urine. The level ofunchanged thiamin in the urine increases as intake increases.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 751Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Toxicity Human data The oral toxicity of thiamin and thiamin derivatives in humans is generally considered very low. Most reports of adverse effects with exposure to thiamin follow parenteral nutrition. High oral doses ofthiamin hydrochloride ( /H328977000 mg) may cause headache, nausea, irritability, insomnia, rapid pulse and weakness. These symptoms are relieved following cessation of treatment or reduction of dose. Therehave been a very small number of reported adverse effects following lower doses from case reports.Three case reports concerned women, one who experienced muscle tremor, rapid pulse and nervoushyperirritability after taking daily doses of thiamin hydrochloride, reported to be 17 mg/ day 14. In another case, a patient suffered an anaphylactic reaction and subsequently died following a single oral dose of100 mg thiamin 2 months after repeatedly taking 100 mg thiamin per day for a period of 15 days. Onepatient with thiamin-related contact dermatitis experienced an exacerbation of eczema followingexperimental provocation with an oral dose of 200 mg thiamin. A fourth case-report involved a youngman who contracted allergic encephalitis following an oral dose of thiamin (the amount and form areunclear). No evidence has been identified on reproductive effects of thiamin or thiamin derivatives in humans.Supplementation trials In a supplementation study, one isolated individual, who had earlier received parenteral thiamin hydrochloride, experienced nausea and insomnia following a daily dose of 200 mg thiaminhydrochloride per day for less than a week. Symptoms resolved when the dose was halved. Animal data The animal toxicity database is limited. Thiamin is of low acute toxicity but single oral doses of 3000-5000 mg/kg bw thiamin/thiamin hydrochloride in rats and mice are lethal. Thiamin nitrate is even lessacutely toxic, with no adverse effects being reported in mice following a single oral dose of 5000mg/kg bw. There is an absence of chronic and sub-chronic data for high-dose exposure to the water-soluble thiamin derivatives. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There has been no study on the carcinogenicity of thiamin. Thiamin hydrochloride has been shown tobe non-mutagenic in a range of bacterial mutagenicity and in vitro chromosomal aberration tests. Genetic variations There are no known genetic variations resulting in increased susceptibility to thiamine toxicity. 761 15It is noted that a dose of 17 mg would have been inconsistent with the rate of urinary and likely faecal excretion quoted withi n the original article. It is suggested, therefore, that this was a text error within the article that should have read '17 g', equivalent to 17,000 mg.Mechanisms of toxicity No mechanisms of toxicity have been identified. Dose-response characterisation No data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified; however, the clinical trials indicate that there is a possibility that a very small number of people may be particularly sensitive (allergic) to thiamin. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Mills, 1941 Thiamin-associated toxicity was reported in a 47 year old woman who had been taking 10,000 mg thiamin hydrochloride daily for 21/2weeks (presumably by the oral route, although this is unclear). Symptoms were reported to resemble those of over-dosage of thyroid extract: headache, increasedirritability, insomnia, rapid pulse, weakness and trembling. Symptoms disappeared within 2 daysfollowing cessation of treatment but recurred 4 1/2weeks after the patient resumed a dose of 5 mg per day16. Again, prompt relief soon followed cessation of intake. In the same report, Mills described symptoms similar to those of thyroid hyperactivity, with fine and coarse muscle tremor, rapid pulse andnervous hyperirritability in a young woman receiving an average of 17 mg thiamin hydrochloride per day(again, this was presumed to be by mouth but this was not explicit) 17. The woman was said to be excreting 12 mg/ day in her urine and passing stools smelling strongly of thiamin. Meador et al., 1993 This was a study conducted in 17 Alzheimer's patients (9 males and 8 females), mean age 69 years, to assess possible beneficial effects of thiamin supplementation. Patients were treated with graduateddoses of thiamin hydrochloride, up to 6000-8000 mg/ day, for 5-6 months. Subjects were reported tohave tolerated the doses well without weakness or other side effects, with the exception of twosubjects who developed nausea and indigestion at dose levels of 7000 and 7500 mg/ day. However,these individuals were subsequently returned to their own previously highest tolerated doses (6500 and7000 mg/ day) without side effects. The study was limited in that there were small numbers involvedand that 8/17 subjects suffered significant mental impairment on objective mental tests, so that anyeffects may have been undereported.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 16The Mills report states 5 mg/ day. However, when citing the Mills data, Iber et al. (1982) state 5 g/ day. 17The dose reported here as 17 mg is inconsistent with the quoted rate of urinary and likely faecal excretion and suggests that t his is a text error within the Mills report that should read 17 g. Such an error would be consistent with an earlier error within the same report, indicated by Iber et al. (see notes 15 and 16). 771Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Gokhale, 1996 A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study was carried out in 556 females (aged 12-21 years) from 14 schools and hostels in India, suffering from moderate to severe spasmodic dysmenorrhoea. Thethiamin status of the participants is unclear. A daily oral dose of 100 mg of thiamin hydrochloride wasgiven for 90 days followed by placebo for 60 days or vice versa. No adverse effects were reported. Animal data Molitor, 1942 The lethal dose for thiamin in mice was reported to be 100 mg (approximately 5000 mg/kg bw, assuming a bodyweight of 20 g). Leuschner, 1992 As a preliminary test to determine a maximum tolerated dose for an investigation into the antinociceptive properties of thiamin, no toxic effects were observed in female NMRI mice (weight,21 - 28 g) when administered oral doses of thiamin nitrate in 0.8% aqueous hydroxypropylmethylcellulose gel at doses up to 5000 mg/kg bw. The number of animals tested was not stated. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 1.50 mg/ day (from 1986/87 NDNS) 2.6 day up to 300 mg/ day (OTC, 2001)Estimated maximum intake: 2.6 + 300 = 303 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment Thiamin present in food is efficiently absorbed. However, water-soluble supplements, such as thiamin hydrochloride and thiamin mononitrate, are poorly absorbed due to saturation of transport mechanisms. It is generally accepted that ingested thiamin has a very low toxicity in humans. Most data are either in the form of case reports of possible thiamin-associated adverse effects or from thiaminsupplementation studies designed primarily to investigate potential beneficial effects. The latter do notalways specifically report an absence of adverse effect. The limited amount of human data indicates that adverse effects are generally CNS-related and occur only at very high doses. A small number of individuals may show an allergic response to lower doses, 781but reports of these lower dose-related events are rare. It is possible that this sub-population may be the same sub-group that is susceptible to adverse effects, e.g. anaphylaxis etc, following parenteraladministration of thiamin. The animal database is also very limited. A lethal dose of thiamin in rodents is preceded by CNS effects such as shock, muscle tremor, convulsions, respiratory disturbance and collapse, symptoms which aresimilar to acute thiamin toxicity in humans. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data to establish a Safe Upper Level for thiamin. The oral toxicity of thiamin andthiamin derivatives in humans is generally considered to be very low. Most available documented dataare either in the form of case reports of possible thiamin-associated adverse effects or from thiaminsupplementation studies designed primarily to investigate potential beneficial effects. The lattergenerally involve the use of the synthetic non-water soluble derivatives (not included in this review andnot currently found in dietary supplements) and do not always specifically report an absence ofadverse effect. Reports of thiamin-associated toxicity in humans are rare and most relate to incidentsfollowing parenteral administration of the vitamin. High doses ( /H328975000 mg) of thiamin hydrochloride may cause headache, nausea, irritability, insomnia, rapid pulse and weakness; these symptoms arerelieved following cessation of treatment or reduction of dose. There have been a very small number ofreported adverse effects following lower doses. These comprise four case reports and one isolatedindividual taking part in a supplementation study. No specific toxic effects of thiamin ingestion by humans have been identified. However, there is a paucity of large controlled human supplementation studies. Significant adverse effects have not beennoted with the water-soluble forms of thiamin used in dietary supplements. These forms are poorlyabsorbed at high doses, which further restricts their toxicity. One human supplementation study (Meador et al ., 1993) reported that graduated doses of thiamin hydrochloride, up to 6000-8000 mg/ day for 5-6 months, caused no adverse effects in a very smallgroup of patients. These subjects were reported to have tolerated the doses well, without weakness orother side effects, with the exception of two subjects (out of seventeen) who developed nausea andindigestion at doses of 7000 - 7500 mg. The study may well have under-reported side effects since halfof the subjects were suffering from significant mental impairment on objective measures. From theavailable database, it appears that higher doses of thiamin ( /H328977000 mg) may be associated with headache, nausea, irritability, insomnia, rapid pulse and weakness. In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study by Gokhale et al . (1996), a daily oral dose of 100 mg thiamin hydrochloride (for sixty or ninety days) was given to 556 young females (12 - 21 years). Noadverse effects were reported. The thiamin status of the participants is unclear. Based on this study, alevel of 100 mg/ day (equivalent to 1.7 mg/kg supplemental thiamin for a 60 kg adult) of supplementalthiamin would not be expected to result in adverse effects. No uncertainty factor has been appliedsince this guidance is based on human data with large numbers of subjects and no hazard has beenidentified from other studies. This level is for guidance only and is applicable to the water-soluble formsof thiamin only. It should be noted that the applicability of the study, which was conducted in youngwomen, to the general population is uncertain and the possibility of rare hypersensitivity reactionscannot be excluded.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 791Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 References COMA (1991).

Pyridoxine is composed of three forms (vitamers), pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine, all of which are normally present in foods. Pyridoxine hydrochloride isphotosensitive and will degrade slowly when exposed to light. Natural occurrence Pyridoxamine and pyridoxal are found in animal products, and pyridoxine in animals and plants. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Pyridoxine is found in chicken (4.2 mg/kg), fish, liver, kidney, pork, eggs (1.1 mg/kg), milk, wheatgerm (11.5 mg/kg) and brewer's yeast (25 mg/kg). Other sources include brown rice (5.5 mg/kg), soybeans (6.3 mg/kg), oats, whole-wheat grains, peanuts and walnuts (7.3 mg/kg). Long-term storage, canning,roasting or stewing of meat and food processing techniques can destroy pyridoxine. Boiling reduces thepyridoxine content of food because of losses into the water. Pyridoxine is present in a number of foodsupplements generally at doses up to 10 mg/ day but some single dose food supplements may contain50 to 150 mg. Single nutrient products (recommended maximum daily doses of 10 - 100 mg) areavailable without the supervision of a pharmacist. As a licensed medicine, pyridoxine hydrochloride is also present in various multivitamin preparations for the prevention and treatment of vitamin deficiencies (maximum daily doses of 0.5 - 30 mg). Productscontaining pyridoxine (maximum daily dose of 10 mg) combined with other constituents are availablefrom a pharmacist. Recommended amounts Recommended intakes of pyridoxine are based on protein intake. In the UK, the RNI is set at 15 /H9262g/g protein for adults. This is equivalent to approximately 1.4 and 1.2 mg/ day in the UK for males andfemales respectively. In the US, the Recommended Daily Allowance is set at 1.3 mg/ day, and it isapproximately 1.6 mg/ day in Australia. Pregnant and lactating women and older people, who have lowvitamin B 6levels, can usually increase their intake through a high-protein diet. Analysis of tissue levels and pyridoxine status Pyridoxal phosphate has been determined enzymatically using tyrosine apodecarboxylase or byfluorimetric methods. The preferred method is high-pressure liquid chromatography. Vitamin B 6status has also been assessed using erythrocyte aminotransferases and the tryptophan loading test; the latteris not a reliable indicator of vitamin B 6status in persons receiving oestrogens or with increased secretion of glucocorticoids.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 811Risk Assessment Vitamin B6(Pyridoxine)Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Pyridoxine is an approved treatment for sideroblastic anaemias and pyridoxine-dependent errors of metabolism. Pyridoxine has also been claimed to alleviate the symptoms of a range of conditionsincluding premenstrual syndrome, sickness during pregnancy, carpal tunnel syndrome,hyperhomocystinaemia (a risk factor for cardiovascular disease) and neuropathies. Function The cofactor forms of pyridoxine are pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate. Pyridoxalphosphate is involved as a cofactor particularly in the metabolic transformation of amino acids,including decarboxylation, transamination and racemisation. Vitamin B 6is a cofactor the conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptamine and of methionine to cysteine. Pyridoxine can modify the action of steroid hormones in vivo by interacting with steroid- receptor complexes. Pyridoxine is essential for the manufacture of prostaglandins and for the formationof red blood cells. Pyridoxine is involved in cellular replication and antibody production. An adequate supply of pyridoxine is necessary for the function of the nervous system. The vitamin is involved in the biosynthesis ofseveral neurotransmitters, including serotonin, gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA), dopamine andnoradrenaline and so has a role in the regulation of mental processes and mood. It is also involved insodium-potassium balance, histamine metabolism, the conversion of tryptophan to niacin, absorption ofvitamin B 12and the production of hydrochloric acid in the gastrointestinal tract. Deficiency Pyridoxine deficiency is unusual in humans. Children who had been given milk in which the pyridoxinehad been destroyed by overheating, displayed various symptoms, including weakness, irritability,nervousness, susceptibility to noise, weight loss and insomnia. Adult volunteers on a pyridoxinedeficient diet became depressed and irritable, with 'a loss of sense of responsibility'. They alsoexperienced a greasy rash on the forehead and around the nose and cracking of the lips and tongue. Pyridoxine dependency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase, which is involved in the synthesis of GABA, has a defective binding site for pyridoxalphosphate. Much higher tissue levels of pyridoxal phosphate are necessary for the enzyme to have anysignificant activity. The condition results in seizures of prenatal or neonatal onset and treatment withlarge doses of pyridoxine is necessary to prevent severe mental retardation or death. It has also been suggested that pyridoxine deficiency may be a factor in hyperhomocysteinaemia, which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Pyridoxine deficiency has also been reported to be associated with immune dysfunction, kidney stones, cancer and carpal tunnel syndrome, although the evidence for these links is variable.Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 821 1Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 83Interactions Pyridoxine requires riboflavin, zinc and magnesium to fulfil its physiological function in humans. Pyridoxine supplements reduce the therapeutic effect of levodopa, a naturally occurring amino acidused to treat Parkinson's disease. Pyridoxine also interacts with other drugs such as isoniazid, phenytoin,theophylline and phenobarbitone. It has been claimed that women taking oral contraceptives may havean increased requirement for pyridoxine. Absorption and bioavailability The phosphate forms of vitamin B6in food are dephosphorylated in the intestinal lumen, and pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are taken up from the small intestine by an energy-dependent process. All three are converted to pyridoxal phosphate in the tissues. A proportion of the vitamin B 6present in plant-based foods is biologically unavailable because it is present as pyridoxine glycosides that are not hydrolysed by intestinal enzymes. These glycosides may beabsorbed, but do not act as a coenzyme in the body and are excreted unchanged in the urine. All three forms of vitamin B 6(pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine) are readily absorbed in the small intestine. The extent of absorption is decreased following gastric resection or in patients withmalabsorption syndrome. Excess pyridoxine is excreted in the urine, and an adequate daily intake istherefore essential. Distribution and metabolism Pyridoxine in food is converted to active forms in the liver, a process which requires zinc and riboflavin. Vitamin B6is stored in the liver, with about 50% also being present in muscle, bound to glycogen phosphorylase. Pyridoxine is also stored in the brain. The total body storage for adults is between 6 and27 mg. Pyridoxine in the form of pyridoxal crosses the placenta, with foetal plasma concentrations beingfive times the level found in maternal plasma. The three forms of vitamin B 6are present in body tissues, mainly as 5-phosphorylated derivatives of pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. The half-life of pyridoxine is 15-20 days, and it is not significantly bound to plasma proteins. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are all largely metabolised in the through phosphorylation by pyridoxal kinase. Pyridoxine phosphate is oxidised to the active coenzyme pyridoxal-5-phosphate,by an enzyme in the liver acid. Excretion Pyridoxic acid, the main excretory metabolite, is eliminated via the urine.1Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Toxicity Human data Long-term use of pyridoxine (generally in excess of 200 mg/ day) has been reported to result in paraesthesiae, somnolence and low serum folic acid levels. Large doses of pyridoxine (usually quotedas over 2000 mg/ day) can cause nerve damage. Symptoms include tingling in the hands and feet(paraesthesiae), a stumbling gait, perioral numbness, a characteristic 'stocking-glove' sensory loss andlack of muscle coordination. Duration of pyridoxine use is important as well as dosage, with lowerdoses of pyridoxine (500 mg/ day or less) consumed for many months or years also being associatedwith neuropathy. In most, but not all reported cases the damage has been generally reversible. Nightrestlessness, vivid dreams, sun sensitivity and an acne-like rash may also occur with high doses (150 mg/ day or more) of pyridoxine. Supplementation trials A number of pyridoxine supplementation trials in humans have investigated effects on conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, pre-menstrual syndrome, sickness during pregnancy andhyperhomocysteinaemia. The majority of these trials have not been placebo controlled and have eithernot considered or not reported adverse effects in detail. The available studies are considered in detail inthe review of vitamin B 6 (http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers) and the key studies for the risk assessment are discussed below. Animal data Symptoms of neuropathy have occurred at variable time intervals in different species following dosesranging from 50 mg/kg bw/ day to 7000 mg/kg bw/ day. Inter-species variability in response is apparent. No effects on foetal development have been observed in animal studies. Doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg bw/ day pyridoxine, administered intraperitoneally, produced histological changes in the testes of rats(reversible at the lower dose), and doses of 50 mg/kg/ day administered intraperitoneally to female ratsprevented prolactin release. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No published data on the carcinogenicity or genotoxicity of pyridoxine have been found. Mechanisms of toxicity Pyridoxal phosphate is thought to be responsible for the observed toxicity. Schwann cells in culturegrow less well when provided with pyridoxal in the culture medium than when the vitamin B 6source is pyridoxine. The addition of pyridoxal to the culture medium decreased cell survival even in thepresence of an adequate concentration of pyridoxine, suggesting a possible neurotoxic action ofpyridoxal. It is not known whether pyridoxal is cytotoxic to other cell types in culture. 841Dose-response characterisation The precise dose-response relationship between pyridoxine and peripheral neuropathy is uncertain in humans. Neuropathy has been associated with high doses of pyridoxine (generally over 2000 mg/ day),but the duration of exposure is also important, with neuropathy occurring after long periods ofexposure to lower levels (500 mg/ day or less) of supplemental pyridoxine. Vulnerable groups No groups particularly vulnerable to pyridoxine-induced toxicity have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations which increase vulnerability to toxicity of vitamin B6have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Data are available from numerous human studies for consideration in the risk assessment of vitamin B6. However, most of the available human data are unsatisfactory, with retrospective exploration of records,use of non-standardised end points and incomplete follow up. Other significant deficiencies were thatthe studies did not include adequate controls (similar patients who were not treated with vitamin B6),were often performed in small groups using observational methods, and were of a duration oftreatment ( /H110216 months) too short to reveal neurological effects, even at very high doses. In many studies adverse effects were not examined. Examples from the available database are described in moredetail below. Short term studies Del Tredici et al., 1985This report studied the effect of vitamin B 6on 24 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome treated for 2-4 months with 150 or 300 mg vitamin B6daily. Vitamin B6was reported as having a beneficial effect on carpal tunnel syndrome, and no exacerbation of neurological symptoms or signs of peripheralneuropathy were reported. Distal motor latency was measured and patients completed a self-assessment questionnaire numerically ranking the severity of the symptoms. The short duration andsmall number of patients involved limit the usefulness of this study in setting a safe upper level. Brush, 1988 In a retrospective survey of 336 women treated with pyridoxine alone or in combination with other agents, 5 subjects reported mild tingling and/ or numbness at doses of 200 mg/ day, which weredescribed in the paper as 'definite side effects'. Similar side effects were not observed in an earlierExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 851Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 group of women treated with up to 150 mg/ day. No control group of patients unsupplemented with vitamin B6was included. This study does not form an adequate basis for setting a safe upper level because of the lack of detail in the reporting, particularly with respect to duration of treatment. Brush et al., 1988 The effects of supplemental vitamin B6in 630 women suffering from premenstrual syndrome were described from a retrospective survey of clinical records. The patients reported taking daily doses ofvitamin B 6ranging from 40 to 100 mg early in the study and from 120 to 200 mg later in the investigation period. The highest dose taken was 100mg/ day or less in 77% of the patients. Patients werereported to have taken vitamin B 6for periods from three months to five years, but only 20% of subjects had continued treatment for more than one year. The authors reported that indigestion and nauseawere 'probably genuine side effects' and that peripheral sensory neuropathy was not observed. Thelimitations of this study are that symptoms were reported from a retrospective investigation of recordsand inadequate details were included. Bernstein and Lobitz, 1988 In an open study, 16 patients received 150 mg vitamin B 6daily for 6 months for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. It was reported that one patient developed increased photosensitivity with increasedtanning on minimal exposure to sunlight, but this subject elected to remain in the study. The patientsunderwent a monthly clinical evaluation by a neurologist, including a detailed electrophysiologicalstudy of motor and sensory nerves. No deterioration of peripheral nerve function was observed, thoughexaminations were completed after only 4 months of supplementation in 10 subjects and after 5months in 5 subjects. The limitations of this study are the short duration of treatment, the small numberof patients studied and the incomplete follow-up of symptoms. Molimard et al., 1980 In a double-blind study, 69 medical students received a tablet of placebo, 50 or 250 mg vitamin B 6twice a day for 10 days (total dose being 100 or 500 mg/ day). The subjects were given a simple digit-coding taskprior to treatment, immediately after treatment and 14 days later. The volunteers were also tested at theend of the treatment period on some numerical problems and on the content of the medicalundergraduate course during the study period. Fifty eight of the volunteers completed the digit-codingtests, which showed a highly significant improvement with time (a learning effect) in all groups. Therewere no significant differences between groups in the uncorrected scores, but there was evidence of adose-related decrease in the learning effect, which was highly statistically significant (p /H110210.002 )in the highest-dose group compared to the controls, but this was not statistically significant at the 5% level(p /H110210.07) in the 100 mg/ day group. No other differences were observed between the three groups. In a second experiment, a group of 30 patients were randomised to receive placebo, 20 mg or 1000 mg/ daypyridoxine for 15 days with subjects given a variety of tests before and after treatment. At the high dose,an adverse effect was reported for word recognition, but not for word or visual memorisation.Performance in the visual retention test was worse in the high dose pyridoxine group after treatment. Theextremely short treatment period and the small number of participants limit the usefulness of this study. Berger et al., 1992 Doses of 1000 or 3000 mg/ day pyridoxine were administered to three and two healthy volunteers respectively, until the development of symptoms of neuropathy in an experimental study. Symptomsoccurred within 1.5 and 3.5 months in high-dose subjects. In subjects treated with 1000 mg/ day 861symptoms of neuropathy, indicated by numbness and pins and needles sensation in the toes, developed in two of the subjects after 4.5 and 7 months of treatment. Treatment of one subject was continued forover 14 months before quantitative sensory threshold test results became abnormal, an early indicatorof neuropathy. An inverse relationship was observed between the daily dose calculated on a bodyweight basis, and the time taken for the development of toxicity. In other words as the dose decreased,the period of treatment before onset of adverse effects increased. Clinical symptoms continued tointensify for some weeks after pyridoxine was withdrawn. The very small number of participantsinvolved in this study limits its usefulness in risk assessment. Bernstein and Dinesen, 1993 This paper reported the effect of vitamin B 6in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Sixteen patients received 200 mg vitamin B6per day for 3 months. No signs of peripheral neuropathy were found in the uninvolved ulnar nerves, and there was no evidence of new peripheral neuropathy duringthe 3 months of treatment. The limitations of this study are the short duration and the small number ofpatients involved. Schaumburg et al., 1983 This paper describes case reports of seven patients who had ataxia and severe sensory nervous system dysfunction after vitamin B 6consumption. Patients self-prescribed a maximum of 2 - 6 g vitamin B6 daily. Only two of the seven patients started taking the vitamin at such high doses, while others beganwith doses of 50 to 100 mg/ day. None experienced symptoms at doses below 2 g per day. Plasmapyridoxine was measured in one of the patients at the initial examination and found to be 30ng/mLthree hours after the subject's usual daily dose of 4 g vitamin B 6. The reported duration of treatment ranged from two months to over three years. The small number of patients and the lack of reporteddetails limit the usefulness of this study. Long term studies Parry and Bredesen, 1985The paper describes 16 patients who developed neuropathy after taking high doses of pyridoxine (200- 5000 mg/ day) for several months or more. The patients developed unstable gait, perioral numbness anda 'stocking-glove' sensory loss followed. Discontinuation of pyridoxine was followed by improvement insymptoms. The authors believed that the toxicity of pyridoxine was manifest through an effect on thedorsal root ganglion. Most patients took 2000 mg/ day or more pyridoxine (many of these had startedat lower doses) and symptoms became apparent within a year of taking 2000 mg/ day or more. Onepatient had taken 200 mg pyridoxine/ day for 3 years and two others had taken 500 mg/ day for 1-2years. Although the duration of this study is adequate, a limited number of patients were studied andfew details are reported. Dalton and Dalton, 1987 This paper represents a follow-up study of data presented in a letter to the Lancet in 1985, which described sensory neuropathy in 23 out of 58 women with premenstrual syndrome, who had serumvitamin B 6concentrations above the normal range (Dalton, 1985). Serum vitamin B6levels were measured in all women taking vitamin B6supplements at a private clinic. Patients (n=172) who had elevated serum vitamin B6levels (above the normal range in humans of 3.16 to 18 ng/mL) were specifically asked to report symptoms such as tingling in the fingers, which could be interpreted as evidence of sensoryExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 871Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 neuropathy. The patients were all taking /H1102150 to /H11021500 mg/ day vitamin B6for premenstrual syndrome. No control group of patients with similar premenstrual symptoms, but not taking vitamin B6, were asked the same questions. Patients reported symptoms including paraesthesia, hyperaesthesia, bone pains,muscle weakness, numbness and fasciculation that were bilateral and most marked in the extremities.Neurological examinations were undertaken on those who reported symptoms, but neurophysiologicaltests were not undertaken. Findings on neurological examination included weakness, diminution but notloss of tendon reflexes, positive L'Hermitte's test and sensory loss in a stocking-glove distribution.Symptoms disappeared when vitamin B 6was withdrawn and reappeared if treatment was resumed. Complete recovery occurred within 6 months of stopping vitamin B6treatment. Three women had subnormal serum levels of vitamin B6after stopping supplementation due to symptoms of sensory neuropathy. They were advised to take 50 mg vitamin B6/ day, but within a month they again experienced symptoms of neuropathy and had serum vitamin B6levels of /H1102218 ng/mL. The 103 women who presented with symptoms took a mean dose of 117 + 92 mg vitamin B6for a period of 2.9 + 1.9 years, and in 70% of these subjects, serum levels were /H1102234 ng/mL (the upper limit of testing). In contrast, the group which did not report symptoms, took a mean dose of 116 + 66 mg vitamin B6, for a period of 1.6 + 2.1 years, and in 55% of these subjects, serum levels were /H1102234 ng/mL. The difference in duration of treatment, was statistically significant (P /H110210.01). Although the duration of treatment and the measurement of plasma vitamin levels in this study were useful, the study has limitations when beingconsidered for risk assessment. The lack of a control group and potential bias introduced by thefocussed questioning of the patients on their symptoms detract from the quality of these data. Itshould be noted that muscle weakness has not been observed at higher doses in other studies. Mitwalli et al., 1984 Twenty two male patients with kidney stones secondary to hyperoxaluria were given doses (250 - 500 mg/ day) of vitamin B 6for 8 months to 6 years (average 2.3 years). Seven subjects underwent nerve conduction studies. No neurological complications were reported in the group. The usefulness of thefindings of this study for risk assessment is limited by the low number of patients involved. Hawkins, 1986 A lower than expected incidence of tardive dyskinesia was reported in a total of 58,139 schizophrenic patients who had been treated by 80 physicians, in some cases for many years, with neuroleptics(phenothiazines and/ or haloperidol) and with high doses of a mixture of vitamins. The vitamin regimenconsisted of three daily doses of vitamin C (1000 mg), vitamin B 6(200 mg), vitamin E (200 IU) and either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide (1000 mg). This data set is of limited value for several reasons: there is alack of detail, the results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, there was no check oncompliance (which is a problem in such patients), the primary endpoint (tardive dyskinesia) is notrelevant to vitamin B 6neuropathy, the elicitation of minor vitamin B6-related symptoms in schizophrenic patients would have been difficult, and any effect of vitamin B6might have been masked by the neuroleptic drug treatment and/ or the very high doses of the other vitamins. In consequence, theusefulness of these observations for risk assessment is limited. The study which reports neuropathy at the lowest dose (50 mg/ day) is that of Dalton and Dalton (1987), but this investigation is flawed in a number of ways. For example, there was no control group, and sincesubjects were questioned about their symptoms, reports may be biased. However, this study has theadvantage that plasma levels of the vitamin were measured. In women with elevated plasma levels,longer exposure was associated with clinical symptoms and in the absence of better quality data toconfirm safety, it is not possible to dismiss this investigation. Brush (1988) and Parry and Bredesen (1985) 881reported neuropathy at doses of 200 or 500 mg/ day, the latter study involving exposure of several years' duration. However, small numbers of patients were involved and few data were provided. Otherstudies which investigated the effects of low doses of vitamin B 6(Del Tredici et al., 1985; Bernstein and Lobitz, 1988; Bernstein and Dinesen, 1993) were somewhat better conducted but did not considerexposure of sufficient duration. For example, in Bernstein and Lobitz (1988) patients received 150 mg/ dayfor 6 months, in Del Tredici (1985) patients received 150 or 300 mg/ day for 2-4 months and in Bernsteinand Dinesen (1993) the subjects received 200 mg/ day for 3 months. These studies did not have placebocontrol groups and involved small numbers of patients, as well as being of durations that wereinsufficient for the development of symptoms, even had the doses been higher. Thus while the results ofthese studies are negative, they are not necessarily incompatible with those of Dalton and Dalton (1987). Animal data In many of the available animal studies vitamin B6was administered by injection. Whilst these studies confirm that pyridoxine neurotoxicity is dose- and time-dependent in both rats and dogs, the data arenot directly comparable to those generated by exposure via the oral route. In contrast to the majorityof the human data, the animal studies described below were performed under controlled conditionsmaking them useful for consideration in risk assessment. Small numbers of animals were involved, as iscommon practice for studies conducted in dogs. Phillips et al., 1978 Pyridoxine hydrochloride was administered orally in gelatine capsules (0, 50 or 200 mg/kg bw/ day) to three groups of female beagles (four control and five per treatment group) over 100-112 days. Four of thefive animals in the high dose group showed signs of ataxia and loss of balance after 45 days oftreatment, while the fifth showed clinical signs after 75 days. Clinical signs of toxicity were not observedin the 50 mg/kg/ day group, but bilateral loss of myelin in the dorsal nerve roots was observedhistologically. Hoover et al., 1981 Three adult beagle dogs (with a fourth dog serving as a control) received pyridoxine hydrochloride in gelatine capsules, 5 mg/kg bw/ day for the first week, 100 mg/kg bw/ day for the second week and150 mg/kg bw/ day from the 15 thto the 100thday of the experiment. Neurological disease, characterised by proprioceptive defects, developed in each pyridoxine-treated dog and occurred in two dogs duringthe fourth week and in the third dog during the eighth week of administration. The dogs had spastic,dysmetric leg movements and lacked apparent sense of motion or position of the legs. This wascharacterised ultrastructurally by degeneration of axons, loss of axons, collapse myelin sheaths,degeneration and myelin and astrocytic scarring on histological examination. Krinke et al., 1980 Six beagle dogs were administered 300 mg/kg bw/ day pyridoxine hydrochloride in gelatine capsules, in addition to a balanced diet. The animals were examined in comparison with two control dogs. Within 9 daysthe treated animals developed a swaying gait, and eventually became unable to walk, but had no observablemuscle weakness. Morphological examination showed widespread neuronal degeneration in the dorsal rootganglia and the Gasserian ganglia. Degeneration of sensory nerve fibres was apparent in peripheral nerves,dorsal columns of the spinal cord and the descending spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 891Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food percentile: Supplements to 100 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum daily exposure: 3.9 + 100 = 104 mg No potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment The key adverse effect, for vitamin B6is neuropathy, which has been demonstrated in both humans and laboratory animals. The effect occurs after consumption of high doses and/ or long duration. Generallythe symptoms are reversible once the exposure is stopped but in some cases involving high doses, theeffects are irreversible. Progressive sensory ataxia occurs, presenting initially as unstable gait and numbfeet, then numbness in the hands, followed by profound impairment of position sense and vibrationsense in the distal limbs. The senses of touch, temperature and pain are less affected. Data from animal studies also demonstrate neurotoxicity, although some species differences are apparent. Doses as low as 50 mg/kg bw/ day have been associated with a loss of myelin. Subtle effectssuch as changes in startle response have also been observed. The animal data also suggest that durationof exposure is important in the response to vitamin B 6. ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL As discussed above, the available human data are not adequate for risk assessment and the Safe UpperLevel has been based on the most appropriate of the studies performed in animals under controlledconditions. Phillips et al . (1978) LOAEL: 50 mg/kg bw/ day, based on the study by Phillips et al . (1978) in dogs Uncertainty factors: 3 for LOAEL to extrapolation 10 50/300 = 0.17 mg/kg bw/ day supplemental pyridoxine (for daily consumption (equivalent to 10 mg/ day for a 60 kg adult)over a lifetime): Excessive quantities of vitamin B 6result in peripheral neuropathy in both animals and humans. The effect is dependent on both the dose and the duration of exposure. In order to determine the levels at which vitamin B6could be safely taken by the entire population over a lifetime, large well-controlled studies with careful symptomatic observation and attention tocritical endpoints are required. Unfortunately much of the available data from studies in humans areunsatisfactory with retrospective exploration of records, use of unstandardised end points andincomplete follow up, often of small observational groups with short durations of treatment ( /H110216 months) and without adequate control groups. Despite the limitations in design of the human studies, the available data clearly indicate that pyridoxine causes neuropathy in humans and that the duration of exposure as well as dose is important. Therefore,in the absence of better quality data the reports of toxicity following long, low level exposure tovitamin B 6cannot be entirely dismissed. Overall, the human data are inadequate to establish a Safe Upper Level, since the effect levels are unclear and the studies at low levels of intake are of limitedquality. Neuropathy is also observed in laboratory animals, and the data confirm the importance of dose and duration in determining the effects of vitamin B 6. In the absence of reliable human data at low levels of exposure, the Safe Upper Level is based on animal data, in which histological changes were apparent inthe nerves of dogs treated with 50 mg/kg bw/ day for 100-112 days (Phillips, 1978). Clinical signs oftoxicity were not apparent in this group but were observed in the high dose group which received200 mg/kg bw/ day. Using uncertainty factors of 300 (consisting of 3 for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolationof a histopathological change, 10 for inter-species and 10 for inter-individual variation) a Safe UpperLevel of 0.17 mg/kg bw/ day can be derived. This relates to supplemental pyridoxine because the basalpyridoxine content of the diet in the key study is unknown. This SUL is equivalent to 10 mg/ day in a60 kg adult. These uncertainty factors are appropriate because the LOAEL in the dog related to asub-chronic study and therefore may have underestimated the toxicity during chronic exposure. Theneed for an inter-species factor is supported by the fact that the LOAEL dose in dogs (50 mg/kgbw/ day) is equivalent to an intake of 3000 mg per day in humans, which would produce severe toxicityin humans, suggesting that humans are probably more sensitive than dogs to these effects. Finally, thefactor for human variability is necessary to allow for the greater size and diversity of the humanpopulation compared with the small number of dogs (n=5) studied by Phillips et al . (1978). In humans, a supplementary dose of 10 mg/ day represents a clear SUL, with no adverse effects being anticipated over a lifetime's exposure. Doses of 200 mg/ day vitamin B 6or more taken for long periods are associated with reports of neuropathy in some human subjects. The effect of taking vitamin B6at doses between 10 and 200 mg is unclear. The risk posed by such exposure in the short term may benegligible, but the available data do not allow identification of a dose or duration of exposure abovethe SUL that would be of negligible risk. It is unfortunate that no reliable and controlled studies have been conducted in the past 5 years to establish whether intakes between 10 and 200 mg/ day are safe in the long term.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 911Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 References Berger, A.R., Schaumburg, H.H., Schroeder, C., Apfel, S., Reynolds, R.

The centreof the tetrapyrrolic ring nucleus contains a cobalt ion that can be attached to methyl, deoxyadenosyl-,hydroxo- or cyano- groups. Natural occurrence Vitamin B12originates from bacteria, fungi and algae, and is present in virtually all animal tissues. Plants contain no vitamin B12 beyond that derived from microbial contamination. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Major dietary sources of vitamin B12, mainly in the forms of methyl, deoxyadenosyl- and hydroxocobalamin, include meat (e.g. /H110220.1 mg/kg in lamb), liver ( /H110220.1 0.03-0.1 mg/kg in mg/kg in tuna). Hydroxocobalamin and, in particular, cyanocobalaminare synthetic forms used in vitamin supplements, pharmaceuticals and in the fortification of food. Methylcobalamin has been used therapeutically outside the UK, for example, in Japan. Recommended amounts The RNI for vitamin B12in adults in the UK is 0.0015 mg/ day (COMA, 1991). There is no increment required during pregnancy but there is a recommended increment of 0.0005 mg/ day for breast feeding mothers. Analysis of tissue levels and vitamin B12status Measurement of vitamin B12 in plasma is routinely used to determine deficiency, but may not be a reliable indication in all cases. In pregnancy, for example, tissue levels are normal but serum levels are low.Various other plasma markers have been identified (including methylmalonic acid, homocysteine,holotranscobalamin, anti-intrinsic factor antibodies) and methods devised (Schilling test, cobalaminabsorbance test, serum gastrin deoxyuridine suppression test) to distinguish different causes of deficiency. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Results of studies in humans have suggested that large doses of vitamin B12(particularly methyl cobalamin) may influence biological rhythms and thus may be beneficial in the treatment of sleepdisorders. Vitamin B 12has also been reported to increase light sensitivity by affecting melatonin secretion. Vitamin B12, in combination with folic acid, has been suggested to be beneficial in certain disorders, such as idiopathic osteoarthritis and vitiligo.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 931Risk Assessment Vitamin B12Function Vitamin B12serves as a cofactor to at least methionine synthase and methylmalonyl CoA mutase. Methionine synthase is pivotal in one-carbon metabolism, being crucial in the synthesisof the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine and in the cellular import and metabolism offolate. Methylmalonyl CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA and is importantin even-chained fatty acid synthesis. Deficiency Dietary deficiency is rare in younger people living in the community but occurs more frequently in olderpeople, particularly those living in institutional environments. Individuals adhering to vegan diets mayalso be at risk. Deficiency is mostly attributable to inherited or acquired defects resulting inmalabsorption or the impairment of transport of the vitamin within the body. Deficiency impacts onthe haematopoietic and nervous systems. Associated diseases include megaloblastic anaemia andneuropathies typically sub-acute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Vitamin B 12deficiency can lead to moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia, a possible risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. Oral supplements are indicated prophylactically where there is a likelihood of deficiency in those whose gastrointestinal function is normal e.g. in individuals who are strict vegetarians. Inherited andacquired disorders relating to vitamin B 12malabsorption are usually treated by repeated injection. However, oral administration of very high doses of vitamin B12has been shown to be effective in the treatment of pernicious anaemia. Interactions Steroid drugs, such as prednisone, have been reported to increase the absorption of vitamin B12in patients with pernicious anaemia. Excessive alcohol consumption and some drugs may decreaseabsorption of vitamin B 12. Oral co-administration with ascorbic acid may result in destruction of vitamin B12. Concurrent administration of chloramphenicol may lead to antagonism of the haematopoietic response to vitamin B12. Absorption and bioavailability Vitamin B12requires intrinsic factor (IF), secreted mainly from the gastric parietal cells, to ensure adequate absorption at normal dietary intake levels. Thus the absorption of physiological doses ofvitamin B 12is limited to approximately 0.0015 - 0.002 mg/ dose or meal, due to saturation of the uptake system. Regardless of dose, approximately 1.2% of vitamin B12is absorbed by passive diffusion and consequently this process becomes quantitatively important at pharmacological levels of exposure.Protein binding in certain foods may reduce the bioavailability of the vitamin, particularly in individualswith impaired gastric acid and/ or digestive enzyme secretion. The different forms of crystallinecobalamin appear to be absorbed or retained to different extents, depending on the dose. Differencesare most apparent at low doses. Ingested vitamin B 12is released from the food matrix by the action of digestive enzymes and gastric acid and becomes bound to salivary haptocorrin-binding proteins. As the pH rises further along the gut, andunder the influence of pancreatic enzymes, vitamin B 12is released from the salivary haptocorrin and becomes complexed with intrinsic factor (IF). The cobalamin-IF complex binds to a specific cell wallPart 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 941 11Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 95receptor of the ileal enterocyte and is internalised by endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the IF is degraded and the liberated vitamin is converted to the methyl or the deoxyadenosyl form, is bound totranscobalamin II (TC II) binding protein and then exported into the portal blood. In the generalcirculation, most cobalamin is bound to transcobalamin I (TC I) but the majority of cobalamin availablefor uptake into the tissues is that bound to TC II. Distribution and metabolism Vitamin B12 is distributed into the liver, bone marrow and virtually all other tissues, including the placenta and breast milk of nursing mothers. The liver is the predominant storage site for vitamin B12. Uptake into cells occurs through receptor mediated endocytosis involving specific TC II cell wallreceptors. Once inside the tissues/ cells, the complex is degraded by the lysosomes, and the released cobalamin is metabolised either to methyl-cobalamin in the cytosol, where it binds tomethionine synthase, or to deoxyadenosyl-cobalamin in mitochondria, where it binds tomethylmalonyl CoA mutase. Excretion Excretion occurs mainly via the faeces and urine, but also through the shedding of skin cells. Excretion isvery slow, with significant enterohepatic cycling. Toxicity Human data There are a few case reports of adverse effects associated with ingestion of vitamin B12, either as a supplement, or following the consumption of yeast extract products, which also containcyanocobalamin. Five cases of allergic reactions were reported, three of which were recurrences ofsymptoms in individuals who had been previously exposed to cobalamin by the parenteral route. Onefurther case reported the occurrence of a skin eruption that resembled acne rosacea. Vitamin B 12 exposures were generally not specified. No adverse effects were reported in an experiment designed to determine the uptake of single oral doses of cyanocobalamin (up to 100 mg). However, only three participants were administered the veryhigh doses. Oral studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of vitamin B 12on pernicious anaemia. However, although no adverse effects are apparent, these studies are not relevant to the generalpopulation since absorption of vitamin B 12is reduced in this condition. The effect of high oral-dose cyanocobalamin on plasma homocysteine levels in healthy females of child-bearing age and thebenefits of cyanocobalamin in patients with seasonal affective disorder have been investigated. Noadverse affects related to treatment were reported in any study including those in which individualsreceived up to 4.5 mg/ day cyanocobalamin for 14 days, 2.0 mg/ day cyanocobalamin for up to one yearor 1.0 mg/ day cyanocobalamin for several years. Less information is available following the oraladministration of the hydroxocobalamin form of vitamin B 12. However, no adverse effects were reported1in individuals administered 0.3 mg/ day for up to 12 months. No adverse effects were reported in a controlled study in which 125 individuals received 6.0 mg/ day methylcobalamin for up to 12 weeks. Adverse reactions (not specified) were reported in one of 16 and in one of 23 oligozoospermia patients given 6 or 12 mg/ day methyl cobalamin, respectively, for 16 weeks, presumably via the oral route.However, this study was not controlled. Animal data The data-base on the oral toxicity of vitamin B12in laboratory animals is limited. Doses of 1.5 to 3.0 mg/kg bw by intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration were found to be acutely toxic in mice(CNS effects; convulsions, cardiac and respiratory failure and ultimately death). However, much higherdoses ( /H328975 g/kg bw) cyanocobalamin appeared to be tolerated by mice following oral administration. There is no evidence relating to vitamin B 12and teratogenicity or adverse effects on fertility or post- natal development. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There is no evidence suggesting that vitamin B12is carcinogenic or genotoxic in vitro or in vivo .H o we v e r , although data are not consistent, there is some limited evidence to suggest that high doses of vitaminB 12may have tumour promoting activity. Mechanisms of toxicity No data have been identified. Dose-response characterisation No relevant data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations have been identified.Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins 961 1Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Waife al ., 1963 As part of a non-controlled supplementation trial in patients with pernicious anaemia (n=27) no adverse reactions were reported in individuals receiving 0.3 mg hydroxocobalamin/ day for up to one year. Berlin et al., 1968 No adverse effects attributable to vitamin B12(cyanocobalamin) were recorded in a long-term clinical trial of 64 patients with pernicious anaemia, and other types of vitamin B12deficiency given a daily oral dose of 0.5 mg rising to 1.0 mg of cyanocobalamin (without intrinsic factor) for 10 to 70 months (42 patients received treatment for over 4 years). However, as noted previously, systemic absorption inthese patients is limited. Juhlin and Olsson, 1997 One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid (5 mg) and vitamin B 12 (1.0 mg cyanocobalamin) twice daily, for up to 12 months. There were no reports of adverse effects. However, 27 /100 and 48/100 participants had stopped taking the supplements after 1 - 2 months and3 - 6 months, respectively but reasons for withdrawal were not stated. Takahashi et al., 1999 As part of a double-blind study to assess the therapeutic effect of methyl cobalamin on sleep-wake disorder, patients were administered either 6.0 (n=21) or 0.03 mg/ day (n=27) methylcobalamin for 8weeks. The lower dose group was considered as a control group because ethical permission was notgranted for the inclusion of a placebo control group. There was no report of any adverse effects. Theroute of administration was not clear from the information given. Data were not available for allpatients at the end of 8 weeks (two of the 6.0 mg/ day dose group and three of the 0.03 mg/ day group). Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake18: day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake: 0.020 + 3.0 = 3.0 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 18The survey data do not distinguish the different forms of vitamin B12. Dietary vitamin B12is mainly in the methyl, deoxyadenosyl and hydroxocobalamin forms. Hydroxo- and particularly cyanocobalamin are the forms usually present in dietary supplements. 971Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Risk assessment Vitamin B12is a water-soluble vitamin. At physiological doses, as occurs in food, the amount absorbed is largely limited (approximately 0.002 mg/meal) by the capacity of the intrinsic factor-wall receptoruptake system. At pharmacological levels of dosing, diffusion becomes more important as the route ofabsorption. Vitamin B 12present in excess of the binding capacity of the liver, plasma and other tissues is excreted by glomerular filtration. It is generally accepted that ingested vitamin B12(cobalamin) has a very low toxicity in humans. Most available documented data are either in the form of case reports of possible vitamin B12-associated adverse effects or from clinical trials or supplementation studies designed primarily to investigatepotential beneficial effects. The latter generally involve the use of the cyanocobalamin ormethylcobalamin forms of vitamin B 12and do not always specifically report an absence of adverse effects. The animal toxicity database for vitamin B12is very limited. Doses of 1.5 to 3.0 mg/kg bw by intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration were found to be acutely toxic in mice (CNS effects;convulsions, cardiac and respiratory failure and ultimately death). However, much higher doses ( /H32897 5 g/kg bw) cyanocobalamin appeared to be tolerated by mice following oral administration. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from studies in humans and animals to set a Safe Upper Level for vitamin B12. Clinical studies have reported no adverse effects following administration of up to 6.0 mg/ day of methylcobalamin for several weeks and up to 1.0 mg/ day cyanocobalamin for several years. Clinicaltrials and supplementation studies involving up to 100 individuals to investigate the beneficial effects oforal cyanocobalamin have not reported any treatment-related adverse reactions following doses of 0.3to 4.5 mg for periods ranging from 14 days to several years. Cyanocobalamin is the type of vitamin B 12 most frequently included in supplements in the UK. The study by Juhlin and Olsson (1997), supported bythe absence of an identified hazard and widespread clinical experience with oral and parenteraltreatment, suggests that supplemental intakes of 2.0 mg cyanocobalamin/ day should not produce anyadverse effects and this intake can be used for guidance purposes. This is equivalent to 0.034 mg/kgbw/ day in a 60 kg adult. No uncertainty factor is needed because human data from large numbers ofindividuals are available. However, it should be noted that this figure has been established in particularsubgroups of the population, i.e. vitiligo suffers and those treated for pernicious anaemia, and may notbe completely applicable to the general population. 981References Berlin, H., Berlin, R., Brante, G.

Annals of Internal Medicine 58, 810-817.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 991Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 General information Chemistry Vitamin C is a six-carbon compound structurally related to glucose, consisting of two inter-convertible compounds: L-ascorbic acid, which is a strong reducing agent, and its oxidised derivative, L-dehydroascorbic acid. Natural occurrence Most animals are able to synthesise vitamin C from glucose and galactose. However, primates andguinea pigs are unable to do so. Occurrence in foods, food supplements and medicines Food of plant origin, particularly citrus and soft fruits and leafy green vegetables, are major sources ofvitamin C. Kidney and liver are good animal-derived sources of vitamin C. Vitamin C is readily lost duringcooking, due to oxidation. Ascorbic acid is a permitted anti-oxidant in food with no specified limits onthe level of fortification. Vitamin C is present in numerous dietary supplements and in licensedmedicines at doses of up to 3000 mg. Recommended amounts In 1991, COMA recommended a RNI for ascorbic acid of 40 mg/ day for adults, with an increase inpregnancy to 50 mg/ day, and during lactation to 70 mg/ day (COMA, 1991). Analysis of tissue levels and vitamin C status Plasma and urinary vitamin C levels may be measured but reflect recent dietary intake rather than thelevel of vitamin C in body stores. Leucocytes contain higher concentrations of vitamin C than plasma,whole blood or serum but measurement of leucocyte vitamin C is technically more difficult thanestimation of plasma or urinary levels. A leucocyte vitamin C level below 0.01 mg per 10 8cells is generally regarded as deficient. Brief overview of claimed non-nutritional beneficial effects It has been claimed that vitamin C protects against the common cold. Beneficial effects on conditionssuch as cancer, vascular disease, cataracts, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, autism anddepression have also been suggested. 1001Risk Assessment Vitamin CFunction Vitamin C is a strong reducing agent and as an antioxidant is involved in prevention of the damaging effects of free radicals. Vitamin C is involved in the synthesis of collagen, neurotransmitters andcarnitine; it is an enzyme co-factor and also increases the gastrointestinal absorption of non-haem iron. Deficiency Vitamin C deficiency in humans leads to the clinical syndrome of scurvy. Early symptoms in adultsinclude fatigue, weakness, aching joints and muscles. In later stages scurvy is characterised by anaemia,bleeding from the gums, petechial and sheet haemorrhages, and delayed wound healing. Interactions Absorption of metal ions may be altered by vitamin C. Absorption and bioavailability Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin C is efficient and occurs in the small intestine via a saturableactive transport mechanism. Absorption efficiency of low oral doses of vitamin C (4 - 64 mg) may be ashigh as 98%, but decreases with increasing doses of the vitamin. Distribution and metabolism Ascorbic acid is widely distributed in all tissues of the body, with higher levels found in the adrenalglands, pituitary and retina, and lower levels in kidney and muscle tissue. Vitamin C is oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid, which is hydrolysed to diketogulonic acid and then oxidised to oxalic and threonic acid. Some oxidation to carbon dioxide occurs at high doses. Excretion Unmetabolised vitamin C and vitamin C metabolites, such as oxalate, are largely excreted in the urine.Approximately 3% of a 60 mg oral dose is excreted in the faeces. More of the vitamin is excretedunchanged at higher levels of vitamin C intake. Toxicity Human data Gastrointestinal effects are the most common adverse clinical events associated with acute, high dosesof vitamin C given over a short period of time.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1011Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 102Other suggested adverse effects include acidosis, changes in prothrombin activity and 'conditioned need' scurvy (where ingestion of an excessive amount of vitamin C during pregnancy maycondition the offspring to require greater than the expected or recommended daily intakes of thevitamin). Adverse effects related to the urinary route of excretion have been claimed, including renal stones, renal tubular disease and oxaluria. It has been suggested that vitamin C consumption may increaseoxalate excretion and cause the formation of urinary stones, and subjects with a predisposition to theformation of kidney stones may be more sensitive to increases in urinary oxalate associated with vitaminC. However, studies in humans have not revealed a substantial increase in urinary oxalate after highintakes of vitamin C, and the moderate increases reported may be an experimental artefact (see later). Vitamin C increases iron uptake from the gut and it is possible that this may be important in subjects with conditions such as haemochromatosis or in subjects heterozygous for this condition. However,when doses of vitamin C of 2000 mg/ day were given to healthy volunteers for 20 months or more, noeffects on iron status were found. Supplementation trials Vitamin C was administered (in combination with other vitamins and minerals) at doses of up to 1000 mg/ day for up to 5 years in two supplementation trials with good compliance and no reportedadverse effects. Reduced vitamin B 12levels in 3 (of 90) individuals consuming more than 1000 mg/ day over a minimum of 3 years were reported in an earlier trial, although the relevance of theseobservations has been questioned. Animal data Vitamin C has low toxicity when large doses are given over a short period of time. High doses of vitaminC are associated with decreased growth rates in guinea pigs (50 mg/ day), increased cholesterol levels inrats (150 mg/kg bw/ day) and interference with trace element metabolism in chicks. No effects onreproductive or developmental parameters have been reported. A conditioned increase in vitamin Crequirements has been reported in guinea pigs. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No data on carcinogenicity have been identified. Some positive in vitro mutagenicity tests have been reported, although results are generally mixed. However, the positive results tended to occur whenvitamin C was tested in the presence of copper. Short-term vitamin C supplementation has beenreported to cause an increase in modified DNA bases, and this has been attributed to pro-oxidanteffects. In vitro , vitamin C caused an increase in DNA reactive metabolites formed from lipid hydroperoxides. There is no reliable evidence of mutagenicity in vivo . Vulnerable groups Individuals unable to regulate iron absorption due to haemochromatosis or thalassaemia may be vulnerable to any enhanced iron absorption caused by vitamin C. Although clear and substantial rises inurinary oxalate excretion have not been demonstrated during increased vitamin C intake, it remainspossible that individuals with risk factors such as uricosuria will be more sensitive.1Mechanism of toxicity Urinary stones may result from an increase in urinary oxalate excretion (see discussion below). Adverse effects attributed to vitamin C may be due to increased sensitivity to oxidant stress, because vitamin Ccan be pro-oxidant at very high concentrations. Dose-response characterisation The dose-response is unclear, as many studies have used only one dose level. However, where found,adverse effects are generally reported at levels in excess of 1000 mg vitamin C/ day. Genetic variations Polymorphisms in haptoglobin and transferrin have been reported to be associated with alteredmetabolism of vitamin C. Certain conditions may increase sensitivity to the adverse effects associatedwith this compound e.g. haemochromatosis, thalassaemia or a pre-disposition to urinary or renal stones. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Cameron and Campbell, 1974 In a stepped study, healthy human volunteers were given vitamin C with the dose increasing each week by 1000 mg. Abdominal distention, flatulence, diarrhoea and transient colic were described as 'fairlyfrequent' effects at supplemental dose levels of 3000-4000 mg daily. No other details were provided. Cook et al., 1984 Seventeen adult volunteers were given 2000 mg vitamin C/ day with meals for 16 weeks in a study examining the effect of dietary iron absorption and assimilation on body iron status. Nine subjectscontinued in the study, taking these doses of vitamin C for 24 months. No subjective side effects werereported. Although vitamin C enhances absorption of non-haem iron, no increase in serum ferritin levelswas found, despite wide variation in initial iron status between the volunteers. The authors concludedthat supplemental vitamin C had a negligible effect on iron stores. Vitamin C supplementationcontinued for a further 20 months in 4 iron-deficient and 4 iron-replete subjects. No effect of vitamin Con body iron reserves (as measured by serum ferritin levels) was apparent and no intestinal adaptationto the enhancing effect of the vitamin had occurred. The authors considered several possibleexplanations for their findings. No adverse effects were reported in this study of large supplementaldoses of vitamin C but the authors noted that the study did not exclude possible adverse effects inindividuals who are heterozygous for the haemochromatosis gene (approximately 10% of thepopulation). The study involved small numbers of participants with variable iron status and was notblinded, though compliance was checked.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1031Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Mai et al., 1990 Twenty patients with multiple sclerosis were randomised to receive either supplements providing 2000 mg/ day vitamin C, 6 mg/ day sodium selenite and 480 mg/ day vitamin E, or placebo for 5 weeks. Thepatients were interviewed about side effects after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment. Out of the 10patients receiving the active supplement, one reported slight facial erythema at week 2, whichsubsequently subsided during continued treatment, one reported passing urine with a peculiar smell.Three of the 10 patients receiving the placebo reported an increased number of headaches. Urivetzky et al., 1992 Fifteen patients with calcium oxalate renal stones (presumed by the authors to be at greatest risk from the effects of ascorbic acid), were given 100, 500, 1000, or 2000 mg supplemental ascorbic acid on days2 and 3 following operations to remove the stones. Intrarenal urine specimens were collected bynephrostomy catheter directly into EDTA sodium thimerosol preservative to stabilise ascorbic acidand oxalate; oxalate was measured following the removal of ascorbic acid with sodium nitrite. Theincrease in urinary oxalate was statistically significant at doses of administered vitamin C of 500 mg ormore. The authors estimated that there was a 6-13 mg/ day increase in urinary oxalate excretion per1000 mg/ day administered ascorbic acid, and concluded that vitamin C supplementation was associatedwith an increased risk of calcium oxalate renal stones. Wandzilak et al., 1994 Fifteen healthy volunteers were given 1000, 5000 and 10,000 mg vitamin C each for 5 days, separated by 5 days with no supplementation. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were preserved by addinghydrochloric acid to reduce the pH to 2 and frozen. Ascorbate appeared to be converted non-enzymatically into oxalate during analysis, confounding the analytical measurement. This may explainthe previously published results in other studies, where oxalate excretion was affected by ascorbateconsumption. A moderate, dose-dependent increase in urinary oxalate was found in the volunteers.However, a clear trend was not apparent when the non-enzymatic ascorbate-to-oxalate conversion wastaken into account. Subjects were advised to take the vitamin C tablets at mealtimes to minimisepotential adverse gastrointestinal effects. However, two out of 15 volunteers experienced diarrhoeawhen consuming 10,000 mg supplemental vitamin C/ day and were unable to continue taking this level.The study was not blinded. Levine et al., 1996; Levine et al., 1999 Steady state plasma ascorbic acid concentrations, urinary ascorbic acid and urinary oxalate concentrations (the latter determined by an enzymatic method reported to be free from interference byascorbic acid) were measured in 7 young healthy non-smoking subjects. At vitamin C intakes of 1000mg/ day there were statistically significant increases in urinary oxalate excretion (though this was stillwithin physiological limits) and uric acid excretion. Auer et al., 1998 Ten healthy male volunteers (with no history of stone formation) ingested 4000 mg vitamin C daily (in 4 doses per day) for 5 days. The urine collection procedure allowed the analysis of oxalate in thepresence and absence of an EDTA preservative and for the analysis of ascorbic acid. In the preservedsamples there was no significant increase in oxalate excretion at any stage of the protocol. Excretion ofascorbic acid increased when vitamin C ingestion commenced but levels stabilised after 24 hourssuggesting saturation of the metabolic pool. While transient and statistically significant changes 1041occurred in some of the biochemical risk factors, it was concluded that large doses of vitamin C did not affect the principal risk factors associated with calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. Gokce et al., 1999 In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery was measured in 21 patients with coronary artery disease 2 hours after a single supplementary dose of2000 mg vitamin C and following a 30-day period during which 500 mg vitamin C was taken daily.A significant increase in flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery was observed, compared tocontrols, following the single dose of 2000 mg vitamin C. This improvement was sustained after the 30-day supplementation period with 500 mg/ day vitamin C. The report does not mention assessmentof adverse effects. Morton et al., 2001 A retrospective cohort study of 994 women, of whom 277 were regular users of vitamin C supplements, assessed the effects of vitamin C supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD). Amongst the usersof vitamin C supplements, supplemental intake ranged from 100 mg/ day to 5000 mg/ day; the mean wascalculated to be 745 mg/ day. Average duration of vitamin C supplement use was 12.4 years. BMD levelswere assessed at the hip, lumbar spine and ultradistal and midshaft radius of the arm. Vitamin Csupplement users were reported to have BMD levels 3% higher than non-users at the midshaft radius,femoral neck and hip, after adjusting for age, body mass index and total calcium intake. A significantincrease in BMD of the femoral neck and a small increase in BMD of the total hip were still apparent invitamin C supplement users even after adjusting for age, body mass index, exercise, alcoholconsumption, smoking, physician-diagnosed osteoarthritis and use of calcium supplements, multivitaminsupplements, thiazides, oestrogen, thyroid hormones and oral corticosteroids. No parameters otherthan BMD were assessed, thus no side effects were reported. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 64 mg/ day 97.5th percentile: 160 (from NDNS) Supplements up to 3000 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum daily intake: 160 + 3000 = 3160 mg Vegetarians are a potential high intake group.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1051Part 1 Water Soluble Vitamins1 Risk assessment The available data suggest that vitamin C is not associated with significant adverse effects and there are no obvious specific key toxic endpoints for vitamin C dose given orally to healthy subjects. High oraldoses of vitamin C are associated with gastrointestinal effects, generally at doses of several grams, buthave also been reported at doses of 1000 mg (1 g). There are few controlled studies specificallyinvestigating this adverse effect. Controlled studies do not support anecdotal reports of other possibleadverse effects, such as infertility. Earlier suspicions of potential adverse effects, such as destruction of vitamin B 12, have not been confirmed following subsequent developments in analytical techniques. Data on increased oxalateexcretion attributable to vitamin C are conflicting. Some reported increases in urinary oxalate might beattributable to experimental artefact (Auer et al ., 1998) though increased oxalate was apparent at doses of more than 500 mg/ day in subjects with calcium oxalate stones. In contrast, doses of 4000 mg/ dayvitamin C were not associated with increased urinary oxalate excretion in normal subjects. Potential vulnerable groups include sufferers from disorders of iron metabolism or storage.Vitamin C has been reported to produce a variety of pro-oxidant effects. The significance of this for the general population is uncertain. Vitamin C has very low acute toxicity in animals and no effects on reproductive parameters have been reported. However high doses of vitamin C are associated with decreased growth rates in guinea pigs(50 mg/ day) and increased cholesterol levels in rats (150 mg/kg bw/ day). ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data to set a Safe Upper Level for vitamin C. The vitamin may be of low toxicity,though adverse effects, in particular on the gastrointestinal system, may occur in subjects consumingquantities of vitamin C greater than 1000 mg/ day. The precise dose at which such effects occur isvariable. These effects may be a serious problem for individuals with disordered gastrointestinalfunction. A limited study by Cameron and Campbell (1974) suggests a LOAEL for gastrointestinal effectsin humans of 3000-4000 mg/ day. For guidance purposes, based on a LOAEL of 3000 mg/ day, andapplying an UF of 3 for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation, a supplemental dose of 1000 mg/ daysupplement would not be expected to have any significant adverse effects. The dose is equivalent to17 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult. A guidance level for total vitamin C intake has not been estimatedsince adverse effects appear to follow supplemental, bolus doses rather than intake of vitamin C infood. It should be noted that higher levels of vitamin C may be without adverse effects in manyindividuals. A number of potentially vulnerable groups have been identified; these include individuals who are heterozygous for haemochromatosis, and thalassaemia or those with a pre-disposition to urinary orrenal stones. Data on the possible adverse effects of vitamin C on these individuals are also conflicting,but, appear to occur at intakes above 1 g/ day. 1061References Auer, B.L., Auer, D. and Rodgers, A.L.

Generally, their structure consists of a \u00df-ionone ring, a conjugated isoprenoid side chain and a polar terminal group.The parent compound all- trans -retinol and its fatty acid ester derivatives are referred to as pre-formed vitamin A, as opposed to the vitamin A precursors, such as \u00df-carotene. Following the recommendationsof the Food Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and World Health Organisation (WHO), estimations ofvitamin A requirement and food content take into account the different activities and variableabsorption of vitamin A and provitamin A, and are expressed in terms of 'retinol equivalent' (RE) where1/H9262g RE = 1 with provitamin A activity = 3.33 IU vitamin A activity from retinol. Natural occurrence The primary sources of vitamin A are the precursor compounds, the carotenoids, which are largely plantderived and retinyl esters found in foods of animal origin. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Foods rich in pre-formed vitamin A (retinol, retinyl esters) include dairy /H9262g RE/kg), liver (approximately 3500 /H9262g RE/kg) and fish oils. Other sources of exposure include single- or multi-vitamin supplements (at levels up to 2400 /H9262g RE per daily dose) and synthetic forms prescribed for therapeutic purposes, e.g. certain skin disorders. Other sources of exposure No other sources of exposure have been identified. Recommended amounts The UK RNI ranges set by COMA are 700 /H9262g RE/ day for adult males and 600 /H9262g RE/ day for adult females (COMA, 1991). The US recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 1000 /H9262g RE/ day for adult males and 800 /H9262g RE/ day for adult females. The WHO recommended dietary intake (RDI) is 600 /H9262g RE/ day for adult males and 500 /H9262g RE/ day for adult females.Risk Assessment Vitamin A (Retinol) 2Analysis of tissue levels and vitamin A status The hepatic concentration of retinyl esters is the most objective measure of vitamin A status, but cannot be readily determined in living individuals. The plasma retinol concentration is underhomeostatic control by the synthesis of retinol binding protein, and therefore is an insensitive indicator of status, except in cases of extreme depletion when other signs of deficiency are alreadyevident. Hypervitaminosis A may be characterised by elevated levels of plasma retinyl esters, whichnormally contribute to /H110215% of blood vitamin A. Other methods used to determine vitamin A status in humans include dietary assessment, clinical evaluation, retinal function tests and assessment ofretinol-binding proteins. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Vitamin A is used in the treatment of some skin disorders including acne, psoriasis and ichthyosis.Vitamin A has been suggested to be beneficial when used as a chemo-preventative or adjuvant agent inthe treatment of some cancers and may improve lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease. Vitamin A is used as a treatment for abnormal dark-adaptation and is included in eye dropsused to treat blurred vision, cataracts, glaucoma, conjunctivitis and dry eyes. Vitamin A (along with zinc)has been suggested to be a useful adjunct in the treatment of anaemia with iron. Vitamin A is also takenas an anti-oxidant dietary supplement. Function Vitamin A is essential to the processes of vision, reproduction, embryonic development, morphogenesis,growth and cellular differentiation. With the exception of the visual process, most processes are relatedto the control of gene expression, with vitamin A metabolites, such as retinoic acid, acting as nuclearreceptor-ligands. Deficiency Vitamin A deficiency is a problem largely in developing countries. It can lead to night blindness andxerophthalmia, growth retardation, keratinisation of epithelia, impaired hearing, taste and smell,increased susceptibility to infection, increased child mortality and reduced male fertility. In pregnancy,vitamin A deficiency can result in malformations in offspring. Deficiency in the developed world isusually limited to those with absorption difficulties, increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections,chronic liver disease and alcoholics. Interactions Vitamin A may potentiate the development of intracranial hypertension when taken in combinationwith tetracycline and minocycline type antibiotics. The catabolism of retinol and retinoic acid in the human liver may be mediated by cytochrome P450. Drugs such as ketoconazole, which inhibit cytochrome P450, can significantly increase the half-life ofretinoic acid.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1112Hypervitaminosis A may decrease vitamin C tissue storage. Vitamin A may antagonise the action of vitamin K in blood clotting function. Hypervitaminosis A may have an anti-thyroid effect. Deficiency in zinc may adversely affect mobilisation of vitamin A from hepatic stores and absorption of vitamin A from the gut. Vitamin A deficiency may result in impaired iron absorption and decrease its utilisation for erythropoiesis.Alcohol may potentiate vitamin A-induced hepatotoxicity. Competitive inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase may lead to decreased synthesis of retinoic acid, resulting in functional vitamin Adeficiency, which has been postulated to be involved in foetal alcohol syndrome. Absorption and bioavailability Approximately 80% of dietary pre-formed vitamin A is absorbed but this may be reduced if diets are lowin fat or individuals are suffering from fat malabsorption syndrome. The form of preparation influencesthe rate and extent of absorption of vitamin A from supplements. Thus, aqueous dispersions andemulsions achieve higher plasma levels, at a faster rate, with lower faecal losses, than oily solutions. Thepharmacokinetic handling of retinol from foods, such as liver, differs to that obtained from supplements. Dietary retinyl ester is released from food by proteolytic digestion and hydrolysed to retinol in the gut. Distribution and metabolism The retinol is taken up into enterocytes, undergoes re-esterification and is incorporated into chylomicra, which are released into the circulation via the lymph. Following the breakdown of chylomicra by serumlipases, the retinyl esters are released, taken up by hepatocytes and re-hydrolysed. The resulting retinolis transferred to the stellate (fat storing) cells and stored in the form of long-chain fatty esters.Approximately 90% of the body's vitamin A is stored in the liver this way. The availability of hepaticstores of vitamin A may be decreased if protein status is low. Plasma retinol is usually maintained under tight homeostatic control and concentrations do not alter significantly unless hepatic stores are severely depleted. If hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, plasmalevels of retinyl ester increase, but plasma levels of retinol itself do not. Mobilised retinol is transported in plasma bound to retinol-binding protein and transthyretin. Uptake into extra-hepatic tissues occurs via a receptor-mediated process. Once inside the cell, retinolundergoes a complex series of metabolic oxidations, isomerisations and conjugations, most of which arereversible. Several enzymes are involved in these reactions, including cytochromes P450. Cellular bindingproteins direct the reactions. Other intracellular binding proteins facilitate transport of specific vitaminA metabolites, such as retinoic acid, into the nucleus of the cell, where they interact with the retinoidnuclear receptors (RARs and RXRs) and participate in the control of gene expression for differentiationand growth. Excretion Oxidised products are excreted in the urine or conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in theurine or bile.Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 1122Toxicity Human data Acute toxicity Symptoms of acute vitamin A toxicity include abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, blurred vision, irritability, headache, and in neonates and infants, bulging of fontanelles. Acute toxicity is associatedwith doses well in excess of 100,000 /H9262g RE and 10,000 /H9262g RE, in adults and children, respectively. Infants of /H110216 months have been shown to develop acute symptoms following a single dose of 7500- 15,000 /H9262g RE, whereas a dose of 30,000 /H9262g RE appears to be well-tolerated in older infants (6 and 9 months of age). Chronic and sub-chronic toxicitySymptoms of chronic toxicity include dry thickening of the skin, cracking of lips, conjunctivitis, erythematous eruption, alopecia, reduced bone mineral density, bone joint pain, chronic headache,intracranial hypertension and hepatotoxicity. The onset and severity of toxic manifestations aredependent on dose, duration and the manifestation in question. Damage to the eyes, bone and livermay be permanent, but most other symptoms are reversible. Chronic toxicity in adults is generallyattributed to supplemental doses of /H110227500-15,000 /H9262g RE/ day, over weeks, months or years. However, there have been cases of toxicity associated with lower doses of /H110111500-3,000 /H9262g RE/ day. Determination of a threshold dose for chronic toxicity may be confounded by pre-existing disease,alcohol abuse, drug therapy and limited knowledge of dietary intake. Extreme vitamin A intolerance mayhave a genetic basis, although the precise metabolic defect has not yet been elucidated. Epidemiological data have shown that the risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women may be doubled when dietary retinol intake is /H110221500 /H9262g RE/ day, compared to an intake of 500 /H9262g RE/ day. Other supporting epidemiological data have shown that hip fracture risk is higher in Northern European countries, particularly Scandinavia, where dietary intake of retinol is higher.Differences in fracture are such that Swedish men have a higher hip fracture rate than English or Swisswomen. Developmental toxicityThere are a number of case reports of vitamin A-associated birth defects. However, only one case involved a vitamin A exposure of /H110217500 /H9262g RE/ day. Since 1990, seven epidemiological studies (five case-control and two prospective) have been reported. Four studies failed to establish an associationbetween vitamin A exposure and birth defects, whereas three studies determined a teratogenic effect atvarying levels. Supplementation trialsIn the (\u00df-Carotene Retinol CARET trial, a combination of 7500 /H9262g retinol/ day and 30,000 /H9262g/ day \u00df-carotene resulted in an increase in lung cancer in male smokers and males who had been exposed to asbestos. However, this and the ABTC study 19indicated strongly that the \u00df-caroteneExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 19See \u00df-carotene risk assessment for details of these studies. 1132Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 component was responsible for this effect. A chemopreventive study in workers exposed to blue asbestos found that 45/512 subjects taking 7500 /H9262g RE/ day elected to change treatment because of associated headaches. A modest increase in skin cancer was apparent in subjects given 7500 /H9262g retinol/ day compared to isotretinoin or controls. In a chemopreventative trial, patients with lung canceror head and neck cancer, were given 90,000 /H9262g RE/ day as retinyl palmitate for one year followed by 45,000 /H9262g RE/ day for a further year. Side effects including dryness, and itching of skin and bleeding and hair loss were reported by 45%. Animal data Acute and chronic toxicity Vitamin A toxicity in animals is dependent upon dose, formulation, duration, species, and age. Lethal doses in rat and mouse are /H110222,500,000 /H9262g/kg bw. Chronic toxicity in adult rats begins at about 3000 /H9262g RE/kg bw/ day. Y ounger animals may be more susceptible. Hypervitaminosis A causes anorexia, weight loss, anaemia, cachexia and ultimately death in rats, hamsters, mice and dogs. Chronicmanifestations include effects on skin (hair loss, localised erythema and thickened epithelium), effectson internal organs (fatty infiltration of the liver and fatty changes in the heart and kidney, testicularchanges, degeneration of myocardial fibres), blood effects (decreased haemoglobin, transient increasesin circulating lipids and serum cholesterol, elevated serum triglycerides), skeletal effects (limping gait,spontaneous fractures, hind leg paralysis, increased osteoclast activity, decreased osteoblast activity,bone elongation without thickening, reduced conjunctiva. Hypervitaminosis A results in the development ofgallstones in the hamster. Developmental toxicity Retinol is teratogenic in laboratory animals, with the following order of increasing susceptibility: rat and mouse, hamster, monkey, and rabbit. The lowest teratogenic doses reported in rat, monkey and rabbitare 35,000, 6000 and 2500 /H9262g RE/kg bw/ day, respectively. Malformations are largely analogous to those associated with synthetic retinoid teratogenicity in humans, such as anencephaly, micronathia, microphthalmia, several defects of the genitalia,pituitary, thyroid, thymus, skull, vertebrae, ribs, and muscles and situs inversus (Hathcock et al ., 1990 and references therein). Permanent learning disabilities have been seen in F344 rats born to dams exposed /H11091 3000 /H9262g RE/kg/ day. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There is no evidence to suggest that retinol or retinyl esters are carcinogenic in laboratory animals and at sub-toxic doses, vitamin A can be highly effective in preventing chemically induced tumours.Epidemiological studies have generally shown a negative association between vitamin A intake andcancer. The weight of evidence suggests that neither retinol nor retinyl ester are genotoxic. 1142Mechanisms of toxicity Retinoic acid plays an important role in the control of expression of many genes, including Hox genes, which are vital for correct positional and sequential development of the embryo. The morphogenicaction of retinoic acid is mediated through the actions of retinoic acid receptor (RAR and RXR) boundmaterial on nuclear retinoic acid response elements. The most sensitive exposure period, in bothhumans and animals, coincides with development and differentiation of the facial neural crest andformation of the branchial apparatus (pharyngeal arches), structures from which most retinoid-associated birth defects are derived. The evidence related to vitamin A in humans remainscircumstantial, but there is a strong suggestion that retinoid teratogenicity may be the outcome of anexaggerated normal response, resulting from abnormal, inappropriate or prolonged transcriptionalactivation of critical genes in target embryonic cells. Although there is some disagreement in the literature, much of the evidence so far indicates that the teratogenic effects of retinol and other naturally occurring retinoid compounds are due to theirconversion to all- trans -retinoic acid. Interspecies differences make comparisons of teratogenic potency and extrapolation for human risk assessment difficult. Dose response characterisation Symptoms of chronic toxicity in humans, such as thickening and dryness of the skin, cracking of lips,conjunctivitis, erythmatous eruption, alopecia, reduced bone mineral density, bone joint pain, chronicheadache, intracranial hypertension and hepatoxicity, are generally associated with supplemental dosesof 7500 /H9262g RE/kg bw/ day. However, decreases in bone density and increases in fracture risk have been reported with chronic exposure to lower doses of 1500 to 2000 /H9262g RE/kg bw/ day. In humans, teratogenic effects have been /H9262g RE/ day to 50-150 /H9262g RE/kg bw/ day). The lowest teratogenic doses reported in rat, monkey and rabbit are 35,000, 6000 and 2500 /H9262g RE/kg/ day, respectively. Vulnerable groups Retinol may represent a teratogenic risk, particularly within the first trimester of pregnancy. Other groups potentially vulnerable to vitamin A toxicity include the young; older people; those sufferingfrom osteoporosis, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus or under-nutrition; haemodialysis patients andindividuals with compromised liver function. An apparent vitamin A intolerance has been observed insome children (Carpenter et al ., 1987). It has been suggested that there may be a genetic component to these cases. However, the basis of this has not been defined. Genetic variations No genetic variations that increase the likelihood of vitamin A toxicity have been identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1152Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Human studies - developmental toxicity Retinoids are recognised animal teratogens, and isotretinoin (13, cis-retinoic acid) is a known human teratogen; therefore, developmental toxicity is critical to the risk assessment of vitamin A. Martinez-Frias and Salvador, 1990 This paper reported the results of a retrospective epidemiological study of prenatal exposure to high doses of vitamin A, using data from a Spanish hospital-based, case control registry (Spanish Collaborativestudy of Congenital Malformations, a surveillance programme which monitored /H1102210 6births). Newborns from 58 hospitals were examined for malformations during the first 3 days of life, and their mothersasked an open-ended question about drug exposures during pregnancy. The mothers were not directlyasked about vitamin use. The investigators studied 12,625 cases and 12,525 controls, becoming 11,293 and11,193, respectively, after eliminations for chromosomal They considered only womenwho had used 3000 /H9262g RE/day or more of retinyl palmitate, either alone or as a multivitamin. No information on dietary intake was pro vided. The number of exposures was very low (16 cases, 14 controls). There was no overall association between vitamin A exposure total supplementary vitamin Aand birth defects (odds ratio (OR) =1.1[95% CI 0.5, 2.5] p=0.4). However, for retinyl palmitate exposurealone, (10, cases, 1 control), the odds ratio was 9.9 [95% CI 1.4, 430.1] p= 0.006). The OR for exposure tovitamin A in multivitamin complexes (6 cases, 13 controls) was not significantly different to 1 (OR= 0.5[95% CI 0.2, 1.3] p=0.08). The OR for exposures of /H1102112,000 /H9262g RE/ day was 0.5 [95% CI 0.1, 1.6] p=0.15 (5 cases, 10 controls) and for exposures to /H9262g RE/ day, OR=2.7 [95% CI, 0.8, 11.7] p=0.06 (11 cases, 4 controls). The authors concluded that their results suggested that a teratogenic effect might exist at high levels of exposure. However, their dose-response data are also c onsistent with no effect. Furthermore, the number of subjects exposed was very small and some exposures may have occurred too late on inpregnancy to be relevant to the birth defects found. Werler et al., 1990 This paper reports a retrospective case control study from the Slone Epidemiology Unit Birth Defects Study, a multi-hospital surveillance programme. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationshipbetween vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy and malformations of structures derived, at leastin part, from the cranial neural crest. Birth defects were identified from hospital records. Women were interviewed within 6 months of delivery and asked whether they had taken any vitamins, iron or folic acid during the 6 months prior toor at any time during pregnancy. No data on vitamin A dose, number of supplements or diet werecollected. Cases were 2,658 infants with primarily craniofacial and cardiac malformations. Controls were2,609 infants with other malformations. Mothers of 6 controls used vitamin A supplements in each ofthe of the first 3 lunar months of pregnancy compared to mothers of 14, 14 and 10 cases in lunar months1, 2 and 3, respectively. Relative risk estimates were 2.5 [95% CI 1.0, 6.2] for lunar month 1, 2.3 [95% CI 0.9,5.8] for lunar month 2 and 1.6 [95% CI 0.6, 4.5] for lunar month 3. No statistically significant associationbetween vitamin A exposure and birth defects was made. However, the numbers of cases and controlsexposed to vitamin A supplements were small. The authors also examined specific common defects 1162and found no statistically significant positive association with vitamin A supplementation (95% CIs included 1). The authors also compared the risk to those taking multi-vitamins with those taking singlevitamin A supplements. The risk was higher but did not achieve statistical significance. Rothman et al., 1995 This paper reports a prospective study from an open prenatal screening programme at Boston University, in which 22,748 pregnant women were identified during prenatal screening. Nurseinterviewers obtained information on diet, medication and illness during the first trimester and onfamily medical history. Information on pregnancy outcomes was obtained from obstetricians or fromthe mothers themselves. Three hundred and thirty-nine babies were born with birth defects and ofthese, 121 were identified as having defects originating in the cranial neural crest. The prevalence ratio ofbabies with defects born to women who had consumed /H110224500 /H9262g RE/ day pre-formed vitamin A from food and supplements compared to those born to mothers who consumed /H110881500 /H9262g RE/ day was 3.5 [95 % CI 1.7, 7.3]. For vitamin A from supplements alone, the prevalence ratio among babies born towomen who consumed /H110913,000 /H9262g RE/ day compared to those born to mothers who consumed /H110881500 /H9262g RE/ day was 4.8 [95% CI 2.2,10.5]. Using a smoothed regression curve, the authors suggested a threshold of near 3000 /H9262g RE/ day of supplemental vitamin A. There has been some criticism of the design of this study and the analysis of the data. This study had no geographical or other population base and no denominator population, which may have introduced bias to the results. Furthermore, physicians identified malformations in only 76.5% of cases. In the remainingcases, the mother supplied information relating to incidence of malformation, so that there isuncertainty that all malformations were correctly classified. Khoury et al., 1996 This is a communication (letter), in response to the publication of the Rothman study, from investigators reporting re-examination of data from a large population-based case-control study of major birthdefects, conducted by the Centres for Disease Control. Using the same classification of defect as in theRothman et al . study, the authors found no overall increased risk of birth defects and no increased risk of cranial neural crest defects among users of vitamin A and/ or multi-vitamin supplements (OR = 0.6[95% CI 0.28, 1.29] and 0.69 [95% CI 0.24, 1.91], respectively). However, no data were collected on vitaminA dosage although the authors noted that most multi-vitamins and supplements during the studyperiod were expected to contain /H110212400 /H9262g RE pre-formed vitamin A (which is less than the 3000 /H9262g RE/ day suggested as a threshold by the Rothman study). Shaw et al., 1996 This is a communication (letter) also in response to the publication of the Rothman study. The authors re-examined geographical population-based surveillance data from previously published studies of oralcleft and conotruncal defects of the heart (both structures associated with the cranial neural crest). Theauthors assumed that most preparations contained pre-formed vitamin A rather than \u00df-carotene, thatsingle supplements would have contained at least 3000 /H9262g RE and that combination exposures of single and multi-vitamin supplements would exceed 3000 /H9262g RE. There was no increased risk of either birth defect associated with the use of vitamin A supplements (OR = 0.55 [95% CI 0.21, 1.5] and OR = 0.0 [95%CI 0.0, 2.2], oral cleft and conotruncal heart defect studies, respectively). These data were limited inthat interviews with the mothers were conducted an average of 3.5 years after delivery and lackedspecific information regarding vitamin A dosage.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1172Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 Mills et al., 1997 This paper describes a geographically based case-control study (encompassing all pregnancies in California and Illinois between 1985-87) to examine whether moderate doses of vitamin A are associatedwith teratogenicity. The study group included women whose pregnancies resulted in offspring withneural tube defects (n=548), offspring with major malformations other than neural tube defects (n=387)and normal controls (n=573). Study participants gave telephone interviews to trained interviewersbetween 1 and 5 months after the detection of the congenital anomaly, in order to estimatepericonceptional vitamin A exposures from supplements, fortified cereals, meat and offal consumption.The proportion of women consuming 2400-7500 /H9262g RE was no greater in either of the malformation groups than in the control group. Women exposed to /H110222400 /H9262g RE/ day and /H110223000 /H9262g RE/ for major /H9262g RE/ day (the result for neural tube defects was similar). Consequently, no association was made between periconceptual exposure to vitamin A atdoses /H110223000 /H9262g RE/ day. However, unlike the study by Rothman et al ., dietary recall was many months after the critical period of pregnancy. Mastroiacovo et al., 1999 This paper describes a multi-centre prospective controlled study to evaluate whether foetuses exposed during organogenesis to high doses of vitamin A have a higher risk of major malformations than thegeneral population. Thirteen European Teratology Information Services (all part of ENTIS - EuropeanNetwork Teratology Service) counselled women during pregnancy. Data were collected on 423pregnancies exposed to a maternal daily dose of at least 3000 /H9262g supplemental RE during the first nine completed weeks of gestation. 394 women were followed up by telephone interview until the first fewweeks after expected delivery date using standardised procedures. Information about malformationswas obtained from mothers or doctors. No information on dietary intake was obtained. The occurrenceof major structural malformations, excluding chromosomal and genetic diseases, was evaluated in 311infants exposed to a median daily dose of 15,000 (range 3000-90,000) /H9262g RE/ day. Only three infants with major malformations were reported and no congenital malformations were reported among 120infants exposed to /H1102215,000 /H9262g RE/ day. The birth prevalence ratios of major malformations compared to two internal control groups (i) exposed to high levels of vitamin A later on in pregnancy and (ii) non-teratogenic agent exposures were 0.28 [95% CI 0.06-1.23] and 0.50 [95% CI 0.14, 1.76], respectively.Consequently, this study provided no evidence that there was an increased risk of major malformationsassociated with exposure to high doses of vitamin A during organogenesis. However, the sample size inthis study was not large enough to enable the detection of differences in risk of less than 2.76. Human studies - general toxicity Wald et al., 1985 In a randomised double-blind study, 376 people were studied and allocated to 1 of 7 dose regimens: 0, 3000, 4054, 6757, 8108, 9460 or 10,810 /H9262g RE/ day, for 6 months. The study was designed to investigate the effect of supplementation on serum retinol levels. The only adverse effects noted related to skinand mucous membranes with 6% of the subjects receiving 4054 /H9262g RE or more reporting skin dryness and itching at their second clinic visit compared to 3% of subjects receiving 0 or 3000 /H9262g RE/ day. 1182Hathcock et al., 1990 This paper is a review of vitamin A-related chronic and sub-chronic toxicity data in humans. Clinical case studies reviewed supported the view that exposure to doses /H1109130,000 /H9262g RE/ day for short periods (days/few weeks) or exposure to 7500 - 15,000 /H9262g RE/ day for several months or more can produce multiple adverse effects. Most evidence for toxicity at the lower end of this range was from reports ofindividuals who had concomitant hepatic damage from other contributing factors. Furthermore,information on dietary intake was not always available. The authors concluded that the data availablewere not sufficient to provide a specific minimum threshold for adverse effects but that 7500 /H9262g RE/ day was nutritionally excessive and carried some risk of toxicity. Similarly, data did not permit identification ofa safe upper limit for the intake range. It was noted that an intake of 3000 /H9262g RE/ day was more than adequate for good nutrition but was low enough to avoid toxicity in most people. However the effectsof vitamin A between 3000 /H9262g RE/ day and 7500 /H9262g RE/ day could not be predicted. Human studies - bone toxicity20 Freudenheim et al., 1986 In a 4 year clinical trial, the effect of usual intakes of energy and 14 nutrients on single-photon absorptiometric measurement of mineral content in arm bones was assessed in 99 women aged 35-60given either a calcium supplement or placebo. In the post-menopausal women of the treatment group,there was an inverse correlation between vitamin A intake and the rate of change in ulna bone mineralcontent. In a single patient receiving a high supplemental dose (average intake 4392 /H9262g RE/ day) bone loss was very rapid with no other reason apparent. Sowers and Wallace, 1990Vitamin A intake, serum retinol concentrations, radial bone mass and fracture history were evaluated in 246 postmenopausal women. More than 36% of the population used a vitamin A supplement, with 8%using a supplement containing /H110222000 /H9262g RE/ day. No relationship was observed between radial bone mass and fracture history and vitamin A intake or serum retinol. No statistically significant relationshipwas observed between serum retinol and bone mass after adjustment for factors associated with bonemass such as age, when the population was stratified by supplement use. When serum retinol valueswere divided into tertiles, no relationship was observed with bone mass when the comparison includedadjustment for age, muscle area and use of thiazide anti-hypertensives. However, it has been noted(Binkley and Krueger, 2000) that this study had inadequate power to test an association between bonemass and vitamin A intakes /H110222000 /H9262g RE/ day (only 8% of the study population had intakes exceeding this level); 36% of the population were aged /H1102160 years of age and were therefore likely to be heterogenous with regards to oestrogen depletion bone loss; and the site where bone mass wasmeasured, i.e. central radius, is considered less responsive to change.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 20A cohort study of serum retinol levels and fracture risk in 266 men followed up over 30 years was recently published by K. Mich a\u00eblsson et al . (N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 287-294). This study was published after the cut off date of 31 December 2002 for data to be considered by the EVM and it has therefore not been used for risk assessment. This prospective cohort study showed a statistically significant association betwe en serum retinol levels and risk of fracture. The relative risk for all fractures in men in the highest quintile of serum retinol compared to middle quintile was 1 (95% CI, 1.12-2.41). 1192Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 Houtkooper et al., 1995 The relationships between total energy intake, nutrient intake, body composition and exercise group status with rates of change in bone mineral density were measured in 66 pre-menopausal women takingcalcium supplements. Nutrients were not significant variables in regression models predicting bonemineral density slopes at any femur site, but retinol intake was associated with decreased bone mineraldensity. Melhus et al., 1998 This paper reported two studies, a randomly selected cross-sectional study, involving 175 females (28-74 years) and a nested case-control study, involving 247 women (40-60 years), who had first hipfracture 2-64 months after enrolment, and 873 age-matched controls (selected from a mammographystudy cohort). Retinol intake was estimated from dietary records and a food-frequency questionnaire.There was no reported use of vitamin A supplements. In multivariate analysis, intake of pre-formed retinol was negatively associated with bone mineral density. For intake greater than 1,500 /H9262g RE/ day, compared with less than 500 /H9262g/ day, bone mineral density was reduced by 10% at the femoral neck (p=0.05), 14% at the lumber spine (p=0.001) and 6% forthe total body (p=0.009). The risk for hip fracture was apparently doubled (odds ratio 2.1 [95% CI 1.1-4.0]). For every 1000 (g increase in daily intake, risk of hip fracture increased by 68% [95% CI 18-140%,p=0.006]. Smoking was found to be a confounding factor. The authors suggested that their study was limited by the possibility of information bias resulting from questioning case-patients after hip fracture had occurred, as was done for some covariates such asphysical activity. In addition, data on thyroid hormone therapy and family history of osteoporosis werenot available. Furthermore, the authors could not rule out confounding influences of an unidentifieddietary factor but suggested that the possibility of a high degree of random error in the assessment ofretinol intake might lead to an underestimation of the true risk of hip-fracture associated with high levels. The rationale for this study was based on the findings of the MEDOS study group (Johnell et al ., 1992) that hip fracture rates varied across Europe, being 11 and 7 fold higher for women and men respectivelyin Northern Europe than in Southern Europe, particularly in Sweden and Norway. The difference inEuropean rates was sufficiently marked that fracture rates were higher in Swedish men than in Swiss orEnglish women. The authors further noted that the difference in incidence was higher betweencountries than between sexes suggesting that an important genetic or environmental factor wasinvolved. Known risk factors were not thought to explain the finding. Melton (1995) also reported thathip fracture rates were higher in Scandinavia than in comparable populations in North America. Whendietary patterns in Europe were compared in different European towns, retinol intakes were found to be6 fold higher in Scandinavia, compared to Southern Europe (Cruz et al ., 1991). Ballew et al., 2001 The association between fasting serum levels of retinyl esters and bone mineral density (BMD) was studied in 5790 non-pregnant participants aged 20 years or older. Data were also collected on age, bodymass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, use of dietary supplements, diabetes, physical activity and,in women, use of oral contraceptives or oestrogen replacement therapy, menopausal status and parity.These covariates were controlled for using multiple linear regression. The study showed no significantassociation between fasting serum retinyl esters and BMD, as assessed at the femoral neck, trochanter,intertrochanter and total hip. 1202Feskanich et al., 2002 As part of the Nurses' Health Study, the relationship between high vitamin A intake from food and supplements and hip fracture was assessed. The study included 72,337 post-menopausal women aged34-77 and the period 1980 to 1998 was considered in the analysis. During this period, 603 hip fracturesoccurred resulting from low or moderate trauma. After controlling for confounding factors, women inthe highest quintile of vitamin A intake ( /H110913000 /H9262g RE/ day) had a significantly elevated relative risk (RR) for hip fractures (RR, 1.48; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.07; P for trend 0.03) compared to women in the lowestquintile of intake ( /H110211250 /H9262g RE/ day). The increased risk was primarily attributable to retinol (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.33-2.68). The association of retinol with hip fracture was reduced in women takingpostmenopausal oestrogens. \u00df-Carotene did not contribute to fracture risk. Women currently taking aspecific vitamin A supplement had a non-significant 40% increased risk of hip fracture (RR, 1.4; 95%CI 0.99-1.99) compared to those not taking the supplement. Among women not taking supplements,retinol from food was significantly associated with fracture risk (RR, 1.69, 95% CI 1.05-2.74). Overall the authors concluded that long-term intake of diet high in retinol may promote the development of osteoporotic hip fractures in women and that the amount of retinol in supplementsand fortified foods may need to be reassessed. The authors noted that the study cohort was largelycomprised of white women and that the findings were not necessarily applicable to other ethnicgroups. Promislow et al., 2002 The association between BMD and bone loss, and total and supplemental retinol intake was investigated in 570 women and 388 men, aged 55 to 92 at completion of the study. Dietary intake ofvitamin A was assessed by dietary questionnaire over a four year period. This ended four years beforethe start of a 4-year period in which annual measurements of BMD and bone loss were made. Retinolintake was associated with decreased BMD and increased bone loss at total intakes above 840 /H9262g/ day, even after adjustment for age, body mass index, weight change, calcium intake, years menopausal(women), use of steroids, cigarettes, alcohol, thiazides, thyroid hormones and supplemental retinol.Supplemental retinol use was also associated with decreased BMD and increased bone loss. Animal data Developmental toxicity Vitamin A has been shown to be teratogenic in animals. The data are summarised below: Hendrickx et al., 1997a,b; Wiegand et al., 1998 and Miller et al., 1998 Hendrickx et al . (1997 a,b), Wiegand et al . (1998) and Miller et al . (1998), reported a teratogenicity study in which dose-related increased rates of abortions and malformations were observed in Cynomolgusmonkeys administered oral doses, during early pregnancy (gestation days 16-27), of 0, 2250, of 6000 and 24,000 /H9262g RE/kg bw/ day, respectively (intermediate dose not reported). The higher dose affected structures derived from the cranial neural crest. These malformations were similar to thoseobserved with isotretinoin (13- cis-retinoic acid) in both monkeys and humans. The spectrum of defects differed slightly to that observed in isotretinoin syndrome in that there was a higher frequency ofabnormality of craniofacial structures, thymus and heart defects were less severe and there were nobrain malformations. Maternal toxicity was observed (nature not specified).Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1212Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 Bone toxicity Leelaprute et al., 1973Gross bone lesions characterised by resorption of parts of the pelvis, fibulae, and scapulae with bone thinning were observed in growing female rats (initial average weight 147g) treated with 7500-22,500 /H9262g RE/ day retinol as palmitate or retinol (vitamin A alcohol) for 17 days. Soft tissue calcification alsooccurred. The animals were given the doses either orally or by intraperitoneal injection. Intraperitonealadministration was associated with greater retinol toxicity, though not with vitamin A palmitate. Frankel et al., 1986A single oral dose of 82,000 /H9262g RE/kg bw given to adult rats, had no effect on biologically active parathyroid hormone (bioactive PTH) concentrations. Secretions of bioactive PTH were not altered byincubation of rat thyroparathyroid complexes with retinol in vitro . In 3-week-old rats given 15,000 /H9262g RE, 3 times a week for 6 weeks, osteoclast numbers were higher and osteoid lower than in the controls.Serum bioactive PTH was not detectable and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly lower thanin controls. At 7500 /H9262g RE, 3 times a week for 3 weeks, serum bioactive PTH was suppressed to undetectable levels but there was no effect on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were lower in vitamin D intoxicated rats which were also given 7500 /H9262g RE, 3 times a week. The authors considered that the skeletal changes caused by high levels of vitamin A were independent of the effects on PTH but could be caused by the changes in vitamin D metabolites. However, thesepathological changes could be modified by secondary changes in calcium metabolism and in themetabolism of calcium-regulating hormones. Hough et al., 1988 Y oung rats (initial weight 100g) were treated with 3000 or 7500 /H9262g RE/ day retinyl palmitate for 21 days by stomach tube. Tibial histomorphometry revealed increased bone resorption (increased osteoclastsize and number) and reduced bone formation. There was also a paucity of trabecular surfaces coveredwith osteoid. Spontaneous limb fractures and increased skeletal turnover (as measured by serumalkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline excretion) were also observed in the high dose group.Serum calcium and magnesium levels were unremarkable but serum phosphorus levels weresignificantly elevated in the control animals. Circulating levels of the potent bone resorbers, PTH,1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were comparable in the treated animals and thecontrols suggesting that vitamin A was having a direct effect on bone. 1222Exposure assessment Total RE/ day (Annex 4) Estimated maximum intake: 6050 + 2400 = 8450 /H9262g RE/ day High intake groups include people who consume liver and liver products regularly. Risk assessment Acute vitamin A toxicity in humans is rare, but is more likely to occur following ingestion of high dose supplements, rather than following high intakes of vitamin A from food. Vitamin A accumulates in the bodyand, therefore, individuals who have regular high daily intakes of vitamin A might suffer adverse effectsfrom chronic hypervitaminosis A. Although most manifestations of chronic vitamin A toxicity are reversibleon cessation of dose, permanent damage to liver, bone and vision, and chronic muscular and skeletal painmay occur in some cases. Epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to high levels of vitamin A during pregnancy might increase the risk of birth defects. The available data do not allow identification of a threshold dose,although one study has suggested that effects may occur at modest intakes. Vitamin A has also beenshown to be teratogenic in animals. Recent epidemiological data have indicated that post-menopausal women with long-term high intakes of vitamin A have an increased risk of hip-bone fracture. Other supporting epidemiological data haveindicated that this effect may occur in men as well as women. These findings are supported by animaldata, which have indicated that retinol has a direct effect on bone, possibly via an interaction withvitamin D, and an effect on parathyroid hormone and therefore calcium metabolism. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL It is not possible to establish a Safe Upper Level for vitamin A. There are two threads of evidenceregarding potential adverse effects of vitamin A, one on teratogenicity and one on the risk of bonefracture, which suggest different levels of intake at which adverse effects may occur. Both of theseranges appear to overlap with dietary intakes of vitamin A.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 21The median intake, rather than the mean, is provided because the mean appears artificially high. It is skewed by the individual s who have a very high vitamin A intake from liver and its products. 1232Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 A number of epidemiological studies have suggested that high doses of vitamin A may be teratogenic, i.e. that they could cause malformations in the unborn child. The precise threshold for this effect isuncertain. The study by Rothman et al . reports that supplemental doses of /H110223000 /H9262g RE/ day, in addition to the diet, may be teratogenic; this is the lowest dose level associated with such an effect. Itwas also noted that a small excess of cranial defects was found in the offspring of women consuming5000 /H9262g RE/ day from food and supplements, compared to those taking 1660 /H9262g RE/ day. Other studies indicate that the threshold may be higher. However, given the severity of the effect, it is prudent to take 3000 /H9262g RE/ day as the threshold for teratogenicity. The Group note and endorse the current advice that women who are pregnant or who wish to become pregnant should not take dietary supplementscontaining vitamin A except on medical advice. In studies of long-term dietary intake, vitamin A has been associated with decreased bone density and increased risk of hip fracture. This finding is supported by investigations in laboratory animals in whichvitamin A has been reported to affect calcium metabolism as well as to have a direct effect on bone.Other supportive epidemiological data suggest that the effect may also occur in men since fracture riskis increased in both males and females in Scandinavian countries, where retinol intake is also higher thanin Southern Europe. The risk of hip fracture is a continuous graded response associated with exposure levels that include average dietary intakes. It is not possible to identify an intake that is without some degree of risk.However, the available data indicate that total intakes greater than 1500 /H9262g RE/ day may be inappropriate. This corresponds to 25 /H9262g RE/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult. Data on retinol intakes from food and supplements suggest that high level consumers of liver and liver products and/ or supplements may exceed intakes at which adverse effects have been reported in theliterature. It should also be noted that dietary supplements may contain 20-100% more vitamin A than isstated on the label, due to the practice of using 'overages' within the food supplements industry toensure that the product contains no less than the stated content of the vitamin throughout its shelf life.This may be particularly important given that the effect on fracture risk appears to be a gradedresponse, with the risk of fracture increasing with increased intake.

The compound can exist indifferent geometrical forms (as cis-or trans- isomers); the majority of naturally-occurring \u00df-carotene, as well as virtually all of the compound prepared by chemical synthesis, is the all- trans isomer. Natural occurrence \u00df-Carotene is synthesised in plants and microorganisms, but not in higher organisms. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines The main food sources of \u00df-carotene are yellow and green (leafy) vegetables and yellow fruits. Commercially-available \u00df-carotene is either synthetic or derived from palm oil, algae or fungi, and iswidely used as a yellow colouring agent (EC160a) in foods and drinks. \u00df-carotene is widely used invitamin and mineral supplements at levels ranging from 0.4 mg to 20 mg per day, and is givenmedicinally in doses of up to 6 mg/ day for dietary deficiency of vitamin A and up to 300 mg/ day in thereduction of photosensitivity in individuals with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Recommended amounts \u00df-Carotene per se is not an essential nutrient and there are currently no dietary reference values specifically for \u00df-carotene in the UK or USA. However, as \u00df-carotene is a precursor for vitamin A,dietary intakes are traditionally expressed as part of the RNI for vitamin A as retinol equivalents (RE). Foradults the RNI for vitamin A is 600 and 700 /H9262g RE/ day (0.6 and 0.7 mg) for females and males respectively (COMA, 1991). 6 /H9262g \u00df-carotene = 1 /H9262g RE. Analysis of tissue levels and \u00df-carotene status \u00df-Carotene status is assessed by measurement of plasma concentration. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Observational studies in humans have shown that high intake of \u00df-carotene-containing foods in the diet, as well as higher serum \u00df-carotene levels, are associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, such ascoronary heart disease and cancer. It has been postulated that this association may be due to theantioxidant properties of the molecule. However, it is unknown whether \u00df-carotene intake is acting as amarker for other components of fruits and vegetables or another lifestyle factor, rather than having aneffect in its own right.Risk Assessment \u00df-Carotene 2Function \u00df-Carotene is a precursor of vitamin A, and (as recently suggested) of other retinoid-like compounds. Its importance in any individual depends upon the level of pre-formed vitamin A in the diet. Deficiency \u00df-Carotene is not classed as an essential vitamin, but it is a provitamin of vitamin A. Thereforedeficiency as a clinical condition per se , is not clearly established. Interactions Interactions between \u00df-carotene and other carotenoids (such as lycopene, lutein and canthaxanthin) occur during absorption and/ or metabolism. Absorption and bioavailability Dietary fat and bile salts facilitate absorption in the upper small intestine, which occurs via incorporationinto multilamellar lipid micelles. It has been estimated that, in humans, 10 to 90% of the total \u00df-caroteneconsumed in the diet is absorbed, and that absorption decreases as intake increases. Availability fromfood products is lower than that of a water-dispersed formulation, due to the need for disruption (bypepsin and proteolytic enzymes and by cooking), of the matrix of fibre, polysaccharide and protein.Bioavailability is reduced in very low fat diets. Distribution and metabolism A proportion of absorbed \u00df-carotene is converted to retinol within intestinal mucosal cells. Unaltered\u00df-carotene is transported via the lymph to the plasma where it is associated with lipoproteins. Tissueuptake and distribution are not well characterised. In the case of regular high intake, long-termaccumulation occurs preferentially in adipose tissues. Serum levels of \u00df-carotene have been reported to be low in smokers, in individuals with a high alcohol intake, and in those with HIV infection. Low \u00df-carotene status may be associated with conditions ofimpaired lipid absorption such as jaundice, liver cirrhosis and cystic fibrosis. \u00df-Carotene is mainly converted to retinol (vitamin A) in the cytosol of intestinal mucosal cells. Experiments in rats have shown that the process is regulated by the levels of \u00df-carotene and of pre-formed vitamin A. In vitro studies have shown that other \u00df-carotene derivatives may also occur, but their biological activity, and whether they are synthesised in vivo , is unknown. Carotenoid absorption and metabolism vary considerably between animal species. No single species provides a good model for studying all aspects of the biokinetics and metabolism of \u00df-carotene inhumans. The rat is particularly unsuitable, due to the high efficiency of conversion to vitamin A, suchthat significant levels of unaltered \u00df-carotene are absorbed only when very high doses are given, forprolonged periods of time. The pre-ruminant calf, the ferret and the Mongolian gerbil are suggested tobe more useful models, although it is apparent that there are many differences between carotenoidabsorption, distribution and metabolism in these animals and humans.Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 1282Excretion Absorbed \u00df-carotene is secreted into the bile and excreted in the faeces. It is also excreted in the sweat. Toxicity Human data Until recently, \u00df-carotene was considered to show no toxicity in humans. Hypercarotenaemia (high plasma \u00df-carotene) has not been associated with adverse effects other than reversible yellowing of theskin (hypercarotenodermia). Long-term, oral \u00df-carotene therapy, in doses up to 300 mg/ day has shownno toxic effects in individuals with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Vitamin A toxicity does notoccur, as the metabolic conversion is regulated by vitamin A status. There have been no reports ofreproductive toxicity or teratogenicity associated with high \u00df-carotene intake, either before or duringpregnancy. Two recent, large-scale supplementation trials testing the hypothesis that \u00df-carotenesupplementation in smokers would reduce the incidence of cancer, have shown an association of high-dose \u00df-carotene supplementation (20 - 30 mg/ day) with increased incidence of lung cancer in smokersand asbestos-exposed individuals. No statistically significant differences in other cancer types wereobserved in these studies. These are described in more detail below. Supplementation studies Two large-scale studies (Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Prevention Study (ATBC) and \u00df-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET)) have shown an association of \u00df-carotenesupplementation (20 mg/ day, alone or in combination with /H9251-tocopherol; 30 mg/ day in combination with retinyl palmitate respectively) with increased incidence of lung cancer in smokers and individualswith previous high-level exposure to asbestos. However, another large-scale study involving \u00df-carotenesupplementation in a well-nourished population, the US Physicians' Health Study, showed no beneficialor adverse effects of \u00df-carotene supplementation (50 mg every other day), in a trial population whichcomprised 11 % current smokers. Additionally, the Heart Protection Study, a large scale study ofsupplementation with 20 mg \u00df-carotene, 60 mg vitamin E and 250 mg vitamin C daily for up to 5 years,showed no difference in cancer incidence compared to placebo controls. The designs of these studiesare given below:Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 12922Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 130Table.

Animal data No adverse effects of high-dose \u00df-carotene supplementation have been observed in standardtoxicological studies in experimental animals. These include tests for acute toxicity (doses up to 5000mg/kg bw/ day in rats), chronic toxicity/ carcinogenicity (doses up to 1000 mg/kg bw/ day for life in ratsand mice; up to 250 mg/kg bw/ day for 2 years in beagle dogs) and teratogenicity and reproductivetoxicity (doses up to 1000 mg/kg bw/ day for 3 generations, or during days 7 to 16 of gestation, in rats;up to 400 mg/kg bw/ day during days 7 to 19 of gestation in rabbits).Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity \u00df-Carotene shows no genotoxicity in vitro or at high doses in vivo and was not carcinogenic in experimental rodent studies. However, \u00df-carotene supplementation (2.4 mg/kg bw/ day, with or withoutexposure of the animals to cigarette smoke) was associated with the development of squamous cellmetaplasia in the lungs of ferrets (Wang et al ., 1999). Vulnerable groups Groups vulnerable to \u00df-carotene toxicity include current smokers, individuals with previous high-level exposure to asbestos, those with high alcohol intakes, and/ or a history of myocardial infarction. Genetic variations No genetic variations that increase sensitivity to \u00df-carotene toxicity have been identified. Mechanism of toxicity A number of hypotheses have been suggested to account for the association between \u00df-carotene supplementation and lung tumourigenesis in smokers, including an imbalance of othercarotenoids or antioxidant species, a pro-oxidant activity of \u00df-carotene at high oxygen tensions (in thelungs), induction of P450 enzymes and the production of damaging \u00df-carotene oxidation products bycomponents of cigarette smoke. However, the mechanism for the observed association remains to beestablished. Dose-response characterisation 20 mg/ day \u00df-carotene was associated with increased incidence of lung cancer in human smokers andindividuals with previous high-level exposure to asbestos. Similar studies with lower doses have notbeen carried out. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Trial (The Alpha-Tocopherol and 1994; Albanes et al., 1996, Rapola 1997) This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial to assess the of daily supplementation with /H9251-tocopherol and/ or \u00df-carotene in the prevention of lung cancer. Finnish, male smokers (n = 29,133) were given a daily supplement of 50 mg /H9251-tocopherol, 20 mg \u00df-carotene, 50 mg /H9251-tocopherol + 20 mg \u00df-carotene or placebo for a period of 5-8 years. StatisticalExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1312Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 analysis for a median follow-up period of 6.1 years showed no statistically significant change in the primary assessed endpoint, lung cancer incidence, in the /H9251-tocopherol-only treatment group, but a significant 18% increase was noted in men who received \u00df-carotene supplementation compared withthose who did not. There was no evidence of an interaction between /H9251-tocopherol and \u00df-carotene in their effects on lung cancer. No significant changes were seen in the incidences of cancers other thanlung cancer, but there was a significant increase in the risk of fatal coronary heart disease in individualswith a previous myocardial infarction in the \u00df-carotene-treated groups. The and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) was of \u00df- carotene and retinol supplementation in individuals considered to be at high risk of developing lungcancer (14,254 male and female heavy smokers and 4060 males with previous high-level occupationalasbestos exposure). The aim of the investigation was to assess the effects of daily supplementation witha combination of 30 mg \u00df-carotene + 25 000 IU retinol (as retinyl palmitate), compared with a placebo,upon the primary measured endpoint - the incidence of lung cancer. The trial was terminatedapproximately 2 years prematurely (after a mean intervention time of 4 years) when a trend towardsincreased incidence of cancer in participants receiving supplementation with \u00df-carotene becameevident. At this time, statistical analysis showed a significant 28 % increase in the relative risk of lungcancer in the supplementation group compared with the placebo group. No statistically significantdifferences in other cancer types were observed. The US Physicians' Health Study (US-PHS) (Hennekens et al., 1996). This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial involving 22,071 male physicians (of whom 11% were current smokers) to assess the effects of aspirin and/ or \u00df-carotene supplementation on the incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Supplementation,on alternate days, of either 325 mg aspirin, 50 mg \u00df-carotene, 325 mg aspirin + 50 mg \u00df-carotene, orplacebo, was given for 6 years, at which time aspirin supplementation was discontinued whilst therandomised \u00df-carotene component of the trial continued for another 6 years. After an average 12 yearsof follow-up, statistical analysis showed no significant effect of \u00df-carotene supplementation on overallcancer incidence, the incidences of specific cancer types (including lung cancer), myocardial infarction,stroke, death due to cardiovascular pathology, all important cardiovascular events, or death from allcauses. It has been suggested that, as current smokers comprised only 11% of the total study populationthe PHS trial had limited capacity to detect adverse effects in this subgroup (in contrast with ATBCwhere 100% of the study population were smokers, and CARET, which included only current orrecently-quit heavy smokers and individuals with previous high-level asbestos exposure). Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002 20,536 adults with coronary artery disease, other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes were allocated to receive either 20 mg \u00df-carotene/ day, together with 600 mg/ day vitamin E and 250 mg/ day vitamin C,or placebo for up to 5 years in this randomised, placebo controlled trial. Small but statisticallysignificant increases in total plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were observed inpatients on the active treatment compared to controls. However, no significant differences in theincidences of all-caused mortality, or in deaths due to vascular or non-vascular events, were observed.Nor were there any significant differences in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarctions orcoronary death, non-fatal or fatal strokes, coronary or non-coronary revascularisation, or in theincidence of cancer or of hospitalisation for non-cancer causes. 1322Toxicity in animals The vast majority of standard toxicological studies in experimental animals have shown no adverse effects of high dose \u00df-carotene supplementation. One study (Wang et al ., 1999) has described an association of \u00df-carotene supplementation with the development of squamous metaplasia in the lungsof ferrets:- Wang et al., 1999 This study used a ferret model to assess the effects of cigarette smoke and \u00df-carotene supplementation, alone and in combination, on lung histopathology/biochemistry. Four groups of 6males were treated with dietary \u00df-carotene supplementation (2.4 mg/kg bw/ day), cigarette smokeexposure, both, or neither, for a period of 6 months. Histopathological analysis revealed that all \u00df-carotene treated animals showed an increase in cell proliferation and squamous metaplasia in lungtissue, and this was further enhanced in the animals that were also exposed to cigarette smoke. Animalsexposed to cigarette smoke alone, did not show these changes. The histopathological endpoint,squamous metaplasia, may not, however, be directly related to carcinogenesis (Lotan, 1999).Furthermore, these findings are not consistent with the results of human studies, in which \u00df-carotenesupplementation showed no effect on sputum atypia or metaplasia in smokers or asbestos workers(McLarty et al ., 1995; van Poppel et al ., 1997). Exposure assessment exposure/intake Food22Mean: 2.3 mg/ adults 97.5th percentile: day (NDNS, 1986/7) Supplements up to 20 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum daily intake: 7.0 + 20 = 27 mgNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment \u00df-carotene is of low toxicity in both animals and man, and prior to the publication of a number of intervention studies was thought to be without adverse effect, other than a yellowing of the skin, whichoccurred after sustained high intake. However, supplementation of smokers and subjects previouslyexposed to asbestos has been associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. The mechanism for thiseffect is unknown but it seems likely that \u00df-carotene has a tumour promoting effect of some type.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 22Note: intake data quoted for food are for total carotene content 1332Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL Key study: The Alpha Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group (1994). Effects observed at: 20 mg/person/ day supplemental \u00df-carotene.Uncertainty Factor: 3 (for LOAEL NOAEL extrapolation).Safe Upper Level for 20/3 = 7 mg/ day supplemental \u00df-carotene (equivalent to daily consumption over 0.11 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult)a lifetime: Epidemiological studies have shown an association between supplementation with \u00df-carotene and an increase in lung cancers in smokers and in individuals who have been heavily exposed to asbestos. TheSafe Upper Level applies only to the general population, i.e.non-smokers and those not exposed to asbestos. There is no evidence that \u00df-carotene supplementation has any effect on non-smokers. However, until the mechanism for the promotion of lung tumours is established it remains uncertain whether other co-exposures could have the same effect as observed in smokers. As a matter of prudence, therefore, theEVM has set a Safe Upper Level for supplementation, based on the ATBC study. This study was chosenfor use in deriving a Safe Upper Level, as of the four large-scale studies investigating the effects of \u00df-carotene supplementation on smokers and/ or those exposed to high levels of asbestos, this study hasshown effects at the lowest level of supplemental intake. The LOAEL from this study was 20 mg/ day.Applying an uncertainty factor of 3, to extrapolate from a LOAEL to a NOAEL, results in a Safe UpperLevel for supplementation of 7 mg/ day. This is equivalent to 0.11 mg/kg bw day for a 60 kg adult. ThisSafe Upper Level applies to supplements only, as there is no evidence to suggest that current levels of\u00df-carotene intake from food results in adverse effects. The dose at which supplemental \u00df-carotene promotes carcinogenesis in smokers and workers exposed to asbestos is unknown. However, there is no evidence that dietary \u00df-carotene is associated. The EVMrecommends that, as a matter of prudence, smokers or those exposed to asbestos should not take \u00df-carotene supplements. References Albanes, D., Heinonen, O.P., Huttunen, J.K.

Two nutritionally significant compounds are vitamin D2(ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3(cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3is metabolised to the active steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3by successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney. Vitamin D2is metabolised to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 by the same enzyme systems. One milligram of vitamin D is equivalent to 40,000 international units. Natural occurrence Vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) is produced photochemically from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin by exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light. Vitamin D2 is formed similarly from ergosterol in plants, fungi and lower life forms. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Vitamin D is found in only a few foodstuffs, with fatty fish and fish oils, liver, milk and eggs being themain natural sources. In most industrialised countries, including the UK, processed milk, some powderedmilks, margarine, breakfast cereals, bread and chocolate bars are fortified with vitamin D. Human milkcontains low levels of vitamin D, but infant formula is fortified with 0.001-0.0025 mg/100 kcal. Vitamin D is present in a range of food supplements (including fish oil products) and licensed medicines. Both vitamin D 2and vitamin D3are used in food supplements, at levels up to 0.0125 mg per daily dose, and for food fortification. Other sources of exposure No data have been identified. Recommended amounts The establishment of recommended intakes of vitamin D is difficult because it is produced endogenouslyas a result of exposure to sunlight, which cannot readily be quantified. COMA has not set a RNI value forthose individuals leading a normal lifestyle. For individuals confined indoors, pregnant and lactatingwomen, an intake of 0.01 mg/ day was recommended by COMA. RNIs of 0.0085 and 0.007 mg/ day wererecommended for infants aged 0-6 months and 6 months to 3 years respectively (COMA, 1998).Risk Assessment Vitamin D 2Analysis of tissue levels and vitamin D status The conventional marker of vitamin D status is plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This marker is employed because it reflects the main storage form of precursor substrate for vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,the formation of which is under homeostatic control. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Vitamin D analogues have been reported to induce cell differentiation and reduce proliferation, andbased on in vitro and epidemiological studies it has been suggested that vitamin D could protect against both prostate and colon cancer. This hypothesis was not commented on by COMA in its review of dietand cancer. It has been proposed that the anti-proliferative effect of vitamin D may be of benefit in thetreatment of psoriasis (and treatment with the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol is of established benefit).There are also some claims that vitamin D may inhibit or stop the development of a number ofautoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and that it or its analogues may suppress transplant rejection. Function Vitamin D is metabolised to the steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, a process which is promotedby parathyroid hormone (PTH). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolismvia three target tissues: kidney, small intestine and bone. In the kidney, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulatescalcium transport in the proximal tubule; in the small intestine, it regulates calcium and phosphateuptake from the gut. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is also involved in the maintenance of plasma calciumlevels via bone resorption and formation. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulates the synthesis of PTH by anegative feedback mechanism. Vitamin D 2and D3are generally assumed to have equal levels of efficacy in humans, although recent data suggest that vitamin D3may be more efficient at increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (Trang et al ., 1998). Deficiency Prolonged vitamin D deficiency in infants and children results in rickets. In adults, vitamin D deficiency results in osteomalacia, the clinical symptoms of which include skeletal pain and muscle weakness andpathological fractures. Less severe vitamin D deficiency (usually referred to as vitamin D insufficiency) isassociated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased bone loss, leading to high risk offractures. Groups such as black, Asian, institutionalised older people, and those who habitually cover the skin may form less vitamin D endogenously as a result of exposure to sunlight, and are vulnerable to vitamin Ddeficiency. Individuals with a decreased capacity for intestinal absorption of vitamin D, for examplefollowing partial gastrectomy, are also at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, as are patients with liver,renal and cardiopulmonary diseases.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1372Interactions The cytotoxic agent actinomycin and imidazole antifungal agents interfere with vitamin D activity by inhibiting the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the kidney enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase. Lead has also been reported to inhibit vitamin D synthesis. Someanticonvulsant drugs may interfere with hepatic metabolism of vitamin D and so raise requirements. Absorption and bioavailability Vitamin D is absorbed from the small intestine as bile salt-dependent micelles and circulated in thebody via the lymph. Absorption of polar derivatives, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, is more efficient andless dependent on bile salts. These polar derivatives are generally not present in any significant amountin food or food supplements, although small amounts of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are found in meat andbreast milk. Distribution and metabolism There is substantial storage of vitamin D in adipose tissue. Vitamin D in plasma is bound to vitamin D-binding protein and transported to the liver where it undergoes 25-hydroxylation and is released intothe circulation bound to /H9251-2 globulin. Additional 1-hydroxylation then occurs in the kidney, producing the active form of the vitamin. This reaction is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which issecreted in response to low plasma calcium levels. Excretion Vitamin D is principally excreted in the bile. It is also metabolised to water-soluble metabolites, such ascalcitroic acid, and excreted in the urine. Toxicity Human data Excessive vitamin D intake may lead to hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. Vitamin D promotes theabsorption of calcium and the resorption of bone resulting in the deposition of calcium in soft tissues,diffuse demineralisation of bones and irreversible renal and cardiovascular toxicity. Patients withsarcoidosis are abnormally sensitive to vitamin D, due to uncontrolled conversion of the vitamin to itsactive form in the granulomatous tissue. Although the condition is uncommon, it would be a potentialhazard if affected individuals were to take supplementary vitamin D. One study has suggested that moderate levels (0.025-0.050 mg/ day) of vitamin D may enhance renal stone formation in susceptible individuals. Data on the comparative toxicity of vitamin D 2and D3in humans are lacking.Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 1382Supplementation trials A number of supplementation trials have reported no adverse effects at intakes of 0.010 - 0.045 mg vitamin D/ day. The effects at higher doses have been more variable. For example, in a study in which 63older individuals (females over 60 years, males over 65 years) were given 0.05 mg/ day supplementaryvitamin D (form unspecified) for 6 months, 2 subjects developed hypercalcaemia (Johnson et al ., 1980). However, in a 5 month study in which 61 younger adults (mean age, 41 years) were given 0.10 mg/ daysupplementary vitamin D 3, serum calcium levels were not significantly increased (Vieth et al ., 2001). The difference may reflect differing prior states with hyperparathyroidism or hypovitaminosis D possiblyoccurring in the elderly. Animal data In animals, excess vitamin D causes hypercalcaemia, resulting in deposition of calcium in soft tissues andbone demineralisation, anorexia, weight loss, anaemia and weakness. In studies in rhesus monkeys, vitamin D 3was shown to be significantly more toxic than vitamin D2. The authors noted that although less toxic, vitamin D2was still functional in this species. Excess vitamin D2during gestation in rabbits led to decreased foetal viability, an increased number of abortions, and supravalvular lesions in the offspring. High doses of vitamin D appear to affect maternalcalcium, phosphate and cholesterol homeostasis and neonatal calcium homeostasis. In rodents,administration of high levels of vitamin D 2during gestation resulted in retarded foetal and placental growth, loss of ossification of foetal bones and foetal skeletal degeneration, resulting particularly infacial malformations. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There are no data relating to the carcinogenicity of vitamin D. No in vivo or in vitro genotoxicity data have been identified. Mechanism of toxicity Vitamin D is involved in calcium metabolism and can increase calcium uptake from the gut, reabsorptionof calcium from the kidney and resorption of calcium from bone. Such responses are not wellcharacterised. Genetic variations Children born with the rare autosomal recessive condition, vitamin D dependency rickets Type II, arevulnerable to rickets and alopecia. The condition is characterised by high circulating levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3and functionless vitamin D receptors. Such individuals would be less susceptible to high intakes of vitamin D. The gene coding for the vitamin D receptor has been reported to be polymorphic, and sensitivity to vitamin D has been shown to vary depending on genotype.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1392Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 Dose response characterisation Due to the unknown contribution of vitamin D formed through exposure to sunlight, the dose response relationship of vitamin D and hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria is difficult to determine in humans. Humansupplementation studies using less than 0.02 mg/ day were not associated with adverse effects, whereasadverse effects have been reported at higher levels of intake in some studies. The majority of studies havereported significant changes at supplementation levels of approximately 0.10 mg/ day or greater. A problem in characterisation arises from the difficulty in ascertaining whether a particular serum calcium level on vitamin D supplementation does or does not indicate normality. In deficient individualsserum calcium levels would be expected to rise less than in those initially replete. Such a situationcould prevail in older people and in Asian populations. Vulnerable groups Infants are at risk of developing hypervitaminosis D; hypercalcaemia has been reported at vitamin Dintakes of 0.050 mg/ day and above (see later). Adults with disease states such as sarcoidosis,Mycobacterium infections and idiopathic hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia more vulnerable to resulting from moderate vitamin D intakes ( /H110220.025 mg/ day). Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Johnson et al., 1980 A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of dietary supplementation with 0.05 mg vitamin D per day (form unspecified) for six months was carried out in females over 60 and males over65 years of age (n = 63). Serum calcium levels were significantly raised in the vitamin D-treated groupand two of the subjects developed hypercalcaemia (serum calcium /H110222.75 mmol/L). Narang et al., 1984 A clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation (form unspecified) was carried out in healthy subjects aged 21-60 years and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Groups were given 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.06 and0.095 mg vitamin D per day for 3 months. In the healthy subjects (n = 30), serum calcium levels weresignificantly raised in the 0.06 and 0.095 mg/ day groups, although levels only normalrange /H110222.75 mmol/L) in the 0.095 mg/ day group. Serum calcium levels were non-significantly raised in the 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mg/ day groups. Honkanen et al., 1990 This randomised clinical trial of dietary supplementation with 0.045 mg vitamin D 3and 1558 mg calcium per day was performed in 52 independently-living and institutionalised elderly subjects treated for 11weeks (27 controls, 25 treated). Serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and creatinine levels weremeasured before and after the trial period. Serum calcium and creatinine levels did not significantly 1402differ in control or treated groups after the trial period, and were not outside the normal ranges in any individuals. Chapuy et al., 1992 The effect of supplementation for 18 months with 0.020 mg/ day vitamin D3, together with 1200 mg/ day calcium, on hip fracture incidence was investigated in this randomised, placebo-controlled study inhealthy women (mean age 84 years). Of the 1634 subjects who received the active supplements, 877completed the study. However, the rate of dropout from the study was similar in both treated andplacebo groups and there were no significant differences in the reasons reported for withdrawal (death,non-compliance, inability to walk during the study, loss to follow-up, intercurrent illness, gastrointestinaleffects). Serum calcium levels were measured every 6 months and one subject in the treated groupwithdrew from the study due to mild hypercalcaemia (serum calcium 2.8 mmol/L), which was reportedto be due to primary hyperparathyroidism. No other subjects had hypercalcaemia at any point during tothe study and it was reported that no subjects developed renal calculi. Jacobus et al., 1992 A retrospective study was carried out on eight US patients with hypervitaminosis D, thought to be caused by consumption of milk excessively fortified with vitamin D 3. Serum vitamin D3concentrations varied considerably in these patients. A proposed explanation for this was that apparently thefortification of the milk was sporadic and only at times in excess. All patients had elevated serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, with 6/8 having elevated serum vitamin D 3concentrations. Seven of the eight patients had hypercalcaemia. All patients drank locally produced milk (118-710 mL/ day) which containedvitamin D levels ranging from undetectable to 6.1 mg/L. The recommended level for milk fortification inthe US is 0.01055 mg/L. Dawson-Hughes et al., 1997 A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial investigated dietary supplementation with 0.0175 mg vitamin D 3and 500 mg calcium per day for 3 years in 389 subjects of 65 years or older. Although primarily a study of effects on bone mineral density, serum calcium and creatinine weremonitored. There was a small but significant increase in serum calcium levels over the lifetime of thestudy in the treated group, but levels were within the normal range. One treated subject withdrew fromthe trial due to hypercalciuria. Vieth et al., 2001 The safety of supplementation with 0.10 mg/ day vitamin D 3for 2 to 5 months was investigated in healthy men and women with a mean age of 41 years. The number of treated individuals withhypercalciuria was not significantly different to the number of untreated controls with hypercalciuria,although the study was of low statistical power to detect such differences. There was no evidence ofhypercalcaemia; mean serum calcium concentrations were within the normal range (2.2-2.6 mmol/L) inall subjects. Animal data Haschek et al., 1977 Pigs received standard diets that had optimal calcium and phosphate and provided intakes of vitamin D3 of 0.00132 mg/kg bw/ day for one week following weaning. They were injected with 45Ca and, 3 daysExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1412Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 later, divided into two groups, one of which received standard diet (control) and one of which received diet providing 0.825 mg/kg bw/ day vitamin D3. Two pigs from each group were sacrificed 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 days after division into the two treatment groups. Pigs fed the high level of vitamin D lost weight;anorexia, weakness, rough hair coat and laboured breathing were also observed. In the treated group,hypercalcaemia began at 12 hours after starting the high vitamin D diet, and progressed rapidly after twodays. Interpretation of the radioisotope studies indicated that bone was the primary source of theincreased plasma calcium, since food intake and, therefore calcium absorption from the gut, wasdepressed. Calcium was released at a rapid rate from pre-labelled bone undergoing breakdown. Chineme et al., 1977 Pigs were fed diets providing vitamin D 3intakes of approximately 0.00132, 0.165 mg/kg bw/ day. The resulting hypercalcaemia, seen in the upper two dose groups, was thought to resultprimarily from intestinal absorption of calcium, not from bone loss and tissue degeneration, ashypercalcaemia per se was not always associated with soft tissue calcification in pigs. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food (Annex 4; intake 0.009 + 0.0125 = 0.022 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment Excess vitamin D may lead to hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. Hypercalcaemia results in the deposition of calcium in soft tissues, diffuse demineralisation of bones and irreversible renal andcardiovascular toxicity. Moderate levels of vitamin D intake may enhance renal stone formation inpredisposed individuals. It has been suggested that excess vitamin D may be linked to heart disease, butthere is limited evidence for this. Data are available from a range of human supplementation studies, but the levels of vitamin D intake at which hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria occurs vary between studies. Likely reasons for this includedifferences in populations studied; for example, several of the studies are in older people, a groupvulnerable to vitamin D deficiency, while other studies are in younger adults, who are not likely to bevitamin D deficient. Individuals and groups are also likely to differ in their exposure to vitamin D sourcesother than supplementation, such as consumption of vitamin D-fortified foods and through exposure tothe sun. Excess vitamin D during gestation in rats and rabbits led to a number of adverse reproductive effects. 1422ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL A safe upper level suitable for long-term intake by the whole population cannot be established based on the available data from studies in humans or animals. The human data are adequate to provideguidance. High intakes of vitamin D are associated with elevated levels of calcium, which in turn lead tosoft tissue calcification, demineralisation of bones, and renal and cardiovascular toxicity. The effect isapparent in both human case reports and in animal studies. Assessing the risk of toxicity in man is complicated. On the one hand, significant numbers of the UK population, notably older people and Asian populations not exposed to sunlight, may ordinarily be atrisk of deficiency. By contrast, apart from the rare individuals with granulomatous diseases, who areabnormally sensitive to the effects of vitamin D, there are others, notably older people, who have ahigh prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism. Others, with tertiary hyperparathyroidism due toprolonged vitamin D deficiency, may show falsely low serum calcium levels in response to vitamin D.There is therefore a particular need for large studies covering all sections of the population. These aregenerally lacking. The highest level of vitamin D supplementation at which no effect on calcium was observed was 0.10 mg/ day, reported by Vieth et al . (2001). This was from a 5 month supplementation study of vitamin D 3 in 63 adults aged 23 - 56 years. In contrast, the lowest level of vitamin D at which effects have been observed was 0.05 mg/ day (Johnson et al ., 1980) from a 6 month study of supplementation with vitamin D (of unspecified form) in females above the age of 60 and males above the age of 65. Two out of the 63 subjects developed hypercalcaemia (serum calcium /H110222.75 mmol/L). The reason for the difference is not known but may be due to difference in other sources of vitamin D exposure or in thestudy populations. Taking the evidence as a whole, long-term exposures of up to 0.025 mg/ day vitamin D appear to be well-tolerated and may be necessary to prevent deficiency in some groups. Higher levels (for example,0.045 mg/ day; Honkanen et al ., 1990) may be tolerated without adverse effects over the short-term under medical supervision and may be necessary to correct a deficiency. The use of an uncertaintyfactor is not appropriate because the value is derived from an overview of a number of human studieswhich measured sensitive biochemical markers of calcium homeostasis. For guidance purposes only, a level of 0.025 mg/ day supplementary vitamin D would not be expected to cause adverse effects in the general population. This is equivalent to 0.0004 mg/kg bw/ day for a 60kg adult. Due to the difficulties in assessing total vitamin D exposure, an estimate for total intake hasnot been provided. Such an intake, or more, might well be required under medical supervision inmanaging overt or occult deficiency states. It should be noted that scaling on a body weight basis tochildren and infants may not be appropriate for vitamin D as it may lead to the recommended intake foran infant not being met.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1432Part 2 Fat Vitamins2 P.J.

American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 73, 288-94. 1442General information Chemistry The term vitamin E is used as a generic designation for a group of eight lipid-soluble compounds synthesised by plants. These compounds fall into two classes, tocopherols and tocotrienols, whichexhibit the biological antioxidant activity of vitamin E. Vitamins in both classes are designated by theGreek letters /H9251, \u00df, /H9253and /H9254. The most biologically active is d-/H9251-tocopherol. Vitamin E activity is expressed as d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents. Where activity is given as International Units (IU), 1 IU of d-/H9251-tocopherol (RRR- /H9251-tocopherol) is equivalent to 0.67 mg. If the vitamin E is present in the form of dl-/H9251-tocopherol ( all-rac -/H9251-tocopherol), then 0.91 mg is equivalent to 1 IU. Natural occurrence Vitamin E is synthesised only by plants and is, therefore, found primarily in plant products, the richest source being plant oils. All higher plants (that is plants other than algae) appear to contain /H9251-tocopherol in leaves and other green parts, while /H9253-tocopherol is generally present in lower concentrations. Animal tissues tend to have low concentrations of vitamin E, with the highest levels occurring in fatty tissuesthough this varies according to the intake of vitamin E. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Plant oils are the main dietary sources of vitamin E (560-1600 mg/kg in soybean oil, 530-1620 mg/kg incorn oil mg/kg) and dairyproducts (0.4-10.0 mg/kg) providing only moderate amounts. The amount of vitamin E in foods at thepoint of consumption is difficult to assess as it depends upon the effects of processing, storage andpreparation. Vitamin E is present in a variety of dietary supplements at doses of up to 268 mg/ day inmulti-constituent products and 670 mg/ day in single constituent products. Vitamin E is also present inlicensed medicinal products; the highest doses authorised are 20-100 mg. Recommended amounts Foods containing large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) will generally contain largeamounts of vitamin E. In addition, the requirement for vitamin E increases with the amount of dietaryPUFAs consumed. Thus, owing to the widely differing requirements based on the PUFA intake, it isgenerally considered more realistic to give ranges of acceptable intake rather than a fixed level. Usingthis approach, in a NDNS survey (Gregory et al , 1990) of 1629 adults only 0.7% had serum tocopherol:cholesterol ratios lower than 2.25 /H9262mol/mmol (below this erythrocytes have a tendency to haemolyse). The 2.5 and 97.5 centile intakes were 3.5 mg and 19.5 mg in men and 2.5 mg and 15.2 mg inwomen. This gives a median intake of 9.3 mg /H9251-tocopherol equivalent/ day for men and 6.7 mg/ day for women. COMA considered these ranges and concluded that daily intakes of 4 mg and 3 mg of /H9251- tocopherol equivalents could be adequate for men and women respectively (COMA, 1991). Potentialdeficiency, however, could be excluded if the lower intakes are maintained over prolonged periods.Intakes of 3.8 - 6.2 mg/ day appear to be satisfactory for pregnant and lactating women.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1452Risk Assessment Vitamin E2Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 146Analysis of tissue levels and vitamin E status. Measurement of serum plasma concentration of /H9251-tocopherol provides the simplest and most direct evidence of vitamin E status. Values of 5 - 20 /H9262g/mL for adults and children of twelve years or older and values of 3 - 15 /H9262g/mL for children under twelve years indicate acceptable levels of intake. Another widely used indicator of vitamin E status is the extent of haemolysis of red blood cells in thepresence of hydrogen peroxide. A high degree of haemolysis accompanies vitamin E deficiency (i.e.greater than 20%); however, this is not specific to vitamin E deficiency. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects. It has been claimed that vitamin E can prevent free radical damage. In a cancer prevention study, theincidence of prostate cancer was 32 % lower and mortality was 41 % lower in men taking /H9251-tocopherol, either with or without \u00df-carotene, than in those not taking the vitamin supplement. Vitamin E is thoughtto have a role in the prevention of atherosclerosis, through inhibition of oxidation of low-densitylipoprotein. Vitamin E has been reported to relieve the symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease. It hasalso been claimed that menopausal symptoms may be relieved by vitamin E. Vitamin E has been used to treat scleroderma and it has been reported that it may prevent retrolental fibroplasia and intracranial haemorrhage in premature infants. In animal studies, vitamin E has beenfound to reduce UV-induced acute and chronic skin damage. Function It is unclear whether vitamin E functions solely as a lipid antioxidant, or whether it might also berequired for the function of some other critical, but unknown metabolic factor. However, currentinformation suggests that the effects of vitamin E are consistent with an antioxidant role. In this regard,vitamin E is thought to have basic functional importance in the maintenance of membrane integrityin virtually all cells of the body. Non-antioxidant functions have also been proposed for /H9251- but not \u00df-tocopherol including modification of gene transcription and expression. Deficiency The clinical manifestations of vitamin E deficiency vary considerably between species. In general, thetargets are the neuromuscular, vascular and reproductive systems . The various signs of vitamin E deficiency are believed to be manifestations of membrane dysfunction, resulting from oxidativedegradation of polyunsaturated membrane phospholipids and/ or the disruption of other critical cellularprocesses. Interactions Vitamin E may exacerbate the effects of vitamin K deficiency, thus affecting blood coagulation. This hasbeen reported in animal studies and in case reports of humans taking large doses the basis for theinteraction is unclear. Vitamin E may also interfere with vitamin A absorption.Absorption and bioavailability /H9251-Tocopherol is absorbed unchanged from the small intestine by non-saturable, passive diffusion. Tocotrienol esters are first hydrolysed by pancreatic esterase. Absorption appears to occur mostly inthe upper and middle thirds of the small intestine. The absorption efficiency of tocopherol and itsesters is generally considered to be variable. It has been reported that in human studies, absorption of/H9251-tocopherol and its acetate ester was in the region of 21 - 86% over 24 hours. Distribution and metabolism Vitamin E does not appear to have a specific carrier protein in the plasma, but it is rapidly transferred from chylomicrons to plasma lipoproteins, to which it binds non-specifically. The vitamin is taken up bythe liver and released in low density lipoprotein (LDL). Most absorbed tocopherols are transportedunchanged to the tissues. Kinetic studies indicate that the body has two pools of the vitamin: a 'labile'pool which turns over rapidly and a 'fixed' pool which turns over slowly. The labile pool predominatesin tissues such as plasma and liver, as the tocopherol contents of those tissues are depleted rapidlyunder conditions of vitamin E deprivation. In contrast, the adipose vitamin E resides predominately inthe bulk lipid phase, which appears to be a fixed pool of the vitamin. Excretion At normal intake levels, vitamin E is conjugated with glucuronic acid and this conjugate is excreted (viabile) in the faeces. Up to 30-70 % of vitamin E is excreted via this route with less than 1% being excretedin the urine. Some vitamin E may be eliminated via the skin. Toxicity Human data Vitamin E has low toxicity. Humans and animals appear to be able to tolerate levels of the vitamin twoorders of magnitude above nutritional requirements, e.g. 1000 - 2000 IU/kg diet without untowardeffects. At very high doses, however, vitamin E can produce signs indicative of antagonism with thefunction of the other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, K). Isolated reports of adverse effects inhumans consuming up to 1000 IU of vitamin E per day include headache, fatigue, nausea, double vision,muscle weakness, mild creatinuria and gastrointestinal distress. In the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) study, vitamin E supplementation was associated with an increased risk of mortality from haemorrhagic stroke, whilst in the Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study(CHAOS) a small excess of cardiovascular deaths was observed in the supplemented group. These aredescribed below: Supplementation studies Many human studies, both small and large scale, have considered the effect of vitamin E on various biochemical and physiological parameters. These have included large-scale intervention studies, designed toassess the effects of vitamin E on conditions such as cancer and heart disease, which have not generallyconsidered more minor side effects. In smaller scale trials, few adverse effects have been reported. However,creatinuria, breast pain, diarrhoea and fatigue and dizziness have been noted in some investigations.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1472Animal data Animals with hypervitaminosis E have been found to show impaired bone mineralisation, reduced hepatic storage of vitamin A and coagulopathy. In each case, these signs could be corrected withincreased dietary supplements of the appropriate vitamin (i.e. vitamins D, A and K, respectively). The antagonism appeared to occur during absorption. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No carcinogenicity studies have been identified in laboratory animals, however, some limited chronicstudies exist which do not suggest that vitamin E is carcinogenic. No in vivo or in vitro genotoxicity studies have been identified. Co-incubation with vitamin E has been reported to reduce the mutageniceffect of chemicals such as malonaldehyde and \u00df-propiolactone in some Ames test studies. Mechanism of toxicity Vitamin E has been reported to interact with vitamin K. The mechanism of this is uncertain, but it hasbeen suggested that the metabolite tocopherylquinone, which is structurally similar to vitamin K mayinhibit vitamin K metabolism and thus coagulation. Dose-response characterisation No relevant data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations Familial isolated vitamin E deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder withsymptoms similar to those of Friedrich's ataxia. Supplementation with vitamin E can prevent the onsetof the disease if given before irreversible damage occurs. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Gillilan et al., 1977 Forty-eight patients with stable angina completed a double-blind crossover study of two 6 month periods of treatment with 1600 IU/ day d-/H9251-tocopherol succinate (equivalent to 1072 mg d-/H9251- tocopherol) or placebo. No statistically significant differences were apparent in a number of cardiacparameters including systolic time interval assessment of left ventricular function and the multistage,Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 1482maximal exercise test. The subjects were questioned regarding possible side effects and underwent periodic urinalysis, blood count and blood chemistry analysis, measures of prothrombin time, chest X-ray and ECG. No deleterious side effects were observed. There was a slightly increased incidence ofgastrointestinal disturbance during the placebo phase; further details are not provided. It was statedthat there was 'no exacerbation of hypertension, congestive heart failure or skeletal muscle complaintscould be attributed to vitamin E therapy'. No further details are provided. No differences were found inthe various clinical chemistry indices. Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study (CHAOS): Stephens et al., 1996 2002 patients with atherosclerosis were entered into a double-blind placebo-controlled study and followed up for a median of 510 days (range 3-981). The treatment group received a dose of 800 IUvitamin E (537 mg as d-/H9251-tocopherol)/ day for the first 546 patients and 400 IU/ day (268 mg as d-/H9251- tocopherol)/ day for the remainder. Treatment significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death andnon-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (a composite endpoint). However, this decrease was due to thedecrease in MI since, when separated out, there was a slight non-significant excess of cardiovasculardeaths in the treatment group (RR, 1.18, 95% CI, 0.62-2.27, p=0.61). The authors speculated that the findingmight be due to chance or might reflect a difference in biological events leading to death and thoseleading to non-fatal MI and noted that the results of larger studies would be necessary to clarify this.The study was not designed to look at any dose response effects and there was no randomisation ofthe subjects within the different treatment groups. Meydani et al., 1998 Eighty-eight healthy older subjects (aged /H1102265 years) were entered into a double-blind placebo- controlled study, receiving placebo, 60, 200 or 800 IU dl-/H9251-tocopherol/ day (34, 134 or 537 mg d-/H9251- tocopherol equivalents) for four months. The groups contained 17, 19, 18 and 19 subjects respectively. Thestudy was designed to assess the effect of supplementation on general health and measured an extensiverange of parameters. It was stated that no side effects were reported. Supplementation had no effect onplasma concentration of other anti-oxidant vitamins and minerals, glutathione peroxidase, superoxidedismutase or total cysteine. There was no significant effect of vitamin E on serum non-specificimmunoglobulin concentrations or anti-DNA and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. The cytotoxic ability ofneutrophils against Candida albicans was not compromised. Vitamin E had no effect on body weight, plasma total proteins, albumin, glucose, plasma lipids or the lipoprotein profile, total bilirubin, time, haemoglobin, urinary or serumcreatine levels. The authors concluded that supplementation had no detrimental effect on health. Ascherio et al., 1999 In the Health Professional Follow-up Study, 43,738 men were recruited and followed for up to 8 years. Vitamin E intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire which included questions onsupplement use. None of the subjects had cardiovascular disease or diabetes. A total of 328 strokesoccurred: 210 ischaemic, 70 haemorrhagic and 48 unclassified. After adjustment, the relative risks forischaemic and total stroke were not affected by vitamin E intake. The association of vitamin E withhaemorrhagic stroke was also non-significant but the confidence intervals were wide. The authorsconcluded that vitamin E supplements did not affect stroke risk but that modest effects could not beruled out.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1492Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 GISSI-Prevenzione Investigators, 1999 11,324 patients who had survived recent myocardial infarction were randomly assigned supplements of n-3 PUFA (1 g daily), 300 mg vitamin E (as synthetic /H9251-tocopherol), both or neither for 3.5 years. The primary combined efficacy endpoint was death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. Smokers andex-smokers were evenly distributed through the groups. Vitamin E treatment had no effect on thecombined or separate endpoints. ATBC study: The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study et al., 2000 In a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study, a total of 29,133 Finnish male smokers were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 50 mg dl-/H9251-tocopherol/ day (equivalent to 55 IU), 20 mg/ day \u00df-carotene, both /H9251-tocopherol and \u00df-carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years. Lung cancer incidence was not affected by /H9251-tocopherol treatment, but the incidence of prostate cancer was reduced. /H9251-Tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality but was associated with an increase in mortality from haemorrhagic stroke (7.8 deaths per 10,000 person years inthe /H9251-tocopherol group versus 5.2 deaths per 10,000 person years in the no /H9251-tocopherol groups). In contrast, deaths from ischaemic stroke and ischaemic heart disease were reduced in the /H9251-tocopherol group. Subsequent analysis of the risk factors for stroke indicated that vitamin E increased the riskof sub-arachnoid haemorrhage (RR, 2.45, 95% CI 1.08-5.55) of cerebral infarction(RR, 0.7: 95%CI 0.55-0.89) in hypertensive men but had no effect on normotensive men. HOPE study: Yusuf et al., 2000 A total of 9,541 subjects (6996 men and 2545 women) aged 55 or over at high risk for cardiovascular events were enrolled in a trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design. The participants received either 400 IUvitamin E (from natural sources - no further details provided) or placebo and either ramipril ormatching placebo for a mean of 4.5 years. The primary endpoint was a combination of myocardialinfarction and stroke and death from cardiovascular causes. The secondary outcomes included unstableangina, congestive heart failure, revascularisation or amputation, death from any cause, complications ofdiabetes and cancer. There were no significant differences in the numbers of deaths from cardiovascularcauses (RR 1.05; 95%CI 0.9-1.22) between those receiving vitamin E or placebo or in any of the secondaryoutcomes. There were no differences in adverse effects between the vitamin E and placebo group or inthe numbers of patients who stopped taking the study medication. There was also no difference in theincidence of haemorrhagic stroke between the groups. Primary Prevention Project (PPP), 2001 In a controlled open 2 x 2 factorial trial, 4495 people were randomised to receive low dose aspirin (100 mg/ day) or no aspirin, and vitamin E (300 mg/ day as synthetic /H9251-tocopherol) or no vitamin E to investigate the prevention of cardiovascular events in people with one or more major cardiovascular riskfactors (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, obesity or family history). The mean follow upperiod was 3.6 years. The main combined endpoint was the cumulative rate of cardiovascular death,non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. Predefined analyses included cardiovasculardeaths, total deaths, and total cardiovascular events. Smokers and ex-smokers were evenly distributedthrough the groups. Vitamin E had no effect on any pre-specified endpoint. 1502Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002 placebo-controlled trial of antioxidant vitamin supplementation, 20,536 high risk adults (those with coronary heart disease, other occlusive vascular disease or diabetes) were given a dailysupplement of 600 mg dl-/H9251-tocopherol (equivalent to 660 IU), 250 mg vitamin C and 20 mg \u00df-carotene or placebo for five years (Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002). No difference in all causemortality was revealed. Compliance was 83% on average in each treatment group, adverse experienceswere sought at each follow up visit (every 4 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter)and no significant side effects were reported. It is unclear whether minor side effects were reported orinvestigated. There was no significant difference in the number having a haemorrhagic stroke. Currentand ex-smokers were evenly distributed between groups. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake (as d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents): up to 670 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum 18 + 670 = 690 mg/ day daily intake: No potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment Very high doses of vitamin E have been reported to cause a few sporadic adverse effects. These include headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, double vision, muscle weakness and mild creatinuria. Highlevels of vitamin E may also antagonise the effects of the other fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin E also hasan anti-platelet and anti-coagulant effect. A number of human supplementation studies on vitamin E areavailable. Unexpected findings were apparent in two large trials, one concerned with heart disease(CHAOS), and one which considered a range of health endpoints in male smokers (ATBC). An increasedrisk of mortality from haemorrhagic stroke was found in the treatment group of the ATBC study; thiswas considered to be biologically plausible given the effect of vitamin E on platelets and the authorsnoted that this finding should be subject to careful review. The level of vitamin E supplementationinvolved (55 IU/ day, equivalent to 37 mg d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents/ day) was relatively low, being about 4 times the average daily dietary intake. It is possible, however, that an interaction might haveoccurred between vitamin E and smoking which was not apparent in the rest of the population studies.Further analysis of the data suggests that the effect was only apparent in hypertensive subjects. TheCHAOS study reported a non-significant excess in deaths from cardiovascular disease in the treatmentgroup; but the authors considered that this might be a chance effect. In the MRC/BHF, HOPE and PPPstudies where subjects at high risk of cardiovascular events were given higher doses of vitamin E, similareffects were not reported. In the observational study of male health professionals (Ascherio et al., 1999)Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1512Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 the relative risk of total and ischaemic stroke was not affected by vitamin E intake, and there was no significant association between haemorrhagic stroke and vitamin E intake. These large interventionstudies do not report more minor side effects. Other smaller human supplementation studies are available, but not all of these investigate side effects in detail. A significant effect of vitamin E is potential interference with vitamin K. This has been demonstrated in animal studies and in isolated case reports of subjects taking large doses of vitamin E. However, theMeydani study did not find an increase in prothrombin time in subjects taking 800 IU/ day vitamin E.Work with in-patients taking the anti-coagulant warfarin suggested similar results. However, there arefew data on these haematological effects at higher doses, so it is not possible to establish a threshold. As noted above, vitamin E has been reported to have adverse effects on clotting in animal studies. There are few other animal data on vitamin E. ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL Key studies: Gillilan et al. (1977); Meydani et al. (1996); Stephens et al. (1996) NOAEL: 800-1600 IU/ day (540 - 970 mg d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents/ day) Uncertainty Factor: 1Safe Upper Level 800 IU (540 mg d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents/ day) supplemental for daily consumption vitamin E (equivalent to 9.0 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult)over a lifetime: In the trials by Gillilan et al. (1977) and Meydani et al. (1996) the biochemical and physiological effects of vitamin E were investigated in some detail and the findings indicate that supplemental doses of 800 to1600 IU/ day are without apparent adverse effect. The results were derived from small groups that maynot be representative, thus an additional uncertainty factor could be applied to account for inter-individual variation. However, the results of the larger CHAOS trial (Stephens et al., 1996) support the view that 800 IU/ day supplemental vitamin E would not result in any adverse effects and, taking thethree studies together, no further uncertainty factors are necessary. A Safe Upper Level of 800 IU/ day(540 mg d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents/ day) supplemental vitamin E is recommended. This is equivalent to 9.0 mg/kg bw/ day for a 60 kg adult. Assuming an intake of 18 mg/ day from food, a total intake of 560 mg d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents/ day would not be expected to result in any adverse effect. This is equivalent to 12.4 mg/kg bw/ day. A study in male smokers has suggested that 55 IU/ day vitamin E (equivalent to 37 mg d-/H9251-tocopherol equivalents/ day) may increase the risk of mortality from haemorrhagic stroke in hypertensive subjectswho smoked. Although biologically plausible, the significance of this finding is uncertain. It has not beenrepeated in other studies in subjects at high risk of cardiovascular events treated with higher doses ofvitamin E (up to 600 mg/ day); however, if it is an effect related to smoking there may have been toofew smokers in these studies for any effect to be apparent. In addition, a large observational study ofmale health professionals did not report this association. 1522References The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group (1994).

Phylloquinone (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) is designated asvitamin K 1. The menaquinones, collectively known as vitamin K2, are a large series of compounds containing an unsaturated side chain with differing numbers of isoprenyl units at the 3 position in themethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone nucleus. Depending on the number of isoprenyl units the individualcompounds are designated as menaquinone- n-(MK- n). Several synthetic water-soluble compounds containing the 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone structure also exist. These include menadione (vitamin K 3) and menadiol (vitamin K4) (see table).Risk Assessment Vitamin K 2 Table: Summary of the nomenclature of the various forms of vitamin K Name Synonyms/ chemical name Source Vitamin K1Phylloquinone 2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone Natural Vitamin K1 is synthesised by plants. The vitamin K2 series is synthesised by various Gram-positive bacteria present in the jejunum and ileum. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Dietary vitamin K is largely obtained from green leafy vegetables and vegetable oils, with lesser amountspresent in dairy products, meat and eggs. Vitamin K is also present as K 1and K2in multi-vitamin food supplements and as K1and K4in licensed medicines. Vitamins K1and K4are used in the treatment or prophylaxis of haemorrhage as a result of low blood level of prothrombin or Factor VII, malabsorptionor use of coumarin anticoagulants . UK food supplements may contain up to 0.045 mg vitamin K (either as K 1or K2) for general consumption and 0.20 mg in supplements intended for women from pre-conception to nursing.Other sources of exposure Vitamin K (as the K2series) is also provided by the bacterial flora in the intestine, and this contributes significantly towards the daily requirement of the vitamin. Recommended amounts Although vitamin K is known to be essential, recommendations on adequate nutritional intakes have notbeen precisely established, because of the unquantified contribution made by the intestinal bacteria.COMA considered that an intake of 0.001 mg/kg bw/ day was probably adequate with regard to thecoagulation function of vitamin K and noted that synthetic preparations of K 3were best avoided for nutritional purposes, due to their link with haemolysis and liver damage in the newborn (COMA, 1991). The Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula regulations (1995) recommend a minimum vitamin K intake of 0.004 mg/100 kcal. Analysis of tissue levels and vitamin K status Functional tests of blood clotting were initially used to assess vitamin K status. However, a radioimmunoassay which measures the ratio of prothrombin to partially carboxylated prothrombin inplasma (the latter is formed during vitamin K deficiency) is now available. Measurement of the carboxylationof serum osteocalcin, and plasma vitamin K 1are also used to determine vitamin K status. However, the measurement of plasma vitamin K1is of limited value because it reflects recent dietary intake. Brief overview of non-nutritional effects Vitamin K (in particular, the water-soluble form) has been reported to potentiate the analgesic effect ofopiates and salicylates, and induce radiosensitisation. Function Vitamin K catalyses the carboxylation of a number of protein factors involved in blood clottingincluding prothrombin, forming the calcium binding sites on glutamyl side chains in the protein. Oncecarboxylated, the glutamates are referred to as gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA). GLA-containing proteins are also found in the bone. For example, bone GLA protein (or osteocalcin) is thought to be involved in the limitation of bone growth, and matrix GLA protein may be involved inmobilisation and deposition of bone calcium. Kidney GLA proteins may be involved in reabsorption of calcium by the kidney tubules and solubilisation of calcium salts in urine. GLA-containing proteins have also been found in the placenta, pancreas, spleen and lungs, but the majority of these have not yet been characterised. Vitamin K-dependent proteins are also thought to have roles in cell signalling and brain lipid metabolism.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1552Deficiency Vitamin K is widely available from the diet and is also provided by gut bacteria . Thus, deficiency is generally secondary to conditions such as malabsorption or impaired gut synthesis. Hospitalised patientscan be at risk of vitamin K deficiency following the use of antibiotics or gastrointestinal surgery. Newbornbabies have low levels of vitamin K, which may result in haemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Interactions It has been shown experimentally that excessive vitamin E exposure results in increased prothrombintimes which are normalised by vitamin K 2. The effects of vitamin K1are also antagonised by excessive oral intakes of vitamin A. Vitamin K1interacts with coumarin anticoagulants. The effect of 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone (vitamin K3) is antagonised by actinomycin D. The carcinogenic activity of benzo(a)pyrene has been shown to be increased by vitamin K1, as a result of induction of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). In contrast, vitamin K3 decreased CYP1A1 activity. Absorption and bioavailability Vitamin K is readily absorbed, but there are conflicting reports on whether this is higher from supplements or from a food matrix. The bioavailability of vitamin K1is the same from raw and cooked broccoli and is unaffected by the fat content of the meal. Absorption of vitamin K1 takes place in the proximal small intestine by a saturable, energy dependent process. Absorption of bacterial menaquinones (K2) occurs in the terminal ileum by passive diffusion. Absorption of vitamin K is enhanced by bile salts and pancreatic juice. Overall, 40-70% of vitamin K maybe absorbed in the jejunum, but absorption is lower elsewhere in the digestive system. Vitamin K 3is believed to be absorbed by passive diffusion in the distal intestine and colon. Distribution and metabolism Vitamin K is transported via the lymph in chylomicrons and concentrated in the liver prior to wide distribution. The body pool of vitamin K is low. The metabolism of vitamins K1and K2involves the formation of an epoxide and a quinone, which can then be reduced by NAD(P)H reductases. Thereduced form is involved in carboxylation reactions. The carboxylic acid derivatives of vitamin K 1 are conjugated with glucuronic acid. In rats, vitamin K1 can be converted to K2in the tissues. Vitamin K3is thought to be metabolised by conjugation with sulphate, phosphate and glucuronide. Excretion Approximately 30-40% of vitamin K is excreted, via the bile, in the faeces as partially degraded, conjugated water-soluble metabolites. are water-soluble metabolites.Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 1562Toxicity Human data There are relatively few reports of human toxicity following ingestion. High doses of water-soluble vitamin K3(menadione) may result in oxidative damage, red cell fragility and the formation of methaemoglobin. High doses of vitamin K3 given to premature infants to treat intracranial and pulmonary haemorrhage have been reported to have caused hyperbilirubinaemia andoverloading of the immature liver, resulting in kernicterus and brain toxicity. Fewer cases have beenreported recently as a safer level has been established. Local hypersensitivity reactions to dermal injections of vitamin K (mostly of the K 1form) have been reported. They are thought to be delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Animal data Acute doses of vitamin K1(phylloquinone) up to 25,000 mg/kg bw caused no fatalities in rats, mice or chicks. In contrast, oral vitamin K3(menadione) administration to rats, chicks and mice resulted in anaemia and death. Parenteral administration of high doses of K3to dogs caused methaemoglobinaemia, urobilinuria and urobilinogenuria, and fatal liver damage. No data on reproductive toxicity have been identified. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No data on carcinogenicity have been identified.Vitamin K 1was negative in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity test, but there are conflicting reports of its ability to cause sister chromatid exchange in human and animal leukocytes. Mechanisms of toxicity Menadione causes oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation. Dose response characterisation No data have been identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1572Part 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 Vulnerable groups Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are more susceptible to the development of methaemoglobinaemia, and this would include oxidative damage caused by menadione(vitamin K 3). Infants are vulnerable to vitamin K3toxicity. An initial suggestion that intramuscular administration of vitamin K was associated with childhood cancer has not been supported infurther studies. Genetic variations No data have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Israels et al., 1987 Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) was measured in human leukocytes taken from adult and placental blood. In the presence of 1 /H9262M vitamin K1, the mean number of SCEs per metaphase increased significantly from 3.32 + 0.219 in placental blood to 5.76 + 0.219 and from 5.13 + 0.273 to 7.81 + 0.326 in adult blood. Co-incubation with vitamin K1 did not affect the number of SCEs caused by benzpyrene or mitomycin C. Cornelissen et al., 1991 The numbers of SCEs were measured in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of six newborn babies 24 hrs after intra-muscular injection with 1 mg vitamin K1(as the drug Konakion) and in six control neonates. The mean number of SCEs per metaphase was 8.88 + 1.22 in the vitamin K1group compared to 9.05 + 1.14 in the controls. The mean number of chromosome aberrations per 100 mitoses was 3.00 + 2.61 in the vitamin K group compared to 2.50 + 1.87 in the controls. Plasma vitamin K1concentration ranged from 0.0255 to 2.55 /H9262M. The authors concluded that there was no evidence that vitamin K1treatment caused genotoxicity. However, it is possible that taking the sample 24 hours after treatment may have been tooearly to detect SCEs. Craciun et al., 1998 Eight elite female athletes were given 10 mg/ day vitamin K 1for one month and markers of bone health were assessed before and after treatment. Four of the eight athletes had been amenorrhoeic for morethan 1 year whilst the others had been taking oral contraceptives. The athletes' dietary vitamin K intakewas stated to be in excess of the 0.001 mg/kg bw/ day RDA value. At baseline, the amenorrhoeic groupwas biochemically vitamin K deficient as assessed by the calcium binding activity of circulatingosteocalcin. In all subjects, supplementation was associated with an increase in the calcium bindingcapacity of osteocalcin, indicating correction of a deficiency. In the amenorrhoeic group 1582supplementation was associated with a 15-20 % increase in bone formation markers and a 20-25% decrease in bone resorption markers. No adverse effects were noted at 10 mg/ day. Booth et al., 1999 In a trial in a metabolic unit using a 3 x 15 day crossover design, both younger and older male and female subjects were fed a mixed diet containing 0.10 mg vitamin K1per day. During two of the 15-day residency periods, the diet was supplemented with either broccoli (0.377 mg total K1per day) or K1fortified oil (0.417 mg total K1per day). No adverse effects were noted at 0.377-0.417 mg total K1per day. Animal data Molitor and Robinson, 1940 Toxicity studies were conducted in mice, chicks and rats. Vitamin K1in single oral doses up to 25,000 mg/kg bw, produced no fatalities in mice, whereas vitamin K3was highly toxic. Intraperitoneal studies showed that doses of 200 mg/kg bw of vitamin K3caused 100% mortality in mice but intraperitoneal doses of vitamin K1as high as 25,000 mg/kg bw failed to cause death. In sub-chronic studies in rats, daily feeding over a 30 day period of 500 mg/kg bw of vitamin K3was fatal and smaller doses resulted in pronounced anaemia. Daily doses as high as 2000 mg/kg bw vitamin K1produced no ill effects. Israels et al., 1987 Five foetal sheep were given a 1 mg dose of vitamin K1 into the femoral vein via a catheter. The mean number of SCEs per metaphase increased from 3.94 + 0.15 at 15 minutes pre-injection to 5.38 + 0.23 at 24 hours post-injection. Before treatment the level of vitamin K1 was not detectable, but increased to 0.3 /H9262M after treatment. The increase in SCE was low but was stated to be statistically significant. No positive controls were used and it is difficult to assess the biological importance of the result. The in vitro dose response curve for SCE induction was investigated in both foetal and adult sheep leukocytes incubated with vitamin K1. The doses tested ranged from 0.1 nM to 1 /H9262M. At 0.1 nM the number of SCEs in the adult cells (from the dam) were not significantly different from the solventcontrol. However, the number of SCEs in the foetal cells was significantly increased compared to thecontrols. The increase in SCEs in the adult cells became significant at 10 nM. The actual numbers ofSCEs at different dose levels were not given but the figure indicates that SCEs in adults increased fromapproximately 6 to 9 per metaphase and in the foetus from 4.3 to 7.5 per metaphase. Edenharder et al., 1999 Vitamins K 1, K3,K4 and 1,4 naphthoquinone caused a concentration-related reduction in the mutagenicity of six heterocyclic amines in the Ames Salmonella assay. The mechanism for the anti-mutagenic effect was related to reduced activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin- O-deethylase further enzyme kineticexperiments, vitamins K 3 and K4behaved as competitive inhibitors of 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5- f] quinoline induced mutagenesis. The mechanism of the anti-mutagenic effect of vitamin K1was not investigated.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1592Exposure assessment Total Exposure/intake: Food Mean: 0.068 mg/ day (based on National Food Survey 2000, DEFRA, 2001). Data for 97.5th percentile not available. Supplements up to 0.20 mg/ day (Annex 4; OTC, 2001)Estimated maximum intake: 0.068 + 0.20 = 0.27 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment The data are sparse but the different forms of vitamin K are associated with different adverse effects. There are relatively few reports of human toxicity for vitamin K1(phylloquinone) and it is stated to be well tolerated in animal studies. Although there are some reports of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo , no effect was found in cells taken from babies given prophylactic intramuscular vitamin K1. The significance of the positive genotoxicity findings is uncertain. High doses of vitamin K3(menadione) may result in oxidative damage, red cell fragility and the formation of methaemoglobin. Hyperbilirubinaemia, resulting in kernicterus and toxicity to the neonatal brainoccurred in premature infants given high doses of vitamin K 3. Local hypersensitivity reactions to injections have been reported. In animal studies, vitamin K3administration has resulted in anaemia, haemoglobinaemia, urobilinuria and urobilinogenuria. High doses have also been reported to cause liverdamage. Vitamin K 3has demonstrated some mutagenic activity in the Ames test, possibly as a result of the structure of the side chain. Few data are available relating to vitamins K2 and K4. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from studies in humans or animals to establish a Safe Upper Level for vitamin K. There are clear differences in the toxicity of different forms of vitamin K. Vitamin K1(phylloquinone) the form occurring naturally in food is not associated with adverse effects at high doses in animal studies. Acute doses up to 25,000 mg/kg bw did not cause fatalities in rats, miceor chicks. Human supplementation studies in small numbers of subjects suggest that, although havingbiological activity, doses of up to 10 mg/ day for 1 month are not associated with adverse effects.Applying an uncertainty factor of 10 for inter-individual variation because of the very limited humandatabase, indicates that for guidance purposes, a daily supplementary intake of 1 mg/ day would bePart 2 Fat Soluble Vitamins2 1602unlikely to result in adverse effects. This is equivalent to 0.017 mg/kg bw in a 60 kg adult. There are insufficient data available to provide guidance on total intakes. The water soluble forms of vitamin K, particularly K3 (menadione) are more active and can be toxic at high doses in both humans and animals. Use of menadione in food supplements is therefore undesirable. References Booth, S.

Examples of compounds containing boron are borax(Na 2B4O7.10H2O) and boric acid (H3BO3). Within this risk assessment the word boron is used as a generic term for boron compounds. For comparative purposes doses of boron compounds are expressed asboron equivalents. Natural occurrence Boron is found (in the form of borates) in the oceans, rocks, coal, shale and some soils. Boronaccumulates in plants. Occurrence in foods, food supplements and medicines Boron is present in foods, particularly nuts (14 mg/kg), fresh fruits (3 mg/kg) and green vegetables(2 mg/kg). Boron is present in a number of multi-vitamin and mineral food supplements at levels up to10 mg, but not in licensed medicines in the UK. Other sources of exposure Intakes of boron from drinking water are estimated to be 0.2-0.6 mg/ day. Exposure from cosmetics andconsumer products (where boron is used as a preservative and pH adjuster) has been estimated to be upto 0.47 mg/ day. Recommended amounts COMA was unable to make specific recommendations for boron intake. The World Health Organisation(WHO) acceptable range of intake is 1-13 mg boron/ day for adults. Analysis of tissue levels and boron status The preferred methods for analysis of boron in bone and plasma are inductively coupled plasma atomicemission spectroscopy and more commonly inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Blood andurine measurements of boron are suitable indicators of excessive boron intake. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects It has been claimed that boron alleviates some symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Risk Assessment Boron 3Function Boron is an essential element in plants and is presumed to be essential in animals, since boron deprivation in both experimental animals and humans causes changes in biological function which arereversible by restoration of boron. The function of boron is unknown, but it may be involved inmetabolism and utilisation of various elements (including calcium, copper, magnesium), glucose,triglycerides, reactive oxygen and oestrogen. Deficiency Boron deficiency has not been observed definitively in human populations. However, it has beensuggested that boron deficiency could be a contributing factor to Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), amusculoskeletal deficiency, which may cause severe joint deformity. Kashin-Beck disease affectschildren in China and the former Soviet Union, and has also been linked to selenium deficiency. A cross-sectional survey in China found significantly lower boron levels in the hair of children with KBD than inthat of local children without KBD. Other authors have reported that short periods of restricted boronintake may affect brain function and cognitive performance in healthy humans. In animals, boron deficiency is associated with symptoms which include reduced growth rate and decreased blood steroid hormone levels. Interactions Studies in animals and in humans have demonstrated that boron interacts with the metabolism ofcalcium, reducing its rate of excretion and increasing serum levels, but the mechanism is uncertain. Absorption and bioavailability Boron as borate is readily, and almost completely, absorbed from the human gut. The mechanism hasnot been defined. Distribution and metabolism Boron, as borate, is distributed evenly, via passive diffusion, throughout body fluids. The highest levelsare found in bone, which possibly represents a second kinetic compartment, as elimination kinetics forbone differ from those of soft tissue and body fluids. It has been shown that boron compounds cancross the human placenta. Boron compounds are not metabolised in biological systems. Excretion Boron is predominantly excreted in the urine as borate.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1653Part 3 Trace Elements3 Toxicity Human data Data from accidental poisonings indicate that the acute, lethal dose of boric acid is 3000-6000 mg for infants and 15,000-20,000 mg for adults. Clinical effects include irritability, seizures and gastrointestinaldisturbances. There have also been reports of inflammation, congestion, oedema, exfoliative dermatitis,exfoliation of the mucosa, and findings of cloudy swelling and granular degeneration of renal tubularcells. Clinical symptoms of boron toxicity have been reported within the dose range 100 to 55,500 mgdepending on age/body weight. Inter-individual variability appears to be high. Long-term exposure to boron in animal studies has been reported to affect male fertility. However, borax miners had a non-significant excess of births compared to the general population and a non-significant excess of female births compared to males in a study of 542 occupational workers in a boraxmine (Whorton et al ., 1994). No effects on fertility were apparent in a Turkish population exposed to boron in drinking water at levels up to 29 mg/L. Supplementation studies No adverse effects were identified in female volunteers supplemented with 3 mg boron/ day for 1 year (Meacham et al ., 1994). However, 10 mg boron/ day for 4 weeks increased plasma oestradiol and testosterone levels in adult male volunteers (Naghii and Samman, 1997). Plasma oestradiol was alsoincreased in peri-menopausal women supplemented with 2.5 mg boron/ day for 60 days (Nielsen andPenland, 1999). Animal data Boron compounds have moderate acute toxicity, with lethal doses in the range 400-900 mg boronequivalents/kg body weight. Symptoms and signs include depression, ataxia, convulsions and weightloss. Damage to the kidneys and nerve cells were observed on histopathological examination. Long-term exposure to boron has been associated with reduced body weights and decreased pancreas, spleen and kidney weights. Boron has been shown to cause specific adverse effects in the male reproductive tract in all species, including shrunken scrota, inhibited spermiation and degeneration of seminiferous tubules with loss orabsence of germ cells. However, mating behaviour in the animals was unaffected. Developmentaltoxicity has been reported following administration of boron to pregnant rats and rabbits. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There is no evidence of carcinogenicity from oral exposure to boron compounds in rats and mice.Boron compounds are not mutagenic in bacterial or in vitro mammalian cell mutation assays. 1663Mechanism of toxicity Boric acid may affect DNA synthesis in germ cells and energy metabolism in Sertoli cells, possibly affecting the production of early germ cells. The mechanism by which boron inhibits spermiation isuncertain. Dose-response characterisation In humans, the lethal dose of boric acid is 3000-6000 mg for infants and 15000-20000 mg for adults.Clinical symptoms are apparent within the dose range 100 to 55500 mg depending on age/body weight. Vulnerable groups Pregnant women are a potential vulnerable group, as indicated by results of animal reproductive studies. Genetic variations No genetic variations have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Weir and Fisher, 1972 Ten Sprague Dawley rats of each sex per group were fed diets containing borax or boric acid for 90 days, at levels providing 2.6, 8.8, 26.3, 87.5 or 263 mg boron/kg bw/ day. At the highest dose 100%mortality occurred. At 87.5 mg boron kg/bw/ day, liver, kidney, spleen, testes, ovaries and body weightswere decreased. Histological changes were observed in the adrenals at 87.5 mg boron/kg bw/ day.Testicular atrophy occurred at 26.3 and 87.5 mg/kg day. Detailed results were provided for the87.5 mg/kg bw/ day dose group only. Thirty five Sprague rats/ sex/group were fed diets containing borax or boric acid for 2 years at levels providing 5.9, 17.5 and 58.5 mg boron/kg bw/ day. Growth rate was decreased, absolute andrelative testes weights were decreased and relative brain and thyroid weights were increased at the topdose. Histological changes in the testes were observed in the top dose group. No other effects wereapparent. Limited results were reported. Five beagle dogs/group were fed diets containing borax or boric acid for 90 days, at levels providing 0.44, 4.4 or 44 mg boron/kg bw/ day. In the group given the highest dose, one death occurred,histological changes in the adrenals and thyroid, and severe testicular atrophy were observed, andwhereas relative weights of thyroid and testes were reduced, those of liver and brain were increased.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1673Part 3 Trace Elements3 Four beagle dogs of each sex per group were fed diets containing borax or boric acid for 2 years, at levels providing 1.45, 2.93 and 8.75 mg boron/kg bw/ day. No treatment related effects were found.Limited results were reported in the paper. In a second study, additional groups were given 29.25 mgboron/kg bw/ day for 38 weeks. Histological changes in the testes were apparent, but (based on oneanimal) were reversible when treatment was stopped. Eight male and sixteen female Sprague Dawley rats/group were fed diets containing borax or boric acid for 14 weeks prior to mating and for 3 subsequent generations. The doses were provided 5.9, 17.5 and58.5 mg boron/kg bw/ day. No adverse effects were reported in the low and mid dose groups. The highdose animals were, however, sterile when mated with control animals. Decreased ovulation and lack ofviable sperm were apparent. Limited results were provided in the paper. Heindel et al., 1992 Feed containing boric acid at levels providing 13.6, 28.5, 57.7 mg boron/kg bw/ day was given to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats throughout gestation (an additional group received 94.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day ondays 6-25 only). Decreased body weight gain was found in the dams in the 57.7 and 94.2 mg boron/kgbw/ day dose groups and increased liver and kidney weights at 28.5 mg boron/kg bw/ day and above.Average foetal body weight/litter was reduced in the offspring of the dams in all dose groups. Pre-natalmortality was increased in the 94.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day group only. The incidence of malformedfoetuses was increased at 28.5 mg boron/kg bw/ day and above. The malformations and anatomicalvariations included enlarged lateral ventricles of the brain and shortening of rib XIII. The authors notedthat developmental toxicity was occurring at lower doses than maternal toxicity. Feed containing boric acid was given to groups of 10 pregnant Swiss mice throughout gestation. The average doses provided by the feed were 43.3, 79.0 or 175 mg boron/kg bw. Minor renal lesions werefound in the dams at all doses, and decreased body weights and increased relative kidney weights at thehighest dose.In the mice given the highest dose, the number of resorptions and malformed foetuseswas increased, and foetal body weights were reduced in offspring. The malformations and anatomicalvariations included an increased incidence of short rib XIII and a decreased incidence of rudimentary orfull ribs at lumbar 1, and were present at all dose levels. The authors argued that since the renal lesionswere minor and occurred in 2/10 mice in the low dose group compared with 8/10 and 10/10 in thehigher dose groups, that this dose level approached a NOAEL for maternal toxicity. Thus, as with the rat,developmental toxicity was occurring at lower doses than maternal toxicity. Price et al., 1996 This study is a follow up to the Heindel et al. rat study and was designed to establish a NOAEL. Groups of 60 pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats were given feed containing boric acid throughout gestation.The average doses provided in the feed were 0, 3.3, 6.4, 9.6, 13.1 or 25.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day. The onlymaternal effect observed was increased relative kidney weight at the 25.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day level.There was no effect on pre-natal mortality. Foetal body weights were reduced in the offspring of the13.1 and 25.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day groups but had recovered by birth. The incidence of short rib XIII wasincreased in foetal rats at 13.1 and 25.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day, but at 25.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day only inpups of 21 days of age. The incidence of wavy rib was also increased in foetal rats at 13.1 and 25.2 mgboron/kg bw/ day but was reversed in pups of 21 days of age. A slight decrease in the incidence of extralumbar ribs was observed at 25.2 mg boron/kg bw/ day in the day 20 foetuses. The authors concludedthat the NOAEL was 9.6 mg day effects and 13.1mg boron/kg bw/ day for 1683maternal toxicity. Developmental toxicity was noted to be occurring at lower doses than maternal toxicity. This is a well-reported study and is consistent with findings of Heindel et al . Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food mg/ up to 10 mg/ day (Annex 4)Cosmetics and consumer products up to 0.47 mg/ day Maximum estimated intake: 2.6 + 0.6 + 10 + 0.47 = 14 mg/ dayVegetarians have been identified as a potential high intake group. Risk assessment In animals, the main toxic effect associated with boron involves the reproductive system. Boron caused specific adverse effects in the male reproductive tract in rats, mice and dogs, including shrunken scrota,inhibited spermiation and degeneration of seminiferous tubules with loss or absence of germ cells.Boron also caused a reduction in ovulation in female rats and renal lesions in female mice. Boron alsocauses developmental toxicity, with foetal malformations occurring in mice and rats at levels lower thanthose associated with maternal toxicity. The human data are scarce, although a study in two Turkish populations (Sayli et al., 1998a) demonstrated that higher levels of boron in well water appeared not to affect reproduction. Similarly,Whorton et al. (1994) examined the standardised birth ratio (SBR) in US borate workers. No effects on fertility were apparent (the SBR was increased compared to the general population), a small butinsignificant excess of female births was found in both studies. Neither study investigated more sensitivemarkers of reproductive toxicity or the effects of boron on neonatal body weight, this being the limitingtoxicity in the animal studies. The human epidemiology data are negative but could be compatible with the available animal data since they involved lower exposure levels than used in the animal studies. However, limited conclusionscan be drawn from these studies due to the relative insensitivity of the end-points measured. There wasno effect on fertility, but more subtle effects on sperm quality (which could be significant in sub-fertilemen) or on other aspects of reproductive health could not be ruled out. The supplementation trial byNaghii and Samman, found that 10 mg boron/ day for 4 weeks significantly increased plasma oestradiolExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1693Part 3 Trace Elements3 levels in male volunteers. The clinical significance of the increase is uncertain. The study is of interest, but limited due to the small numbers involved and the lack of follow up. Other studies have notdemonstrated this effect but lower doses of boron were used. Boron has also been reported toenhance the effects of oestrogen in post-menopausal women taking oestrogen therapy. Further workon the effects of boron on the endocrine system is therefore desirable. ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL Key Study: Price et al. (1996). NOAEL: 9.6 mg boron/kg bw/ day.Uncertainty 10 for inter-species variation x 6 for inter-individual variation Factor: in humans = 60 Safe Upper Level for 9.6/60 = 0.16 mg boron/kg bw/ day (equivalent to daily consumption 9.6 mg boron/ day for a 60 kg adult).over a lifetime: The key adverse effect associated with boron is reproductive toxicity. However, the human data are limited regarding reproductive toxicity and so the SUL is based on animal studies. Reproductive toxicityis apparent in laboratory animals, with characteristic effects being produced in the testes. A clear dose-response relationship has been demonstrated. The NOAELs for reproductive effects are 4.4 mgboron/kg bw/ day in dogs and 9.6 mg boron/kg bw/ day in rodents. Similar effects are observed indifferent animal species. A Safe Upper Level can be derived from animal data with the appropriate use of uncertainty factors. Although the Weir and Fisher study resulted in the lower NOAEL of 4.4 mg/kg bw/ day, the number ofanimals in this study was low and the differences between the dose levels tested were large, so that thelowest dose at which adverse effects were observed was ten times this level. Considering the totality ofthe data, the highest intake without significant adverse effects (the NOAEL) is 9.6 mg/kg bw/ day, basedon the study of Price et al . (1996) and so this has been used to establish an SUL. The usual uncertainty factor of 10 for differences between animals and humans was used to allow for the known differencesin renal clearance of boron between animals and humans, and to allow for the possibility that humantissues may be inherently more sensitive than rat tissues. The factor of 10 for inter-individual variabilityin humans was revised to a chemical-specific adjustment factor of 6 as proposed by Dourson et al. (1998). This comprises a factor of 1.8 to allow for glomerular filtration in some women being 2 standarddeviations below the average, and a factor of 3.1 to allow for possible, but undefined, inter-subjectvariability in tissue sensitivity. Pregnant women are a potential vulnerable group given the effects ofboron on foetal weights. However, the critical animal studies cover this endpoint and there appears tobe no need for an additional uncertainty factor. This results in a safe upper level for total intake of9.6 mg boron/ day for a 60 kg adult. This is higher than the present maximum UK intake from food,water and consumer products (estimated to be up to 3.7 mg boron/ day), suggesting a margin of6 mg/ day for supplemental intake. 1703References Dourson, M., Maier, A., Meek, B., Renwick, A., Ohanian, E., Poirier, K.

Biologically, trivalent (III) and hexavalent (VI) chromium are mostimportant. Within this risk assessment the word chromium refers to ionic chromium except wherespecific chromium compounds are mentioned. Natural occurrence Trivalent chromium is ubiquitous in nature, occurring in air, water, soil and biological materials.Hexavalent chromium compounds are man-made and do not occur naturally in the environment. Occurrence in foods, food supplements and medicines Chromium in foods or supplements is in the trivalent form. Processed meats (0.23 mg/kg), whole grainproducts (bread and miscellaneous cereals 0.13-0.14 mg/kg), pulses and spices are the better sources ofchromium, but chromium levels are low in staple foods. Chromium is not contained in any licensed medicines, but is present (together with other nutrients) in a number of supplements that may only be sold under the supervision of a pharmacist, for use inmalabsorptive states, conditions leading to hypoproteinaemia and perioperative nutritional support, atlevels up to 0.2 mg. It is also present in a number of multivitamin and mineral food supplements atlevels up to 0.6 mg. Recommended amounts COMA has set no RNIs but suggested that an adequate level of intake for trivalent chromium lies above0.025 mg/ day for adults and between 0.0001 and 0.001 mg/kg/ day for children and adolescents(COMA, 1991). COMA also noted that no adverse effects were observed at intakes of 1000 - 2000mg/ day trivalent chromium. The US National Research Council (NRC) specify an Estimated Safe andAdequate Daily Dietary Intake (ESADDI) of 0.05 - 0.2 mg/ day for adults and 0.01 - 0.04 mg/ day forinfants (0 - 0.5 years). Analysis of tissue levels and chromium status Plasma or serum levels reflect trivalent chromium intake, but chromium tissue stores do not rapidlyequilibrate with blood chromium, so fasting plasma or serum concentrations may not be an indicationof chromium status. Elevated serum chromium may be a good indicator of excessive exposure tochromium.Risk Assessment Chromium 3Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Beneficial effects of trivalent chromium on adult-onset type II diabetes mellitus and glucose tolerance have been claimed. Increased lean body mass and decreased total body fat have been attributed totrivalent chromium and chromium compounds have been used to enhance weight loss. Function Trivalent chromium has been shown to potentiate insulin action and thereby influences carbohydrate,lipid and protein metabolism. Deficiency In humans, deficiency has only been observed in patients on long-term parenteral nutrition. Thesymptoms observed were impaired glucose tolerance and glucose utilisation, weight loss, neuropathy,elevated plasma fatty acids, depressed respiratory quotient and abnormalities in nitrogen metabolism. Interactions Chromium interacts with iron by affecting its binding to transferrin, and has been shown to impair ironmetabolism and storage. Absorption and bioavailability Intestinal absorption of trivalent chromium is low (0.5 - 2.0%). The mechanism of absorption has notbeen clearly defined, but it appears to involve processes other than passive diffusion. Chromiumpicolinate is absorbed more effectively than other forms of trivalent chromium. Distribution and metabolism Absorbed trivalent chromium does not enter blood cells, but binds to plasma proteins such astransferrin and is transported to the liver. In contrast, hexavalent chromium does penetrate red bloodcells, where it is reduced by glutathione to trivalent chromium, which binds to haemoglobin. Excesshexavalent chromium is taken up into the kidneys, spleen, liver, lungs and bone. Excretion Ingested trivalent chromium remains largely unabsorbed and is excreted via the faeces. Absorbedchromium is mainly excreted via urine, with only small amounts being eliminated in perspirationand bile.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1733Part 3 Trace Elements3 Toxicity Human toxicity Data on the acute effects of oral exposure to chromium are available from two case reports on accidental or intentional ingestion of chromium at levels of 7.5 mg/kg bw (as hexavalent dichromate)and 4.1 mg/kg bw acid) respectively. Death was preceded by gastrointestinalhaemorrhage and severe kidney and liver damage.Haematological effects have also been reported inindividuals consuming sublethal doses. Ingestion of basic chromium sulphate (trivalent) (48 g in 400 mL,equivalent to 800 mg/kg) caused death by cardiogenic and renal shock, pancreatitis, haemorrhage andgut mucosal necrosis. Chronic exposure to hexavalent chromium is reported to induce renal failure, anaemia, haemolysis and liver failure. Anaemia, haemolysis and liver and renal dysfunction have also been reported in casestudies describing chronic exposure to trivalent chromium, but where follow up was reported, thesewere reversible, and parameters had returned to normal in one year. Supplementation studies Trivalent chromium (usually in the form of picolinate) has been investigated in a number of human supplementation studies. The studies have investigated the effects of chromium on a variety of endpoints ranging from serum chromium to DNA damage. Doses of up to 1 mg/ day chromium have beenused, for periods up to 64 weeks. No adverse effects were observed, although in many of the studies itis unclear whether such effects were investigated. Animal data The available data are limited, but oral exposure to trivalent chromium and hexavalent chromiumcompounds has resulted in adverse gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, immunological, neurological,developmental and reproductive effects. Trivalent chromium compounds are less toxic than hexavalent chromium compounds, with chronic intakes of up to 750 mg/kg bw/ day not being associated with adverse effects. Doses of 14 mg/kgbw/ day hexavalent chromium for 3 weeks resulted in decreased body weights. Both forms of chromium have been reported to reduce fertility, foetal weight, and crown length and increase post-implantation losses in mice. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There is no clear evidence of carcinogenicity where chromium has been tested in rats via the oral route.No data are available relating to the mutagenicity in vivo of oral exposure to trivalent chromium. In general, in vitro mutagenicity tests have yielded positive results for hexavalent chromium, and negative results for trivalent. However, two studies in mammalian cells have shown that chromiumpicolinate (a form of trivalent chromium) may cause DNA damage. The authors of one study proposedthat the picolonate moiety was responsible for the activity. However, the authors of another study 1743proposed a mechanism involving reduction to chromium II and production of hydroxyl radicals. Chromium nicotinate and chromium III chloride were also investigated in one of these studies and didnot damage DNA. The significance of these observations is unclear and no in vivo genotoxicity data are available. Mechanism of toxicity Chromium (VI) induces oxidative stress in vivo . Dose-response characterisation No data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Wasser and Feldman, 1997 This was a clinical report of renal failure in a patient taking supplements of 0.6 mg chromium picolinate (trivalent) daily for six weeks to aid weight loss. It is reported that tests had shown normal renalfunction 2 years previously. Findings from a renal biopsy supported a diagnosis of nephrotoxicity, whichthe authors attributed to ingestion of chromium. Cerulli et al., 1998 This was a clinical report of observation of a single patient after ingestion of 1.2 - 2.4 mg/ day chromium picolinate for 4 - 5 months. She presented with weight loss, anaemia, haemolysis, liver dysfunction andrenal failure. In addition to her intake of over-the-counter chromium supplements, the patient wasreceiving medication for schizophrenia and depression, but this medication was not believed to berelated to the symptoms presented.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1753Part 3 Trace Elements3 Jeejeebhoy, 1999 This was a review paper describing the results of 19 randomised controlled human supplementation trials, in which individuals received between 0.175 and 1 mg trivalent chromium/ day for durations ofbetween 6 and 64 weeks. No evidence of toxic effects was identified. Studies considered in thereview include: Anderson et al., 1985 In a double-blind crossover study, 76 adult subjects were given 0.2 mg/ day chromic chloride (trivalent) or placebo for three months. Mean basal serum chromium increased significantly from 0.13 /H11006 0.02 (SE) ng/mL to 0.38 /H110060.02 (SE) ng/mL. This was primarily a study of efficacy and did not report any adverse effects. Roeback et al., 1991 In a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, 63 male patients, prescribed beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension, were given 0.6 mg/ day trivalent chromium or placebo for 8 weeks.A low number of side effects were reported, including mild gastrointestinal symptoms and decreasedappetite; however, these were of similar low frequency in both treated and control groups. Abraham et al., 1992 In a randomised clinical trial, 76 patients with atherosclerotic disease were given 0.15 mg/ day chromium chloride or placebo for a period of 7 to 16 months. Mean serum chromium levels were significantlyincreased from 2.69 nmol/L to 12.12 nmol/L. Clinical chemistry indicated no adverse effects on liver orrenal function and there were no haematological abnormalities. The authors reported that bothplacebo and chromium supplement were well tolerated and that patients reported no adverse effects. Campbell et al., 1999 In a randomised, double-blind study, 23 men aged 50-75 years were given 0.924 mg/ day chromium (as picolinate) or placebo for a period of 12 weeks, during which time the subjects participated in aresistance training programme. Five subjects did not complete the study due to reasons unrelated tochromium or placebo treatment (injury, aggravation of injuries, family commitments). The authors didnot report any treatment- or placebo-related effects, but this was primarily a study of efficacy. Animal data Ivankovic & Preussman, 1975 This was a chronic toxicity/ carcinogenicity study, in which trivalent chromium (as chromic oxide) was incorporated into diet at 0, 1, 2, or 5 % (equivalent to 150, 300 or 750 mg chromium/kg bw/ day). Thecompound was baked into bread and fed to rats 5 out of 7 days per week for 840 days (a total of 600feeds). At the weekends a control diet and a vegetable supplement were given. No adverse effects wereobserved at any dose level. In a preliminary 90-day study using the same dosing regime, a decrease inorgan weights was apparent at the top dose. No statistical analysis was given and the findings were notfollowed up . Although samples were taken for histological analysis in the main study, the results are not reported. On the basis of this study, it can be concluded that chromic oxide is not carcinogenic, orovertly toxic. 1763Anderson et al., 1997 Trivalent chromium was given to rats in the diet. A lack of toxicity was demonstrated at levels up to 100 mg chromium per kg of diet as chromium chloride or picolinate for 24 weeks. Assuming a dietaryintake of 15 g and a 100 g rat, the intake in the 100 g chromium per kg diet would be 1.5 mg/ day or15 mg/kg bw/ day. The animals receiving chromium picolinate had significantly higher renal and hepaticchromium, indicating higher absorption of this compound. There were no histological changes in theliver and kidneys but other organs were not examined histologically. Reproductive toxicity Elbetieha & Al-Hamood, 1997 Reproductive toxicity was assessed after exposure of sexually mature male and female mice to trivalent (and hexavalent) chromium in drinking water for 12 weeks. Females received approximately 500 or1250 mg/kg bw/ day and the males, approximately mg/kg bw/ day trivalent chromium (aschromium chloride). Reduced by number of pregnant females, viable foetuses andresorptions) was apparent in male mice at the highest dose. In females, exposure to trivalent chromiumresulted in a decreased number of implantation sites and viable foetuses at both doses. A parallel studywas used to assess organ weights at doses of 500 and 1250 mg/kg bw/ day trivalent chromium. In males,bodyweights were significantly reduced and testes weights increased at both doses. Seminal vesicleweights were decreased at the top dose. Female mice were tested only at 120 mg/kg bw/ day, whichresulted in increased ovarian weight and decreased uterine weight. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 0.10 mg/ day 97.5th percentile: (1997 TDS) Water up to 0.002 mg/ day (estimated intake from 2 litres of water containing /H110210.001 mg/L) Supplements up to 0.6 mg/ day (Annex 4)Maximum estimated intake: 0.17 + 0.002 + 0.6 = 0.77 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1773Part 3 Trace Elements3 Risk assessment The data on oral chromium toxicity are limited. However, it is apparent that the toxicity of chromium varies depending on the valency state, with hexavalent (VI) chromium, being generally more toxic thantrivalent (III) chromium. This risk assessment concentrates on the evaluation of trivalent chromium asthis is the form found in food and dietary supplements. Ingested trivalent chromium has a low level of toxicity, due partly to its poor absorption. Chromic acid at chronic doses of up to 750 mg chromium/kg bw/ day given in food to adult animals for periods of upto 24 weeks was not associated with adverse effects. Absorption was not demonstrated in this study.Chromium picolinate and chromium chloride were not associated with adverse effects at doses of15 mg chromium/kg bw/ day. Increased levels of tissue chromium indicated that absorption hadoccurred. Higher doses of chromium (approximately 100 mg/kg bw/ day) are associated withreproductive and developmental effects, although these may be secondary to parental toxicity. In general, hexavalent chromium has given positive results in in vitro mutagenicity tests, whereas trivalent chromium compounds have been negative. However, chromium picolinate, a syntheticchromium compound with a higher solubility and lipophilicity than other trivalent chromiumcompounds, has caused DNA damage in mammalian cells. The significance of these observations isunclear and no in vivo genotoxicity data are available. Limited data from human supplementation studies have indicated that doses up to 1 mg/ day of trivalent chromium compounds in general were not associated with adverse effects, although it is unclear whatadverse effects were evaluated. The human studies were conducted in a variety of small groups andinvestigated a range of different endpoints, so limited conclusions may be drawn from these. Two casereports associating chromium picolinate with renal failure exist but the significance of these is uncertain. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL Overall, there are insufficient data from human or animal studies to derive a Safe Upper Level forchromium, although the oral toxicity of poorly absorbed trivalent chromium appears to be low. There are few available data on chromium (III) toxicity in humans by the oral route. Acute chromium toxicity is associated with vomiting, diarrhoea, haemorrhage and blood loss into the gastrointestinaltract resulting in cardiovascular shock. The available animal data are also limited but adversegastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, immunological, neurological, developmental and reproductive effectshave been reported. The study by Anderson et al . (1997) indicated that 15 mg/kg bw/ day chromium (as chromium chloride) was not associated with adverse effects in the rat. Based on this study, and allowing uncertainty factorsof 10 for inter-species variation and 10 for inter-individual variation, a total daily intake of about0.15 mg/kg bw/ day (or 10 mg/person) would be expected to be without adverse health effects. Thisvalue can be used for guidance purposes and applies to trivalent chromium only. Chromium picolinate isalso excluded from this guidance. Unlike other forms of trivalent chromium, chromium picolinate wasshown to cause DNA damage in mammalian cells in vitro . Additionally, two case reports have associated renal failure with the use of chromium picolinate supplements. The significance of such results isunclear but may be due to the higher solubility and lipophilicity of chromium picolinate than othertrivalent chromium compounds, which enable it to be readily absorbed and able to pass through 1783membranes and enter cells. Further research is therefore needed to investigate the safety of this compound. References Abraham, A.S., Brooks, B.A. and Eylath, U.

Within this risk assessment the word cobalt refers to ionic cobalt except where specific cobalt compounds are mentioned. Natural occurrence Cobalt is widely distributed in the environment, accounting for 0.001% of the earth's crust. It formsbivalent and trivalent compounds, those of biological interest being bivalent. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines High concentrations of cobalt are found in fish (0.01 mg/kg), nuts (0.09 mg/kg), green leafy vegetables(0.009 mg/kg) and fresh cereals (0.01 mg/kg), and most of the cobalt ingested is inorganic. The meanpopulation intake of cobalt is 0.012 mg/ day. There is no evidence of cobalt being used in foodsupplements. However, cobalt (as the sulphate) is included in some multi-constituent licensedmedicines, at a maximum daily dose of 0.25 mg. Other sources of exposure Atmospheric concentrations of cobalt are usually around 1 ng/m3, but levels up to 10 ng/m3have been reported in heavily industrialised cities. Occupational exposure to cobalt occurs mainly by inhalation.Uncontaminated samples of fresh water contain concentrations of cobalt ranging from 0.001 to0.010 mg/L. Recommended amounts Recommended intakes of cobalt have not been set as the only form of cobalt required by the body isvitamin B 12, of which cobalt is an integral part. In the UK, COMA has set a RNI value for vitamin B12 of 1.5/H9262g/ day (equivalent to 0.006 /H9262g cobalt) for adults, including pregnant women (COMA, 1991). This amount is considered adequate not only to reduce the risk of megaloblastic anaemia in normalindividuals, but also to provide sufficient stores to withstand a period without intake. During lactation,an increment of 0.5 /H9262g vitamin B 12/ day is recommended. For infants, the RNI for vitamin B12is 0.3 /H9262g/ day. Analysis of tissue levels and cobalt status Cobalt can be measured in whole blood, serum and various tissues. There are no recognised markers or indicators of cobalt status.Risk Assessment Cobalt 3Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects No suggested non-nutritional beneficial effects have been identified. Function Cobalt is an essential trace element being an integral part of vitamin B12, which is essential for folate and fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency Although cobalt is an essential trace element, cobalt deficiency has not been reported in humans.A wasting disease in cattle, of which a key feature is anaemia, has been demonstrated to be due tocobalt deficiency in pastures. Interactions No compounds that interact with cobalt have been identified. Absorption and bioavailability The extent of gastrointestinal absorption of cobalt depends upon the dose, with very low doses being almost completely absorbed, whereas larger doses are less well absorbed. Nutritional factors also influence absorption, for example, absorption is reduced by amino acids, and increased in iron deficiency. Distribution and metabolism In human autopsy studies, the liver (the organ where vitamin B12is stored) contains the highest concentration of cobalt (approximately 20% of the total body content). In the human body there is noevidence of accumulation of cobalt with age. Excretion Cobalt is mainly excreted in the urine but also in the faeces. Independent of the route of exposure,most cobalt is eliminated rapidly, with a small proportion being eliminated slowly and having a half-lifeof the order of years.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1813Part 3 Trace Elements3 Toxicity Human data Cardiomyopathy was reported in heavy beer drinkers in the 1960s as a result of the use of cobalt chloride as a foam stabiliser, present in beer at concentrations of 1 - 1.5 ppm. Ethanol and cobalt havean additive effect, reducing blood flow to the heart and thus causing anoxia and damage to the heartmuscle. Animal studies indicate that protein (particularly tryptophan , DL-methionine and L-cysteine) deficiency is a risk factor for cobalt toxicity. Few other data on human toxicity are available where exposure is by ingestion. The majority of the available papers refer to reports from case studies. For example, Carson et al. (1986) reported cases of acute effects following ingestion of excess amounts of cobalt salts (30 mg/ day) for the treatment ofanaemias, including gastrointestinal upset, skin rashes and hot flushes. Features of chronic toxicityinclude effects on the heart, thyroid and possibly the kidney (Carson et al. , 1986). Patients receiving 0.17 - 3.9 mg cobalt/kg bw/ day (equivalent to 10 - 234 mg in a 60 kg adult) for 6 days to 8 months, usuallyto treat anaemia, showed a 20 - 90 % depression in iodine uptake, resulting in goitre and classic signs ofhypothyroidism. Animal data Animal studies have shown that cobalt accumulates in the myocardium and causes myocytolysis.Detrimental effects on sperm production and fertility have been observed in rats. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No carcinogenicity data are available following exposure by the oral route. Mixed results were obtainedwith cobalt compounds in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests. Mechanisms of toxicity No relevant data have been identified. Dose response characterisation There are insufficient data to establish a dose response relationship. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variation No genetic variations have been identified 1823Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Human data Seghizzi et al., 1994 A review of the literature from the 1960s described endemics of cardiomyopathy with mortality rates of up to 50 % in heavy consumers of cobalt-fortified beer (containing cobalt concentrations of 1 - 1.5ppm). The intake of cobalt in such consumers was estimated to be 6 - 8 mg daily. Dietary proteindeficiency may be an important factor in cobalt induced cardiomyopathy, and zinc and magnesiumdeficiency may also play a part. Animal data Pedigo et al., 1988 Cobalt chloride was administered to groups of 10 mice in drinking water providing 23, 42 or 72 mg cobalt/kg bw/ day for up to 13 weeks. The highest dose level resulted in a dose- and time-dependentdecrease in testicular weight and decreased epididymal sperm concentration, along with decreases inboth motility and percent motile forms of sperm. Fertility was decreased at week 13. There was a dose-dependent decrease in testicular weights (as a ratio to body weight), whilst serum testosterone levelswere increased 5 to 7 fold at all dose levels. Paternain et al., 1988 Cobalt chloride (25, 50 or 100 mg cobalt/kg bw/ day) was administered to mice on days 6 to 15 of gestation by oral gavage. An increase in stunted foetus/litter rates was observed at 50 and 100 mgcobalt/kg bw/ day, although this was not statistically significant. The number of corpora lutea, implants,resorptions, live and dead foetuses and sex distribution were unaffected by treatment. Maternal toxicity(decreased weight gain and food consumption) was seen at all dose levels. An erythropoietic effect wasapparent in the top dose group. Anderson et al., 1992 Cobalt chloride administered to groups of 10 mice in drinking water providing 72 mg cobalt/kg bw/ day for a thirteen week period, resulted in seminiferous tubule degeneration. Groups of mice wereevaluated at 7, 9, 11 and 13 weeks treatment. Initial changes involved vacuolation of Sertoli cells andformation of abnormal spermatid nuclei, followed by the presence of multi-nucleated cells and thesloughing off of cells. Continued degeneration resulted in shrinkage of tubules and the accumulation ofsome calcified necrotic debris. Groups of mice were allowed to recover for 20 weeks after thetreatment period. Repopulation of the tubules was observed in a few animals only.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1833Part 3 Trace Elements3 Cardiovascular effects In addition to the above papers, consideration was given to the studies of Morvai et al. and Sandusky et al.which provided evidence of cardiovascular effects of cobalt from animal models, substantiating the observations that have been made in humans. Sandusky et al., 1981 Groups of dogs were maintained on normal diet or protein and thiamine deficient diet and received 500 mg of cobalt chloride twice weekly by intravenous infusion. Dyspnoea and exercise intolerance wasobserved in all the dosed animals and tachycardia in those maintained on protein and thiaminedeficient diet. Morvai et al., 1993 Administration of cobalt chloride (50 mg cobalt/kg bw/ day) by oral gavage to rats for 3 weeks, caused incipient multifocal myocytolysis and a significant decrease in blood pressure and the blood flow to theheart. Alcohol accentuated the effect of cobalt on blood flow. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food 0.02 mg/ day (Estimated from IARC 1991 - range in water 0.001 - 0.01 mg/L and consumption of 2 L/ day) Supplements 0 (present only as B12) (Annex 4) Estimated maximum intake: 0.019 + 0.02 = 0.039 mg/ day No potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment Cardiomyopathy was reported in heavy beer drinkers in the 1960s as a result of the use of cobalt chloride as a foam stabiliser. Cobalt without alcohol caused damage to the heart muscle, whilst bothalcohol and cobalt reduced blood flow (cobalt significantly so), the combination having an additiveeffect. It has been suggested that the anoxia caused by the combination of alcohol and cobaltexacerbates the cardiotoxic effects of cobalt. Protein deficiency also appears to be a risk factor. Sincecobalt chloride is no longer used as an additive in beer, no further cases have been reported. Althoughthis condition was related to oral cobalt, a combination of exposures is necessary. 1843Few other human data are available. Case reports suggest that acute intakes of /H1102230 mg/ day cobalt may cause gastrointestinal upset, skin rashes and hot flushes. Chronic cobalt intakes of 0.17 - 0.39 mg/kg(10.2 - 23.4 mg total in a 60 kg adult) may depress iodine uptake. The cardiotoxic effects of cobalt can also be reproduced in animals. Other adverse effects related to cobalt include degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and subsequently decreased fertility. There areno data available to establish whether this effect also occurs in humans. It is therefore prudent toassume that it could. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data to set a Safe Upper Level for cobalt. There is no evidence of cobalt beingused in food supplements, however, cobalt (as the sulphate) may be included in some multi-constituentlicensed medicines, at a maximum daily dose of 0.25 mg. In case reports cobalt is described to cause decreased iodine uptake in man (. 10 mg) or acute effects such as gastrointestinal upset and skin rashes in man (reported with intakes of 30 mg/ day). Cobalt is known to have adverse effects on the heart in both animals and man. In man, cardiomyopathy occurred in heavy consumers of beer containing cobalt chloride as an additive providing a cobalt intakeof 6.8 mg/ day. The combined effect of alcohol and cobalt and possibly protein deficiency was probablynecessary to cause this condition. Cobalt chloride is no longer used for this purpose. In laboratory animals, cobalt is associated with adverse effects on spermatogenesis and, ultimately, fertility. Doses of 23 mg cobalt/kg bw/ day caused minor testicular effects, the severity of the effectthen increasing in a dose related manner.This is the lowest dose at which toxic effects have beenobserved in animals.It is not known whether the effects on spermatogenesis and fertility also occur inhumans exposed to cobalt but it would be prudent to assume that they do. If the conventionaluncertainty factors were to be applied (10 for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation x 10 for inter-speciesvariation x 10 for inter-individual variation = 1000) for guidance purposes only, an intake of 0.023 mg/kgtotal cobalt would not be expected to result in any adverse effects. This is equivalent to 1.4 mg/ day in a60 kg adult. This level is lower than the doses causing decreased iodine uptake or acute effects inhumans, and below the level associated with cardiomyopathy in beer drinkers (see above). It is alsosubstantially higher than the present daily intake of cobalt in the UK (estimated to be approximately0.030 mg from food and water).Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1853Part 3 Trace Elements3 References Anderson, M.B., Pedigo, N.G., Katz, R.P., George, W.J.

The Science of the Total Environment 150, 105-109. 1863Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 187General Information Chemistry Copper has two valency states, cuprous (copper I) and cupric (copper II). It occurs in nature mainly in the form of its oxide, Cu2O and sometimes as the chloride, CuCl2which, in the presence of humidity and oxygen, is oxidised to the basic copper (II) chloride, Cu(OH)Cl. The most important coppercompounds in the chloride, cuprous nitrate and cupric sulphate. Withinthis risk assessment the word copper refers to ionic copper, except when specific copper compoundsare mentioned. Natural occurrence. Copper is found in a wide variety of mineral salts and organic compounds as well as in the metallic form. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Food is the major source of copper intake, with particularly high concentrations being found in nuts(8 mg/kg), shellfish and offal (40 mg/kg). Copper is present in mineral and multivitamin plus mineral dietary supplements at doses up to 2 mg/ day. Licensed medicines may be obtained under the supervision of a pharmacist as Pharmacy(P) medicines, with a maximum recommended dose of 4 mg, or from various retail outlets as GeneralSales List (GSL) products, with a maximum recommended daily dose of 1 mg. Other sources of exposure Other sources of copper exposure include emissions from mines, smelters and foundries. Environmentalcopper can also arise from the burning of coal for power generation and from municipal wasteincinerators. However, the contribution of airborne copper to total daily intake is negligible. Copper isalso used as an anti-fouling agent for boats. Buffered copper sulphate can be used as a pesticide inorganic farming. High concentrations of copper can be dissolved from copper plumbing, depending on the hardness, pH and quality of the water. Dissolved copper levels are higher in acidic waters, especially where pipe runsare long and water can stagnate. Thus, drinking water can make an important contribution to copperintake in some circumstances (the UK standard is 3 mg/L, based on aesthetic considerations).However,levels in UK water are generally less than 1 mg/L.Risk Assessment Copper 3Recommended amounts COMA has set a RNI of 1.2 mg/ day for copper (COMA, 1991). The US safe designation for adults is 1.5-3.0 mg/ day. Analysis of tissue levels and copper status Present analytical methods lack sensitivity, particularly for marginal copper deficiency. The use oferythrocyte copper-zinc superoxide dismutase activity as a measure of copper status is underinvestigation. Tissue copper measurements considered to be of use are serum copper, caeruloplasmin,urinary copper and hair copper all of which are depressed in frankly copper-deficient subjects. Plasmacopper levels may be raised in pregnancy, infection and inflammation. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Copper supplements are generally only used to correct copper deficiency.Benefits have been claimedfor copper-containing supplements as anti-oxidants for general use, and specifically for arthritis andosteoporosis. There is speculation that copper might have a role in preventing age-related decline intissue function, and possibly in ensuring healthy foetal brain development. Function Copper is an essential micronutrient normally subject to effective homeostatic control. It is involved inthe function of several enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase, amino acid oxidase, superoxidedismutase and monoamine oxidase. Copper is thought to be required for infant growth, host defencemechanisms, bone strength, red and white cell maturation, iron transport, cholesterol and glucosemetabolism, myocardial contractility and brain development. Deficiency Copper deficiency may result from an inherited defect, such as Menke's syndrome, or may be anacquired condition. Common clinical features include anaemia, neutropenia and bone abnormalities.Less frequent signs and symptoms include hypopigmentation of the hair, hypotonia, impaired growth,increased susceptibility to infection, abnormalities in metabolism of glucose and cholesterol andcardiovascular changes. Interactions Various dietary components affect the absorption of copper.For example, absorption is higher from adiet high in animal protein compared with plant protein. Milk proteins have varying effects on copperstatus, with whey protein having a negative effect on copper absorption. High dietary ascorbic acid hasbeen suggested to reduce intestinal absorption of copper, but it also increases hepatic uptake andbiliary excretion of copper.Studies in rats have shown that dietary fructose exacerbates the effects ofcopper deficiency, by elevating faecal and urinary excretion of copper, but this has not beendemonstrated in humans. Other animal studies suggest that when copper status is low, copperabsorption is affected by high concentrations of iron, and to a greater extent when high concentrationascorbic acid is also present.Part 3 Trace Elements3 1883Zinc and copper may interact, with high concentrations of one element inhibiting the absorption of the other. Absorption and bioavailability Copper is mainly absorbed in the duodenum bound to specific proteins as Cu(II). Both passive diffusionand carrier mediated transfer occur. A small amount of copper is absorbed from the stomach.Absorption of copper is decreased when copper ingestion is high. Cellular mechanisms such asinduction of metallothionein, which sequesters copper, have also been suggested to be part of thishomeostatic process. Infants are apparently unable to absorb copper to the same extent as adults, andare often found to be in negative copper balance. Distribution and metabolism Copper distribution occurs in two phases, via specific carrier proteins, first to the liver and then to otherbody tissues. On leaving intestinal cells, copper is initially bound predominantly to albumin andtranscuprein and transported mainly to the liver hepatocytes, where it is incorporated intocaeruloplasmin (the major form for transport to other tissues), excreted into the bile or incorporatedinto superoxide dismutase (SOD). Absorbed copper is incorporated into 3 main fractions in the livercytosol; a high molecular weight pool, a 30,000 kDa pool (which appears to be SOD), and a 10,000 kDapool (mainly composed of metallothionein). Copper binds to a range of unidentified components ofboth high and low molecular weight, but none of these has yet been related to the copper complexesidentified in the liver. Excretion Homeostasis of copper is maintained largely by the rate of excretion. The major route of copperexcretion is via the bile, which is directly correlated with absorbed dose. Toxicity Human data Acute copper toxicity is rare, but can occur as a result of food or beverage contamination. However, theemetic properties and unpleasant taste of copper salts prevent their frequent accidental or deliberateingestion. Signs of acute copper toxicity include salivation, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting anddiarrhoea. Individual susceptibility varies, but vomiting has been associated with consumption ofbeverages contaminated with copper ranging from 25 to 840 mg/L. Intakes of 25 - 75 mg copper havebeen quoted as emetic doses but lower intakes have resulted in the same symptoms when taken on anempty stomach. Ingestion of /H11091100 g copper sulphate may produce intravascular haemolysis, acute hepatic failure, acute tubular renal failure, shock, coma or death. Few data are available on chronic copper toxicity in humans.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1893Part 3 Trace Elements3 Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) is a fatal disorder associated with accumulation of massive levels of copper in the liver. Although ICC has been attributed to boiling and storing milk in copper and brassvessels, thus elevating copper content, there also appears to be an element of genetic predisposition inmany cases of ICC. Isolated cases of idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT), identical in nature to ICC, havealso been reported in non-Indian communities in the US and Europe. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism, which is normally manifest in late childhood. There is a failure of normal copper excretion into the bile and ofincorporation into caeruloplasmin. As a result, copper accumulates and causes toxicity, primarily in theliver and brain.Clinical manifestations may include liver disease, and neurological and psychiatricdisturbances. Increased copper levels in adults with untreated Wilson's disease, or in children who have recovered from ICC, have been associated with a possible increased incidence of hepatoma. High copper levelshave also been cited as a possible risk factor for heart disease. In the normal population, there is no evidence that elevated copper intake is associated with cancer incidence. Supplementation studies Few adverse effects have been reported in human supplementation studies where copper has been given in food or as a tablet. For example, in a study in which 10 mg/ day was given for 12 weeks nochanges in serum enzyme activities was apparent. However in other studies enzyme activities increasedin subjects with lower than median copper status. In studies of copper given in solution, increasedincidences of vomiting, diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported. Animal data Toxicity is highly species dependent. For example, while pigs and rats are relatively tolerant, sheepdevelop copper toxicosis at low dietary intakes of copper. Repeat dose studies in rats and mice have demonstrated lesions in the forestomach (attributable to irritation). Liver and kidney toxicity, anaemia, and changes in systolic blood pressure and enzyme activityhave also been reported in rats. Hepatic failure has been demonstrated in rabbits receiving 10 mg/kg copper sulphate by gavage for 33-440 days. Limited effects on reproduction in rats have also have been reported. These include changes to the reproductive organs and growth retardation in the offspring.At higher doses, developmentalabnormalities have been observed. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat is a rodent model of Wilson's disease, characterised bycaeruloplasmin deficiency, hepatic copper accumulation, and hepatocellular injury ultimately resulting inhepatocellular carcinoma. 1903Copper compounds were negative in the majority of bacterial mutation assays reported. Chromosomal aberrations have been produced in isolated rat hepatocytes incubated with copper sulphate. Mechanisms of toxicity The liver mitochondrion appears to be an important target in copper hepatotoxicity, and oxidativedamage may be involved in its pathogenesis. Dose response characterisation In humans, mild gastrointestinal effects have been reported following consumption of water containing3 mg copper/L, probably due to the irritant effect of copper in solution. Metabolic andsupplementation studies suggest that dietary doses of 7-10 mg copper/ day do not result in adverseeffects. In laboratory animals, forestomach lesions were seen in rats given feed containing 2000 mg/kg or greater copper sulphate for 13 weeks (equivalent to 32 mg copper/kg bw/ day in male rats and 46 mgcopper/kg bw/ day in female rats). In mice the lesion occurred in animals given 4000 mg/kg bw/ day(equivalent to 184 mg copper/kg bw/ day in male mice and 262 mg copper/kg bw/ day in female mice).In the same study, liver toxicity in rats was observed at doses of 65-67 mg/kg bw/ day copper (and inone male receiving 32 mg/kg bw/ day) and kidney toxicity and anaemia was observed in rats at doses of32-34 mg copper/kg bw/ day. Other effects such as changes in blood pressure and enzyme activitieshave been reported at lower doses. Effects on the reproductive organs of rats have been observed atdoses /H1109145 mg copper/kg bw/ day. Adverse effects on foetal development in rats and mice occur at doses of 65-80 mg copper/kg bw/ day, with foetal abnormalities in mice being observed at 159 mgcopper/kg bw/ day. Vulnerable groups Haemodialysis patients and subjects with chronic liver disease are potentially sensitive to copper excess.See also 'Genetic variations' below. Children may be at increased risk of copper toxicity due to a combination of efficient uptake and immature biliary excretion. However, copper is accumulated in the third trimester of pregnancy withoutapparent adverse effect, suggesting that neonates may be resistant to high levels of hepatic copper. Genetic variations Subjects with Wilson's Disease and, possibly, ICC are sensitive to excess copper intake.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1913Part 3 Trace Elements3 Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Pratt et al., 1985 As part of a double-blind study of back pain management, 14 adult volunteers received a supplement of 10 mg copper/ day as copper gluconate for 12 weeks or a placebo. There was no increase in the levels ofcopper, zinc or magnesium in SGOT, GGT, LDH andcholesterol levels were not significantly affected by treatment. The authors concluded that the resultssupported the view that excess copper was excreted and homeostasis maintained in non-Wilson'sdisease subjects. Adverse effects of nausea, heart burn and diarrhoea occurred in copper and placebotakers, but the numbers stated are too few for reliable comparison. Turnland et al., 1989 Eleven young male volunteers were confined to a metabolic ward for 90 days and given a sequence of adequate (1.68 mg/ day), low (0.785 mg/ day) and high (7.53 mg/ day) copper diets for 24, 42 and 24 daysrespectively. Absorption of a stable copper isotope 65Cu (as 65CuO) from the high copper diet, was lower (12%) than that absorbed (36.3%) from the adequate copper diet, and from the low copper diet(55.6% for the first 35 days of treatment), and declined linearly with time. Thus in the last 6 days of thestudy, copper balance was negative in the high dose treatment group suggesting endogenous excretionof copper retained earlier in the study. The authors concluded that where copper intake was high,reduced fractional absorption was insufficient to prevent the absorption of some excess copper, butthat the excess was then eliminated by increased endogenous losses. No adverse effects were noted,but because the experiment was designed to investigate copper balance, markers of copper toxicitywere not considered. Olivares et al., 1998 Healthy infants living in Santiago were randomly assigned to two groups receiving drinking water containing /H110210.1 mg/L (n = 48) or 2 mg/L (n = 80) copper (as copper sulphate) from 3-12 months of age. The mothers of the infants also consumed the same water. Within the groups, the infants were dividedinto 2 subgroups: those who were formula-fed and those who were breast-fed. Formula-fed infants inthe low and high copper intake groups received 0.8-1.2 and 2.3-2.5 mg copper/ day, respectively. Breast-fed infants in the low and high copper intake groups received 0.1-1.6 and 0.1-2.0 mg copper/ day,respectively. Values for copper intake included copper intake from food, but not from breast milk. At 6,9 and 12 months serum concentrations of copper, caeruloplasmin, transaminases and /H9253-glutamyl transferases were measured, as an indication of copper status. No adverse effects were observed, butsmall differences were apparent in biochemical estimates of copper status. There were no significantdifferences in copper status between the 4 groups of infants during the study. However, there weredifferences between the breast-fed and formula-fed infants in serum copper and erythrocytemetallothionein levels and in the serum caeruloplasmin activity of individuals with high and low copperintake levels at points during the study. A greater incidence of diarrhoea in formula-fed infants wouldseem likely to reflect their enhanced risk of enteric infection. Overall, the authors concluded thatconsumption of drinking water containing copper at the WHO guideline level of 2 mg/L did not resultin adverse effects. 1923Pizarro et al., 1999 Sixty healthy adult female volunteers living in urban Santiago were randomised into four groups (n =15) who received drinking water containing 0, 1, 3 or 5 mg copper/L for 2 weeks followed by a further weekof standard tap water. The copper was added in the form of copper sulphate. A double-blind latin squaredesign was used so that each volunteer experienced all of the copper concentrations and acted as theirown control. Untreated tap water contained 0.02 mg copper/L. Average dietary intake of copper by thestudy population was estimated to be 1.7 mg/ day. Water consumption and gastrointestinal symptomswere recorded daily. Average water consumption was 1.64 L/ day regardless of copper concentration.Twenty-one subjects reported gastrointestinal disturbances during the study (nine subjects presentedwith diarrhoea (some with abdominal pain and vomiting) and twelve subjects presented with abdominalpain, nausea or vomiting. One third of the 60 subjects had mild diarrhoea during the study but this wasnot associated with copper concentration. A copper concentration of 3 mg/L or above was associatedwith an increased incidence of nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain (5, 2, 17 and 15% in the 0, 1, 3 and5 mg/L groups respectively). Final serum copper, caeruloplasmin and liver enzyme levels were measuredin all the volunteers but did not differ from baseline. The numbers involved were small and the incidenceof diarrhoea in the whole group appears quite high; the reasons for the latter were discussed. Theauthors suggested that the subjects could have been more sensitive to symptoms since they werespecifically asked to record them. Animal studies H\u00e9bert et al., 1993 Rats and mice were given up to 10,000 mg copper/kg (estimated intake up to 35 mg copper/kg bw/ day in male rats, 30 mg copper/kg bw/ day in female rats, 131 mg copper/kg bw/ day in male mice and 171 mgcopper/kg bw/ day in female mice) copper sulphate pentahydrate in drinking water for 2 weeks.Concentrations of 300-1000 mg copper/kg sulphate (up to 28 mg copper/kg bw/ day in rats and up to35 mg copper/kg bw/ day in mice) did not have any overt adverse effects on F344 rats or B6C3F1 mice,whereas concentrations of 3000-10,000 mg copper sulphate/kg (equivalent to 30-44 mg copper/kgbw/ day in rats and 56-171 mg copper/kg bw/ day in mice) were rapidly lethal. Copper exposure waslower in the top dose rats due to markedly reduced drinking water consumption. Body weights weredepressed at > 3000 mg/kg copper sulphate (30 and 44 mg copper/kg bw/ day in female and male ratsand 56 and 61 mg copper/kg bw/ day in male and female mice) in both species. Clinical signs observedat these dose levels included ruffled fur, emaciation, abnormal posturing, hypoactivity, dyspnea andtremors. The only histological lesions observed in rats (males only) were increased numbers of proteindroplets in the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules. In mice in the highest dose group, mosttissues showed cellular depletion, due to decreased water consumption.No effects were produced at1000 mg copper sulphate/kg (equivalent to 26 mg copper/kg bw in female rats and 24 and 35 mgcopper/kg bw in male and female mice) in female rats and mice, but protein droplets were reported inmale rats at all doses. Rats and mice were given up to 16,000 mg copper sulphate pentahydrate/kg in feed for 2 weeks. Concentrations of 4000-16000 mg copper sulphate/kg (equivalent to 91 mg copper/kg bw/ day andabove in male rats, 159 mg copper/kg bw/ day and above in female rats, 193 mg copper/kg bw/ day andabove in male mice and 212 mg copper/kg bw/ day and above in female mice) caused significantreductions in body weight gain in both species. Body weights were reduced in rats given 8000 mg/kg ormore copper sulphate (equivalent to 192 mg copper/kg bw/ day in females and 194 mg copper/kgbw/ day in males) and in mice in the top dose group (704 mg copper/kg bw/ day for male mice and 767 mgExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1933Part 3 Trace Elements3 copper/kg bw/ day for female mice). Hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis on the limiting ridge of the forestomach were present in both species (this was more severe in mice) and was attributed to irritation.A dose-related increase in liver damage (inflammation and changes in clinical chemistry) was apparent inthe rats, as was damage to the renal tubules. Depletion of iron stores occurred in rats but not in mice,and histologic changes indicated microcytic anaemia also in rats. The NOAEL for the 2 week feedstudies was 1000 mg copper sulphate/kg in rats (equivalent to 23 mg copper/kg bw/ day) in males andfemales respectively based on liver, kidney and forestomach effects. In mice, effects on the liver andkidney were not observed but the NOAEL based on the forestomach was 2000 mg/kg copper sulphate(equivalent to 91 and 102 mg copper/kg bw) in males and females respectively. A 13 week feeding study in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice was also carried out. The rats and mice received diet containing 500-8000 mg/kg and 1000-16,000 mg/kg copper sulphate pentahydrate respectively.Body weights were significantly reduced in male rats at 4000 and 8000 mg/kg copper sulphate(equivalent to 65 mg copper/kg bw/ day and 138 mg copper/kg bw/ day) and in females at 8000 mg/kg(equivalent to 132 mg copper/kg bw/ day). A dose related decrease in body weights was apparent inmice at doses of 4000 mg/kg copper sulphate or more (equivalent to 184 mg copper/kg bw/ day andabove in males and 262 mg copper/kg bw/ day and above in females). Hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis onthe limiting ridge of the forestomach were present in both species, though rats were more severelyaffected at the same dose levels. This was attributed to the irritant effects of the copper sulphate.Damage to the renal tubules, and a dose-related increase in liver damage (inflammation and changes inclinical chemistry) was apparent in the rats. Depletion of iron stores occurred in rats but not in mice,and changes in haematologic parameters at 13 weeks indicated microcytic anaemia in rats confirming thefindings of the two week feed study. The NOAEL for the 13 week studies was 1000 mg/kg coppersulphate in rats (equivalent to 16 and 17 mg/kg bw/ day copper in males and females respectively) basedon liver, kidney and forestomach effects. In mice, effects on the liver and kidney were not observed butthe NOAEL based on reduced body weights was 1000 mg/kg (43 mg copper/kg bw/ day) in male miceand 2000 mg/kg (124 mg copper/kg bw/ day) in females. Forestomach effects were reported in the miceat 4000 mg/kg or more copper sulphate. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food 1.4 mg/ day (mean 1986/87 NDNS) 3.0 mg/ day (97.5thpercentile from 1986/87 NDNS) to 2 mg/ day (Annex 4; OTC, 2001)Drinking Water up to 6 mg/ day (assuming 2 L/ day consumption and the maximum permitted water copper concentration of 3 mg/L.) Estimated maximum daily intake: 3.0 + 2 + 6 = 11 mg No potential high intake groups were identified. 1943Risk assessment Acute copper toxicity in humans is rare due to the emetic properties and unpleasant taste of the compounds. There are relatively few data on lower level or chronic oral copper exposure in man.Copper is kept under tight homeostatic control to prevent the accumulation of excess amounts. Wheredietary copper is high, absorption is reduced and, in particular, biliary excretion increased. Othermechanisms, which sequester excess copper within the cell, may also occur. Copper toxicity occurswhen such defences are overwhelmed. Thus, in man, liver toxicity has only been seen in geneticallydetermined conditions such as Wilson's disease and in Indian Childhood Cirrhosis where hepatic copperaccumulation occurs. There is no evidence for copper carcinogenicity in the general population,although an elevated incidence of hepatoma has been suggested in untreated Wilson's disease patientsor subjects recovering from ICC. In the general human population, the key adverse effects usually associated with excess copper intake are gastrointestinal, resulting from consumption of copper in water or beverages. There are some animal data for copper, although few from adequate chronic studies. Forestomach lesions, liver and kidney toxicity and anaemia were reported in a sub-chronic toxicity study.Reproductive effects have been reported in laboratory animals, but these findings are not consistent. ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL Key studies: Hebert et al ., (1993) Supporting studies: Turnland et al. (1989), Pratt et al. (1985) NOAEL: 16 mg/kg bw/ day from a 13-week study in rats.Uncertainty 10 for inter-species variation x 10 for intra-individual Factors: variation (total 100) Safe Upper Level 16/100 = 0.16 mg/kg bw/ day (equivalent to 10 mg/ day in a for total daily 60 kg adult).consumption overa lifetime: Copper is kept under tight homeostatic control to prevent the accumulation of excess amounts. Copper toxicity occurs when such defences are overwhelmed. Balance studies and supplementation studies in small numbers of human volunteers suggest that doses of 7.5 mg to 10 mg copper/ day in food or supplements are not associated with adverse effects. Incontrolled studies on the effects of copper levels in drinking water. Pizarro et al . (1999) reported that water containing 3 mg copper/L was associated with gastrointestinal disturbance in adults, whereaswater containing 1 mg/L was not. Olivares and colleagues reported that water containing 2 mgcopper/L (resulting in intakes of up to 2.5 mg/ day in formula fed infants and 2 mg/ day + an undefinedcontribution from breast milk in breast-fed infants) were not associated with adverse effects. Nodifferences in liver function tests related to copper intakes were apparent. It is noted that there was aExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1953Part 3 Trace Elements3 higher rate of diarrhoea in formula-fed infants. However, since breast-feeding is known to protect against diarrhoea this is not unexpected. The gastrointestinal disturbance reported by Pizarro et al . appears to be the result of a direct irritant effect from copper in water and is not so apparent whencopper is present in a food matrix. Whilst liver toxicity occurs in humans who accumulate large quantities of copper in the liver, this is as a result of genetically determined conditions such as Wilson's disease and Indian Childhood Cirrhosis andis not relevant to the general population.Copper balance studies indicate that decreased absorptionand increased excretion occurs when excess copper is consumed so that homeostasis is maintained. A NOAEL of 16 mg/kg bw/ day was identified in a well-reported sub-chronic toxicity study in rats. Higher doses resulted in damage to the forestomach, kidney and liver. If uncertainty factors of 10 forinter-species variation and 10 for intra-individual variation (total 100) are applied to this, a Safe UpperLevel of 0.16 mg/kg bw day for total intake of copper is derived. This is equivalent to 10 mg/ day in a60 kg adult. This is consistent with the data from small scale human studies which suggest that up to10 mg/ day supplemental copper may be without adverse effect. The worst-case maximum estimateddaily exposure from food and water is 9 mg/ day copper suggesting that there is a margin of 1 mg/ dayfor supplementation or other additional intake. The exposure estimate suggests that individuals in the UK could theoretically consume in excess of 6 mg/ day copper from water alone if it was assumed that 2 L/ day water was consumed containing copperat the statutory limit of 3 mg/L. This was also the dose associated with gastrointestinal effects in the Pizarrostudy. However, in practice copper levels in UK drinking water are much lower, so this level of exposure isunlikely to occur. There is no evidence that copper intakes in water in the UK present any risk to health.

Within this risk assessment, the word germanium refers to ionic germanium, except when specific compounds arementioned. Natural occurrence Germanium is found in a range of minerals and ores. Both organic and inorganic germanium compoundsoccur. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Germanium is present in foods including beans, tomato juice, oysters, tuna and garlic. Germanium is notcurrently present in any licensed medicines. Germanium food supplements were voluntarily withdrawnby industry in the UK due to toxicity but can be obtained by mail order over the internet and areavailable in other parts of the world (for example, supplements containing 100 mg Ge-132). Other sources of exposure No data were identified. Recommended amounts Germanium is not considered to be an essential trace element. Analysis of tissue levels and germanium status No data on the analysis of tissue levels and germanium status have been identified. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects. Germanium has been claimed to have beneficial effects on a number of conditions including cancer,AIDS, liver disease, hypertension, arthritis, food allergies and malaria. The results of trials usingspirogermanium (an organic compound) as a cancer treatment are inconclusive.Risk Assessment GermaniumFunction There is no known biological function for germanium. It has been suggested that germanium may be involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Deficiency No deficiency disease has been described. It has been suggested that germanium deficiency could be acontributory factor in Kashin-Beck disease (an osteo-arthritic condition affecting children in China andthe former Soviet Union) but this is based on a reported association from a single study. Interactions It has been suggested that germanium can interact with silicon in bone metabolism. It can interfere withthe action of loop diuretic drugs and inhibit the activity of a number of enzymes including lactate andalcohol dehydrogenase. Hexabarbital-induced sleeping times are increased in mice treated withgermanium compounds suggesting that inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity may also occur. Organicgermanium compounds have been reported to inhibit the detoxication enzyme glutathione-S-transferase. Absorption and bioavailability Germanium compounds are readily absorbed following oral exposure. Distribution and metabolism Germanium is distributed throughout the body tissues, particularly the kidney and thyroid. Organicgermanium is thought not to accumulate to the same extent as inorganic germanium compounds butfew data on germanium metabolism are available. Excretion Germanium is excreted largely in the urine. Some biliary and faecal excretion also occurs. Toxicity Inorganic forms of germanium compounds are more toxic than organic germanium compounds. Human data Germanium toxicity in humans has generally occurred following consumption of inorganic germanium asa food supplement. Initial symptoms include anorexia, weight loss, fatigue and muscle weakness. This isfollowed by renal dysfunction and failure, which can be fatal. Peripheral neuropathy has also beenreported. Where patients have recovered, renal function has not returned to normal. Transientneurotoxic side effects have been reported from the use of spirogermanium in clinical trials. No data on trials in healthy human volunteers have been identified.Part 3 Trace Elements3 1983Animal data Germanium has low acute oral toxicity. Symptoms of acute toxicity from large doses include sedation, vasodilation, ptosis, cyanosis and tremors with death resulting from respiratory paralysis. Symptoms ofchronic and sub-chronic effects of inorganic germanium include weight loss, in weights,progressive neuropathy by de- and re-myelination, nerve oedema and changes toSchwann cells) and renal damage. Organic compounds are less toxic but produce weight loss anddecreased red blood cell counts. Few data are available on reproductive toxicity. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Sodium germanate was not carcinogenic in rats. Mutagenicity data are limited, but negative results wereobtained with the germanium compounds tested. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations resulting in increased susceptibility to germanium toxicity have been identified. Mechanism of toxicity The precise mechanism is uncertain but specific pathological effects on the mitochondria of the kidneyand nervous system have been observed. Dose-response characterisation The toxicity of inorganic germanium compounds is clearly progressive. It is difficult to define athreshold since the available data consist of human case reports and animal studies where few doselevels have been used. Fatal renal failure in humans has occurred following cumulative doses of /H1102220 g germanium. In animals no toxicity was reported for inorganic germanium when the animals were dosedwith 5 mg germanium/kg bw/ day for 4 weeks only. However, adverse effects were apparent at the samedose level over longer periods of exposure. Organic germanium compounds are less toxic but adverseeffects have been reported.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 1993Part 3 Trace Elements3 Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Schauss, 1991 18 case reports of germanium -induced renal toxicity were reviewed, two of which were fatal.The patients took supplements of germanium dioxide or Ge-132, an organic form. The cumulative dosesconsumed ranged from 16-328 g over a 4 to 36 month period. However it is considered possible that theGe-132 may have been contaminated with inorganic germanium compounds. Animal data Kanisawa and Schroeder, 1967 A group of 135 Swiss CD mice were given drinking water containing 5 mg/L sodium germanate from weaning throughout their lifespan. The control group consisted of 198 mice. The authors estimated thatgermanium intake was 0.35 mg/kg bw/ day with an additional 0.019 mg/kg germanium being supplied bythe diet. The body weights of the treated males were lower throughout the study, becomingsignificantly so in the second year. The body weights of the treated females were lower than thecontrols in the second year of treatment, but this was only significant at 15 months.Few historicalcontrol data were provided ,not all of the animals were autopsied, and only tissues considered to be abnormal were microscopically evaluated. Sodium germanate was not found to be carcinogenic. Sanai et al., 1991 Groups of female Wistar rats were fed 75mg/kg bw germanium dioxide or 120mg/kg carboxyethylgermanium sesquoxide (GeO 2, Ge-132) for 24 weeks in the diet. The doses contained equivalent quantities of germanium. Treatment was then withdrawn for a further 16 week recoveryperiod. By week 24, weight loss, anaemia, liver dysfunction, and increased blood urea nitrogen, sodiumphosphate and creatinine were apparent in the GeO 2group only. Vacuolar degeneration and granular deposition were observed in the degenerated renal tubules of this group. The scores for tubulardegeneration were 95 /H110069%, 3 /H110061% and 1 /H110061 %, in the GeO 2, Ge-132 and control groups respectively. After discontinuation of the treatment, fibrosis became prominent in the GeO2treated group even at week 40, 16 weeks after treatment. No effects on renal histology were found in the control or Ge-132groups. The only adverse effects observed in the Ge-132 group were elevated liver weights at week16 and decreased liver weights compared to the controls following the recovery period. Anger et al., 1992 Groups of 30 male and female Wistar rats were given an oral dose of 1000 mg/kg bw/ day Ge-132 five days a week for 6 months (the route was unclear but appears to be stomach tube/gavage). Three deathsoccurred in the treated group as a result of accidental damage to the animals made when administeringthe dose. A small decrease in body weight was observed in the treated animals. A significant decrease inerythropoiesis and leukocyte ratios was also found. The main toxic effect was a slight renal dysfunction , characterised by increased serum creatinine levels (significant in males only). Urinary germanium 2003excretion was constant and related to achieved dose. It is stated that no preferential accumulation of germanium occurred, but it is apparent that germanium levels in the kidney and liver were 3 times higherthan those in tissues such as the heart or the lung. The study is limited , in that it is not well-reported and few details are provided on many aspects of the investigation. However it suggests that higherand/ or more sustained doses of Ge-132 are associated with renal dysfunction in male rats. Yim et al., 1999 Sprague Dawley rats were treated with doses of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg germanium dioxide dissolved in water and administered by orogastric tube for up to 24 weeks. The aim of the experimentwas to determine the earliest onset of germanium-induced myopathy and the minimum dose of GeO 2 that would cause the effect. The earliest pathological changes in the muscle fibres observed by electronmicroscopy were abnormalities of mitochondrial shape and size and increased numbers ofmitochondria. A number of rats died during the study. The minimal dose of GeO 2causing myopathy was 10 mg/kg bw/ day for 4 or more weeks. Exposure assessment Food mean: mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified. Risk assessment Germanium is not considered to be an essential element although it has been marketed as such and was available in the UK as a dietary supplement prior to its voluntary withdrawal. Germanium causes specific toxic effects on the kidney, the muscle and the nervous system in both animals and man. A number of human case reports are available, many of these involving fatal renalfailure. However, the incidence of renal toxicity as a fraction of all those taking germanium supplementsis uncertain. The effects of germanium on the kidney are not completely reversible following thecessation of treatment. Comparable data are available from animal studies. Germanium toxicity has been largely associated with consumption of inorganic germanium dioxide and it has been suggested that organic germanium compounds do not cause adverse effects. For example Sanaiet al. (1991) showed that an organic germanium compound carboxyethylgermanium sesquoxide (Ge-132) did not cause tubular degeneration in rats compared to a comparable dose of germanium dioxide overthe same 16 week period. However, Anger et al. (1992) demonstrated moderate tubular damage when a higher dose of Ge-132 was given over a longer time period. Sources claiming the lack of toxicity ofExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2013Part 3 Trace Elements3 organic germanium are generally secondary and are not available in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Although organic germanium compounds are less toxic than their inorganic equivalents, adverse effectsare still apparent. The mechanisms of germanium-induced target organ toxicity are uncertain. Naturally-occurring germanium present in food does not appear to be associated with any adverse effects. EVM OPINION Germanium is not considered to be an essential element. Germanium is a cumulative toxin causingserious, and potentially fatal, adverse effects on the kidneys. Naturally-occurring germanium present infood does not appear to be associated with any adverse effects, but there are insufficient data todefine a NOAEL for chronic exposure in either animals or humans at levels in excess of this. Whilstorganic forms of germanium appear to be less toxic than inorganic ones, at present there are alsoinsufficient data to establish a NOAEL or to rule out cumulative toxicity of a similar type to that ofinorganic germanium, albeit occurring at higher doses. Dietary supplements containing germanium were voluntarily withdrawn in the UK but may be obtained by mail order over the Internet. Given the cumulative nature of germanium toxicity there are insufficient data to set a Safe Upper Level for any amount of germanium in excess of that provided by the diet.

Yim, S.Y, Lee, I.Y, onsei Medical Journal 40, 69-75. 2023Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2033General information Chemistry Iodine is a non-metallic group VII element (a halogen). At room temperature it is a blue-black solid which sublimes into a gaseous form. It reacts readily, common compounds being iodides (e.g. potassiumiodide) and iodates (e.g. potassium iodate). Iodine can exist in oxidation states -1, 1, 5 and 7, -1 (iodide)being the most common. In this risk assessment, the word iodine refers to both the elemental and ionicforms of iodine. Natural occurrence Iodine is present in seawater, igneous rocks and some soils. Occurrence in foods, food supplements and medicines High levels of iodine are present in marine fish (up to 2.5 mg/kg), shellfish (up to 1.6 mg/kg) and sea salt(up to 1.4 mg/kg). Levels in cereals and grains vary depending on the iodine content of the soil. The foodcolour erythrosine is also rich in iodine. In the UK, iodine is also present in cows' milk (average level0.15 mg/kg), probably as a result of the use of supplemented cattle feeds and iodophors as teatsterilants. The content of iodine in raw food is reduced by cooking. Iodine, as iodide, is present in multi-vitamin and mineral supplements (providing up to 0.49 mg iodine/ day) and is a component of kelpproducts. It is also present in licensed medicines, topical antiseptics and radiographic contrast agents. Iodine intakes in children are higher than those in adults, because of a greater consumption of milk, and are likely to be higher in the winter than the summer because winter milk contains more iodine. Other sources of exposure Iodine intake from water is estimated to be generally less than 0.03 mg/ day. Recommended amounts COMA established a Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) and a RNI for iodine of 0.07 and 0.14mg/ day, respectively (COMA, 1991). Analysis of tissue levels and iodine status Urinary iodine excretion, or blood levels of thyroxine (T4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) havebeen used to estimate iodine status.Risk Assessment IodineBrief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Iodine is claimed to assist with weight loss, rheumatism, ulcers, hair loss and the maintenance of healthy arteries, nervous tissue and nails. Function Iodine forms part of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).Receptors bindingT3 and T4 have been found in the cell nucleus and in mitochondria.These hormones are involved in themaintenance of metabolic rate, cellular metabolism and integrity of connective tissue. Thyroidhormones are necessary for the development of the nervous system in the foetus and infant. Deficiency A variety of mechanisms exist to compensate for low levels of iodine intake. These include enlargementof the thyroid gland (goitre). Only when these mechanisms fail do the clinical signs of hypothyroidism(also known as myxoedema) develop. Symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism include lethargy,weakness, weight gain, poor concentration, oedema, myalgia, dry skin, delayed tendon reflexes and slowheart rate. In pregnancy, iodine deficiency is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirthand congenital abnormality. Cretinism is the result of iodine deficiency in the developing foetus, and ischaracterised by mental retardation, deaf mutism, and spastic diplegia. A less common form of cretinismis the myxoedematous type, which is characterised by hypothyroidism and dwarfism. Interactions Iodine interacts with selenium and possibly with vanadium. Natural goitrogens (which impair thyroid hormone synthesis) may be present in soybeans, peanuts and walnuts, or may be formed (for example, thiocyanate) from foods such as corn, maize, cassava, potato,cauliflower and broccoli.Pollutants derived from coal (such as 2 and 5 methyl resorcinol) have alsobeen reported to act as goitrogens. Absorption and bioavailability The few data available suggest that the bioavailability of iodine in food is high. Inorganic iodine (generally in the form of iodide) is readily absorbed, largely from the small intestine. It can also be absorbed through the skin, absorption being increased when the skin is damaged. Distribution and metabolism Once absorbed, iodine is distributed rapidly throughout the extracellular fluid, secreted into saliva, andenters the gastrointestinal system, from where it is reabsorbed.Iodine can cross the placenta and issecreted into human breast milk.Part 3 Trace Elements3 2043Iodine is taken up and stored in the thyroid gland mainly as iodinated tyrosines and thyronines, within a large protein (thyroglobulin), for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3). Excess iodide isexcreted in the urine. T4 and T3 are released into the blood (by passive diffusion) after proteolysis fromthyroglobulin, and circulate in protein-bound and free forms. The free forms of the hormones entertissues, in particular the liver (for T4) and skeletal muscle (for T3).The thyroid gland is the onlysignificant store of iodine. Excretion Iodine is largely excreted in the urine, mainly in the form of iodine. Very small amounts of iodine maybe excreted in sweat, faeces and exhaled air. Toxicity Human data Several biological mechanisms protect against iodine toxicity; these include reduced iodine uptake andpreferential production of the more heavily iodinated thyroid hormones. Not all exposed subjects willreact to excess iodine. Clinical features of acute iodine toxicity that have been produced following accidental or deliberate ingestion, or medical procedures such as wound irrigation, include gastrointestinal disturbance (vomitingand diarrhoea), metabolic acidosis, asiodide mumps, iododerma and iodide fever may also occur following treatment with iodine-containingdrugs, or the use of radiographic contrast media. Chronic and sub-chronic toxicity have also been identified. Excess iodine or iodide intake may disrupt thyroid function, resulting in the induction of hypothyroidism with or without goitre, hyperthyroidism(thyrotoxicosis) and changes in the incidence and types of thyroid malignancies. Responses of this typefrequently occur where there is general high iodine intake or where intervention has taken place tocorrect iodine deficiency. The pattern of effects changes over time as iodine exposure in the population changes. For example, in the UK, the possibility of iodine induced hyperthyroidism associated with prior iodine deficiencyappears to be less common due to recent increases in the iodine intake of the population as a whole. Supplementation studies Measures of serum thyroid hormone levels, such as T3, T4 and TSH are used as indicators of iodine disturbances in human studies. Increased TSH and decreased T3 and T4 levels have been noted atsupplemental doses of 0.5-1.5 mg/ day and above for 2 weeks. Significant reductions in further iodine uptake have been noted with supplemental doses of 2 mg iodine/ day. Dietary iodine intakeswere uncertain.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2053Animal data Symptoms of acute iodide or iodate toxicity include diarrhoea, with alternating periods of hyperactivity, weakness, prostration, convulsions and death. Symptoms of sub-chronic toxicity include reduced weight gain and haemolysis, in addition to specific effects on the thyroid. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No data have been identified on the carcinogenicity of iodine. Both iodine deficiency and excess canpromote tumour formation in animals pre-exposed to known carcinogens. Metaplasia of the thyroidwas reported in rats given potassium iodide in drinking water for two years. This was thought to occurvia a non-genotoxic proliferation dependent mechanism. Human epidemiological studies have shownvariations in the incidence of thyroid cancer, depending on the levels of iodine available in watersupplies in these areas. The type of cancer appears to differ depending on whether iodine levels aredeficient or excess. Changes to the pattern of thyroid tumours have been noted after prophylaxis. Themutagenicity data for iodine are generally negative. Mechanism of toxicity The adverse effects of high levels of iodine are largely due to the derangement of thyroid hormonemetabolism, the thyroid-pituitary axis and the compensatory mechanisms that exist to protect suchmetabolism against low or high levels of iodine intake. Previous exposures to iodine and the complexeffects of pre-existing thyroid conditions also influence the effects of subsequent exposure. Dose-response characterisation The threshold level of iodine necessary to induce thyrotoxicosis is uncertain and appears to varydepending on previous iodine exposure. The available data are inadequate to establish a dose-responserelationship. Vulnerable groups Pregnant and lactating women, and neonates are considered to be vulnerable groups as iodine freelycrosses the placenta and is expressed in breast milk, and goitre and hypothyroidism have been reportedto occur in the offspring of mothers exposed to pharmacological doses of iodine and iodide. Genetic variations No genetic variation in the uptake and toxicity of excess iodine has been identified.Part 3 Trace Elements3 2063Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Saxena et al., 1962 This study investigated the minimal effective dose necessary to suppress radioactive iodine uptake. Increasing doses of stable iodine (as sodium iodide) were given to children with normal thyroid function.Doses of 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 or 1 mg iodide/ day were given to children aged 1-3, 4-6 or 9-11 years of age. The24 hour uptake of 131I was measured every two weeks until uptake declined to 5% or until there was no change between successive uptakes. Iodide was then discontinued. No toxic effects were observed.Thyroid hormone concentrations were not assessed. The length of the study in the particular sub-groups is uncertain, but appears to have been no longer than 3 months. The degree of suppression ofradioactive iodine uptake was related to dose, with maximum suppression of 131I being achieved with a dose of 1.5-2 mg iodide per square meter of body surface. This was equivalent to a dose of 1-2 mgiodide in children and 3-4 mg in adults. 131I uptake rapidly returned to normal once the iodide was discontinued. Freund et al., 1966 The health status and thyroid function of representative subjects of a prison population were assessed before and during use of iodinated water for 9 months. The group initially comprised 133 euthyroidprisoners, but was gradually reduced to 70, due to discharge from the institution. Water containing 1 mgiodine/L resulted in a marked decrease in the uptake of test doses of radioactive iodine, to a level of7%. However, protein bound iodine levels did not change significantly until the iodine concentration ofthe water was increased to 5 mg/L for 2 months (following 7 months exposure at the lower level),radioactive iodine uptake then fell to 2%. Serum thyroxine concentration did not change regardless ofthe iodine concentration of the water. No information is provided on individual iodine intake, but waterconsumption can be assumed to have been approximately 2 L/ day. Prisoners continued to receiveiodine from the diet, including iodised salt. No effects on thyroid function were reported in non-prisonpersonnel who swam in water iodinated at a level of 5 mg/L. No evidence of iodine allergy wasapparent. Two (of fifteen) male inmates had impaired iodine organification, after consuming water (for atleast 3 months) containing 1 mg iodine/L, as measured by the change in thyroidal 131I concentration following administration of perchlorate. The clinical significance of this effect is unclear, since individualT4 concentrations remained unchanged throughout the study i.e. no patients demonstrated iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Stockton and Thomas, 1978 No significant change in serum thyroxine levels was seen following the iodination of a prison water supply at a concentration of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/L (estimated intake 1-1.5 mg/ day) for up to 15. During thesame period, 177 women in the prison gave birth to 181 full term infants none of whom had enlargedthyroids. Ninety-nine mothers (of 101 infants) had been in prison for /H11091122 days, whilst eighty mothers had been imprisoned for /H11021118 days (10-118). This study has been published as an abstract only.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2073Part 3 Trace Elements3 Sternthal et al., 1980 Single doses of 10-100 mg iodide (as sodium iodide), were given to adult volunteers. In a subsequent experiment, 12 daily doses of 10-100 mg sodium iodide were given. All doses greater than 10 mgsuppressed 24-hour uptake of 123 I to between 0.7% and 1.5%. Continued daily administration of 15 mg iodide or more resulted in 24-hour uptake values of less than 2% (compared with baseline values of 17to 23%). Pooling the 24 hour uptake values of the subjects taking 30-100 mg iodide resulted in asignificant increase in serum TSH and significant decreases in T3 and T4 levels. These values returned tonormal following the withdrawal of treatment. No adverse effects were reported. Braverman, 1987 Doses of approximately 150 mg iodine given to normal adults for 1-3 weeks induced a small but significant decrease in serum T3 and T4 levels, with a small, significant compensatory increase in serum TSH, andTSH response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH). However, the values for these parameters werewithin the normal range. Similar changes in thyroid function were reported in male volunteers given 200mg/ day of the iodine-rich colour erythrosine for 14 days.The increase in urinary iodine excretion wasapproximately 1.5 mg daily, which is equivalent to a 2-7 fold increase in dietary iodine intake. No effectwas found when the volunteers were given 60 mg erythrosine/ day. The effects caused by 200 mgerythrosine/ day were reproduced when 1.5 mg/iodine was administered. The author considered thatthese subtle changes in thyroid function represented physiological adaptation to iodine excess. Serum T3 and T4 concentrations and free T4 index were unchanged in normal subjects who used iodine-containing mouthwash daily for 6 months. (A small but significant increase in TSH levels wasmeasured; this was within the normal range and considered a normal physiological adaptive response.The amount of iodine absorbed was equivalent to 2- 4 mg/ day (based on increased urinary excretion). Paul et al., 1988 Subjects with a normal functioning thyroid (9 men and 23 women) between the ages of 26 and 56 were given doses of 0.25, 0.5 or 1.5 mg supplemental iodine/ day for 14 days. There were small but significantdecreases in serum T3 and T4 concentrations following the administration of 1.5 mg/ day as well as asmall compensatory increase in serum TSH levels and in TSH response to TRH. No effects wereobserved in the subjects given the lower levels of iodine. Gardner et al., 1988 Thirty healthy men aged 22-40 were randomly assigned to receive 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 mg iodide/ day for 2 weeks. Several thyroid parameters being measured on day 1 and day 15. Mean serum T4 levels and freeT4 index values were decreased at the 1.5 and 4.5 mg/ day dose. No changes were observed in serum T3concentrations at any dose. Doses of 0.5 mg/ day resulted in a significant increase in the serum TSHresponse to TRH and the two larger doses resulted in increases in both basal and TRH-stimulated serumTSH concentrations. Chow et al., 1991 A randomised controlled trial was performed to investigate the effects of low levels of iodine supplementation in healthy women and in women with sub-clinical Hashimoto's thyroiditis (one of thetwo major types of autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis, characterised by an enlarged thyroid). From agroup of 225 women screened for thyroid microsomal antibody, 20 antibody positive women and 30antibody negative controls were recruited into a trial comparing iodide and placebo. Additional groups 2083of older subjects from iodine sufficient and iodine deficient areas were also enrolled. The subjects received a supplement of 0.5 mg iodide/ day or placebo. Dietary iodine intake was estimated to beapproximately 0.25 mg/ day. Free thyroxine (T4) and thyrotrophin levels were measured after 14 and 28days treatment. No changes in thyroid function were seen in the placebo group. All the iodidesupplemented groups showed a small decrease in free thyroxine and increase in thyrotrophin levels. Intwo subjects thyrotrophin levels rose beyond the reference range and in a further three subjects , initially elevated thyrotrophin levels increased further. The effects seen were comparable in the normaland antibody positive subjects. The authors noted that the changes would not be of clinical significancein the general population but that a small shift in the mean value for these indices in a populationtended to result in greater effects at the extremes of the distribution. The authors further concludedthat dietary intakes in the UK should be monitored since total intakes of 0.75 mg/ day could adverselyaffect thyroid function. Garber et al., 1993 Healthy hyperlipidaemic subjects (104) were placed on a low fat diet for 12 weeks. Between weeks 4 and 12, they were randomised into a control group (n=53) or were given an iodine enriched egg per day(iodine enriched eggs are produced by hens fed a diet containing kelp and contain an average of 0.71 mgiodine/ egg). No information was provided on the iodine content of the rest of the diet. Some subjectsfrom each group continued in the study for an additional 4-8 weeks; there were 19 test subjects and 21controls by week 16. Plasma and urinary iodine levels were significantly higher in the test subjectscompared to the controls. No significant adverse clinical effects were reported (with the exception ofone report of an allergic-type response shortly after beginning egg consumption). There were nodifferences in clinical chemistry values between the two groups. Thyroid function tests (T3, T4, T3uptake, TSH, thyroid binding globulin and free T4 index) were normal in 17 (of 19) subjects and 20 (of 21)controls. The remaining subjects (2 test and 1 control) had elevated TSH levels. A report was providedfor just 1 of these subjects, and revealed high iodine excretion, suggesting exposure to other sources ofiodine. Unfortunately, the subject was not followed up and it was unknown whether clinically significanthypothyroidism developed. Three of the studies cited above (Freund et al ., 1966; Saxena et al ., 1962; Sternthal et al ., 1980) reported on blockage of radioactive iodine uptake following repeated doses of stable iodine. The purpose ofthese studies was to identify the minimum daily dose of iodine necessary to prevent thyroidal uptake ofradioactive iodine in the event of nuclear fallout. The mechanism by which stable iodine blocksthyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine is not well established but may involve isotope dilution,saturation of iodide transport mechanism, interference with intrathyroidal organification iodide(acute Wolff-Chaikoff effect), or inhibition of hormone release (Zanzonico and Becker, 2000). Thyroidradioactive iodine uptake is inversely proportional to iodine intake (Merck, 2001). In normal subjects theWolff-Chaikoff effect is transient and overcome by prolonged exposure. Furthermore, when assessed inthese studies, serum thyroid hormone concentrations were unaffected. It is therefore unclear whetherthis minimum inhibition dose can be considered an adverse effect.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2093Part 3 Trace Elements3 Exposure assessment Total /H110210.03 mg/ day (estimated intake from 2 litres of water containing /H110210.015 g/L) Supplements up to 0.49 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated 0.43 + 0.03 + 0.49 = 0.95 mg/ dayChildren are a potential high intake group, because iodine intakes in children are higher than those in adults due to higher milk consumption. Risk assessment The observed effects at lower levels of iodine exposure (as opposed to overt poisoning) seem to resultfrom the derangement of thyroid hormone metabolism and the complex feedback mechanisms thatgovern it. Changes in thyroid parameters that represent normal compensating mechanisms are difficult todistinguish from those which indicate the onset of adverse or toxic effects in human studies as iodineexposure increases. Small changes in the levels of thyroid hormones may be of little significance, whereaslarger changes or phenomena such as blocking of further iodine uptake or increased thyroid weight maybe of more significance, suggesting that iodine intakes are at a level where permanent change or moresignificant symptoms could occur. The response to increased iodine intake also seems to vary dependingon previous iodine exposure. Disruption of normal thyroid metabolism by increased iodine intake maymanifest as either hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism (mimicking the hypothyroidism caused byiodine deficiency). Subjects exposed to pharmacological doses of iodine, frequently as the result of medical treatment, may exhibit effects such as iodine fever or mumps or iododerma. The mechanisms for such reactionsare uncertain, as is the nature of any susceptible groups. The relevance of such sensitivity reactions tothe risk assessment process is therefore unclear. Although there are human data available, much are unsuitable for risk assessment purposes since a large number of case reports or epidemiological studies have inadequate, if any, estimates of iodine exposure.Similarly, there are few, if any, good quality animal studies where clear adverse effects can be defined andthus animal studies have not been considered further. 2103ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from human or animal studies to establish a Safe Upper Level for iodine. A few studies (Paul et al ., 1988; Chow et al ., 1991; Gardner et al ., 1988) have reported that supplemental doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg iodine/ day produced small changes in the levels of thyroid hormones. Otherstudies (Saxena et al ., 1962; Freund et al ., 1966) indicate that supplemental doses of 2 mg/ day, in addition to the iodine present in the diet, result in the blockage of further iodine uptake. Although 0.5 mgsupplemental iodine/ day has been reported to alter thyroid parameters in some studies, the changesare likely to represent normal feedback processes rather than adverse effects. Taken together the data suggest that, for guidance purposes only, a supplemental intake of 0.5 mg/ day (equivalent to 0.003 mg/kg bw in a 60 kg adult), in addition to the iodine present in the diet would notbe expected to have any significant adverse effects in adults. No uncertainty factors have been appliedas these data come from a number of well-reported, controlled human studies. Assuming an intake ofiodine from the diet of 0.43 mg/ day, this equates to a total intake, which would be expected to bewithout adverse effects, of 0.94 mg/ day (equivalent to 0.015 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult). It ispossible that some consumers of foods with high levels of iodine, particularly children, mayoccasionally exceed this guidance level from normal dietary sources, but compensatory mechanismsexist and allay concerns for this potentially vulnerable group.

Mn2+and Mn3+are the most biologically important. Within this risk assessment, the word manganese refers to ionic manganese, except when specific manganese compounds are mentioned. Natural occurrence Manganese is present both naturally and as a result of contamination in soils, sediments and water. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Manganese is present in foods, particularly green vegetables (2 mg/kg), nuts (14.9 mg/kg), bread (8 mg/kg) and other cereals (6.81 mg/kg). Tea is a rich source of manganese, containing 2.71 mg/kg andis the largest contributor to manganese intake. It is present in several licensed medicines, in combinationwith other substances, in use for prevention and treatment of nutrient deficiencies and other relatedconditions. Manganese is also present in a number of multi-vitamin and/ or mineral food supplements atlevels up to 10 mg. Other sources of exposure The level of manganese in drinking water ranges from 0.001 to 0.1 mg/L, but is mostly around 0.01 mg/L.Exposure to manganese may also occur through inhalation of airborne particles by miners, smelters andworkers in the manufacture of dry batteries. Recommended amounts COMA and the WHO were unable to set a specific recommendation for manganese intake. The EUScientific Committee for Food (SCF) considered a 'safe and adequate intake' to be 1-10 mg/person/ day.The US National Research Council (NRC) specified Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes(ESADDIs) of 0.3-1, 1-3 and 2-5 mg/ day for infants, children and adults respectively. Analysis of tissue levels and manganese status A method for assessing manganese status has not been defined, because of an inconsistent relationshipbetween tissue measures and external exposures. Measurement of manganese-specific superoxidedismutase (MnSOD) activity and and zinc-copper superoxide dismutase activity has been proposed as a method for assessment, but may beconfounded by elevated cytokine levels and disease states which increase MnSOD expression,independent status.Risk 214Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects There have been claims of a variety of beneficial effects on diabetes, fatigue, memory, dizziness, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, some cases of epilepsy and the Parkinsonian side effects ofphenothiazines. COMA considered there might be a plausible basis for manganese affecting bone health, but that there is currently insufficient evidence to support dietary recommendations in this respect (COMA, 1998). Function Manganese is a component of a number of enzymes and activates a range of others. Glycosyltransferases are specifically activated by manganese. Deficiency In humans, manganese deficiency has only been observed under experimental conditions wheredecreased levels of cholesterol and clotting proteins were measured. Black hair was found to redden,fingernail growth slowed and scaly dermatitis was observed. In animals, manganese deficiency isassociated with a variety of symptoms including skeletal malformations, and impaired growth andreproductive function. Interactions Manganese and iron compete for absorption sites. Fibre, phytate, calcium, phosphorus and magnesiummay also interfere with manganese absorption. It has been suggested that ethanol may enhancemanganese toxicity. Absorption and bioavailability Absorption takes place in the small intestine via a carrier-mediated mechanism; passive diffusion mayalso occur. Absorption is generally low but appears to be higher in infants and young animals.Bioavailability of manganese from different food types is variable, but appears to be generally low, dueto poor solubility. Distribution and metabolism In the portal blood manganese may bind to albumin and /H92512macroglobulin. A small proportion of manganese is oxidised to Mn3+, and enters the systemic circulation, possibly by binding to transferrin. Manganese accumulates in mitochondria-rich tissues such as liver and pancreas. Manganese alsoaccumulates in the brain, particularly faeces, as a result of biliary excretion, although some directsecretion also occurs. A small amount of manganese is excreted in the urine.3Toxicity Human data Occupational exposure, for example in manganese miners and smelters, to high levels of inhaled manganese has been associated with manganism, a neurotoxic condition similar to Parkinson's disease.Drinking water contaminated with manganese has also been associated with neurological and behaviouraleffects. There is an association between manganese accumulation and liver disease but this may be dueto impaired biliary excretion caused by the liver disease rather than manganese toxicity. Effects on theimmune system have been reported. Supplementation studies Supplementation trials of human volunteers with 15 or 9 mg manganese/ day for 124 days and 'many months' respectively have not reported any adverse effects, but it is unclear whether information onsuch effects was specifically sought. Animal data Manganese has low acute toxicity but neurotoxic effects have been observed in animals chronically fedhigh concentrations of manganese salts in the diet. High doses of manganese have also resulted inanaemia as a result of iron sequestration. Fertility is reduced by high doses of manganese but otherreproductive parameters are unaffected. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Manganese has been tested in bioassays in rats and mice. No clear evidence of carcinogenicity has beenfound in either species. Some positive in vitro mutagenicity tests have been reported, although results are generally mixed. Studies in mice have indicated that manganese is not mutagenic in vivo . Mechanism of toxicity Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the neurotoxicity of manganese, including irreversible oxidation of dopamine, via the reduction of Mn3+to Mn2+or interference with calcium. Other hypotheses include known neurotoxin at high occupational levels of inhalation exposure. However, it hasalso been suggested that exposure from lower levels in drinking water may result in more subtleneurological effects in human populations. Neurological effects have been reported at estimatedintakes of 3.6-4.6 mg manganese from water, though comparable intakes have been negative in otherstudies. Other more limited data suggest that adverse effects may occur at even lower intake levels inchildren. In laboratory animals, adverse effects have been reported following long term exposure tomanganese at doses greater than 50-200 mg/kg bw/ day. Detailed neurological examinations wereperformed in only one study in mice which detected effects at /H11091130 mg/kg bw/ day.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2153Part 3 Trace Elements3 Vulnerable groups Anaemic individuals may be vulnerable to the toxic effects of manganese due to the increased absorption that occurs in states of iron deficiency. Groups with impaired biliary clearance, such aspatients with liver disease or older people, may also be susceptible to manganese accumulation andtoxicity. It has also been reported that ethanol and long-term use of anti-psychotic drugs increases thesusceptibility of humans to manganese toxicity. Genetic variations No genetic variations increasing susceptibility to manganese have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Kondakis et al., 1989 This was a retrospective study of three cohorts exposed to water containing 0.0036-0.015, 0.08-0.25 or 1.8-2.3 mg/L manganese. The subjects were all aged over 50 years and had been exposed to manganesefor /H1102210 years. No estimates of the actual amount of water consumed or the manganese content of the diet were provided, although the 3 cohorts were considered to be comparable. Assuming 2L/ day waterconsumption, intakes for the three groups can be estimated to be 0.0072-0.03, 0.16-0.5 and 3.6-4.6 mgmanganese plus dietary manganese. There was no difference in blood manganese levels in subjects fromthe 3 areas, but hair manganese was higher in subjects in the area with the highest level of manganese. Ithas been noted (US DHHS) that hair manganese is a useful measure of exposed versus unexposedpopulations but that it is of limited use in assessing individual exposure. The authors suggested that thiscould be because blood levels are highly variable and depend on how recent intake is, and thus couldmask the influence of manganese stored in body tissues. A history was taken and a physical examinationconducted by a neurologist unaware of the manganese exposure status. Neurological signs andsymptoms were scored and were elevated in subjects from the highest manganese area. The symptomsscored ranged from depression, fatigue and hallucinations to tremor and impaired reflexes. Some of thesymptoms were relatively subjective (e.g. fatigue) and it is uncertain whether one or two unusual 'outlier'individuals with a number of symptoms and/ or signs may have produced the observed elevation in thehigh intake group. The authors noted that an effect was apparent at exposure levels which werenegative in occupational studies. The authors attributed this finding to the age of the subjects, makingthem more susceptible to neuronal loss with ageing. The study was limited by inconsistent evidence ofsignificant excess exposure and the subjective ascertainment of clinical effects. Vieregge et al., 1995 This was a retrospective study of two cohorts exposed to water containing /H110210.05 mg/L or /H110220.3 mg/L (range 0.3-2.16 mg/L) manganese. The subjects in the groups were aged 41-84 (mean = 57.5) yearsand 41-86 (mean 56.9) years. Long duration of exposure (10-40 years) to manganese had taken place. Noestimates of the actual amount of water consumed or of the manganese content of the diet were 2163provided by the authors, but the cohorts were considered to be comparable. Assuming 2 L/ day water consumption, manganese intakes of 0.1 and 4.3 mg from water can be estimated. A neurologist blindedto the group status of the participants conducted the examination. No significant differences in bloodmanganese levels or neurological scores were found between the two groups. The authors noted theconflict with the findings of Kondakis et al ., which they attributed to the greater age of the participants in that study. This study was also limited by the lack of exposure data. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 4.9 mg/ day 97.5th percentile: 8.2 mg/ (TDS, Supplements 10 mg manganese/ day (Annex 4)Water 0.1 mg/ day (assuming UK level of 0.05 mg/L and consumption of 2 L/ day).Estimated maximum intake: 8.2 mg + 10 mg + 0.1 mg = 18 mg/ day Tea drinkers are a potential high intake group, though the bioavailability of manganese in tea is unclear and may be low due to the presence of tannins. Risk assessment Cumulative exposure to manganese causes neurotoxicity in both humans and animals. Occupationalexposure to manganese by inhalation has been associated with manganism, a condition similar toParkinson's disease. This condition occurs as a result of inhalation exposure of high levels of manganeseand is not relevant to the assessment of lower levels of manganese in food. It has generally been considered that manganese uptake from oral exposure is subject to homeostatic control. However, there is also a suggestion of less severe neurotoxic effects at lower levels of exposurefrom consuming drinking water containing higher levels of manganese. The reported symptoms includemuscle pain, fatigue, tremor, memory problems and impaired reflexes. Although other human data areavailable as noted above and in the review, it is not possible to draw conclusions from these due toproblems with co-exposure, study design or lack of data. Animal data are also available and indicate similar neurotoxic effects to those reported in humans. However, the neurotoxic effects are inevitably of a less subtle nature than the symptoms assessed inhuman studies and so these have not been considered further. Animal studies have also reportedadverse effects on haematology and reproductive parameters.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2173Part 3 Trace Elements3 ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL The data are insufficient to establish a Safe Upper Level for manganese. Manganese is known to cause neurotoxicity at high levels of exposure. In humans, this occurs as a result of inhalation exposure. However, there is also a suggestion of less severe neurotoxic effects occurring atlower levels of exposure from the consumption of contaminated well or drinking water. Two largeepidemiological studies show apparently conflicting results where subjects were exposed to watercontaining manganese at levels of 1.8-2.3 positive) and 0.3-2.1 mg/L (Vieregge et al., negative). However, these studies may not be incompatible given the higher range of manganese levels measured in the Kondakis study and the greater age of the participants (increasing agetheoretically conferring potentially greater vulnerability). A major limitation of both studies is the failureto provide water consumption or dietary manganese intake data. If it is assumed that waterconsumption is 2 L/ day, the resulting intakes from water would have been approximately 3.6 - 4.6 and0.6 - 4.4 mg/ day. The contribution from food is more difficult to estimate. Little information on diet isprovided in the Vieregge study. It should also be noted that the effect level in the Kondakis study isapparently lower than occupational exposure levels not associated with adverse effects. The authorsconsidered that this may be due to the increased sensitivity of the ageing brain to manganese. Other epidemiological studies suggest adverse effects at lower levels of manganese exposure but these are too limited in design to draw any conclusions. For guidance purposes, it is reasonable to assume that inthe general population, a supplemental intake of up to 4 mg manganese/ day in addition to the diet wouldbe unlikely to produce adverse effects (equivalent to 0.07 mg/kg bw for a 60 kg adult) based on theNOAEL from the Vieregge study. No uncertainty factor is required as the NOAEL is based on a largeepidemiological study. Using the NOAEL from the Kondakis study, it can be assumed that up to 0.5 mg/ daymanganese (equivalent to 0.008 mg/kg bw for a 60 kg adult) in addition to the diet would not result inadverse effects in older people. Assuming a dietary intake of 8.2 mg, acceptable total manganese intakescan be estimated to be 12.2 mg/ day in the general population (equivalent to 0.2 mg/kg bw in a 60 kg adult)and 8.7 mg/ day (equivalent to 0.15 mg/kg bw in a 60 kg adult) for older people. Some population groups may be exposed to high levels of manganese as a result of tea consumption. The significance of this level of exposure is uncertain. References COMA (1998).

Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences 22, 286-289 2183Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 219General information Chemistry The transition element molybdenum exists in five oxidation states (II - IV), the predominant states are Mo (IV) and Mo (VI). Within this risk assessment, the word molybdenum refers to ionic molybdenumexcept where the specific compound is stated. Natural occurrence Molybdenum does not exist naturally in the metallic state, but occurs in association with otherelements. The predominant form of molybdenum occurring in soil and natural waters is the molybdateanion, MoO 4-2. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Generally, foodstuffs from above ground plant material, such as legumes, leafy vegetables and cauliflower, contain relatively high concentrations of molybdenum compared with food from tubers oranimals. The 1994 TDS found the highest levels of in nuts (0.96 mg/kg fresh weight),canned vegetables (0.31 mg/kg fresh weight) and cereals (0.23 mg/kg fresh weight). Few data areavailable on the variability of molybdenum content of individual plant species, but it is affected by thesoil molybdenum concentration and pH, with molybdenum uptake increasing with soil pH. Foodstuffsfrom plants grown in alkaline or neutral soils with high molybdenum concentrations can be expected tohave the highest molybdenum levels. Molybdenum is available in food supplements at levels up to 0.33 mg and licensed medicines. The latter are used (maximum daily dose 0.25 mg) to treat patients with malabsorption states and conditionsleading to hypoproteinaemia and in perioperative nutritional support. Other sources of exposure Most natural waters contain low levels of molybdenum. The WHO recommends a maximum level ofmolybdenum in drinking water of 0.07 mg/L and notes that concentrations of molybdenum in drinkingwater are typically less than 0.01 mg/L. However, in areas near mining sites, molybdenumconcentrations up to 0.2 mg/L have been reported (WHO, 1993). Recommended amounts COMA has not set a RNI value for molybdenum. WHO (1993) estimated a daily requirement formolybdenum of between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ day for adults. Analysis of tissue levels and molybdenum status Molybdenum can be measured in whole blood, serum and various tissues.Risk Assessment Molybdenum 3Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Molybdenum has been reported to be beneficial to various groups of individuals, including those with sulphite sensitivity, asthmatics with elevated urinary ratios to intravenous sulphur contianing amino acids. Molybdenum has been claimed to reduce the incidence and severity of dental caries. Function The basis of the importance of molybdenum is in its role in metalloenzymes. All of the molybdoenzymes are oxidoreductases, which exploit the variable valency states of molybdenum. Themolybdenum in molybdoenzymes is inserted as part of a prosthetic group, known as the 'molybdenumcofactor'. In humans, xanthine oxidase and sulphite oxidase are important molybdoenzymes. Deficiency Molybdenum deficiency has not been identified in free-living human or animal species. It has, however,been identified in a single subject receiving total parenteral nutrition and can be achieved in animalstudies. In goats, a molybdenum deficient diet was associated with reduced fertility and increasedmortality in both the mothers and the offspring. In a rare inherited metabolic disorder, molybdenum deficiency is associated with genetic deficiency of the molybdenum pterin cofactors. Neurological disorders, abnormal urinary metabolites, dislocatedocular lenses and failure to thrive are observed. The disorder is fatal by the age of 2-3 years. Interactions It is recognised that molybdenum interacts with copper and sulphates in living organisms, but themechanism of this interaction has not been elucidated. The presence of dietary copper and sulphateaffects the amount of molybdenum absorbed and retained by the body. Absorption Absorption of molybdenum varies over a wide range (25 - 93%). Reports suggest that solublemolybdenum compounds are readily absorbed, whilst insoluble compounds are not. Distribution Molybdenum occurs in low concentrations in all the fluids and tissues of the body. The greatestamounts are found in the kidney, liver, small intestine and adrenals. It is found largely asmolybdoenzymes. In plasma, molybdenum is bound specifically to /H9251 2-macroglobulin. Excretion Molybdenum is primarily excreted in the urine and experimental data from humans suggest that up to 80% of the absorbed amount is excreted via urine. Normally only small amounts are excreted in thefaeces with exceptions in certain gastrointestinal disorders.Part 3 Trace Elements3 2203Toxicity Human data Few data are available on human toxicity following ingestion. Food or water must contain more than 100 mg/kg to produce signs of toxicity, which include diarrhoea, anaemia and high levels of uric acid inthe blood. Elevated uric acid levels, which are associated with the onset of gout, are hypothesised to becaused by stimulation of xanthine oxidase by high molybdenum intake. Occupational exposure, byinhalation, to molybdenum containing dusts has been associated with pneumoconiosis. Animal data Although non-ruminant animals will develop symptoms of toxicity when fed high molybdenum diets,ruminants are much more sensitive. Thus the toxicity seen in these species cannot be related to theeffects that would be expected in man. The toxicity is primarily expressed as a copper deficiency andthe ambient sulphate level has a marked effect on the interaction between copper and molybdenum.Molybdenum toxicity in animals is commonly referred to as molybdenosis or teart. In appearance it issimilar to the disease of copper deficiency. Signs of molybdenum toxicity in animals include anaemia,anorexia, profound diarrhoea, joint abnormalities, osteoporosis, hair discoloration, reduced sexualactivity and death. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There is no evidence of carcinogenicity of molybdenum. No data are available on the genotoxicity ofmolybdenum compounds in vitro , although there is limited evidence of genotoxicity from in vivo tests, the reliability of which is questionable. Mechanism of toxicity No data have been identified. Dose response characterisation No data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations have been identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2213Part 3 Trace Elements3 Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Kovalsky et al., 1961 In a retrospective study of environmental exposure to increased molybdenum (form unclear), medical reports revealed a prevalence of gout in 31% and 18% of the exposed and control populations,respectively. Intake was calculated to be 10 - 15 mg molybdenum per day in the exposed populationcompared to 1 - 2 mg/ day in the control area. It is possible that the 1-2 mg intake produced a low levelof response. Symptoms included arthralgia in the hand, feet and knee joints, accompanied by elevatedblood and urine molybdenum levels. Animal data Fairhall et al., 1945 Molybdenum (as the trivalent form molybdenite, and as the hexavalent forms molybdenum trioxide, calcium molybdate and ammonium molybdate) was administered in the diet to rats at levels of 10 - 500 mg molybdenum/ animal/ day, for periods up to 232 days. No signs of toxicity were observed in thegroups ingesting molybdenite. In the groups receiving hexavalent molybdenum, signs of toxicity wereobserved at all dose levels and included loss of appetite, weight loss, a tendency to become quiet andlistless and premature death. One hundred percent mortality was recorded in the groups receiving/H11022100 mg hexavalent molybdenum/ animal/ day. Limited experimental details were provided. Arrington & Davies, 1953 Hexavalent molybdenum (sodium molybdate) was administered in the diet to groups of 2-5 weanling or mature rabbits at levels of 140, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg/kg diet (4, 15, 30, 60 or 120 mg/kg bw/ day- estimated) for up to 12 weeks (average survival being 3 - 54 days in the higher dose groups). In thehighest dose group 100% mortality was observed and 80% mortality in the group receiving 60 mg/kgbw/ day. Anaemia, anorexia, loss of weight, alopecia, dermatosis and effects on the skeletal system werenoted in animals receiving 30 mg/kg bw/ day and above. Limited experimental details were provided.Haemoglobin levels appear to decrease by /H1102250% within a few weeks of treatment. It is uncertain whether this is a specific effect or related to factors such as haemodilution. Data for the 500 ppm(4 and 15 mg/kg bw) group are not provided so it is uncertain whether the decrease would have alsohave been apparent at this level. Schroeder & Mitchener, 1971 Sodium molybdate (hexavalent molybdenum) was administered in drinking (0.0025 mg/kg bw/ day) and diet (0.07 mg/kg bw/ day) in lifetime studies over three generations of mice. In the first andsecond generations, 15/238 and 7 /242 premature deaths, respectively, were observed, compared to0/209 and 6/248 in the control populations. In the third generation increased numbers of prematuredeaths, maternal deaths, failure to breed, runting and production of single sex or dead litterswere observed. 2223Exposure assessment Total Water 0.02 mg/ day (estimated from 0.01 mg/L - WHO, 1993)Supplements up to 0.33 mg molybdenum (Annex 4)Estimated maximum + 0.02 + 0.33 = 0.56 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified. Risk assessment Few data are available concerning oral molybdenum toxicity in humans, but some data exist that suggest an increased incidence in gout-like symptoms (joint pains and increased serum uric acid) in populationswith a high molybdenum intake (1 - 15 mg/person/ day). The form of the molybdenum is uncertain. Fewdetails of this study are available. Some data are available from limited animal studies, which suggest that intakes of trivalent molybdenum of up to 500 mg/rat/ day may be without adverse effects, although these are not sufficiently reliable todraw any conclusions. It should be noted from the animal studies that signs of toxicity were observed instudies in which hexavalent molybdenum was administered. ESTABLISHMENT OF A GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from human or animal studies to establish a Safe Upper Level formolybdenum. There are few reliable data on the oral toxicity of molybdenum. A limited human study (Kovalsky et al ., 1961) suggests that intakes of /H110221 mg/ day could be associated with an increase in gout-like symptoms - joint pains and increased serum uric acid levels. The form of molybdenum to which the population wasexposed is unclear, but as exposure is via water and locally grown/produced food, it is most likely to bethe more toxic hexavalent molybdate ion. However, this epidemiological evidence is not robust, as thereis no means of unbiased assessment, no control group and the exposure to molybdenum cannotaccurately be determined. Lack of evidence makes it impossible to determine whether higher intakeswould be problematic. The available animal data are also limited. Signs of general/ systemic toxicity have been reported at doses of 30-75 bw/ day of molybdenum, appears to be less toxic. A multi-generation study in which mice werefed 0.0025 mg/kg bw/ day and 0.075 mg/kg sodium molybdate in drinking water and food respectivelyExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2233Part 3 Trace Elements3 also produced adverse effects such that the colony was not viable beyond the F2generation. The level at which this effect occurred was lower than intakes causing adverse effects in other studies. Thelimited details available on the study make it impossible to establish whether the effect was real, orwhether an effect unrelated to treatment occurred as a result of inbreeding. The molybdenum intake from the UK diet (estimated maximum intake 0.23 mg/ day) is not expected to present any risk to health, but there are insufficient data on the safety of molybdenum intakes in excessof those naturally occurring in the diet to be able to provide further guidance.

World Health Organisation, Geneva. 2243Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 225General information Chemistry Nickel is an abundant metallic element which can exist in valency states of 0, +1, + 2 and +3 and form a variety of compounds. Within this risk assessment, the word nickel refers to ionic nickel, unless specificcompounds are stated. Natural occurrence Nickel and nickel compounds are found in soil, water, animals and plants. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Nickel is present in a variety of foods particularly pulses, oats (0.18 mg/kg in miscellaneous cereals) andnuts (1.77 mg/kg). Lower levels of nickel are present in drinking water. Nickel is present in a few multi-mineral food supplements at levels of approximately 0.005 mg/ daily dose. The average intake of nickelin the UK is 0.13 mg/ day from food, and 0.02-0.04 mg/ day from drinking water. Other sources of exposure Nickel-plated objects, such as jewellery, coins and nickel-containing implants, are sources of internal anddermal exposure. Recommended amounts COMA was unable to set recommended amounts for nickel intake. Analysis of tissue levels and nickel status Markers for nickel status have not been established. Nickel may be analysed in serum. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects No non-nutritional beneficial effects of nickel have been clearly identified. Function Nickel is present in a number of enzymes in plants and microorganisms.In humans, nickel influencesiron absorption and metabolism, and may be an essential component of the haemopoietic process.Risk Assessment Nickel 3Deficiency Nickel deficiency has not been observed in humans. In animals deficiency is associated with disturbances such as reduced growth, impaired reproductive function and reduced haematopoiesis. Interactions It has been suggested that high levels of nickel may impair absorption or utilisation of iron when ironstatus is low. It has been hypothesised (on the basis of their chemistry and biology and limited in vitro studies) that magnesium and nickel may interact, but no toxic effects have been observed to result fromsuch interaction in vivo . Absorption and bioavailability Absorption of nickel takes place in the small intestine via a carrier-mediated mechanism but passive diffusion may also occur. In a fasting state, the fraction of nickel salts absorbed after ingestion as asolution is between 20-25%. However absorption of nickel from solution can be reduced to less than 1%when ingested with food, ascorbic acid, milk, tea, coffee and orange juice. Distribution and metabolism Nickel binds to albumin, histidine and /H92512 macroglobulin, and is distributed widely throughout the tissues. The highest nickel levels are found in the bone, lung, kidney, liver and endocrine glands. Nickel isalso found in breast milk, saliva, nails and hair. Transplacental transfer of nickel has been demonstratedin rodents. Excretion Absorbed nickel is excreted in the urine predominantly in the form of low molecular weight complexes.Non-absorbed nickel is eliminated via the faeces together with a fraction of absorbed nickel that isexcreted in the bile. Nickel is also eliminated in sweat. Toxicity Human data Acute nickel exposure is associated with a variety of clinical symptoms and signs which includegastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea), visual disturbance(temporary left homonymous hemianopia), headache, giddiness, wheezing and cough. Chronic inhalation of nickel and its compounds is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.Trials investigating nickel sensitisation are reviewed below. No additional data have been identified.Part 3 Trace Elements3 2263Animal data Nickel has moderate to low acute toxicity. In laboratory animals, long-term exposure to nickel is associated with adverse effects on haematological parameters, decreased body weights and changes inorgan weights. These effects are generally produced at doses greater than 5 to 10 mg/kg bw/ day. In reproductive toxicity studies, nickel is associated with an increase in perinatal mortality. Abnormal embryonic development has been reported following high doses of nickel chloride given by intra-peritoneal injection, which were also associated with maternal toxicity. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity In animal studies, orally administered nickel was not found to be carcinogenic. Nickel compounds causechromosome aberrations in cultured cells in vitro but are generally negative or weakly positive in in vitro bacterial mutation assays. Chromosome aberrations have been observed in vivo in both humans and laboratory animals following exposure to nickel by inhalation and nickel is carcinogenic bythis route. Vulnerable groups Approximately 7-10% of the population (predominately women) are affected by nickel allergicdermatitis. There is evidence suggesting that nickel ingestion may contribute to the exacerbation ofeczema in sensitised individuals. Iron-deficient individuals may be vulnerable to increased intestinal absorption of nickel, and thus to nickel sensitisation and adverse effects on haematopoiesis. Genetic variations No genetic variations that influence adverse reactions to nickel have been identified. Mechanism of toxicity Gastrointestinal effects are thought to be due to irritation rather than to specific toxicity. The chemicalstructure of the nickel atom is conducive to formation of antigens by binding to peptides or proteins,hence its strong sensitising potential. Nickel is thought to bind to histone proteins, generatingpotentially DNA damaging oxygen radicals through a redox cycling process. The interaction isdependent on the delivery of ionic nickel to target sites. Other mechanisms explaining thecarcinogenicity of nickel following inhalation, such as inhibition of DNA repair, interference with cellsignalling, calcium metabolism and transcription factors, have been suggested. The carcinogenic effectsfollowing inhalation are not relevant to low level oral exposure to nickel. Dose-response characterisation The lowest reported oral dose associated with acute effects in humans was 0.05 mg/kg bw (1.2 mg in a60 kg adult).Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2273Part 3 Trace Elements3 The dose response associated with sensitisation is difficult to define since sensitised subjects differ widely in their sensitivity, so that even a very small exposure could theoretically trigger a response insome individuals. Doses as low as 0.6 mg have resulted in exacerbation of eczema in sensitisedindividuals. Adverse effects are produced in laboratory animals, at doses above 5 to 10 mg/kg bw/ day, although some studies have reported effects at lower doses. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human Christensen and Moller, 1975 This was a double-blind crossover study on the provocation of eczema. 12 patients were given a placebo or nickel sulphate challenge. Oral nickel sulphate (5.6 mg nickel) provoked a reaction in 9/12sensitised subjects. The test was repeated with the reversed medication on a later occasion. Theplacebo did not provoke a response. Kaaber et al., 1978 Seventeen out of 28 patients with chronic nickel dermatitis experienced aggravation of symptoms when given a 2.5 mg oral dose of nickel, but no effect with placebo. Dermatitis improved in 9 of the 17patients when they were put on a low nickel diet for 6 weeks and worsened when the normal diet wasresumed. The nickel content of the diet was not measured but nickel excretion was measured in 14 ofthe patients and was found to decrease, indicating that nickel in the normal diet can contributeto dermatitis. Gawkrodger et al., 1986 In a double blind crossover study, an oral dose of 5.6 mg (but not 0.4 mg or 2.5 mg) nickel produced a reaction in nickel-sensitised subjects more frequently than the placebo. Nielsen et al., 1990 In a single-blind cross-over study, 12 nickel sensitive subjects were given a supplementary high nickel diet for 4 days. The additional dose of nickel was 0.49 mg by analysis, this dose was lower than doses usedin other oral challenge studies where reactions were not provoked. Hand eczema was exacerbated in10/12 patients. Menne and Maibach, 1991 Following a review of 12 published nickel challenge studies (1975-1988) using a variety of designs, the authors concluded that a dose-response existed for exposure to oral nickel and the exacerbation ofdermatitis. Thus, a minority of nickel sensitive subjects would react to doses of /H110211.25 mg but the majority will react to oral doses of 5.5 mg nickel. 2283Nielsen et al., 1999 Eight non-allergic volunteers were given nickel in drinking water, followed by scrambled egg meals at different time intervals. When the nickel was ingested 30-60 minutes before the meal, peak serum nickellevels were reached 1 hour after water intake and were thirteen fold higher than when the nickel wasingested with the meal. Where the nickel and meal were taken together, a delayed peak in serum levelsoccurred 3 hours after ingestion. Nine out of 20 nickel-sensitised patients with vesicular hand eczemaof the pompholyx type, developed flare-up of symptoms 12 hours after ingesting as little as 0.012 mg/kgbody weight nickel in solution (0.003 mg/mL), on a empty stomach, with abstinence from foodmaintained for a further 4 hours. The dose given can be estimated to be equivalent to 0.720 mg in a60 kg adult. Twenty age-matched non nickel-sensitive controls, with similar hand eczema symptoms,exhibited no exacerbation following oral nickel challenge. The dermatologists assessing the symptomswere not informed of the status of the patients. Animal studies Ambrose et al., 1976 Groups of 25 rats of each sex were fed nickel, as nickel sulphate hexahydrate, in the diet for 2 years. The doses were estimated to be 0, 5, 50 or 125 mg/kg bw/ day. Decreased body weights, significantlyincreased heart and decreased liver weights were observed in both the mid and top dose groups.Analyses of blood, urine and tissue histology revealed no significant effects, but few data were reported.Poor survival of animals from the control and all dose groups was a major limitation of this study. Groups of 3 beagle dogs of each sex were fed diets containing nickel, as nickel sulphate hexahydrate, for 2 years. The doses were estimated to be 0, 3, 29 or 70 mg/kg bw/ day. In the highest dose group,decreased body weights and increased kidney and liver weights were observed.No significanthaematological effects were observed, and histological changes were seen only in the high dose group. In a 3 generation rat study, groups of 20 rats of each sex were fed diets containing nickel, as nickel sulphate hexahydrate, for 11 weeks prior to breeding of three generations (F 0, F1, F2), throughout pregnancy and lactation. The doses were estimated to be 5, 25 or 50 mg/kg bw/ day nickel. No effects on fertility,gestation, viability or lactation were observed. An increased number of stillborn rats was apparent in alltreatment groups of the F1 generation but not in the F2 and F3 generations. The number of siblings perlitter and siblings weaned decreased as the dose of nickel increased. Body weights were markedlyreduced in the offspring of the dams exposed to 50 mg/kg nickel. No statistical analysis was reported. Smith et al., 1993 Groups of 34 female rats were given nickel chloride in drinking water for 11 weeks prior to breeding and throughout 2 gestation (G1 and G2) and lactation (L1 and (L2) periods. The average doses provided by thewater were estimated to be 1.33, 6.8 or 31.8 mg/kg bw/ day nickel. No overt toxicity was reported. Therewas a dose-related increase in pups born dead or dying shortly after birth. This was significant at topdose at G1 and all doses at G2. Body weight gain was reduced in dams in the mid and top dose group inG1. Reproductive performance was unaffected by treatment. Although it is of unusual design, this was awell-conducted and reported study.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2293Part 3 Trace Elements3 Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Water water (NAS/NRC)Supplements up to 0.005 mg/ day (Annex 4; OTC, 2001).Estimated 0.04 + 0.005 = 0.26 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment The carcinogenicity of nickel compounds which occurs through inhalation mainly as a result of occupational exposure does not appear to be relevant to oral exposure from low levels in food,although data are lacking in this area. In animals, nickel caused a decrease in bodyweight in dogs and an increase in kidney weight at a dose of 70 mg/kg bw/ day. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats, nickel was shown not to affect reproductionat doses up to 50 mg/kg bw/ day. However, there was an increase in the number of pups stillborn ordying shortly after birth with the numbers stillborn increasing as dose increased from 5 to 50 mg/kgbw/ day. At 50 mg/kg bw/ day, there was a significant decrease in body weight of the pups. The key toxic endpoint for nickel in humans is the aggravation of nickel sensitisation, for which a threshold is unclear but which is possible at the levels of nickel found in food. It is also possible thatoral intakes of nickel as low as 0.49 mg (Nielsen, 1990) could trigger symptoms, particularly in the fastingstate. Although certain sensitised subjects will be aware that exposure to nickel may be responsible fortheir dermatological symptoms, other subjects may only be aware that they are unable to toleratecertain jewellery. They also may not be aware that their dermal symptoms could be aggravated by food. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL Nickel is a potent skin sensitiser, with 7-10% of the UK population reportedly affected. Dietary nickelcan cause flare-ups of dermatitis and while there is some discussion about the levels at which thiseffect occurs, it appears that levels as low as 0.49 to 0.72 mg may be able to trigger a reaction,particularly if taken on an empty stomach. 2303In animals, nickel has fairly non-specific toxic effects, but appears to be associated with increased perinatal mortality in multi-generation studies. Using the LOAEL of 1.3 mg/kg bw/ day derived from thestudy by Smith et al. (1993) and applying the conventional uncertainty factors of 3 for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation, 10 for inter-species variation and 10 for intra-individual variation, indicates that total nickelintake of 0.0043 mg/kg bw/ day would not be expected to have effects in non-sensitised individuals(equivalent to 0.26 mg/ day in a 60 kg adult). Prevalence of nickel sensitivity is high and many individuals may not be aware that they are sensitised. Furthermore, the absorption of nickel is greater when taken on an empty stomach and in the absence offood, as may occur with supplements. It is therefore not possible to set a safe upper level or guidancefor supplemental intake of nickel. UK dietary intake of nickel in food is not expected to result inharmful effects.

Within this risk assessment, the word selenium refers to ionic selenium, except when specificselenium compounds are mentioned. Natural occurrence Selenium is found in soils and rocks and consequently may then accumulate in plants. Occurrence in foods, food supplements and medicines Selenium is present in foods particularly fish (0.32 mg/kg), offal (0.42 mg/kg), brazil nuts (0.25 mg/kg),eggs (0.16 mg/kg) and cereals (0.02 mg/kg). In foods, selenium is generally present as the amino acidderivatives selenomethionine and selenocysteine. Selenium is present in several licensed medicines bothalone and in combination with other substances, and is present in a number of food supplements atdoses up to 0.3 mg/ daily dose. Recommended amounts COMA set RNIs of 0.075 and 0.060 mg selenium/ day for males and females respectively, and 0.075 mgselenium/ day for lactating women (COMA, 1991). The lower limit of the WHO safe range of thepopulation mean intake to meet requirements is 0.040 mg selenium/ day. Analysis of tissue levels and selenium status Selenium can be measured directly in plasma, serum, red cells, nails and hair. It can also be determinedindirectly by measuring tissue glutathione peroxidase activity, although a plateau in activity may occurwith higher levels of selenium intake not producing a corresponding increase in activity. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Selenium has been claimed to reduce the incidence of a range of cancers, although the COMA reporton Nutritional aspects of the Development of Cancer (1998) considered there to be insufficientevidence for such a link. Beneficial effects of selenium intake on AIDS symptoms, male fertility, skindisorders, anxiety and asthma have also been claimed.Risk Assessment Selenium 3Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2333Function The biologically active form of selenium is selenocysteine. Selenocysteine is incorporated into selenoproteins, of which over thirty have been identified to date. The selenoproteins include theglutathione peroxidases, which protect against oxidative damage, the iodothyronine deiodinases(involved in the production of the hormone triiodothyronine from thyroxine), selenoprotein P (which isinvolved in antioxidant and functions) and the thioredoxin reductases (maintenance of theintracellular redox state). Deficiency In humans, selenium deficiency is associated with Keshan disease, an endemic cardiomyopathy whichparticularly affects children and women of child-bearing age, and possibly also Kashin-Beck disease, amusculoskeletal disorder. Interactions Since selenium is an essential component of the enzyme tetraiodothyronine 5'-deiodinase 1 (which isinvolved in iodine metabolism) there is a complex interaction between selenium and iodine. Severeselenium deficiency may increase the hypothyroid stress caused by iodine deficiency. However,supplementation with selenium alone may aggravate iodine deficiency by accelerating iodine loss. This interaction is likely to be significant only in cases of severe deficiency. Selenium interacts with other metals and ascorbic acid. Selenium status affects the metabolism and thus the toxicities of some xenobiotics. Absorption and bioavailability Selenium compounds are readily absorbed from the small intestine. The extent of absorption dependson the nature of the compound, with soluble selenate and selenomethionine being most readilyabsorbed. Distribution and metabolism Selenium is widely distributed throughout the body and can be detected in breast milk. Selenium hasalso been reported to cross the placenta in animals. Selenium levels are slightly higher in the liver andkidneys than in other tissues. Selenium can be incorporated into selenoproteins, bind to seleniumbinding proteins or be incorporated into volatile methylated metabolites, which are subsequentlyexcreted. Excretion Selenium is largely excreted in the urine, with volatile metabolites being excreted in the breath.Some faecal excretion occurs, particularly after chronic administration.Toxicity The toxicity of selenium depends on the nature of the selenium compound, particularly its solubility. Thus, insoluble selenium sulphide is much less toxic than selenite, selenate and selenomethionine.Selenium toxicity is cumulative. Human data Acute selenium toxicity in humans is characterised by hypersalivation, emesis and a garlic aroma on thebreath due to the excretion of volatile selenium metabolites.These effects may be accompanied bygastrointestinal effects (severe vomiting and diarrhoea), hair loss, neurological disturbance (restlessness,spasms, tachycardia) and fatigue. Chronic selenium poisoning, or selenosis, is associated with changes to the hair and nails, skin lesions and clinical neurological effects such as peripheral hypoaesthesia, acroparasthaesiae, pain andhyperreflexia; numbness, convulsions and paralysis may then develop. Studies undertaken in subjectsliving in seleniferous areas of the USA and China indicate that selenosis is associated with intakesgreater than 0.91 mg/ day (0.015 mg/kg bw for a 60 kg adult). Supplementation trials Supplementation of human volunteers with 0.2 mg/ day for 10 years did not result in selenosis (Clark et al., 1992).Other data from supplementation trials indicate that doses of up to 0. 388 mg selenium/ day for shorter periods are without apparent ill effect, although a formal clinical examination for symptomsand/ or signs of selenosis was not always made. Animal data Selenium has moderate to high acute oral toxicity. Acute toxicity results in effects on the nervoussystem, liver and lungs. Chronic exposure results in reduced growth rates and weight gain. High levels ofselenium exposure have adverse effects on some reproductive parameters, such as the oestrous cycle infemales and sperm concentration and quality in males. Multi-generation studies suggest that seleniumreduces post-natal survival and weight of the offspring. Specific teratogenic effects have been observedin birds, fish, sheep and pigs and in hamsters at maternally toxic doses. Selenium is not teratogenic inthe macaque monkey. Some studies have indicated that pre-weanling animals are more sensitive toselenium toxicity. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Selenium sulphide is carcinogenic in rats and mice. Other selenium compounds are not carcinogenic.The results of in vitro mutagenicity tests are inconsistent. Selenium compounds are largely negative in the available in vivo mutagenicity tests. An increase in chromosomal aberrations in hamster bone marrow has been reported, but this occurred at lethal doses of sodium selenite only .Part 3 Trace Elements3 2343Mechanism of toxicity No specific mechanisms have been identified. However, redox cycling of auto-oxidisable metabolites, glutathione depletion, inhibition of protein depletion of and thereplacement of sulphur by selenium in critical sulphydryl groups have been suggested. Dose-response characterisation The epidemiological studies of Yang and colleagues demonstrated a dose response relationship forselenium toxicity. In adult humans the estimated intake associated with the onset of selenosis (clinicalselenium poisoning, which includes the occurrence of nail, hair and skin lesions) is 0.910 mg/ day(0.015 mg/kg bw/ day). Acute selenium poisoning is harder to assess but appears to occur at doses of0.5 mg/kg bw and above. In animals, doses of soluble selenium compounds of approximately 0.5 mg/kg bw/ day are not associated with any adverse effects. Vulnerable groups In subjects suffering from iodine as well as selenium deficiency, supplementation with selenium alonemay aggravate the iodine deficiency. However, this is likely to be significant only in cases of severedeficiency and would not be applicable to the UK. Genetic variations No relevant genetic variations have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Studies in seleniferous areas Yang et al., 1983The intake of selenium was investigated in areas of China where selenium intakes were classified as high (with or without endemic selenosis), adequate or deficient. The average daily intake of selenium was0.75 mg/ day (range 0.24-1.51) in areas where selenium intake was high but where there was no selenosis.In areas of chronic selenosis, selenium intake was 3.2-6.99 mg/ day. Intake was estimated frominformation on dietary habits and by measuring the selenium content of typical cereal andvegetable staples.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2353Part 3 Trace Elements3 Yang et al., 1989a Individual selenium intake was calculated for the inhabitants of areas with low, moderate or high selenium levels (selenosis cases occurred in high selenium areas only). Selenium intake was thencorrelated with selenium levels in a range of tissues from the same individuals. At physiological levels ofselenium intake, whole blood selenium levels were the best reflection of intake, whereas at higherintake levels, hair, finger and toenails were more sensitive markers. Selenium intake was calculated froma three day dietary survey, collecting and weighing samples of raw and cooked food. Yang et al., 1989b Individual selenium intake was calculated for the inhabitants of areas with low, moderate or high selenium levels (1989a study described above). Selenium intake was then correlated with a range ofbiochemical parameters. Morphological changes in the fingernails were used as the main diagnosticcriterion of selenosis and this occurred largely in adults. There was no correlation between bloodselenium levels and clinical signs attributed to day to day variations in selenium intake causing variationsin blood selenium levels. However, long term selenosis was apparent in 5 patients with blood seleniumconcentrations in excess of 1.054 to 1.854 mg/L. This concentration was estimated to represent aselenium intake of 0.91 mg/ day and was considered by the authors to be the level indicating marginalselenium toxicity. Prothrombin time increased significantly from 12.2 seconds to 13.4-13.5 at seleniumintake levels greater than 0.85 mg/ day; it is unclear whether this is outside the normal range for thispopulation. White cell count also increased with selenium intake. Whole blood reduced glutathionelevels were lower in the high selenium intake areas compared to the low ones. No evidence of livertoxicity was apparent but the authors suggested that the population may have adapted to high seleniumintakes. No specific neurological symptoms were found. There was no evidence of birth defects inhumans (although it was noted that malformed chickens were hatched from locally produced eggs).The authors suggested that the maximum safe level of selenium intake was 0.4 mg/ day (using a safetyfactor of 2). Longnecker et al., 1991 Over a 2 year period, 142 subjects were recruited from ranches in the USA where a high selenium intake was suspected.Subjects underwent physical examinations, completed health questionnaires, andprovided tissue samples. Duplicate -plate collections were used to estimate selenium intake. Specific questions were asked about neurological symptoms, and changes to hair and nails. A range of clinicalchemistry tests were also conducted. Approximately half of the subjects had selenium intakes/H110220.2 mg/ day (average 0.239 mg/ day, range 0.724 mg/ day). No physical characteristics of selenium toxicity, or any other significant effects were apparent. Increasing selenium intake wasassociated with increasing serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels but the differences, even at theextremes of intake, were considered to be clinically insignificant. The increase in prothrombin time foundby Yang was not apparent in this study. Yang and Zhou, 1994 In a follow-up study of the 5 selenosis patients described in Yang et al ., (1989b) a decrease in average blood selenium levels from 1.346 to 0.968 mg/L was reported which was attributed to dietary changes.The decrease in blood selenium levels was associated with a loss of clinical signs of selenosis. Thecorresponding safe selenium intake was equivalent to approximately 0.8 mg/ day), which was suggestedby the authors to represent the mean NOAEL. The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for thecorrelation equivalent to an intake of 0.6 mg/ day, was taken to approximate the maximum individual 2363safe selenium intake. Based on these data, Yang and Zhou confirmed the previous recommendation that 0.4 mg/ day as the maximum safe daily dietary intake for selenium. The reporting of the work of Yang and colleagues is confusing since Yang et al. (1989b) reported that there was no correlation between blood selenium and selenium intake due to daily variation in foodsupply. However, a regression equation was then used to estimate selenium intakes in subjects withselenosis from their blood levels. This appears to be based on work in Yang et al. (1989a) which used plots of average blood selenium levels and average selenium intakes to derive a regression equation.Generally, blood selenium is considered to be a reliable indicator of selenium intake where thecomposition of the diet is not very varied. Studies in non-seleniferous areas Clark et al., 1996In a double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial, 1312 patients (with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma) were given a 0.2 mg selenium supplement, or placebo, for up to 10.3 years(mean 4.5 years) in an attempt to establish whether selenium had a protective effect on skin cancer.Patients were evaluated for signs of selenosis (pathological nail changes, brittle hair and garlic breath)every 6 months. The dietary selenium intake of the participants was unknown but mean baseline serumselenium levels were comparable between the groups. No dermatological signs of selenium toxicitywere found. A total of 14 and 21 patients from the control and selenium supplementation groups,respectively, withdrew from the trial as result of adverse effects (mainly gastrointestinal symptoms).Within each group the patients reporting adverse effects did not have significantly different plasmaselenium concentrations from those not reporting such effects. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 0.039 mg/ day 97.5 percentile: up to 0.3 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake: 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identifiedExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2373Part 3 Trace Elements3 Risk assessment Selenium has a variety of toxic endpoints in both animals and humans. In man, the first signs of chronic toxicity appear to be pathological changes to the hair and nails, followed by adverse effects on thenervous system. Changes in biochemical parameters have also been reported. The available studiesindicate the development of selenosis is associated with excess of 0.85 day(0.014 mg/kg bw for a 60 kg adult). Supplementation studies in humans indicate that up to 0.3 mg/ day additional selenium is not associated with overt adverse effects over a short period of time, although specific symptoms have not alwaysbeen investigated. However, the study by Clark, which specifically considered symptoms of selenosis,indicated that 0.2 mg/ day additional selenium for up to 10 years did not result in symptoms ofselenosis. In addition to reduced growth rates, similar symptoms to those in humans are found in animals treated with selenium. Selenium sulphide is carcinogenic but other selenium compounds are not. Selenium compounds are not mutagenic in vivo . Adverse effects have been reported on the reproductive system of various animals, though not primates as determined by Tarantal et al . (1991). Reproductive toxicity is not an issue that has been examined in detail in the available human epidemiological studies. ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL Key Studies: Yang et al . (1989 a and b) LOAEL: mg 0.45 mg total selenium/ day for daily consumptionover a lifetime The most sensitive indicators of selenium toxicity are changes in the nails and hair. In a study by Yang et al . (1989a and b) conducted in an area of China where dietary selenium exposure is high, selenium intakes were correlated with blood levels to determine the intakes at which marginal selenium toxicityoccur. This was at a total intake of 0.91 mg/ day selenium. There are some discrepancies in the NOAELs described by Yang and colleagues in that the range of intakes in high selenium areas that was not associated with selenosis were given as 0.24-1.51 mg/ daywhereas a LOAEL of 0.91 mg selenium/ day was determined in a later study. This may have resulted fromthe way in which the dietary intakes were calculated but it has also been argued that subjects may havebecome sensitised to selenium as a result of earlier outbreaks of selenosis. A follow up study (Yang andZhou, 1994) indicated that the symptoms of selenosis could be reversed if selenium intake was reduced. 2383The intake of 0.91 mg selenium/ day produced slight effects and was close to a NOAEL. Because of this an uncertainty factor of 2 was applied for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation. Because this is based on apopulation study, an uncertainty factor for inter-individual variation is not required. A Safe Upper Levelfor total selenium intake of 0.45 mg/ day can therefore be derived (equivalent to 0.005 mg/kg bw/ dayin a 60 kg adult). This Safe Upper Level is consistent with the findings of other groups who havereported that intakes of 0.2 mg/ day supplemental selenium and 0.24 mg/ day total selenium are notassociated with any adverse effects (Clark et al ., 1996; Longnecker et al ., 1991). Assuming a maximum intake of 0.1 mg/ day from food, a margin of 0.35 mg/ day selenium is available for supplementation orother additional intake. No vulnerable groups have been identified.

It is rarely found as the metallic element in nature and is usually found combined with other substances, most commonly as the dioxide (SnO2). It has oxidation states of II and IV and the corresponding oxides of these states are amphoteric. Organotin compounds can besynthesised and are highly toxic, but these are not found in food, beverages or food supplements.Within this risk assessment, the word tin refers to ionic tin, except where specific tin compounds arementioned. Natural occurrence The occurrence of tin in various organisms from different localities is highly dependent on the existenceof local mineral sources of tin. Although not commonly present in fresh water, it occurs at aconcentration of about 0.003 mg/kg in seawater. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines. The presence of tin in fresh food of both vegetable and animal origin is highly dependent on theconcentration of tin in the soil of the area in which the food is produced. Canning may result indissolution of the tin lining of the can, particularly if the products are acidic. The regulatory limit fortotal tin in canned products is 200 mg/kg. The major dietary sources of tin are fruit products andcanned vegetables. Stannous chloride, SnCl 2, is a permitted food additive (E512). Tin is present in some multivitamin and mineral food supplements at levels of up to 0.01 mg in the daily dose recommendedby the manufacturer. No medicinal products containing tin have been licensed. Other sources of exposure Trace quantities of tin are detectable in the air, the concentrations in any area depending on the extent of industrial activity. Water and airborne tin provide only minimal exposure for humans. Recommended amounts There are no recommended daily intakes for tin compounds since it has not been proven to be anessential element.Risk Assessment Tin 3Analysis of tissue levels and tin status Tin levels can be measured by spark source mass spectrometry, radioactivation analysis or x-ray fluorescence analysis. Tin concentrations in fluids, tissues, or organs of the human body have beenmeasured. There is no measurement used to indicate tin status. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Tin is present in some dietary supplements and has been claimed to delay hair loss, male patternbaldness and hearing loss. Function There is no proven biological function for tin. It has been suggested that, because of its coordinationchemistry, it may contribute to macromolecular structure and function at the active site ofmetalloenzymes. Deficiency Naturally occurring deficiency of tin in free-living humans or animal species has not been demonstrated.Experiments on induced deficiency of experimental animals in isolators have been criticised and otherevidence claimed to support the hypothesis that tin is an essential element is not convincing. Interactions In humans, ingestion of tin has been shown to lower net retention of zinc. It can also alter the excretionof selenium in faeces and urine, but without affecting the overall balance. In rats the absorption ofcopper has been reported to be decreased by ingestion of tin. Absorption and bioavailability The gastrointestinal absorption of tin is low. The solubility and bioavailability of inorganic tincompounds varies and is dependent on the oxidation state. Distribution and metabolism The tissues and organs that accumulate the highest concentrations of tin are bone, lymph nodes, liver,lung, ovary, testis and kidney. No metabolism of tin has been demonstrated. Excretion The majority of ingested inorganic tin is excreted in the faeces (about 95-99% of ingested dose in animalstudies), with the remainder in the urine.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2413Part 3 Trace Elements3 Toxicity Human data Reports of acute poisoning have been associated with high concentrations of tin in drinks or solid foods. Subjects presented with gastrointestinal effects (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea),and headache and chills within 1-2 hours of consuming the implicated foodstuff, and recovered within 1-2 days. However, there is little consistency in the reports in terms of the nature of the foodstuff, orthe concentration and chemical form of the tin, all of which may influence human toxicity. Animal data. In studies of the acute oral administration of tin to animals, cats have shown a vomiting response,similar to that of humans. Most studies of the subchronic toxicity of tin have been carried out in rats, a species which lacks an emetic reflex. Reduction in body weight gain, reduced appetite and reduced feed conversion efficiencyhave been reported. These, together with abdominal distension and at autopsy, distended caeca,reddening of the mucosal surface of the stomach and histopathologic changes in the gastrointestinaltract (from the stomach to the ileum), are indicative of gastrointestinal effects in the rat. Haematologicalchanges included reduced haematocrit and haemoglobin, which are indicative of anaemia, although nobiologically significant changes to leucocytes occurred. These effects may result from disturbance tothe pathways of haem biosynthesis and degradation, as tin reduces the activity of the enzyme5 aminolaevulinate dehydratase and increases haem oxidase. Pathological changes to the pancreas, including atrophy with single-cell necrosis and destruction of complete acini ,have been suggested as being characteristic of tin toxicity. Pathological changes to the liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals and testicles have also been reported. Various authors have investigatedthe effects of tin, given orally or parenterally, on calcium balance and bone metabolism in experimentalanimals. Some changes were detected at low doses of tin. The results of reproductive anddevelopmental toxicity studies were negative. The available data on chronic administration of tin are limited and it is difficult to draw conclusions due to adverse effects being observed in all groups (including controls). However, the available data indicatethat doses of up to 100 mg/kg bw/ day as stannous chloride are well-tolerated and do not affect survival. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Various tin compounds were not carcinogenic in long-term studies in animals. The conformation ofDNA is disrupted by in vitro exposure to stannous chloride, but it has been suggested that this is a result of the generation of reactive oxygen species under the conditions used. Mutagenicity studies on tinhave not been identified. Mechanism of toxicity No relevant data have been identified. 2423Dose-response characterisation There are no data on which to determine a threshold of intake at which adverse gastrointestinal effects will not occur in humans. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variation No genetic variations in the susceptibility to tin have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). De Groot et al., 1973 Groups of 10 male and 10 female weanling Wistar-derived rats were administered diets containing either stannous oxide or stannous chloride for 90 days, at concentrations of 0, 300, 1000, 3000 and10,000 mg/kg of diet. There were no toxic effects of stannous oxide at any dose. Animals receiving the10,000 mg/kg stannous chloride diet showed effects within the first 7 days, including abdominaldistension and loss of appetite. This particular group was terminated in the ninth week because of ahigh rate of mortality. Upon autopsy, various gross pathological conditions were found, includingdistension of the intestines, small oedematous pancreases and greyish-brown livers. revealed moderate pancreatic atrophy, a spongy state of thewhite matter of the brain, acute bronchopneumonia, enteritis and distinct liver changes (atypicalhomogenous liver cell cytoplasm and mild proliferation of bile duct epithelium). In view of the markedreduction in appetite in the 10,000 mg/kg group, it is difficult to assess the extent to which tin wasresponsible for the observed pathological changes. Animals fed the 3000 mg/kg diet showed someabdominal distension and loss of appetite during the first 2 weeks of the 90-day study. After the secondweek, appetite and growth returned to normal. Significantly lower haemoglobin levels were detected inboth sexes between the fourth and ninth week. However, by the end of the study only males on the3000 mg/kg stannous chloride diet had lower (p /H110210.05) haemoglobin and haematocrit values. Autopsy and histological evaluations of the 3000 mg/kg group showed only minor treatment-related changes in some of the animals of both sexes (e.g., atypical homogenous cytoplasm of the hepatocytesand bile duct epithelial proliferation). There were no treatment-related effects fed the 300 or1000 mg/kg stannous chloride diets. Leucocyte total and differential counts of blood taken at autopsywere unaffected, as were the serum activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate and glutamate-pyruvatetransaminases. At termination, there was a dose-related decrease in the activity of serum alkalinephosphatase in both male and female rats. However, this achieved statistical significance only at the3000 mg/kg dietary concentration of stannous chloride. The authors indicated that unpublished pairfeeding experiments suggest that the growth depression observed in some of the tin feedingExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2433Part 3 Trace Elements3 experiments cannot be explained by a lack of palatability of the diet. In addition, on the basis of other studies involving iron supplementation and deficiency, the authors suggested that the toxicity ofcationic tin compounds is inversely dependent on the iron content of the diet. The authors suggestedthat the tin compounds that cause adverse effects in vivo had no-effect levels corresponding to 1000 mg/kg of stannous chloride in the diet, which is equivalent to 450-650 mg/kg of tin, providing anintake in the range of 22-33 mg tin/kg bw per day. Dreef-van der Meulen et al., 1974 Male and female Wistar-derived rats were fed dietary concentrations of stannous chloride dihydrate increasing by weekly increments from 1000 mg/kg in the first week to 8000 mg/kg in weeks 8 to 13.Body weight in the male animals was significantly reduced at the end of this period. Haemoglobinconcentration and haematocrits were reduced compared to controls in males and females. Reducedserum alkaline phosphatase activity was recorded in female rats. Autopsy revealed pancreatic atrophyas well as changes to the gastrointestinal tract.Histological studies confirmed these observations, withseverity of pancreatic changes ranging from necrosis of individual acinar cells to complete destructionof the pancreas. In addition, changes in the kidney and thyroid were observed. The authors consideredthe pancreatic atrophy to be the most specific manifestation of the toxicity of tin. Effects on thepancreas were observed in this study, which utilised an increasing concentration of tin in the diet, from1000 mg/kg up to a final dose of 8000 mg/kg (equivalent to 310 mg/kg bw/ day). Fritsch et al., 1978 In a study of 6 months duration, groups of 10 male Sprague-Dawley CD rats were administered diets containing 0 (control), 4000, or 8000 mg tin/kg of diet as stannous chloride. Groups of five rats weretreated in the same manner to provide control and treated animals for histological studies. Bodyweights were recorded twice weekly and in the 8th, 16th and 24th weeks the consumption of diet wasmeasured. It is noted that all the treated animals exhibited a fatty degeneration, with lymphocyticinfiltration and atrophy of the exocrine tissue of the pancreas. The kidneys and adrenal medulla wereoedematous and there was karyolysis in the adrenal cortex. In the gastrointestinal tract there weregeneralised signs of irritation, with oedema and excessive mucus in the fundal and pyloric regions of thestomach. There was congestion in the jejunum and oedema with lymphocytic infiltration in the caecum.Effects on the pancreas were observed at 4000 mg/kg of tin in the diet (equivalent to 240 mg/kgbw/day). Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 1.8 mg/ day in adults. 97.5th percentile: 6.3 mg/ day (TDS, 1994) Supplements 0.01 mg/ day (Annex 4; OTC, 2001)Estimated maximum intake: 6.3 + 0.01 = 6.31 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified. 2443Risk assessment Gastrointestinal effects are the main manifestation of toxicity associated with ingestion of foods or drinks contaminated with tin. These are caused by the irritant action of soluble inorganic tincompounds. Recovery from the effects is rapid. Some subchronic feeding studies have resulted in haematological changes in rats. Other reports of other chronic carcinogenicity studies and one multigeneration reproduction study have either not recordedany such effects, or have noted that the observed changes were transient. Pancreatic atrophy has alsobeen observed in subchronic studies in rats. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There is no convincing evidence to suggest that tin is an essential element and it should be noted thattin in food is generally considered to be a contaminant. There are insufficient data from human or animal studies to establish a safe upper level for tin. Nausea and vomiting have been reported following ingestion of food contaminated with tin. However, thebalance of evidence suggests that the concentration of tin in contaminated foodstuff is critical to thedevelopment of acute gastrointestinal effects, and that tin concentrations above 200 mg/kg foodstuffare more likely to be associated with this. The regulatory limit of 200 mg/kg for the concentration oftin in foodstuffs therefore provides protection against the occurrence of episodes of acute humanpoisoning by tin. No groups vulnerable to this form of toxicity are known to exist. For guidance purposes it should be noted that subchronic toxicity studies in rats indicate that pancreatic atrophy occurs at doses of about 240 mg tin/kg bw/ day (Fritsch et al. , 1978). In addition, changes to liver cells and anaemia have been observed in a study in which a NOAEL of 22-33 mg tin/kg bw/ day canbe derived (de Groot et al. , 1973). Applying uncertainty factors of 10 for inter-species variation and 10 for inter-individual variability to this NOAEL, gives a daily intake of about 0.2-0.3 mg tin/kg bw/ day. Thelower end of this range 0.22 mg/kg bw/ day, has been used for guidance purposes only and would beexpected not to produce adverse effects in humans. This is equivalent to 13 mg tin/ day in a 60 kg adult Current maximum dietary intakes are estimated at 6.3 mg/ day. References De Groot, Feron, V.J., Til, H.P.

It forms oxidation states of -1, 0, +2, +3, +4 and +5. this risk assessment, the wordvanadium refers to ionic vanadium, except when specific compounds are mentioned. Natural occurrence Metallic vanadium does not occur in the free form in nature but does occur in over 65 naturallyoccurring minerals. The predominant forms in biological materials are vanadate (+5 V, VO 3-) and vanadyl (+4 V, VO+2), respectively. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Beverages, fats, oils, fresh fruits and vegetables contain the lowest levels of vanadium, whereas wholegrains, seafood, meats and dairy products contain more (0.005 - 0.03 mg/kg). A few foods, includingspinach, parsley, mushrooms and oysters, contain relatively high amounts of vanadium ( /H110220.10 mg/kg). Vanadium is present in a number of multi-vitamin/mineral dietary supplements at levels ofapproximately 0.025 mg per day. There are no licensed medicines containing vanadium. Other sources of exposure Exposure to vanadium by inhalation may occur occupationally. In the production of vanadiumpentoxide, dust concentrations of the pentoxide can range from 0.1 to 30 mg/m 3, and concentrations of 0.5-5 mg/m3are not uncommon in the production of vanadium metal and vanadium catalysts. Recommended amounts Vanadium has not yet been proven to be an essential trace element for mammals. Analysis of tissue levels and vanadium status Vanadium can be measured in whole blood, serum and various tissues. Markers of vanadium status havenot been established.Risk Assessment Vanadium 3Overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects It has been claimed that vanadium may be a possible treatment for diabetes mellitus (types I and II). Information on the internet suggests that the element is used by body builders, although the rationalefor this and any possible effects are uncertain. Function No specific function has been identified for vanadium in higher animals. In vitro and animal studies suggest that vanadium may function as an oxidation-reduction catalyst, and may regulate the sodium, potassium-adenosine triphosphatase enzyme, however, this has not been proven. Deficiency In humans, the reported signs of deficiency are questionable, although it has been suggested that lowintakes may be associated with cardiovascular disease. Interactions Although no specific data have been identified, it is possible that vanadium may interfere with thestorage and metabolism of iron, because absorbed vanadium is bound to transferrin. Absorption and bioavailability Intestinal absorption of vanadium is low, less than 5%. The mechanism of absorption has not beendefined. Distribution Absorbed vanadium is mainly transported in the plasma, associated with transferrin. Concentrationsreported in human blood vary widely, with levels in whole blood and serum in the range of 0.01 - 0.4 mg/L.The concentrations in all tissues are low, but are higher in the liver, kidney and lung. Vanadium is alsopresent in breast milk and saliva and passes through the blood brain barrier. Small amounts have beenidentified in the placenta. Based on animal studies, bones and teeth retain the highest concentrationsof vanadium. Excretion Ingested vanadium is Absorbed vanadium is mainlyexcreted via the urine.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2473Part 3 Trace Elements3 Toxicity Human data The toxicity of vanadium compounds increases as valency increases, V5+being the most toxic. In humans, exposure by inhalation causes diverse toxic effects on the respiratory, digestive, and centralnervous systems, the kidney and skin. There are very few reported cases of vanadium toxicity in humans,when it is taken by mouth. Supplementation trials Supplementation of human volunteers with vanadyl compounds at oral doses of 50-125 mg/ day caused cramps, loosened stools and 'green tongue' in all patients, and fatigue and lethargy in a minority. Animal data Orally administered vanadium has low overt toxicity, but is reported to have adverse effects onreproduction and development in both males and females. There is some evidence of increased pre-and post-implantation foetal loss and significant accumulation of vanadium in the foetus. Skeletalanomalies and reduced ossification in the offspring, as well as an increased incidence of cleft palatehave been reported. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Lifetime studies in animals indicate that vanadium is not carcinogenic. Positive results have beenobtained in some in vitro mutagenicity tests. Mechanism of toxicity No data have been identified Dose-response characterisation No data have been identified Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified in human studies. However, animal data suggest that high doses of vanadium may have adverse effects on reproduction in both males and females and ondevelopment of offspring. Genetic variations No genetic variation of effects with vanadium have been identified. 2483Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Dimond et al., 1963 Oral supplements of ammonium vanadium tartrate (increasing doses in the range of 25, 50, 75 and 125 mg/ day) were administered to at least 6 volunteers for a minimum of six weeks. The total daily dosewas limited by cramps and diarrhoea in all six patients. Haematological studies and urinalysis revealedno abnormalities. Non-significant and temporary decreases in cholesterol levels were observed in two(of six) patients.Doses of 50 mg or more resulted in 'green tongue'. Two patients complained of fatigueand lethargy. Few subjects were involved and the dose was increased during the study. The authorssuggested that the tolerated dose varied from 50 to 125 mg, although it was also noted that 'greentongue' developed at this dose range. No effects were observed at 25 mg ammonium vanadium tartrateper day in 4 subjects, which is equivalent to approximately 5 mg vanadium/ day (0.08 mg vanadium/kgbw/day). Somerville et al., 1992 125 mg/ day of diammonium oxy-tartrato vanadate was administered for approximately five months, to patients with coronary heart disease. Half the subjects reported abdominal pains, anorexia andweight loss. Cohen et al., 1995. Vanadyl sulphate, administered at 100 mg/ day for three weeks to six patients with non-insulin dependant diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in a single-blind placebo controlled trial, resulted in mildgastrointestinal effects: nausea, mild diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. This toapproximately 0.52 mg/kg bw/ day as vanadium. Goldfine et al., 1995 125 mg sodium metavanadate/ day was administered to ten diabetic patients (5 insulin dependant and 5 with NIDDM) for two weeks. Mild gastrointestinal intolerance and diarrhoea were reported in bothgroups, including vomiting in one patient, which limited the total daily dose to 75 mg in this patient. Nobiochemical evidence of toxicity was detected by screening, which included electrolytes, blood ureanitrogen, creatinine, liver function studies, thyroid functions, urine analysis and a complete blood count.The daily dose of 125 mg/ day was equivalent to approximately 0.83 mg/kg bw/ day as vanadium) Boden et al., 1996 Vanadyl sulphate was administered at 100 mg/ day (equivalent to approximately 0.52 mg/kg bw/ day as vanadium) to eight NIDDM patients for a total of four weeks. Two of the eight patients reported noadverse effects. Adverse gastrointestinal effects were reported in the other six patients, includingnausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and flatulence. In one patient, diarrhoea and abdominal crampslasted for eleven days. In the others all symptoms disappeared during the first week of treatment.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2493Part 3 Trace Elements3 Halberstam et al., 1996 Transient gastrointestinal effects were reported in seven diabetic patients given 100 mg/ day vanadyl sulphate (equivalent to approximately 0.52 mg/kg bw/ as vanadium) for three weeks. These includednausea, mild diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, which subsided after one week of treatment.Additionally, some patients noted discolouration of the stool; however, stool examinations werenegative for occult blood. Animal data Domingo et al., 1986 Sodium metavanadate was administered to adult male rats by oral gavage (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg bw/ day, equivalent to approximately 0, 2, 4 and 8 mg vanadium/kg bw/ day) for sixty days, beforemating with females that received the same vanadate doses for the 14 days prior to mating. Treatmentof the females was continued during the periods of gestation and lactation.No significant effects onfertility, reproduction and parturition were observed; the number of dead foetuses and resorptions wasincreased in the highest dose group, but this was not significant. The development of the offspring(body weight, body length and tail length) was significantly decreased from birth and during thelactation period, at all dose levels, which were equivalent to approximately 2 to 8 mg/kg bw/ dayas (0, 37.5, 75 and 150 mg/kg bw/ day) was administered by oral gavage to pregnant mice on days 6 to 15 of gestation. Maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity(including teratogenicity) were reported at 75 and 150 mg/kg bw/ day, which is equivalent toapproximately 7.5 mg/kg bw/ day as vanadium. Llobet et al., 1993 Sodium metavanadate was given in drinking water to male mice for 64 days before mating with untreated females. The concentrations of sodium metavanadate used were 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and0.4 mg/mL, giving doses of 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/kg bw/ day. A significant decrease in the pregnancyrate was seen at 60 and 80 mg/kg bw/ day. Decreased body and epididymis weights were observed inthe 80 mg/kg bw/ day group, but testicular weights were not altered at any of the doses administered.The sperm count was significantly diminished at 60 and 80 mg/kg bw/ day, but sperm motility wasunaffected and histopathological examination revealed that the testes were normal. The developmentof subsequent offspring was not assessed.No effects were observed with sodium metavanadate at40 mg/kg bw/ day, which is equivalent to approximately mg/kg bw/ day as vanadium. 2503Exposure assessment UK TDS) 97.5 percentile: No data available Supplements up to 0.025 mg/ day (Annex 4)Drinking Water 0.01 mg/ day (estimated from 0.005 mg/L, WHO 1988)Estimated maximum daily intake* 0.013 + 0.025 + 0.01 = 0.05 mg/ day No potential high intake groups were identified.* Note that no data on high level intakes are available, so this is an underestimate. Risk assessment Few data are available. Vanadium compounds have been reported to cause gastrointestinal effects in supplementation studies in human volunteers. In rodents, orally administered vanadium has low overt toxicity, but is reported to have adverse effects at high doses on reproduction and development in both males and females. It is unclear whether theseeffects could also occur in humans. EVM OPINION It has not been proven that vanadium is an essential element in humans, although vanadium-dependentenzymes occur in lower organisms. There are insufficient data from human or animal studies to establisha safe upper level for vanadium. Supplementation of human volunteers with vanadium compounds at doses of 50-125 mg/ day has been reported to cause cramps, loosened stools and 'green tongue' in all patients and fatigue and lethargy in aminority of participants. Few human data are available and interpretation is limited by the small number ofparticipants and the relatively short duration of studies. Data from animal studies suggest that vanadium has adverse effects on both male and female reproduction and on the development on the subsequent offspring. There are insufficient data toestablish whether or not this effect could occur in humans. The available studies are inadequate to support the safe use of vanadium in supplements. It should be noted that vanadium supplements aimed at body builders are available (particularly via the internet) atdoses between 7.5 and 10 mg/ day. Supplements containing these levels of vanadium may not be safe.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2513Part 3 Trace Elements3 References Boden, G. Chen, X, Riuz, J, van Rossum J.D., Turco, S.

It occurs in nature as the sulphide (ZnS), in blende and sphalerite, as the silicate (ZnSiO4), calamine, willemite and zinc spar, and as the oxide(ZnO) in zincite. Within this risk assessment document the word zinc refers to ionic zinc except wherespecific zinc compounds are mentioned. Natural occurrence Zinc is present in the earth's crust and in seawater. Zinc is found in all plant and animal tissues,particularly inside the nuclei. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Meat and cereal products are rich in zinc. Zinc salts are also widely available in food supplements. In theUK, zinc supplements provide intakes up to 50 mg/ day. Zinc is present in a number of licensed medicines both alone and with other ingredients, and is used for the treatment and prevention of deficiency. The maximum daily dose of products available from apharmacist is 150 mg, and of products available on the General Sales List is 5 mg. Other sources of exposure Intake of zinc from drinking water is normally very low, but may be increased by dissolution of zinc frompipes and contaminated wells. The UK current regulatory limit in water (based on taste and appearance)is 5 mg/L. Many cases of food poisoning incidents have resulted from the storage of food or drink ingalvanised containers. Recommended amounts The UK RNI ranges set by COMA are 5.5-9.5 mg/ day for males and 4.0-7.0 mg/ day for females (COMA,1991). The US Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is 15 mg/ day for males and 12 mg/ day for females. Analysis of tissue levels and zinc status Reliable, validated measures of zinc status are not available. Plasma, blood, hair and urinary zinc can bemeasured, but these may be affected by conditions unrelated to zinc deficiency.Risk Assessment Zinc 3Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects. Zinc sulphate is used to treat Wilson's disease. Studies have also reported its use to enhance wound healing and slow macular degeneration. Zinc has also been claimed to ameliorate a variety of conditionsincluding the common cold. Function Zinc is an essential constituent of more than two hundred metalloenzymes. Zinc plays a key role in thesynthesis and stabilisation of genetic material and is necessary for cell division and the synthesis anddegradation of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Deficiency Zinc deficiency results in effects including poor prenatal development, growth retardation, mentalretardation, impaired nerve conduction and nerve damage, reproductive failure, dermatitis, hair loss,diarrhoea, loss of appetite, loss of taste and smell, anaemia, susceptibility to infections, delayed woundhealing and macular degeneration. Interactions Zinc and copper are mutually antagonistic, each interfering with the gastrointestinal uptake of the otherthus potentially leading to imbalance. Similarly, zinc and iron compete for absorption. Excess zinc mayalso decrease magnesium and calcium uptake, and conversely, high levels of calcium in the diet candecrease zinc absorption. Zinc salts reduce the bioavailability of fluoroquinoline antibiotics. Absorption and bioavailability Absorption of zinc salts from food is approximately 20-40%, being higher from fish and meat but lowerfrom cereals, where phytate content impairs absorption. The absorption of zinc salts depends on theirsolubility. Zinc is absorbed both by passive diffusion and an unknown membrane carrier process, whichrequires energy. Distribution and metabolism The mechanism for transfer across the gut wall is by both passive diffusion and an unknown membraneassociated carrier-mediated process, which requires energy and occurs throughout the small intestine.Following internalisation in the intestinal cell, zinc associates with metallothionein. Once in plasma, zincbinds to a number of proteins including albumin, transferrin, /H9251-2-macroglobulin and ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase).Little is known about uptake, but zinc is found in all cells, particularly inside the nuclei, ofall tissue types. Some tissues are particularly rich in zinc. These include the choroid of the eye, adrenalgland, skin, certain areas of the brain, pancreas and the prostate gland.Part 3 Trace Elements3 2543Excretion Since zinc is not stored, the balance between absorption and excretion (homeostasis) is essential to the maintenance of a broad spectrum of zinc-dependent functions. Zinc excretion is largely via the faeces,which contain unabsorbed zinc as well as biliary and pancreatic secretions. Toxicity Human data The symptoms of acute zinc salt toxicity include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Other reportedeffects include lethargy, anaemia and dizziness. Prolonged use of high doses of zinc can result insecondary deficiency of copper. Symptoms of this include hypocupraemia, impaired plasma LDL:HDL cholesterol, decreased glucose clearance, decreased methionine and leucineenkephalins, abnormal cardiac function and impairment of pancreatic enzymes, amylase and lipase.It has also been suggested that excess zinc is atherogenic. Supplementation trials A variety of supplementation studies are available. Many of these investigate the effects of zinc supplementation on various medical conditions or physiological systems. However, some work has alsobeen undertaken suggesting that high levels of zinc can adversely affect copper and iron status. Animal data Very high doses of zinc can cause minor neural degeneration, acinar cell necrosis and metaplasia in thepancreas, decreased haematocrit and decreased white blood cell count. Very high doses have also beenshown to cause reproductive toxicity in rats. Lower doses have resulted in reduced ceruloplasminactivity and decreased haemoglobin levels. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Zinc has been found to give positive results in some in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests. No data have been identified on the carcinogenicity of zinc. Vulnerable groups A small study suggests that zinc supplementation increases the levels of glycosylated haemoglobin indiabetics. Genetic variations Sufferers from haemochromatosis may absorb larger amounts of zinc indicating possible increased riskof zinc-induced copper deficiency.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2553Part 3 Trace Elements3 Mechanisms of toxicity No data have been identified on the mechanisms of toxicity. Dose response characterisation In humans, the acute toxic effects of zinc occur at doses of approximately 200 mg or more . ESOD activity, thought to be the most sensitive measure of copper status, was shown to decrease followingsupplementation with 50 mg/ day or more for 12 days. However, other studies have reported no effectat doses of 50 mg/ day. Supplementation with 50 mg/ day for up to 10 weeks has further resulted inreductions in haematocrit and serum ferritin. Doses greater than 100 mg/ day have resulted in alteredratios of HDL:LDL cholesterol. Copper deficiency and sideroblastic anaemia, associated with chroniczinc ingestion, were reported in one individual who had taken non-prescribed zinc supplements of26.6 - 40 mg/ day for at least 2 years. In animal studies, acute effects occur at doses greater than 480 mg/kg bw/ day. Reproductive toxicity in rats has been observed at doses above 200 mg/kg bw/ day. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Secondary copper deficiency General Sandstead, 1995This paper discusses the inhibitory effect of zinc on copper absorption and the risk of secondary copper deficiency increasing with high zinc:copper molar ratios. The signs of secondary copperdeficiency include decreased ESOD, increased LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol, decreasedglucose clearance, decreased methionine and leucine enkephalins and abnormal cardiac function. ESODactivity is thought to be particularly sensitive to decreased copper status. The author suggested apreliminary reference dose of 9 mg/ day for 60 kg adults for over the counter (OTC) zinc, assuming highbioavailability and uncertain copper intakes. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group, 2002 The effects of supplementation for 5 years with 80 mg/ day zinc (as zinc oxide) plus either antioxidants (500 mg/ day vitamin C, 268 mg/ day vitamin E, 15 mg/ day \u00df-carotene) or 2 mg/ day copper (as copperoxide) on serum levels of zinc, copper, lipids and haematocrit were reported in this paper. No significantdifferences in serum haematocrit, copper or lipids were observed at the end of the 5-year periodcompared to placebo controls. However, only 20% of participants were followed up for the full 5 yearsand no group received zinc alone. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions from this study. 2563HDL, LDL and cholesterol Hooper et al., 1980Twelve healthy male volunteers (23-25 years) were given 160 mg/ day zinc (as zinc sulphate, taken with meals) for 5 weeks. Eight control subjects received placebo treatment. After 5 weeks treatment, a 25%reduction (p /H110210.001) in HDL-cholesterol levels was measured. No effect on total cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, or triglyceride was found. No decline in these parameters was apparent in the controls.HDL levels continued to decline for a further two weeks after cessation of treatment. Eleven weeksafter the cessation of treatment, the HDL values had returned to near baseline. Plasma copper was notdecreased throughout. The amounts of zinc and copper provided by food and beverages were notstated. This was a small scale, presumably single-blinded, study. Pachotikarn et al., 1985 Twenty three male volunteers were given 50 mg zinc/ day (as gluconate) for 6 weeks. Subjects were asked to avoid foods high in copper, phytate and fibre during the study. A statistically non-significantincrease (approximately 16%) in HDL cholesterol and a decrease in total cholesterol with a significantdecrease in diastolic blood pressure were measured. Dietary zinc and copper intakes were in the range11.9-12.4 and 0.93-1.01 mg/ day during the study. The zinc:copper intake ratio was estimated to be 60:1.Haematocrit, haemoglobin and plasma copper levels were not significantly altered from baseline. Nocontrol group was included in the study, so it is not possible to assess the potential effect of dietarychanges on the parameters measured. Black et al., 1988 Groups of 9-13 male volunteers (19-29 years) were given supplements of 0 (placebo), 50 or 75 mg zinc/ day (as gluconate, consumed after breakfast with water) for 12 weeks. HDL cholesterol wasdecreased by approximately 14% at weeks 6 and 12 of treatment in the higher dose group and at week 12in the lower dose group. However, at weeks 8 and 10, levels of HDL cholesterol in both treated groupswere higher than the controls. It was noted that week 10 was a holiday in which the volunteers left thecampus. Serum zinc levels increased in the high but not the low dose group. Serum copper levels werenot altered. Mean dietary copper levels were 2.1, 1.8 and 1.7 mg/ day for the placebo, 50 mg and 75 mgzinc supplement groups, respectively. Mean dietary zinc intakes were 12.6, 14.1 and 9.8 mg/ day. This wasa double-blind study. Details of diet were collected to establish copper and zinc intake from food. Thenumber of participants was small and the protocol demanding since a number of dietary restrictionswere requested (high phytate and high copper foods). This was monitored by the use of bi-weekly 3-daydietary records. However, limited compliance with the dietary restrictions may explain some of thevariations. In the high dose group, total and saturated fat and protein intakes were lower than in theother groups. Samman and Roberts, 1988 As part of a double blind crossover study, 20 female (mean age 27 years) and 21 male volunteers (mean age 28 years) were given 150 mg (3 x 50mg) zinc/ day (as sulphate) for 6 weeks. Plasma zinc increasedsignificantly on treatment. There were no changes in total plasma cholesterol levels in either sex.However, in females, LDL cholesterol was decreased by 9% while ESOD and caeruloplasmin activitieswere reduced. Plasma copper and haematocrit remained unchanged. Gastrointestinal and other effectswere reported by some of the subjects leading to 6 females dropping out of the study (see alsoSamman and Roberts, 1987 below). Differences between the sexes were attributed to females receiving aExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2573Part 3 Trace Elements3 higher dose on a mg/kg basis (mean bodyweights were 73.9 and 61.3 for males and females respectively). Copper intake was not stated. ESOD and other enzyme activities Taper et al., 1980Groups of 5 or 6 adult women of child bearing age, were fed dietary regimes containing 2 mg/ day copper and 8, 16, or 24 mg/ days zinc for 18 days. Plasma levels of zinc and copper were increased anddecreased, respectively. However, zinc had no effect on copper retention at any dose and the negativecopper balance observed in each treatment group was unrelated to zinc dose. There was no functionalassessment of copper status in this study. Fischer et al., 1984 Groups of 13 healthy males, were given a placebo or a supplement of 50 mg zinc/ day (as gluconate taken as two doses) for 6 weeks. The volunteers were divided so that baseline caeruloplasmin andESOD activity were the same within the two groups. In the treatment group plasma zinc levels wereelevated. ESOD activity decreased following 4 weeks of treatment being reduced by a maximum of 20%after 6 weeks. Plasma copper and caeruloplasmin activity were unaffected by zinc treatment. Theamounts of zinc and copper provided by food and beverages were not stated. The time taken for ESODto decline was thought to be related to erythrocyte turnover. This was a reasonable double blind study,though the numbers are small and there is no information on dietary copper or zinc intake. Festa, 1985 Nine healthy male volunteers were given a basal egg-white diet that provided recommended levels of all essential nutrients, with the exceptions of zinc and protein where the diet provided 1.8 mg zinc and16.4 g nitrogen daily. Copper intake was 2.63 mg/ day. Zinc carbonate was added to give a total zincintake of 20.7 mg/ day (week 1), 18.5 mg/ day (weeks 3, 5, 6, 8, 9), 1.8 mg/ d (week 2) 1.8 or 8.0 mg/ day(week 4) and 4, 6 or 8 mg/ day (week 7). It was reported that a total zinc intake of 18.5 mg/ day for 2weeks following on from a week at a lower intake resulted in reduced apparent retention and increasedexcretion of copper. Mean plasma copper concentrations remained within the normal range throughoutthe study, but mean faecal copper excretion was elevated over copper intake in week 6. However, thebiological significance of this result is uncertain. Negative copper balance was not repeated in week 9and there was no measurement of any functional index of copper status. Yadrick et al., 1989 Nine female volunteers (25-40 years) were given supplements of 50 mg/ day zinc (as twice daily gluconate capsules) for 10 weeks. ESOD activity, haematocrit and serum ferritin were significantlyreduced (by 50%, 5% and respectively) compared with pre-treatment levels. Effects on ferritin andhaematocrit but not ESOD were ameliorated when equal (mg for mg) iron supplementation was given toa second group of nine women (at the start of study, the volunteers were divided so that baselineferritin and ESOD levels were the same). The amount of zinc and copper provided by food andbeverages during the study was not stated. This was a reasonable double blind study, though thenumbers were small and there is no information on dietary copper or zinc intake. 2583Abdallah and Samman, 1993 Six healthy female volunteers (age range 18-36 years), were given zinc capsules (50 mg/ day as zinc sulphate, taken with breakfast) for 12 days. A significant, 20%, decrease in ESOD activity was measured.Dietary zinc was estimated as 9-12 mg/ day. Copper intake was not stated. Small increases in erythrocyteand plasma zinc were observed but were not significant. Stomach cramps and a 'burning sensation' afterswallowing were reported by some volunteers. The study involved small numbers and there was nocontrol group. The results are reasonably consistent with those of Yadrick (see above). Cunningham et al., 1994 Following supplementation with 50 mg/ day zinc (as gluconate) for 28 days, 45% and 20% increases in HbA 1cwere reported in insulin years) 23-38 years), respectively, suggesting glycosylation becomes altered in a milieu ofzinc excess. In this study, plasma and erythrocyte copper did not differ significantly from baseline levels.Dietary zinc was estimated to be 11.2 and 8.7 mg/ day in the IDDM and non-IDDM individualsrespectively, reflecting the sex distribution in the groups. Copper intake was not stated. Small numberswere involved in this study and there were no placebo control subjects. Davis et al., 2000 A study was conducted on a metabolic ward, 25 healthy post-menopausal women were fed diets containing low (1 mg/ day) or high (10 mg/ day) copper for 180 days. For one 90 day period, the womenwere given a supplement of 50 mg zinc/ day and for the other 90 day period, a placebo. The basal dietcontained 3 mg zinc/ day. Zinc supplementation significantly increased superoxidedismutase activity but did not affect erythrocyte superoxide dismutase. This effect was more apparentwhen the subjects received the low copper diet. The study is unusual in that it was conducted on ametabolic ward, where a high degree of control over the zinc and copper intakes of the subjectswas possible. Other adverse effects Samman and Roberts, 1987 This paper describes details of the side effects that occurred in the study of Samman and Roberts (1988), described above. Symptoms were reported by 84% of the female and 18% of the malevolunteers. These included headaches, abdominal cramps, nausea, loss of appetite and vomiting. Thesymptoms were particularly apparent when small meals or no food was taken with the supplements(contrary to instructions). It was considered that, although a sex difference could not be ruled out, thehigher number of symptoms in the female volunteers could be due to their lower body weight. Sixsubjects dropped out of the study, 5 due to the abdominal cramps and one due to persistentheadaches. All were women receiving a dose of 0.86 mg/kg.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2593Part 3 Trace Elements3 Hale et al., 1989 Health questionnaires, electrocardiograms, and laboratory and medication use data from a health screening program for older people were compared for 69 participants taking zinc supplements (20 to150 mg/ day for an average duration of 8 years) with 1,832 subjects who were not taking supplements. Noassociation was found between zinc supplementation and increased risk of developing cardiovasculardisease. The zinc treated group had lower mean creatinine and total protein levels. After controlling forage and sex the group had lower serum uric acid and higher mean cell haemoglobin levels. The redblood cell count was decreased in women taking zinc. No significant differences were found intriglyceride or cholesterol levels but HDL cholesterol was not measured. Limited details and no actualvalues for the parameters were provided on this study. No data on dietary intake of zinc or copperwere provided. Exposure assessment Food Mean: 9.8 mg/ day 97.5 percentile:17 mg/ day (from 1986/87 Water up to 10 mg/ day (assuming 2 L/ day consumption at maximum UK concentration of 5 mg/L) Supplements up to 50 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake: 17 + 10 + 50 = 77 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified. Risk assessment Consumption of zinc supplements by human volunteers has been reported to cause gastrointestinal effects, including cramping and nausea. This was particularly apparent when the supplements weretaken with little or no food. Excess levels of dietary zinc interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of copper, potentially leading to secondary copper deficiency. Signs of this include decreased ESOD (erythrocyte superoxidedismutase) activity, increased LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol, decreased glucoseclearance and abnormal cardiac function. One of the most sensitive markers of this appears to be ESODactivity. Supplemental doses of 50 mg cause significant decreases in the activity of this enzyme. Iron and zinc in the diet each affect the gastrointestinal absorption of the other. Few data are available, but high levels of iron are known to interfere with zinc uptake, and more limited data suggest that thereverse interaction also occurs. This has not been considered in detail. 2603Two vulnerable groups have been identified; diabetics, since the study by Cunningham et al. (1994) indicates that HbA1cis increased in conditions of zinc excess, and sufferers of haemochromatosis who have enhanced gastrointestinal absorption of iron, cobalt, lead and possibly zinc, potentiallypredisposing them to accumulation of zinc. However, there are insufficient data to establish the level ofzinc intake at which adverse effects could occur in these groups. Data are also available from animal studies that indicate high zinc levels can have a negative effect on copper balance. These have not been considered in detail in the risk assessment, as considerable datafrom human studies are available. ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL Key studies: Yadrick et al. (1989), Fischer et al. (1984), Black et al. (1988), Cunningham et al. (1994), Davis et al . (2000). LOAEL: 50 = 25 mg zinc/ day for supplemental zinc for daily consumptionover a lifetime. Zinc affects iron and copper uptake at supplemental doses of 50 mg/ day and above. However, this is not apparent in all studies. The key endpoint is the reduction of copper absorption by zinc. Where thecontribution of dietary zinc was also assessed, the lowest level at which effects were apparent (reducedactivity of the copper-dependent enzyme ESOD being the most sensitive) was approximately 58-62mg/ day (50 mg supplements plus approximately 8-12 mg/ day from food). There is no evidence ofadverse effects from dietary zinc intake.In addition, since the contribution of zinc from the diet inmany of the studies is uncertain, and may have been altered under study conditions, it is appropriate toset a safe upper level for supplemental zinc but not total intake. Taking the LOAEL as 50 mg/ day and byapplying an uncertainty factor of 2 to account for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation, a Safe Upper Levelof 50/2 = 25 mg/ day for supplemental zinc is derived (equivalent to 0.42 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kgadult). An uncertainty factor of 2 has been used rather than 3 since the effect concerned is a small andinconsistent change in a biochemical parameter. No uncertainty factor is needed for inter-individualvariability because this safe upper level is supported by a large number of human studies. Assuming amaximum intake of 17 mg/ day from food, a total intake of 42 mg/ day (equivalent to 0.7 mg/kg bw/ dayin a 60 kg adult) would not be expected to result in any adverse effects.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2613Part 3 Trace Elements3 References Abdallah, S.M., Samman, S.

It is a divalent cation with an atomic weight of 40. Calcium shows a single oxidation state of +2. Natural occurrence Calcium does not exist freely in nature, but occurs abundantly as limestone (CaCO3), gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), and fluorite (CaF2). Many calcium compounds (e.g. fluorspar and calcium carbonate) are almost insoluble in water, but there are exceptions (e.g. calcium chloride and calcium nitrate). Withinthis risk assessment, the word calcium refers to ionic calcium, except where specific calciumcompounds are described. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Foods particularly rich in calcium are milk (1200 mg/kg), cheese (730-12000 mg/kg) and other dairyproducts (except butter), green leafy vegetables (except spinach), soybean products, bread and otherbaked goods made from calcium fortified flour (variable levels), almonds (2400 mg/kg), brazil nuts (1700 mg/kg) and hazelnuts (1400 mg/kg). In the West, more than 70% of calcium intake is from milkand dairy products. Fortified foods such as bread and baked products and some breakfast cereals now contribute significantly more calcium to the diet than would be the case without fortification. UK law requires thatall flour, with the exception of wholemeal flour, be supplemented with 2350-3900 mg calciumcarbonate (equivalent to 940-1560 mg calcium) per kg. Wholemeal flour contains naturally 380 mgcalcium per kg. Calcium in dietary supplements is available either alone or in combination with other minerals beneficial to bone health (such as vitamin D, magnesium and zinc) or in multivitamin preparations with added minerals.Concentrations typically range from 133 mg/tablet, taken once daily, to 800 mg/tablet, taken 3 times perday. Calcium in dietary supplements is available in many different forms, including calcium carbonate andvarious calcium chelates. Calcium carbonate contains the highest concentration of elemental calcium (400 mg/g), but is of low solubility and therefore less bioavailable than calcium chelates. Antacidpreparations contain calcium carbonate (with a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg calcium). Other sources of exposure In different geographical areas, the concentration of calcium in drinking water varies from less than 100 mgcalcium per litre in soft water areas, to up to 300 mg per litre in hard water areas. The calcium contentof mineral water also varies widely ( /H1102110 mg/L to /H11022300 mg/L).Risk Assessment Calcium 4Recommended amounts Dietary Reference Values are based on calcium requirements for bone formation, minimised bone resorption and retention of calcium. Recommendations vary for different stages of growth andreproduction (COMA, 1998). A Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) of 240 mg/ day has been calculated for infants. However, absorption from infant formula is less than from breast milk (40% as opposed to 66%) and so a RNI of525 mg/ day is recommended. The calcium intake required for healthy bone formation and skeletal growth increases from the age of 1 to 10 years; RNIs of 350, 450 and 550 mg/ day are recommended for children of ages 1-3, 4-6 and 7-10years respectively. For adolescents (11-18 years) RNIs are 800 mg/ day for females and 1000 mg/ day formales, due to an increased requirement for calcium at a time of increased skeletal growth. RNIs for adults are based on calcium loss and retention and are 700 mg/ day. No additional intake is considered necessary for pregnancy, although an increase of 550 mg/ day over the RNI is recommendedduring lactation. Analysis of tissue levels and calcium status Calcium in the body may be measured in the blood or in bone. However, blood calcium concentrationsare tightly regulated and are not reflective of calcium status. Blood calcium levels are only seen outsidethe normal range in conditions such as severe malnutrition or hyperparathyroidism. There are several techniques for measuring the amount of calcium in individual bones at different ages, but results from the different methods do not correlate very well. A recently developed technique,using neutron activation analysis, enables total body calcium to be measured in living persons. Bonemineral content (BMC), the concentration of mineral at a specific skeletal site, and bone mineral density(BMD), the bone mineral content per unit area of skeletal site, are used as indicators of calciuminsufficiency and as predictors of increased risk of fracture, when compared to a reference range,adjusted for age and gender. Change in BMC and BMD are useful indicators of calcium status in adults;change in BMC is a useful indicator of calcium retention in children. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects In some, but not all studies, calcium supplementation at doses of approximately 1250-2000 mg/ day, hasbeen shown to reduce colonic and rectal epithelial cell proliferation in subjects at risk from developingcolon cancer. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials have suggested that dietary calcium may have a beneficial effect on primary hypertension (in non-pregnant women). Some studies have also indicated anassociation between calcium intake and decreased blood pressure in children. Traditionally, calcium restriction has been advised in the prevention of calcium stones. However, recent evidence suggests that dietary calcium restriction may actually increase the risk.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2654Evidence from a limited number of studies has suggested that calcium supplementation may inhibit the development of breast cancer, particularly in the presence of vitamin D. Function In the vertebrate skeleton, calcium provides rigidity in the form of calcium phosphate (Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6, also known as hydroxyapatite), embedded in collagen fibrils. Calcium is also a key component in themaintenance of cell structure. Membrane rigidity, viscosity and permeability are partly dependent onlocal calcium concentrations. Calcium fulfils important physiological roles as a cofactor for many enzymes (e.g. lipase), as an important component of the blood clotting mechanism and through an active role as an intracellularsignal. Changes in intracellular calcium concentration, in response to a physiological stimulus, such as ahormone or neurotransmitter, can act as an intracellular signal. This signalling controls events such ascell aggregation, muscle contraction and cell movement, secretion, transformation and cell division, aswell as muscle protein degradation. Deficiency A negative calcium balance occurs when net calcium absorption fails to compensate for urinary calciumlosses. Calcium absorption is impaired in individuals with conditions of fat malabsorption (e.g. insyndromes such as pancreatic insufficiency, bile duct obstruction and coeliac disease) because of thelack of vitamin D as a transporter. Acute hypocalcaemia is frequently seen following parathyroid surgeryand may occur during thyroid surgery through inadvertent interference with the parathyroid glands. The possible effects of calcium deficiency are numerous and wide-ranging. Signs of calcium deficiency are manifest in the bones and teeth of all young animal species, including humans. Effects includestunted growth, poor quality bones and teeth, and bone malformation. Interactions Interactions between calcium and other dietary constituents may affect the efficiency of calciumabsorption. Phytic acid (found in unleavened bread, raw beans, seeds, nuts and grains) can reducecalcium absorption by forming an insoluble salt, calcium phytate. Calcium is thought to have an inhibitory effect on iron absorption from the diet, even at low levels. High calcium diets have also been shown to reduce net zinc absorption and balance. The phosphate ion can form insoluble complexes with calcium, and therefore potentially decrease calcium absorption. It has been suggested that the dietary phosphate:calcium ratio has to be very high(exceeding 3:1) to interfere significantly with calcium availability. However, some studies have shown thatphosphorus intake had little or no effect on overall calcium balance, and that variations in phosphorusintake were not associated with differences in calcium absorption. Complexation of phosphorus withaluminium inhibits phosphorus absorption, which increases excretion of calcium. Thus, long-term use ofantacids can cause calcium loss.Part 4 Minerals4 2664Absorption and bioavailability About 25-50% of dietary calcium is absorbed and delivered to the exchangeable calcium pool. Most of the calcium in food is in the form of complexes with other dietary constituents, which must be brokendown and the calcium released in a soluble and ionised form before it can be absorbed. Calcium crosses the intestinal mucosa by both active and passive transport mechanisms. The active transport mechanism is a saturable, transcellular process which involves the calcium-binding protein,calbindin. Calbindin is regulated by the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D 3). The passive transport mechanism is a nonsaturable, paracellular process, which is of low efficacy and is unaffectedby calcium status or parathyroid hormone. Both processes occur throughout the small intestine,although the efficiency of calcium absorption is much greater from the duodenojejunal segments of theintestine, than from the ileal segments. During periods of additional calcium requirement, the absorptive capacity of the gut is increased, and renal excretion is regulated. Distribution and metabolism Total body calcium is about 30 mol (1200 g). Of this, 1% is located in the serum, lymph and other fluids,the remaining 99% being found in the bone and teeth. The concentration of ionised calcium in serum isclosely regulated within 10% of approximately 100 mg/L. Calcium circulates in the plasma in three forms: bound to plasma proteins (45%); in complexes with citrate, phosphate or bicarbonate (about 10%); and as free calcium ions (about 45%). Free ionisedcalcium is the most physiologically important form. Excretion Calcium excretion tends to equal intestinal calcium absorption in adults of a good nutritional state.Absorbed calcium is excreted in the urine, and to a lesser extent, in the sweat. Urinary calcium excretion varies widely among individuals, ranging from 100-200 mg/ day. Faecal excretion of calciumconsists mainly of unabsorbed dietary calcium, the remainder coming from shed epithelial cells anddigestive juices.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2674Part 4 Minerals4 Toxicity Human data Excessive calcium intake may lead to hypercalcaemia (serum calcium levels in excess of 10.5 mg/ dl). Features of hypercalcaemia are progressive lethargy, confusion and ultimately coma (at serum calciumconcentrations above 14 mg/ dL). These effects are reversible and are directly related to the degree of hypercalcaemia. Headache, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and, rarely, convulsions, may alsooccur in patients with hypercalcaemia. However, hypercalcaemia more commonly results from anexcessive ingestion of both calcium and alkali, such as antacid tablets, calcium supplements and milk(providing vitamin D which promotes calcium absorption), a condition which is known as milk-alkalisyndrome (MAS). Clinical signs of MAS are hypercalcaemia, alkalosis and renal insufficiency. MAS can be acute, intermediate (Cope's syndrome) or chronic (Burnett's syndrome) depending on the duration of exposureand symptoms. Hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphatemia and renal insufficiency are reversible after acute orintermediate exposure. However, chronic MAS is associated with irreversible or only partially reversiblerenal insufficiency and metastatic calcinosis (deposition of calcium in soft tissue). Historically, themajority of patients developing MAS have been middle-aged males ingesting milk and absorbable alkali,but this has decreased with the use of modern medication for peptic ulcer disease. More recently, casereports have described the syndrome occurring in predominantly female patients taking calcium-containing drugs for conditions such as autoimmune disease, organ transplantation, chronic renal failureand osteoporosis. The syndrome has been reported to occur at calcium carbonate intakes of 4000 mg/ dayand above. Although MAS has usually been observed after ingestion of large quantities of antacid tablets or other calcium-containing medication with vitamin D, two cases of MAS have been described resulting purelyfrom ingestion of food. Both cases arose from the practice of consuming betelnut paste containingcalcium carbonate from oyster shells. Hypercalcaemia commonly occurs as a result of hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma are the neoplasias most commonly associated with hypercalcaemia,due either to osteolytic secondary deposits or to ectopic parathyroid-like hormone production,typically in lung cancer. Supplementation studies A range of supplementation studies have been reported with supplementary calcium doses of up to 2000 mg/ day. These have generally failed to show adverse effects, but data on adverse effects are limited. A study of supplementation of the diet of pregnant women with 2000 mg calcium/ day (as calcium carbonate) showed no significant increase in the incidence of urolithiasis. Women with a history of, orhigh risk for, developing renal disease were excluded from the study (Levine et al ., 1997). 2684In a randomised, double-blinded controlled clinical trial of pregnant adolescents, a reduced incidence of pre-term delivery and low birth weight was observed in the supplemented group receiving 2000 mgadditional calcium/ day (Bucher et al ., 1996). No adverse effects were reported. Numerous clinical trials have been reported in which patients with a history of adenomatous colonic polyps have received calcium supplements. These trials mainly consist of double-blind placebo-controlled studies, with patients receiving between 250 and 2000 mg calcium (usually in the form ofcalcium carbonate), over periods ranging from 4 weeks to 4 years. Few adverse effects have beenreported in individuals participating in such trials, although this may be partly because the effects werenot deliberately sought. A low incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, such as severe abdominal painor diarrhoea, has been observed in studies where side effects have been actively ascertained. Animal data Limited animal data concerning calcium toxicity are available. In rodents and dogs, dietaryadministration of excess calcium leads to kidney calcification, enlarged kidneys and reduced glomerularfiltration rate. An investigation of the effect of providing pregnant mice with 8.2% calcium (as carbonate and lactate) in the diet (equivalent to an intake of approximately 12,200 mg/kg bw/ day) compared to controls givendiets containing 1.2% calcium (approximately 1800 mg/kg bw/ day) on foetal development resulted insignificantly decreased foetal weights, and retarded skeletal and dental calcification. No grossabnormalities were detected. In rats maintained on a high calcium diet throughout pregnancy and lactation (providing an estimated calcium intake of 3790 mg/kg bw/ day), offspring were born significantly hypocalcaemic and had lowergrowth rates and focal alopecia. These effects were reversible when the pups were weaned onto anormal diet. Hypercalcaemic lactating dams also produced milk with a higher calcium concentrationthan controls, which may have contributed to the response seen in the offspring. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No relevant data on carcinogenicity or genotoxicity have been identified. Mechanisms of toxicity Acute hypercalcaemia can impair renal function by causing vasoconstriction with consequent decreasesin both the renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Hypercalcaemia increases absorption ofbicarbonate in the response characterisation No relevant data are available.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2694Part 4 Minerals4 Vulnerable groups Patients with renal failure are particularly susceptible to developing hypercalcaemia when taking calcium supplements. Individuals without renal failure taking diuretics may also be at increased risk. Patients with absorptive or renal hypercalcuria, primary hyperparathyroidism and sarcoidosis may have a higher risk of renal stone formation following calcium supplementation. Genetic variations No data on genetic variations that increase the toxicity of calcium have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment(For full review see http://www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). Human data Kleibeuker et al., 1993 Calcium carbonate tablets were well tolerated by participants in this intervention study. No mention of side effects was made when individuals were specifically asked about them. Individuals received 1500mg calcium/ day for twelve weeks. Wu et al., 1996 This paper reports two cases of milk-alkali syndrome. Both cases showed classic MAS symptoms, i.e. hypercalcaemia and renal insufficiency. The authors estimated that the patients had ingested 9000 mgand 6000 mg of calcium carbonate (3600 and 2400 mg calcium) per day, respectively. These are the firstreports of MAS not caused iatrogenically. Levine et al., 1997 Supplementation of 2,295 pregnant women with 2,000 mg calcium/ day (as calcium carbonate) resulted in no significant increase in the incidence of urolithiasis. This study excluded women with a history of,or a high risk of, developing renal disease. Hofstad et al., 1998 116 patients received 1,600 mg calcium/ day (as calcium carbonate) or placebo for 18 months. Five patients in the treatment group experienced constipation compared to one in the controls. Diarrhoeawas reported in 5 calcium and 7 placebo subjects and bloating (8 patients) was equally distributedbetween groups. Baron et al., 1999 No toxicity was associated with calcium supplementation during a randomised double blind, placebo controlled trial on patients with a history of colorectal adenomas. The 930 received 3000 mg ofcalcium carbonate/ day (equivalent to 1,200 mg calcium per day) and were examined after 1 and 4 yearsof treatment. 2704Bonithon-Kopp et al., 2000 665 adult patients with a history of polyps were randomised into 3 groups receiving 2000 mg calcium/ day (as calcium gluconolactate and carbonate) fibre or placebo for 3 years. 552 patientscompleted the follow up examination after 3 years, although 94 of these had stopped treatment early.The total number of patients reporting side effects were 26/176, 19/198 and 12/178 in the calcium, fibreand control groups, respectively. Major side effects (severe abdominal pain or diarrhoea) were alsoreported to be more frequent (6/176) in the calcium group compared to the control (3/178) or fibre(3/198) groups, which might have been a chance finding. Animal data Fairney and Weir, 1970 The effect of maternal hypercalcaemia during pregnancy and lactation on the development of the offspring was investigated. Rats were maintained on high calcium diets, containing 3% calcium in dietand 4000 mg/100 mL drinking water (equating to an estimated total intake of 3790 mg/ day), throughoutpregnancy and lactation. In comparison to controls (receiving 0.8% calcium in diet and 1.1 mgcalcium/100 mL drinking water), the offspring of treated rats were born with significant hypocalcaemiaand had lower growth rates and focal alopecia. These effects were reversible when the pups wereweaned onto a normal diet. Shackelford et al., 1993 The effect of moderately increased dietary calcium on foetal development was investigated in pregnant rats. The doses were selected to resemble the increases recommended by the 1984 US NationalInstitutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Panel on Osteoporosis. All animals were fednutritionally adequate diets and received 0.5 (control), 0.75, 1.00 or 1.25% dietary calcium as calciumcarbonate. Treatment was for 6 weeks prior to mating, during mating and for the first 20 days ofgestation. Foetal bodyweights and lengths remained similar between treatment and control groups.There were no significant increases in external, visceral or skeletal variations of the foetuses, whencompared to the control animals. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 830 mg/ day (from 1990 NDNS) 97.5th percentile: 1500 mg/ day Water up to 600 mg/ day (assuming 2L/ day consumption at 300 mg/L)Supplements up to 2400 (3 x 800) mg/ day (OTC, 2001)Estimated maximum intake: 1500 + 600 + 2400 = 4500 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2714Part 4 Minerals4 Risk assessment In humans, the main adverse effect associated with high levels of calcium intake is milk-alkali syndrome, resulting in hypercalcaemia, alkalosis and renal impairment. Symptoms can include abdominal pain,hypertension, headaches and tissue calcification. The condition has been reported in a small number ofsubjects taking calcium-containing medication. Previously , MAS was more common in males taking absorbable alkali and milk, but is now more common in females taking calcium-containing medication. Data on the effects of high doses of calcium in animals are sparse. However tissue calcification and adverse reproductive effects have been reported. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from studies in animals or humans to establish a Safe Upper Level forcalcium. High intakes of calcium in vulnerable human subjects can result in milk-alkali syndrome, acondition characterised by hypercalcaemia, alkalosis and renal impairment. This is associated withsymptoms such as hypertension, neurological problems, abdominal pain and tissue calcification. Milk-alkali syndrome has not been investigated in controlled studies, but numerous case reports are available.The condition tends to occur as a result of consumption of large amounts of calcium via calcium-containing medication with or without vitamin D, with intakes of calcium carbonate as low as 4,000 mg/ day(1,600 mg calcium) having been associated with this condition. However, since milk-alkali syndromegenerally occurs in subjects taking medication or with underlying medical conditions, it is notconsidered relevant to the general population. Numerous human trials have been reported in which calcium supplements have been given to subjects with colonic polyps or who are at risk of such polyps. Some investigations have reported g astrointestinal effects in small numbers of the many patients studied taking doses of 1600 or 2000 mg/ day supplemental calcium, but many of the studies are limited by inadequate reporting of side effects. No uncertaintyfactor is needed because the assessment is based on studies of large numbers of people. Takentogether the data suggest that, for guidance purposes, doses up to 1,500 mg/ day supplemental calciumwould not be expected to result in any adverse effect, but that higher doses could result in adversegastrointestinal symptoms in a few people. An estimate for total calcium intakes has not been made asthe effect is related to calcium in supplemental doses. 2724References Baron, J.

These were vitamins and minerals which were either generally considered to be essential and/ or which wereavailable as food supplements. Fluoride is thought to be essential, though this has been difficult todemonstrate experimentally. Although fluoride supplements are only available as licensed medicines,fluoride was included in the EVM programme as it has been used to fortify particular foodstuffs on alocal basis in order to improve dental health. Two of the major sources of exposure (drinking water and dental products, the latter being considered either licensed medicines or cosmetics) are neither foods nor food supplements. The EVM has concluded that it is inappropriate to comment on fluoride with regard to food fortification since this is carried out as a public health measure. Determining maximum levels ofsupplementation has to take place within the context of local exposure and involves a consideration ofrisks and benefits which is not within the terms of reference of the EVM. The review commissioned by the FSA for the EVM will remain available for information purposes on the EVM website or from the Secretariat. This should not be taken to mean that the EVM has endorsed orapproved this review. 2744Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 275General information Chemistry Iron, a transition metal, is ubiquitous in biological systems. In solid form the element exists free, or in iron-containing compounds. In aqueous solution, it exists in one of two oxidation states, Fe2+, the ferrous form, and Fe3+, the ferric form. Iron has a particularly high redox potential in solution. Within this risk assessment, the word iron refers to ionic iron, except where specific iron compounds are mentioned. Natural occurrence Iron is found in certain minerals, and in nearly all soils and in mineral waters Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Dietary sources rich in iron include liver, meat, beans, nuts, dried fruits, poultry, fish, whole grains orenriched cereals, soybean flour and most dark green leafy vegetables. Iron in foods occurs in two mainforms: haem and non-haem. The major sources of haem iron in the diet are haemoglobin and myoglobinfrom meat, poultry and fish. Non-haem iron consists mainly of iron salts, derived from plant and dairyproducts. Most of the non-haem iron present as foods is in the ferric form. Fortification of food with iron is common in developing countries, where deficiency of the element is widespread. In the UK there is mandatory fortification of white and brown flour at a level not less than16.5 mg iron/kg flour. Many breakfast cereals are fortified on a voluntary basis; levels vary but aretypically within the range of 70 to 120 mg/kg. Inorganic dietary iron supplements are generally (chloride, fumarate, gluconate, glycerophosphate, ferric salts. Ferroussulphate and succinate are the most commonly available. Other sources of exposure Water is a potential source of iron. The limit in UK water supplies is 0.2 mg/L. Recommended amounts Estimated average daily iron requirements in the UK are 8.7 and 6.7 mg for males aged 11-18 and 19+years, respectively (COMA, 1991). For women in the 11-50 years age group the estimated average dailyiron requirement is 11.4 mg, whilst that for postmenopausal (50+ years) women is 6.7 mg. Estimatedaverage daily requirements for children are 1.3 mg (0-3 months), 3.3 mg (4-6 months), 6.0 mg (7-12months), 5.3 mg (1-3 years), 4.7 mg (4-6 years) and 6.7 mg (7-10 years). It has been estimated that the totalRisk Assessment Iron 4amounts of iron required for a full gestation is 680 mg. Existing body iron stores should provide this requirement, assuming adequate iron stores at conception, cessation of menstruation and increasedintestinal absorption throughout gestation. Analysis of tissue levels and iron status A number of haematological and biochemical tests may be used to characterise iron nutritional status.Serum ferritin, serum iron concentration, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation(Fe/TIBC) indicate the level of iron supply to the tissues. Transferrin receptors are expressed on cellsurfaces in proportion to the cells requirement for iron. As functional iron depletion occurs, moretransferrin receptors appear on the cell surfaces. The concentration of cleaved extracellular domains, orsoluble serum transferrin ferritin and transferrin saturation areuseful as indicators of iron overload. In healthy subjects, an accurate determination of iron status can bemade using combined measures of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and erythrocyte protoporphyrin. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects No relevant data have been identified. Function The majority of functional iron within the body is present in haem proteins, such as haemoglobin,myoglobin and cytochromes, which are involved in oxygen transport or mitochondrial electron transfer.Many other enzymes also contain or require iron for their biological function. Total body iron averages approximately 3800 mg in men and 2300 mg in women. Approximately one third of body iron in men and one eighth in women is in the form of storage iron. Iron is stored mainlyin the liver within the iron storage proteins, ferritin and haemosiderin. Small amounts of ferritin are alsopresent in the plasma, although there are a number of differences from tissue ferritin and plasma has alow iron content, even in iron-overloaded individuals. Many of the key biological functions of iron in living systems rely on the high redox potential, enabling rapid conversion between the Fe 2+and Fe3+forms. The redox potential is, however, also potentially harmful in terms of the capacity for oxidative damage to cellular components such as fatty acids,proteins and nucleic acids. However, iron within the body (whether it is being stored, transported or as acomponent of various catalytic pathways) is normally bound to carrier proteins and/ or molecules withantioxidant properties, which minimise the capacity of the free ion to cause oxidative stress. Deficiency Iron deficiency generally develops slowly, and may not be clinically apparent until iron stores areexhausted and the supply of iron to the tissues is compromised, resulting in iron-deficiency anaemia.Groups that are vulnerable to iron deficiency include: infants over 6 months, toddlers, adolescents andpregnant women (due to high requirements); older people and people consuming foods high in ironabsorption inhibitors (due to poor absorption); menstruating women or individuals with pathologicalblood loss (due to high blood losses).Part 4 Minerals4 2764Interactions Interactions may occur between iron and other metals close to iron in the periodic table, such as copper, manganese, zinc and chromium. Studies in rats have shown that iron supplementation impairsthe absorption of zinc, and this has raised concerns that iron supplements may have adverse effects onzinc nutrition in humans. However, the magnitude of such an effect is less apparent in human studiesthan in rats. In general, calcium inhibits the absorption of iron. This may be relevant in consumption ofiron supplements with milk or calcium-rich foods. Absorption and bioavailability Modulation of absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract is the primary mechanism for regulationof body iron levels. The amount of iron absorbed from the diet can vary widely and depends on bodyiron stores and physiological requirement (generally, the rate of erythrocyte production). Absorption of haem and non-haem iron involves different mechanisms. In general haem iron uptake, which is via a specific haem receptor, occurs approximately 2- to 3-fold more extensively than that ofnon-haem iron and is largely independent of other dietary components. The mechanism by which non-haem iron enters intestinal mucosal cells is not clearly established, although there appear to beseparate mechanisms for the uptake of ferrous and ferric iron. Uptake of non-haem iron dependsinitially on a low pH to effect solubilisation. Iron chelators, such as ascorbic acid, increase absorption bymaintaining iron in solution. In the absence of chelators, ferric iron is generally less well absorbed thanferrous iron, due to its low solubility at higher pH. Dietary supplements are mostly inorganic salts. Ironsupplements are also available in the form of the iron protein complex, ferritin, but poor absorption isreported. Iron absorption from a diverse diet has been estimated to be approximately 15%. Women and children generally have lower iron stores than men, and thus absorb a greater percentage of the amountingested. This is particularly pronounced during pregnancy with absorption of dietary iron increasingthroughout gestation. Conversely, absorption is lower in postmenopausal women, in whom iron storesare generally high. Distribution and metabolism Iron is transported by the plasma transport protein, transferrin. In healthy adults approximately one-third of the total iron binding capacity is saturated. In conditions of iron overload or atransferrinaemia,non-protein-associated iron may also be detected in the plasma. Turnover of the total plasma iron pool(approximately 3 mg) is more than 10-fold every day. Approximately 80% of iron leaving the plasma isdelivered to erythroid bone marrow. Iron in circulating erythrocytes is returned to plasma transferrin bymeans of reticuloendothelial cell phagocytosis. Iron uptake by cells (other than during absorption from the intestinal lumen) occurs via binding of transferrin to the transferrin receptor, which is subsequently internalised within an endocytic vesicle.Recent studies have identified a number of novel proteins which are also likely to be involved in irontransport into and within cells, although the function of these proteins in iron transport has yet to bedetermined.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2774Excretion Little of the absorbed iron is excreted. Very small losses occur in the faeces, by desquamation of gastrointestinal cells, in haemoglobin and bile, and via the urine. Substantial iron loss can occur throughloss of blood. Average, total daily iron losses for healthy adults are 1.0 mg for men and 1.3 mg forpremenopausal women (assuming an average blood loss of 30 - 40 mL per menstrual cycle). Daily ironlosses for children have not been measured directly but are estimated as 0.2 and 0.5 mg for infants andchildren aged 6 - 11 years, respectively. Toxicity Human data Acute and sub-chronic toxicity Most cases of acute iron poisoning occur in children, due to accidental ingestion of iron supplements intended for adults. The acute toxic dose of iron in infants is considered to be approximately 20 mg/kgbw, associated with gastrointestinal irritation, whilst systemic effects do not generally occur at doses /H11021 60 mg/kg bw. The lethal dose in children is approximately 200 - 300 mg/kg bw. Iron poisoning inadults is rare. Individual case reports suggest that a dose of approximately 100 g (approximately 1400mg/kg bw) iron is lethal, although survival may occur with treatment. High doses of iron supplements are frequently associated with gastrointestinal effects, especially constipation, but also with nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. The severity and occurrence of the effectdepends upon the formulation of the supplement and the amount of iron released in the stomach. Severe gastrointestinal damage has been described following iron overdose. Reports of mucosal injury resulting from iron tablet ingestion at therapeutic levels are rare. Very few systematic studies of thepotential of therapeutic doses of iron to cause or promote gastric or oesophageal ulceration have beenconducted. The limited data available suggest that tissue damage due to iron tablets can bedemonstrated histopathologically. It is unclear whether therapeutic doses of iron are likely to initiategastrointestinal damage. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity Chronic iron overload may result from parenteral administration (as therapeutic iron or blood transfusions). Increased oral iron intake does not generally result in significant iron overload unless theiron is in a highly bioavailable form or there is an accompanying genetic defect, or increased demand(e.g. anaemia), causing increased iron absorption. 'Generalised iron overload' has been arbitrarily definedas an excess total body iron of more than 5 g in adults, and 'severe iron overload' as an excess of 10 g ormore, associated with iron-induced tissue damage, including cirrhosis of the liver and impaired heartand endocrine function. The term haemochromatosis, previously used to describe massive iron overloadassociated with iron-induced tissue damage, is now usually restricted to the primary, genetically-determined disturbance of iron metabolism, hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC), an autosomalrecessive disorder, associated with homozygosity for a specific mutation (Cys282Tyr) of the HLA-linked,HFE gene. The overall prevalence of HHC in Caucasian populations is approximately 1/250 with an estimated carrier frequency of approximately 0.1. The disorder is characterised by unregulated dietaryPart 4 Minerals4 2784iron absorption, excess to bodily requirement, leading to accumulation of excess iron in the parenchymal cells of the major organs of the body, primarily the liver, pancreas and heart. This results inirreversible tissue damage, with clinical disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes andheart failure) being manifested in middle age. Heterozygotes for HHC may show mildly increased signsof iron storage, but significant iron loading does not occur in the absence of other disorders related toexcess iron-loading. Secondary iron overload is defined as a quantitative increase in total body iron that is not the result of a genetically determined increase in iron absorption. The iron originates from either parenteraladministration and/ or increased absorption. Parenteral iron is initially cleared by the macrophages ofthe reticuloendothelial system, whilst iron absorbed from the gut may be taken up directly byhepatocytes. Pathology is most severe when there is both parenteral administration and increasedabsorption, as often occurs, for example, in the chronic inherited anaemia syndromes, \u00df-thalassaemiaand sideroblastic anaemia. In such cases iron chelation therapy is required to prevent the developmentof severe pathology and early death. Many epidemiological studies have found associations between markers of high body iron status and increased risk of either cardiovascular disease or cancer in the general population. Interpretation of suchstudies is difficult because the biochemical indices used to assess body iron status may have beenaltered by the existence of chronic disease. The results of epidemiological studies suggesting thatindividuals heterozygous for HHC show increased risk of chronic disease, particularly cardiovasculardisease, are also controversial. Iron supplementation is common during pregnancy, generally during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters (at levels up to approximately 200 mg/ day), with no reports of adverse effects other than gastrointestinalirritation. The relatively small number of reports that are available suggest that acute iron overdoseduring pregnancy is not associated with substantially increased foetal iron levels. Supplementation studies A large number of studies involving oral iron supplementation have been reported. Analysis of all reports was not possible, but was limited to those identified by database search as randomised,controlled trials. Many of these studies were carried out with the aim to improve iron status inpopulation groups who were known or likely to be at risk of iron deficiency, such as pre-schoolchildren, juveniles, adolescent girls and pregnant and non-pregnant women, often in developingcountries where such deficiency is common. Apart from gastrointestinal side effects, such studies havegenerally not addressed issues of potential adverse effects associated with oral iron supplementation. Supplementary doses of 100-200 mg iron/ day and above have been associated with nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain (Ganzoni et al. , 1966b; Reddaiah et al . 1989). Other studies have reported a range of gastrointestinal effects, including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation andepigastric pain, following supplementary doses of between 50 and 220 mg/ day (Hallberg et al ., 1993; Frykman et al., 1994). However, such effects were variable and appeared to vary depending on the formulation of the iron supplement given, with fewer adverse effects reported by subjects given supplementary iron aschelated iron or haem iron than by subjects given ferrous sulphate. Several studies have suggested that excess iron intake could result in decreased serum zinc levels. Decreased maternal serum zinc concentrations were reported following iron supplementation at dosesExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2794Part 4 Minerals4 of more than 60 mg/ day during pregnancy (Breskin et al ., 1983; Hambidge et al ., 1983, 1987) and Dawson et al . (1989) reported that daily supplementation of pregnant women with 18 mg iron, in combination with a multivitamin supplement (on average from 13 weeks of gestation to term), resulted in a significantdecrease in serum zinc level in the third trimester, compared with women who were given an equivalentmultivitamin supplement without iron. Conversely, Sheldon et al . (1985) reported that supplementation with 480 mg/ day ferrous fumarate (160 mg/ day elemental iron), from the first or second trimester ofpregnancy to term, had no effect on maternal serum zinc concentrations. As plasma zinc levels are notconsidered to be a good index of body zinc status the significance of these findings is unclear. One study found an association between supplementation with ferrous sulphate (equivalent to 60 mg elemental iron/ day) during pregnancy and reduced birth weight in women who were carriers for thesickle cell anaemia genotype (Menendez et al ., 1995). Animal data Acute toxicity Oral lethal doses of 675 and 1230 mg/kg bw were reported for ferrous sulphate and phospholipid- microencapsulated ferrous sulphate, respectively, in Swiss strain mice. An acute oral LD50value of 2800 mg/kg bw (560 mg/kg (Ferrochel) inSprague-Dawley rats. Sub-acute, sub-chronic and chronic toxicity Loading with high doses of carbonyl iron, a form of iron with higher bioavailability than other forms, has been used most to assess the effects of dietary iron overload in experimental animals. Chronic, high-dose supplementation in rats and mice results in rapid hepatic iron deposition, with a pattern similar tothat seen in human HHC, and associated with cellular changes but not, in the majority of studies, withthe development of fibrosis or cirrhosis. The main targets, in addition to the liver, were the heart,pancreas and the spleen. A number of genetic mouse models have also been developed to mimic dietary iron overload in humans. The haemochromatosis ( HFE -/-) gene-knockout mouse exhibits a pattern of iron overload similar to that seen in human HHC, and develops even greater levels of iron overload in association withhigh-dose dietary iron supplementation. These mice may, thus, provide a good model for future studiesof iron overload in humans with HHC. Reproductive and developmental toxicity A multigeneration study in rats showed no adverse effects of 20 mg/kg bw/week maternal iron supplementation (by intramuscular injection, but not during pregnancy) on the numbers of offspringproduced or their growth weights, with no significant evidence of excess iron transfer across theplacenta. A study of maternal iron poisoning in an ovine model also showed that extremely elevatedmaternal serum iron concentrations were not accompanied by corresponding increases in foetal serumiron levels. One study showed that iron gluconate was teratogenic after intraperitoneal administration to pregnant mice on the 8th and 9th days of gestation, the most pronounced defect being exencephaly. 2804Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity A number of studies have shown that supplementary iron added to the diet enhances the development of neoplasia in animals that produce spontaneous tumours, are inoculated with tumour cells, or areexposed to chemical carcinogens. However, (1200 - 1500 mg/kg bw/ day) dietary carbonyl-iron supplementation had no effect on the initiation or promotion of hepatocarcinoma in the Solt-Farber model of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. There appear to have been relatively few studies carriedout to assess the effects of dietary iron overload, in the absence of chemical carcinogens, ontumourigenesis in experimental animals. Supplementation of the diet with 80 mg/kg bw/ day iron inmice fed a high-fat diet was associated with increased mitotic and labelling indices in colonic crypts, butlow-level dietary iron supplementation in rats (approximately 5.1 mg/kg bw/ day iron, for 5 days) wasassociated with a significantly increased frequency of colonic crypt cell mitoses. Supplementation ofBALB/ cJ carbonyl-iron up to 4,500 mg/kg bw/ day, for periods of up to 12 months,was not associated with the development of hepatic fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, althoughthere was evidence of nuclear changes in hepatocytes in the animals receiving the highest dosesupplement for 12 months. The majority of ferric and ferrous iron salts that have been assessed, and also carbonyl iron, have produced negative results in gene mutation assays, but were positive for viral-enhanced celltransformation in Syrian hamster embryo cells, in vitro , or in a mouse lymphoma assay. Mechanisms of toxicity In the presence of available cellular reductants, iron may act as a catalyst in the initiation of free radical- mediated reactions. The resultant oxyradicals or lipid hydroperoxides have the potential to damage avariety of cellular structures, including lipids in organelle membranes, nucleic acids, proteins, andcarbohydrates, which could result in the disruption of numerous cellular functions. However, therelationship of such effects to the progressive fibrosis associated with chronic iron overload in humansis currently unclear. Dose response characterisation Although there are many studies on iron in humans, there is no relevant information on the doseresponse because the studies are correcting deficiency and frequently only test one dose level. Withregards to gastrointestinal effects in iron-replete subjects, the form of the iron affects the findings andtherefore it is hard to compare doses. The animal database is too limited to draw any conclusions regarding dose response. Vulnerable groups Individuals with pre-existing gastrointestinal tract disease or chronic hepatitis, have been shown to be vulnerable to the toxic effects of iron.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2814Part 4 Minerals4 Genetic variations Several inherited diseases, for example, hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC), are associated with increased iron absorption. Hereditary anaemias, such as thalassaemia or sideroblastic anaemia,frequently require treatment by repeated blood transfusions, which may result in iron overload andtoxicity. Studies of particular importance to the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Blot et al., 1981 In this study 132 pregnant women were given 105 mg iron (form not stated) plus 500 mg ascorbic acid, with or without 350 mg folic acid for 90 days. 14 % of subjects reported severe gastrointestinal effects(diarrhoea or constipation) and 16% minor effects. There was no difference in incidence between thegroups, but there was no placebo group. Brock et al., 1985 The tolerability of supplemental iron delivered from a wax-matrix tablet of ferrous sulphate was compared to that from a conventional ferrous sulphate tablet in a single blind, parallel group study.Both tablets delivered 50 mg of iron. The incidence of adverse gastrointestinal effects was significantlygreater amongst subjects taking the conventional tablets, than amongst those taking the wax-matrixpreparation. Of those taking the wax-matrix formulation only 19% experienced a severe or moderateadverse effect (306 reports), compared to 50% (1021 reports) of those taking the conventional tablets. Coplin et al., 1991 The tolerability of supplemental iron (50 mg iron) in the chelated form of bis-glycino iron was compared with that of ferrous sulphate in a randomised double-blind cross-over trial. Of the 38 participants, 37%experienced moderate to severe adverse gastrointestinal effects whilst taking ferrous sulphate,compared to 21% who experienced similar side effects whilst taking the chelate formulation. Frykman et al., 1994 In a controlled double-blind cross-over trial, haem and non-haem iron were administered to 100 healthy volunteers for periods of 1 month each. Groups of participants were given one of two different ironpreparations: Group 1: two tablets of 1.2 mg haem iron from porcine blood, plus 8 mg non-haem iron asiron fumarate. Group 2: one tablet of 60 mg iron as iron fumarate. The study was divided into threeconsecutive periods of one month each and all participants received a placebo for one of the last twoperiods. Participants assessed side effects by keeping individual symptom diaries, a multiple-choicequestionnaire was used for daily evaluation with listing of effects known to be related to iron therapy.The number of reports of obstipation and the total side effects, were significantly higher for the non-haem iron treatment, than for the haem iron or placebo. Constipation was reported in 35% and allgastrointestinal side effects were reported by 25% of participants during the non-haem iron phase ofthe trial. The effects reported for the haem iron treatment were indistinguishable from the placebo. 2824Liguori, 1993 In a prospective, controlled, double-blind, two-placebo controlled, multicentre trial the tolerability of ironproteinsuccinylate (ITF 282) was compared with a ferrous sulphate controlled release tablet. 1095patients were randomised to receive either two ITF 282 tablets per day (60 mg iron per tablet) or onecontrolled release ferrous sulphate tablet per day, containing 105 mg iron, both treatments lasted 60days. The general tolerability was reported to be favourable with both treatments, but significantly morefavourable with ITF 282. With ITF 282, 63 patients (11.5%) complained of 69 adverse reactions (25heartburn, 19 constipation, 25 abdominal pain), compared with 141 adverse events (33 heartburn, 31epigastric pain, 23 constipation, 32 abdominal pain, 8 skin rash, 14 nausea) reported by 127 (26.5%) ofthose taking ferrous sulphate. Lokken and Birkelan, 1979 In a randomised, double-blind crossover study, 19 young women received a dose of 120 mg/ day (2 x 60) iron as ferrous fumarate or placebo for 2 periods of 8 weeks. Seven participants experiencedgastrointestinal discomfort, 2 while taking placebo. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 12 mg / day 97.5th percentile: 24 mg/ day (from 1986/87 NDNS) Water 0.4 mg/ day (assuming 2 L/ day at UK limit of 0.2 mg/L)Supplements 20 mg/ day (up to 60 mg/ day for particular conditions, e.g. pregnancy) (Annex 4) Estimated maximum intake: 24 + 0.4 + 20 mg = 44 mg/ day Risk assessment In humans acute iron poisoning is associated with severe gastrointestinal damage which may include haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Blood and other fluid loss may lead to shock and coma. In some cases,apparent recovery may take place, possibly due to a latency period during which the iron is distributedthroughout the body. Systemic iron toxicity is characterised by multi-system damage, principally in theliver, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathies and cardiovascular collapse. Acute poisoning is relativelyunusual in adults, the lethal dose being approximately 100 g, but is more common in children. Iron overload as a result of dietary intake is unusual in the normal population and only a handful of case reports exist describing this phenomenon. This may be due to the reduction in iron absorption thatoccurs as exposure increases.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2834Part 4 Minerals4 Individuals with conditions such as hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC) are particularly vulnerable to iron overload, which occurs as a result of enhanced uptake. In subjects heterozygous for the condition,a small increase in iron storage may occur. It has been suggested that heterozygous subjects (up to 1% ofthe population) may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease but this remains controversial.Similarly, the suggestion that high iron status may be associated with other chronic conditions remainsunresolved. Studies in rodents suggest a pattern of iron overload comparable with that seen in haemochromatosis, with cellular changes but not with fibrosis occurring. Reproductive studies in rodents have shown nosignificant evidence of iron transfer across the placenta. This is supported by a study in an ovine modelwhere maternal iron poisoning did not result in increases in foetal serum iron levels. However one studyreports that iron gluconate is teratogenic, causing exencephaly in mice following administration on the8th and 9th days of gestation. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL Overall, there are insufficient appropriate data to establish a Safe Upper Level for iron. Manysupplementation studies have been conducted, generally in iron-deficient groups and none of them areapplicable to the population as a whole. For iron-replete individuals in non-developing countries, themost common side effects reported are gastrointestinal in nature, usually constipation but nausea,vomiting and epigastric pain have also been reported. These effects are reported to follow supplementdoses of between 50 and 220 mg iron/ day, the frequency increasing at higher dose levels. The severityand occurrence of effects depends on the formulation of the supplement (Coplin et al ., 1991; Liguori, 1993). A number of studies have examined the effects of different iron formulations. For guidance purposes, a supplemental intake of approximately 17 mg/ day (equivalent to 0.28 mg/kg bw/ day for a 60 kg adult) would not be expected to produce adverse effects in the majority of people.This is derived by dividing the lower end of the range found to have an effect by an uncertainty factorof 3 to allow for extrapolation from a LOAEL to a NOAEL. This is based on data referring to ferrous iron(Fe II), which is the form of iron used in supplements currently available in this country. No additionaluncertainty factor is needed for inter-individual variation because the assessment is based on studies onlarge numbers of people. A safe upper level for total iron has not been estimated, as gastrointestinaleffects are associated with iron in supplements rather than in foods. The guidance value of 17 mg/ day calculated above, does not apply to the small proportion of the population who have increased susceptibility to iron overload, via a mechanism of unregulated(increased) absorption from the diet, associated with the homozygous haemochromatosis genotype(estimated prevalence, approximately 0.4% in Caucasian populations). It is not possible to givequantitative information on the difference in susceptibility between this group and normal subjects. It should be recognised that many of the available studies do not look at side effects in detail and information on the long-term implications of iron supplementation on iron status and storage is lacking. 2844References Blot, I., Papriernik, E., Kaltwasser, J.P., Werner, E., Tchernia, G.

Natural occurrence Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the earth's crust. It does not occur as a pure metal in nature, but it is found in large deposits as magnesite, dolomite and other minerals. In this riskassessment the word 'magnesium' refers to ionic magnesium, except where specific magnesium salts aredescribed. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Magnesium is ubiquitous in foods, but the content varies substantially. Leafy vegetables, as well as grainsand nuts, generally have a higher magnesium content (60-2700 mg/kg) than meats and dairy products(less than 280 mg/kg). A number of magnesium salts are used as food additives. Magnesium salts arealso used in food supplements at levels providing up to 750 mg/ day, and licensed medicines to treatmalabsorption, as a perioperative nutritional support or in special diets, and are included in antacid andlaxative formulations. Other sources of exposure The magnesium content of water is variable. The concentration depends on the region of its source andits manner of storage. 'Hard' water has a higher concentration of magnesium salts. Recommended amounts COMA has calculated a RNI of 300 mg/ day for adult males and 270 mg/ day for adult females (COMA,1991). The RNI for infants and children ranges from 55 to 280 mg/ day. An RNI for magnesium duringpregnancy was not calculated by COMA. Analysis of tissue levels and magnesium status Tissue levels of magnesium are determined by atomic spectroscopy. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Dietary magnesium has been claimed to benefit bone health, but further studies are necessary toconfirm this suggestion.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2874Risk Assessment Magnesium4Part 4 Minerals4 288There have been clinical trials and case reports of the therapeutic effects of magnesium in potentially life-threatening conditions, such as the cardiac arrhythmia 'torsade de pointes', digitalis toxicity,bronchospasm, alcohol and myocardial infarction. It hasalso been suggested that magnesium possibly plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure. Magnesium salts are effective cathartic agents and are also used in some antacid preparations. Function Magnesium is required as a cofactor for many enzyme systems. It is required for protein synthesis and for both anaerobic and aerobic energy generation and for glycolysis, either indirectly as a part ofmagnesium-ATP complex, or directly as an enzyme activator. Magnesium plays a multifunctional role incell metabolism, (particularly at the level of key phosphorylations), and has a critical role in cell division.It has been suggested that magnesium is necessary for the maintenance of an adequate supply ofnucleotides for the synthesis of RNA and DNA. Magnesium regulates the movement of potassium inmyocardial cells and is also known to act as a calcium channel blocker. Magnesium is an important element in the metabolism and/ or action of vitamin D, and is essential for the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone. Deficiency Magnesium deficiency has been linked to cardiovascular, skeletal, gastrointestinal and central nervoussystem disorders and to the use of loop diuretics. Magnesium is essential for the normal function of the parathyroid gland and for vitamin D metabolism. Magnesium depletion markedly disturbs calcium homeostasis, and hypocalcaemia is a commonmanifestation of moderate to severe magnesium deficiency. Interactions Calcium homeostasis is controlled in part by a magnesium-requiring mechanism, which releasesparathyroid hormone. Several magnesium-activated enzymes are inhibited by calcium. Absorption and bioavailability The net absorption of magnesium from the diet is typically approximately 50 percent. High levels ofdietary fibre from fruits, vegetables, and grains decrease magnesium absorption. Dietary protein is alsoknown to influence intestinal magnesium absorption. Magnesium is absorbed along the entire intestinal tract, but the sites of maximal absorption appear to be the distal jejunum and ileum. It has been suggested that absorption occurs by both an unsaturablepassive and saturable active transport system. Thus, in both adults and children, the fractionalabsorption of magnesium is inversely proportional to the amount ingested.Distribution Magnesium is abundant in the body with the largest amounts found in bone. It is also found in a variety of other tissues including muscle, liver, heart and kidneys. In plasma, half of magnesium present is in theionised form. About 20% is bound to proteins, the remaining 80% is unbound. Most intracellularmagnesium is found bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. Excretion Magnesium is excreted primarily in the urine. extent of urinary excretion, and thereby thehomeostasis of magnesium, is influenced by a wide variety of hormones, including calcitonin, thyroxine,glucocorticoids, glucagons and angiotensin. Under normal conditions, the kidney tubule reabsorbs 95%of the filtered load of magnesium and about 5% is excreted in urine. Toxicity Human data No adverse effects have been associated with the ingestion of magnesium as a naturally occurringsubstance in foods. However, adverse effects have been seen with excessive magnesium intake as aconsequence of the use of various magnesium salts for pharmacological/medicinal purposes. The primary manifestation of excessive ingestion of magnesium from non-food sources is osmotic diarrhoea, which is reversible. Magnesium has a well-known cathartic effect and is used in medicines forthis purpose. Animal data There are only a limited number of studies on the toxicity of magnesium in animals. Studies on theshort-term toxicity of magnesium administered by the intravenous route demonstrated that the LD 50 value in rats is 174 mg/kg bw in females and 206 mg/kg bw in males, and in dogs is in excess of1200 mg/kg bw, but such data are of no value for this risk assessment. High doses (1000 mg/kg bw/ daythree times daily) of magnesium sulphate administered subcutaneously in reproductive studies in ratsresulted in lower food consumption and decreased body weight gains in the dams and produceddelayed differentiation in their pups. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Mice given magnesium chloride in the diet for 96 weeks (2% in diet, equivalent to approximately3000 mg/kg bw/ day) exhibited no evidence of compound-related carcinogenicity. In vitro genotoxicity tests were negative for magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2894Dose response No relevant data have been identified. Mechanism of toxicity No relevant data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Nagy et al., 1988 No adverse effects were reported in this study in which 20 patients with duodenal ulcers received up to 1200 mg of magnesium per day in the form of an aluminium-magnesium-hydroxycarbonate antacidover a 6-week trial period in a randomised, prospective cross-over clinical trial. Marken et al., 1989 Diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal effects were reported in a number of individuals participating in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study. The dose of magnesium in this studywas 470 mg/ day (given as 800 mg/ day magnesium oxide) for 60 days. Zemel et al., 1990 This study investigated the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure, erythrocyte cation metabolism and serum lipid levels in 13 patients with mild hypertension. The study employed a 3-weekplacebo run-in period and no adverse effects were reported following a dose of 486 mg magnesiumtwice daily for three months (given as magnesium aspartate). Paolisso et al., 1992 In this double-blind cross-over study, doses of 393 mg/ day magnesium (as magnesium pidolate) were well tolerated by 12 older subjects (mean age 77.8 years) over a 4-week period.Part 4 Minerals4 2904Bashir et al., 1993 This was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial, in which 21 patients with stable congestive heart failure, secondary to coronary heart disease, received 384 mg magnesium/ day (asmagnesium chloride) for 6 weeks. Gastrointestinal effects, including diarrhoea, were reported in 6 out ofthe 21 subjects receiving magnesium. Stendig-Lindberg et al., 1993 No diarrhoea or gastrointestinal effects were reported in a long-term study in which a group of 31 post- menopausal women received daily supplements of magnesium hydroxide (providing up to 750 mg/ daymagnesium) for 6 months followed by 226 mg/ day of magnesium for 18 months. Altura et al., 1994 No adverse effects were reported in 18 healthy 18-38 year old males who were given diets enriched with magnesium oxide for 6 days, providing a daily dose of 452 mg magnesium. Exposure assessment Food: Drinking 100 mg/ day (assuming an intake of 2 L/ day, estimated from 50 mg/L - EC directives) Supplements: 750 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake: 510 + 100 + 750 = 1400 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment The common effect of excessive ingestion of magnesium is osmotic diarrhoea. However, this effect was only observed in a limited number of studies of variable quality. There are only limited data on the oral and general toxicity of magnesium in animals. The available data suggest a lack of carcinogenicity at doses of up to 3000 mg/kg bw/ day. Mutagenicity tests onmagnesium salts have also been negative.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2914Part 4 Minerals4 ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data to establish a Safe Upper Level for magnesium. Although a few studies reported mild and reversible diarrhoea in a small percentage of patients and healthyvolunteers at levels of 384 to 470 mg/ day, these symptoms were not observed in the majorityof studies using similar or higher doses. For guidance purposes only, 400 mg/ day supplementalmagnesium would not be expected to result in any significant adverse effects. This isequivalent to 6.7 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kg adult. An uncertainty factor for human variability isnot needed because the value is derived from a number of studies in humans, some of whichreported no adverse effects at considerably higher doses. Guidance has not been given fortotal magnesium since the reported adverse effects are not associated with magnesium infood. The potential implications of this dose range for vulnerable groups such as infants andolder people needs to be addressed by further studies.

Within this risk assessment, the phosphorus refers to ionic phosphorus except where specific phosphorus compoundsare mentioned. Natural occurrence Phosphorus is most commonly found in nature in its pentavalent form in combination with oxygen, asphosphate (PO 43-). Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Phosphorus is widely found in many food groups, largely as phosphate(s). Dietary sources that are rich in phosphorus include red meats (1600 mg/kg), dairy products ( /H11022900 mg/kg), fish (4000 mg/kg), poultry (2100 mg/kg) and and other cereal products ( /H11022900 mg/kg). A number of phosphate salts are used in foods and soft drinks as additives (JECFA, 1994). Phosphorus is also used in food supplements (atlevels up to a daily dose of 1100 mg/ day) and licensed medicines, in the form of inorganic phosphatesalts and sodium acid phosphate, respectively. Other sources of exposure Phosphorus is present in fertilisers, detergents, sewage effluent and surface waters. The Drinking Waterin the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 specify a limit of 2.2 mg phosphorus per litredrinking water. Recommended amounts COMA (1991) noted that phosphorus requirements are conventionally set as equal to calcium, in massterms i.e. 1 mg phosphorus : 1 mg calcium. However, these elements are present in the body in equimolaramounts and COMA took the view that the ratio in the diet should be set at 1 mmol phosphorus: 1 mmolcalcium and considered that the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for phosphorus should be setequal to the calcium RNI in molar terms (1 mmol calcium = 40 mg, 1 mmol phosphorus = 30.9 mg). COMA therefore calculated a RNI of 550 mg/ day of phosphorus for males and females aged 19-50 years. COMA derived an increment of 440 mg/ day for women during lactation, giving a total of990 mg/ day. The RNI for infants and children ranges from 400 to 775 mg/ day.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2934Risk Assessment PhosphorusPart 4 Minerals4 Analysis of tissue levels and phosphorus status Phosphorus is abundant in the body with largest amounts found in bone. It is also found in all soft tissues including muscle, liver, heart and kidneys. Serum total phosphorus levels are measured bycolorimetric methods. Overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Treatment with oral or intravenous phosphate causes a decrease in serum calcium in hypercalcaemicadults. Thus, it has been reported to be useful in reducing hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. It is alsoused for the treatment of conditions of the bone, such as fractures, Paget's disease and multiplemyeloma. Function Phosphorus is a constituent of all major classes of biochemical compounds. Structurally, phosphorusoccurs as phospholipids, which are a major constituent of most biological membranes, and asnucleotides and nucleic acids. Phosphorus plays an important role in carbohydrate, fat and proteinmetabolism and is essential for optimum bone health. The energy that is required for most metabolicprocesses is derived from the phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate and other high energyphosphate compounds. Clinical studies employing chronic phosphorus supplementation were the first to show that high phosphorus intakes influence the parathyroid-vitamin D axis, which maintains calcium balance in thebody. The phosphorus loading in humans operates through mechanisms of nutritional or secondaryhyperparathyroidism similar to those observed in animals fed excess phosphorus. Deficiency Factors associated with phosphorus deficiency (hypophosphatemia) include liver disease, sepsis,alcoholism, diabetic ketoacidosis and the use of aluminium-containing antacids. The symptoms of apotentially fatal syndrome include anorexia, anaemia, muscle weakness, bone pain, rickets and ataxia.Hypophosphatemia in infants is known to occur in situations of poorly managed parenteral nutritionwith inappropriate administration of fluid and electrolyte therapy or with rapid refeeding afterprolonged dietary restriction. Preliminary studies have indicated that phosphate deficiency at birth isassociated with the development of rickets in later life. Interactions Phosphorus absorption is reduced by ingestion of aluminium-containing antacids and by pharmacologicaldoses of calcium salts. High phosphate diets cause a reduction in the urinary excretion of calcium. Absorption Net absorption of phosphorus from a mixed diet has been reported to range from 55 to 70 % in adultsand from 65 to 90% in infants and children. The intestinal absorption of phosphorus is greatest in thejejunum and decreases along the length of the small intestine. 29444Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 295Distribution and metabolism Approximately 80% of the body phosphorus is present in the skeleton and the remainder is distributed in soft tissues and extracellular fluid. About 70% of the phosphorus in blood is as a constituent ofphospholipids; the remainder is present as inorganic phosphate, about 85% free and 15% protein-bound.Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the major regulator of the balance of phosphorus and calcium. Thus, alow calcium and high phosphate diet induces the secretion of PTH, which decreases the serumconcentration of phosphate by increasing its urinary excretion. Excretion Phosphorus is primarily excreted in the urine. The regulation of phosphorus excretion is apparent fromearly infancy. In infants, as in adults, the major site for the regulation of the amount of phosphorusretained by the body is the kidney. Toxicity Human data The majority of the published data relating to the toxicity of phosphorus in humans focus on accidentalor intentional ingestion of the more toxic forms of phosphorus that are not found in food or foodsupplements (e.g. elemental yellow phosphorus). No human data on chronic toxicity of dietary forms of phosphorus were identified in the literature.Supplementation trials The predominant adverse reaction to orally administered phosphorus (as various phosphate salts, including sodium, potassium, ammonium and glycerol) in human supplementation studies is osmoticdiarrhoea, which has been reported at intakes of 750 mg/ day and above. Other mild gastrointestinaleffects, including nausea and vomiting have been noted in some studies. Animal data There are a limited number of studies on the oral toxicity of inorganic phosphate salts in experimentalanimals. Kidney lesions have been reported in rats following the administration of acute doses ofphosphates (approximately 5000 mg/kg bw/ day, equivalent to about 1200 mg/kg bw/ day phosphorus).Pathological effects in the parathyroids, kidneys and bone have also been reported in subchronic studiesat high doses (approximately 4000 mg/kg bw/ day, equivalent to about 1000 mg/kg bw/ dayphosphorus). No adverse effects on growth and reproduction were reported in an abstract report of long-term studies with phosphoric acid.Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity No data on carcinogenicity or genotoxicity of dietary forms of inorganic phosphorus and phosphate salts were identified. Mechanism of toxicity No relevant data have been identified. Dose-response characterisation Data from human trials indicate a dose-related increase in osmotic diarrhoea from intakes of 750mg/ day and above. Vulnerable groups One study suggested that increased phosphorus intake may lead to increased bone resorption inpostmenopausal women with osteoporosis (Goldsmith et al ., 1976). However, a more recent study in postmenopausal women found no biochemical evidence of increased bone remodelling as a result ofsupplementation with phosphorus (Brixen et al ., 1992). Black and Asian people and older people may be susceptible to bone resorption as a result of high phosphorus intakes, as they are more susceptible to hypovitaminosis D, which decreases the absorptionof calcium, and phosphorus has been shown to influence the parathyroid-vitamin D axis, causing anincrease in serum calcium levels via bone resorption. Genetic variations No genetic variations conferring vulnerability to phosphate toxicity have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Human data Goldsmith et al., 1968 This was a study of the role of phosphate as an adjunct in the therapy of multiple myeloma. Phosphate supplements (given as mixtures of sodium and potassium salts and providing a daily dose ofapproximately 1000 to 2000 mg phosphorus) were given to 14 patients orally for up to 15 months, orintravenously (duration not stated). Reductions in bone pain and urinary calcium were reported by theauthors. None of the patients developed any evidence of extra-skeletal calcification during follow-upperiods of up to 15 months. One patient developed an increase in pedal and pretibial oedema, whichsubsided when the phosphate salts were discontinued. Another patient complained of dyspepsiaPart 4 Minerals4 2964following the ingestion of phosphate supplements, although the same subject reported similar discomforts with other medications including placebo. Brixen et al., 1992 This was a study of the effect of a short course of oral phosphate treatment on serum parathyroid hormone levels and markers of bone turnover. A group of postmenopausal women with reduced bonemineral density and a history of at least one fracture were randomised in a double-blind study andgiven oral phosphate (providing 750, 1500 or 2250 mg/ day phosphorus) or placebo for 7 days; thesubjects were followed for 4 months thereafter. The phosphate was administered as effervescenttablets containing a mixture of ammonium phosphate, potassium phosphate and glycerol phosphate.The urinary phosphate/ creatinine ratio increased in a dose-related fashion whereas no significantchanges were seen in serum phosphate or serum calcium. Serum parathyroid hormone rose significantlyin the groups receiving 1500 and mg/ day phosphorus. No effect on serum parathyroid hormonelevels could be demonstrated with the lowest dose of phosphorus. Gastrointestinal side effects werenoted in a dose-related fashion in 2 of 19 patients receiving 750 mg/ day, in 3 of 19 patients receiving1500 mg/ day and in 7 of 20 patients receiving 2250 mg/ day. Whybro et al., 1998 This was a report of two studies carried out to test the effect of supplementation with phosphate on calcium homeostasis and bone turnover. Study 1 was a 1-week, randomised, controlled cross-over trialinvolving 10 healthy men supplemented with 1000 mg phosphorus (as sodium acid phosphate). Thecontrol diet for these men contained 800 mg/ day of calcium and 800 mg/ day of phosphorus. Study 2(involving 12 healthy men) was an escalating dose study of 0, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/ day phosphorus,given as phosphate for 1 week. The control diet contained 1000 mg/ day of calcium and 1000 mg/ day ofphosphorus as phosphates. Both studies showed an increase in the urinary excretion of phosphate and adecrease in urinary calcium. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone were only elevated in the first study.There were no changes in serum phosphate, osteocalcin or urinary N-telopeptide. Diarrhoea wasreported in one subject in study 2 when receiving phosphorus at 2000 mg/ day. Exposure day (assuming 2 L/ day at maximum level of 2.2 mg/L)Supplements: up to 1100 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum 2110 + 4.4 +1100 = 3200 mg daily intake: No potential high intake groups have been identified.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2974Part 4 Minerals4 Risk assessment In humans, changes in serum parathyroid hormone levels have been reported in supplementation studies in postmenopausal women with reduced bone mineral density and a history of fracture and inhealthy men. Osmotic diarrhoea and other mild gastrointestinal symptoms have also been reported insupplementation studies. However, these symptoms were only reported in a limited number of studies. There are limited data on the oral and general toxicity of inorganic phosphate salts in animals. Pathological effects in the parathyroid gland, kidneys and bones have been observed in mature male ratsfed a diet containing an excessively high level of sodium orthophosphate for 7 months. No adverseeffects on growth and reproduction were reported in long-term studies with phosphoric acid. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data from human and animal studies to establish a Safe Upper Level for inorganicphosphates. A few studies have reported diarrhoea and mild gastrointestinal symptoms at doses of 750to 2250 mg supplemental phosphorus/ day. The osmotic diarrhoea reported in these supplementationstudies was mild and reversible in nature. In addition, physiological changes in calcium and parathyroidhormone levels have been associated with intakes of 1500 mg/ day and above of supplementalphosphorus. Because persons with hypovitaminosis D are vulnerable to hyperparathyroidism, anuncertainty factor of 3 has been applied to the NOAEL of 750 mg/ day to allow for inter-individualvariation. Based on these limited studies, and for guidance purposes only, a supplemental intake of250 mg/ day would be expected not to produce adverse effects, including mild gastrointestinal upset.This is equivalent to 4.2 mg/kg bw in a 60 kg adult. Assuming a maximum intake of 2100 mg/ day fromfood and water, an estimated total intake of 2400 mg/ day (equivalent to 40 mg/kg bw/ day in a 60 kgadult) would not be expected to result in any adverse effects.

European Journal of Clinical Nutrition 52, 29-33. 2984General information Chemistry Potassium is an alkaline, metallic element. It is not found in the elemental form in nature and is always found combined with other substances, most commonly as the chloride salt (KCl). Potassium is widelydistributed in silicate rocks, and occurs in salt beds and seawater. Within this risk assessment, the wordpotassium refers to ionic potassium, except where specific potassium compounds are stated. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines Potassium is present in all animal and plant tissues. Major dietary sources include milk (1.4-1.5 mg/kg),fruit and vegetables (0.8-4.4 mg/kg), fish 3.9 mg/kg), beef (2-3.5 mg/kg),chicken and turkey (3 mg/kg); liver is also a rich source of potassium (2.5 to 4.2 mg/kg). Potassiumchloride is used in fertilisers and plant nutrients and thus may increase the potassium content of plants.Potassium chloride is the major ingredient used in salt substitutes to satisfy the taste for salt whilstreducing sodium intake. A range of food additives are potassium salts. Potassium iodide can be added to foods and is used in other countries to supplement iodine intake in iodine deficient regions. UK food supplements can contain up to 200 mg potassium per tablet as potassium chloride. Licensed medicines containing potassium chloride (300 mg/ dose) are available by general sale, for replacementof potassium loss following acute diarrhoea. Other sources of exposure The potassium content of mineral, spring, table and spa water varies widely. Recommended amounts The RNI for potassium is 3500 mg/ day for adults (over 18 years) of both sexes (COMA, 1991). There is noincreased requirement during pregnancy or lactation. Analysis of tissue levels and potassium status Potassium levels can be measured by flame emission spectroscopy, electron microprobe X ray analysisor measuring the dilution of radioactive isotopes of potassium. Total body potassium is estimated to beapproximately 135 g in a 70 kg adult man. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Potassium exerts a beneficial effect on hypertension by lowering blood pressure.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 2994Risk Assessment PotassiumPart 4 Minerals4 Function Potassium, together with sodium, is essential for the maintenance of normal osmotic pressure within cells. About 98% of the total body potassium is located intracellularly where the concentration can be30 times that of the extracellular concentration. The extracellular potassium concentration is a criticaldeterminant of neuromuscular excitability. Potassium is also a cofactor for numerous enzymes and isrequired for secretion of insulin by the pancreas, for phosphorylation of creatine and for carbohydratemetabolism and protein synthesis. Deficiency Hypokalaemia most commonly results from increased loss of the element, secondary to diarrhoea,diabetic acidosis, vomiting, intense and prolonged sweating, body burns or diuretic drugs. Rarely, 'crash'or very low calorie diets can result in reduced intake, sufficient to cause potassium deficiency.Hypokalaemia can cause rapid and irregular heart rhythm, muscle weakness and irritability, occasionalparalysis, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and low muscle tone in the gut, and has been reported topredispose to hypertension. Interactions The balance between sodium and potassium is very important. Excess sodium intake can depletepotassium. Magnesium deficiency results in failure to retain potassium and conversely, excessive levels ofpotassium may interfere with magnesium absorption. Thallium interacts with potassium in the body,because the active transport mechanisms for potassium do not differentiate between thallium andpotassium. In animals, the rate of loss of thallium from the body increases as dietary potassium increases. Absorption and bioavailability About 90% of ingested potassium is absorbed, irrespective of the amount consumed. The majority ofpotassium absorption occurs in the small intestine, mainly through passive mechanisms. Distribution and metabolism Potassium is transported in the extracellular fluid, and its distribution between cells is tightly controlled,with only 1.5 - 2.5% of total body potassium found in the extracellular fluid. A large proportion of the body burden of potassium is found in muscle and the skeleton, and it is also present in high concentrations in the blood, central nervous system, intestine, liver, lung and skin. Excretion The major excretory route of potassium is via the kidneys. It is secreted by the renal tubules, inexchange for sodium of the glomerular filtrate (ion exchange mechanism). Excretion in sweat and faeces is negligible, the latter changing only slightly as dietary potassium intake varies over a wide range. 3004Toxicity Human data Potassium chloride has been associated with acute poisoning in humans. Case reports have described heart failure, cyanosis and cardiac arrest after ingestion of high doses of potassium chloride tablets.Gastrointestinal toxicity has also been described after chronic ingestion of potassium chloride in casestudies and supplementation studies. This is characterised by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting,diarrhoea, and ulceration of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum and ileum. Case studies of toxicity resulting from high doses of salt substitutes have described chest tightness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, hyperkalaemia, shortness of breath and heart failure. For example, afatality resulted from hyperkalaemia and resultant asystole after ingestion of 21,000 mg of saltsubstitute representing an oral bolus of 11,065 mg potassium (Restuccio, 1992). A 2 month old boy diedafter being given three doses of 1500 mg potassium chloride with breast milk over one and a half days(Wetli and Davis, 1978). Supplementation trials Numerous potassium supplementation studies have examined the association between increased potassium intake and decreased risk of hypertension and heart disease. The majority of these studieshave shown beneficial effects of potassium supplementation. Although adverse effects have notgenerally been reported, outside the gastrointestinal effect, it is often unclear whether adverse effectswere investigated. Although few details were given, it was stated that no adverse effects were apparentin 18 subjects aged 66-79 given 2340 mg potassium (as potassium chloride) for 4 weeks (Fotherby andPotter, 1992) or in subjects aged 21-61 given 1900 mg potassium (form not stated) for 15 weeks (Siani et al., 1987). In a number of supplementation studies, potassium treatment resulted in ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract, the severity of the effect related to the formulation of the treatment and tofactors such as gut transit time. Hyperkalaemia also occurs as a result of potassium treatment. Animal data Acute oral administration of potassium to animals causes changes in acid-base balance, hyperkalaemia,changes in respiratory rate and hypernatraemia. Acute oral administration of potassium chloride inanimals has been reported to cause death by respiratory failure, with gastroenteritis and renal tubularnecrosis. The subchronic or chronic toxicity of potassium has not been investigated with inert salts such as potassium chloride. Effects produced with potassium nitrate (hypertrophy of the adrenal zonaglomerulosa) and potassium iodate in the renal attributed tothe anions (i.e. the nitrate and iodate moieties).Expert Group on and Minerals 2003 30144Part 4 Minerals4 302Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity There are no data on the carcinogenicity of potassium chloride. Potassium bromate, potassium iodide and potassium hydrogen carbonate produced cancers in experimental studies, but the effects wereattributed to the anions (i.e. the bromate, iodide and hydrogen carbonate moieties) and are thus notrelevant to this risk assessment. Genotoxicity studies have found that potassium bromate is mutagenic in animal and human cells and can produce DNA oxidation. Mechanisms of toxicity No relevant data have been identified. Dose response characterisation No relevant data have been identified. Vulnerable groups Older people may be vulnerable to potassium toxicity due to reduced physiological reserve in renalfunction. Individuals with pre-existing renal disease, hyperkalaemia, adrenal insufficiency, acidosis orinsulin deficiency are also vulnerable, as are those using certain drugs, such as potassium-sparingdiuretics, \u00df-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-convering and succinylcholine. Infants may be vulnerable toexcessive potassium due to limited renal reserve and immature function. Genetic variations No genetic variations that increase susceptibility to toxic effects of potassium have been identified. Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD). McMahon et al., 1982 The effect of differing formulations of potassium chloride supplementation on the gastrointestinal tracts of 48 healthy young men was investigated by endoscopy. Wax-matrix potassium chloridepreparations (providing 1250 mg potassium) three times a day for seven days (total daily dose, 3700 mgpotassium) resulted in considerable mucosal pathology, with erosions, gastric ulcers, inflammatorylesions and bleeding at endoscopy. A microencapsulated form of potassium chloride causedsignificantly fewer mucosal lesions.McMahon et al., 1984 In a further study, 225 healthy male subjects received either potassium chloride as wax-matrix tablets, in liquid form or microencapsulated, a potassium-sparer or placebo for one or two weeks. The doses usedranged from 900 - 3700 mg potassium/ day). Upper mucosal injury (erosions and ulcerations) was morefrequent after wax-matrix potassium chloride treatment. It was noted that gastro-intestinal effects weremild and did not correlate with endoscopic evidence of lesions. When hypertensive subjects 1560-3120 mg potassium/ day) an of21 months, 6/9 subjects developed erosions compared with 1/9 matched controls. Following 7 days ofin-patient treatment, one of the 6 subjects with erosions developed an ulcer and a further 2 placebosubjects developed erosions. The authors concluded that cyto-adaptation to potassium chloridetreatment did not seem to occur. Grimm et al., 1988, 1990 In a double blind study, groups of males aged 45-68 years were given 3700 mg potassium/ day (as potassium chloride) or a placebo (n = 148 in potassium group and 150 in placebo group). Adverse effectsreported in both groups after 12 weeks and two years included abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting,diarrhoea and bright red blood in the stools. The effects were not investigated by endoscopy. Theincidence was stated to be similar in the two treatment groups. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake Food Mean: 2800 mg/ day (from NDNS, 1986/7) 97.5thpercentile: 4700 mg/ day Water Up to 24 mg/ day (assuming 2 L/ day at the maximum permitted level in the UK) Supplements Up to 200 mg/ day (Annex 4)Estimated maximum intake: 4700 + 24 + 200 = 4900 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified. Risk assessment A number of case reports of accidental and deliberate poisoning with potassium have shown that large doses of potassium result in hyperkalaemia and hypernatraemia and lead to in changes in acid-basebalance and respiratory and heart rates. However, the dose associated with the onset of hyperkalaemiaand adverse effects varies depending on potassium status and clearance time.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 3034Part 4 Minerals4 Supplementation studies have generally not reported side effects, although it is unclear whether side effects were specifically investigated in many of these studies. However, endoscopic investigationfollowing periods of potassium supplementation has shown that potassium supplementation may causelocal irritation in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to erosion and ulcerations. The available animal data are not relevant to this risk assessment as the effects described are considered to be due to the anionic components, such as bromate and iodate. Older people and infants may be more vulnerable to potassium toxicity due to lower renal function, as may patients with conditions such as pre-existing hyperkalaemia, renal disease, acidosis, insulindeficiency or digitalis intoxication. ESTABLISHMENT OF GUIDANCE LEVEL There are insufficient data to establish a Safe Upper Level for potassium. The amounts of potassiumreported to cause adverse effects are variable and depend on factors which include formulation. In thestudy by Grimm et al . (1998, 1990), subjects received 3700 mg/ day potassium for 2 years, with the incidence of side effects being comparable in placebo and treatment groups. However, in studies byMcMahon et al . (1982, 1984), in which subjects were treated with 3700 mg/ day potassium, endoscopic examination indicated that gastrointestinal erosions could occur with only mild symptoms beingapparent. Overall, for guidance purposes, it can be concluded that supplemental doses of up to 3700 mg potassium/ day appear to be without overt adverse effects (this is equivalent to 60 mg/kg bw/ day in a60 kg adult), but may be associated with gastrointestinal lesions diagnosed by endoscopy. Nouncertainty factor has been applied for inter-human variation as this is based on data from a number ofhuman studies. The available animal data are not relevant to this risk assessment. Since the effectappears to relate to the ingestion of potassium supplements, rather than potassium in food, a guidancelevel for total potassium intake has not been calculated. Extrapolation of the guidance level to childrenon a bodyweight basis may be inappropriate. Infants, older subjects and patients with conditions such as pre-existing hyperkalaemia, renal disease, acidosis, insulin deficiency or digitalis intoxication should not take potassium supplementation withoutmedical advice. 3044References COMA (1991).

Journal of American Medical Association 240, 1339.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 3054Part 4 Minerals4 General information Chemistry Silicon (Si) is a non-metallic element with an atomic weight of 28. The term 'silica' is used to refer to naturally occurring materials composed principally of silicon dioxide (SiO2), whereas 'silicone' (organosiloxane) refers to man-made siloxane polymers based on a structure of alternating oxygen andsilicon atoms. Natural occurrence Silicon is not found freely in nature, but occurs chiefly as the oxide and silicates. Silica (SiO2) occurs in nature in several different forms: crystalline (quartz, cristobalite and tridymite) and amorphous. Whenexposed to water, silicates liberate orthosilicic acid to a concentration of 1-15 mg/L. Occurrence in food, food supplements and medicines High levels of silicon are found in foods derived from plants, particularly grains such as oats (4250mg/kg wet weight), barley (2420 mg/kg wet weight) or rice. Levels are lower in foods from animalsources. Beer is also a rich source of silica containing 33-60 mg/kg. Silicon is also found in drinking wateras orthosilicic acid. Amorphous silica is used as a food additive, in particular as an anti-caking agent, but also to clarify beverages, control viscosity and as an anti-foaming agent and dough modifier. It is also used as an anti-caking agent and as an excipient in pharmaceuticals for various drug and vitamin preparations. UK food supplements contain up to 500 mg silicon.There are no licensed medicines containing silicon as an active component. Other sources of exposure Consumption of 2 L/ day drinking water could result in consumption of up to 10 mg silicon. Exposure to high levels of airborne silica occurs in occupations such as quarry workers, miners, foundry workers andsand blasters. Silica deposited in the lungs can be slowly absorbed. Recommended amounts Although silicon is thought to be essential, recommendations on adequate nutritional intakes have notbeen established, either by COMA or other advisory bodies. 3064Risk Assessment SiliconAnalysis of tissue levels and silicon status Silicon was initially measured by a colorimetric assay, but high-performance liquid chromatographic/ electrothermal atomic absorption (HPLC/ETAAS) and atomic absorption spectroscopy(AAS) methods have been developed more recently. Methods of assessing silicon status have not been established. Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Silicon has been claimed to reduce the incidence and severity of atherosclerosis. Function Silicon is involved in the formation of bone and connective tissues. The precise mechanism is uncertain. However, it has been suggested that silicon could facilitate the formation of glycosaminoglycan andcollagen components of the bone matrix through its role as a constituent of the enzyme ofprolylhydrolase. Alternatively, silicon could have a structural role as a component ofglycosaminoglycans and glycosamino-protein complexes, occurring as silanolate in mucopolysaccharidesand linking different polysaccharides in the same polysaccharide chain, or linking acidmucopolysaccharides to protein. Deficiency Silicon deficiency has been produced experimentally in chicks and rats. Such deficiency producesdeformities of the skull and peripheral bones, characterised by poorly formed joints, defectiveendochondrial bone growth and reduced contents of articular cartilage, hexosamine, collagen andwater. The concentrations of elements such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, sodium, iron, potassium andmanganese may also be decreased in the femur or vertebrae. Silicon deficiency has not been observed in humans. Interactions Silicon has been reported to interact with a number of minerals including copper, zinc and germanium. The interaction between silicon and aluminium has been researched in more detail as a means ofinhibiting aluminium toxicity. However the results are conflicting and it is possible that silicon levels aretoo low for any effect to occur in vivo . Absorption and bioavailability The bioavailability of silicon depends on the solubility of the compound or speciation concerned. It is thought that silicic acid is the form absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. It has been reported thatthe absorption of silicic acid from the gut is 20-75 %.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 3074Part 4 Minerals4 Distribution and metabolism Silicon is widely distributed in the tissues. High levels are present in bone, nails, tendons and the walls of the aorta, with nails containing the highest levels (up to 1500 mg/kg). Lower levels are present in redblood cells or serum (approximately 44 mg/kg for red cells and 20 mg/kg for bound silicic acid inplasma. Silicon is also found in breast milk. Silicon has also been found in the liver, spleen and lung.Animal data suggest that high levels of silicon are found in the kidney, liver and lungs with moderateamounts being found in bone, skin, muscle, testes and spleen. Brain tissue contains negligible amountsof silicon. No data on silicon metabolism have been identified. Excretion Silicon is predominantly and rapidly excreted in the urine, with smaller amounts being eliminated in the faeces. Toxicity Human data Few data are available on the oral toxicity of silicon in humans and no acute or chronic toxicity datahave been identified. The occurrence of silica stones has been reported in patients on long term antacidtherapy with magnesium trisilicate. If inhaled at high concentrations over prolonged periods, certain forms of silica can cause silicosis. Silica particles are inhaled into the alveoli of the lung, causing tissue damage that ultimately results in fibrosis,which reduces the efficiency of the lungs and results in shortness of breath. IARC has classified silica (byinhalation) as a Group 1 'known human carcinogen', based on human epidemiological data with supportfrom studies in both animals and biological systems. In vitro studies have demonstrated that silicon has an inhibitory effect on superoxide dismutase and thus may potentially increase free radical damage. It is thought that the carcinogenicity of inhaled silica particles is due to local tissue damage and inflammation with the production of reactive oxygen species, which overwhelm cellular defences anddamage DNA. This process is considered not to be relevant to oral exposure to silica or silicon. Chronic occupational exposure to silica by inhalation can also lead to a distinctive nephropathy manifested clinically by albuminuria and hypertension and characterised pathologically by changes inthe glomeruli and proximal tubules. This nephrotoxic reaction (as with the respiratory toxicity describedabove) is thought not to occur by exposure to silicon in food. Animal data The acute oral toxicity of silicon (as silica) is low. No significant toxicity or mortality has been reportedin animals given doses of up to 3 g/kg bw/ day. 30844Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 309Growth rates were reduced, and the concentrations of certain other minerals in the plasma and tissues were affected in rats fed 500 ppm (equivalent to approximately 50 mg/kg bw for young rats) siliconfrom 3 different silicate forms in the diet for 8 weeks (either tetraethylorthosilicate (TES), sodium silicateor sodium zeolite (Kayonga-male and Jia, 1999). Of the forms tested, only sodium silicate is relevant tothe assessment of silicon in food. Similar results were observed in turkeys fed 270 ppm dietary siliconfrom the same three sources for 4 weeks. Similarly, in rats fed up to 5% syloid (amorphous silicon dioxide) for 24 months, treatment was not associated with any significant dose-related effects on growth rate, survival, haematology ormicroscopic pathology. Liver weights were reduced from 12-24 months in the females fed 2.5% and 5%syloid respectively, although a clear dose-related trend was not apparent. No dose related pathologicalchanges were observed. No dose related increases in tumours were apparent. Growth was reduced transiently in mice fed up to 5% (equivalent to 7,500 mg/kg bw/ day) syloid in the diet for 21 months. The treatment had no effect on haematology or gross or microscopic pathology. Itwas stated that an increase in tumours attributed to treatment was found in the haematopoietic organs,particularly malignant lymphoma/leukaemia which occurred in the mid-dose female mice only, but thiswas not considered significant because a statistical trend test was negative. No data on reproductive toxicity have been identified. Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Silicon was not carcinogenic in mice or rats at 5% in the diet. Silica was negative in the Bacillus subtilis recassay and was not mutagenic in the Ames test. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) was not induced in Chinese hamster V79 cells at a range of concentrations. Quartz has been reported to induce dosedependent increases in the number of morphologically transformed Syrian hamster cells. Overall,inorganic silicon compounds do not appear to have significant genotoxic potential. Mechanism of toxicity No data have been identified on the mechanism of oral silicon toxicity Dose response characterisation No data have been identified. Vulnerable groups No vulnerable groups have been identified. Genetic variations No genetic variations in the handling of silicon have been identified.Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Takizawa et al., 1988 Groups of 40 B6C3F1 mice were fed 0, 12,500, 25,000 or 50,000 ppm (5%) syloid (silicon dioxide) in the diet for up to 21 months (equivalent to 1,900 - 7,500 mg/kg bw silica or 900 to 3500 mg silicon). Thebasal silicon level of the diet was not stated. Interim sacrifices were made at 6 and 12 months, such thatup to 20 mice completed the dose period. The growth of mice in the top dose group was significantlyreduced at the end of the first 10 weeks of the experiment but no other significant differences wereapparent. Food consumption was significantly increased in the males fed 50,000 and 25,000 ppm. Nosignificant dose-related effects on haematology or gross or microscopic pathology, including tumours,were observed. Since the decreased growth rate is likely to be due to nutritional imbalance the topdose (equivalent to 7,500 mg/kg bw/ day silicon dioxide, or 3,495 mg silicon/kg bw/ day) was consideredto be a NOAEL. Groups of 40 Fischer rats were fed 0, 12,500, 25,000 or 50,000 ppm syloid in the diet for up to 21 months. The silicon content of the basal diet was not stated. No significant dose-related effects onfood consumption, growth rate, survival, haematology or microscopic pathology were observed. Minerallevels in the tissues were not measured. Liver weights were reduced (by up to 15%) in the 2.5 and 5%females from 12-24 months; a clear dose related trend was not apparent. No dose related pathologicalchanges were observed. No dose related increases in tumours were apparent but a relatively smallnumber of animals were used in the study. The few effects identified may have resulted from anutritional imbalance and therefore may not be relevant to humans. The top dose (equivalent to2,500 mg/kg bw/ day silicon dioxide, or 1,165 mg silicon/kg bw/ day) was regarded as a NOAEL. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake Food up to 50 mg/ day (Bowen and Peggs, 1984; Pennington, 1991)Supplements up mg/ day OTC, 2001)Water 10 mg/ day (assuming 2 litres of water at maximum reported level of 5 mg/L) (Pennington, 1991) Estimated maximum intake: 50 + 500 + 10 mg = 560 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups were identified.Part 4 Minerals4 3104Risk assessment Few data are available on oral silicon toxicity in humans. Animal data are available on certain forms of silicon, which suggest that high levels of silicon in the form of silicates can reduce growth and alter mineral levels in rats and turkeys, fed 500 ppm (approximately50 mg/kg bw) and 270 ppm silicon, from 3 silicon sources respectively. Some chronic studiesinvestigating the food additive syloid (99% amorphous silicon dioxide) are also available. Reductions ingrowth rates and organ weights at the higher doses were reported but no significant effects onhaematology or gross or microscopic pathology were observed. The changes reported may have beendue to nutritional inadequacies in the diet. Overall it can be concluded that the chronic toxicity ofsilicon as amorphous silica is low. Silica by inhalation is a known carcinogen, but this results from a mechanism specific to inhalation exposure. The available genotoxicity data are largely negative, although these are limited. No vulnerable groups have been identified and no data on the effects of silicon on children have been identified. ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE UPPER LEVEL Key study: Takizawa et al. (1988) NOAEL: 50,000 ppm supplemental dietary silica, equivalent to 2500 mg/kg bw/ day in rats, 7500 mg/kg bw/ day in mice). The study in rats has been used to establish the safe upper level. Uncertainty factors: 10 for inter-species variation 10 for inter-individual variation Safe Upper Level 2500/100 = 25 mg/kg bw/ day supplemental silica (equivalent to for daily 1500 mg/ day for a 60 kg adult)Consumption overa lifetime: In terms of elemental silicon, this is equivalent to a Safe Upper Level of 12 mg/kg bw/ day or 700 mg/ day for a 60 kg adult for supplemental silicon. Few data are available on the oral toxicity of silicon in humans and they are inadequate for risk assessment. Therefore the animal data have been considered for this purpose. The study by Kayonga-Male and Jia (1999) in rats and turkeys suggested that short term intakes of 500 and 270 ppm dietarysilicon respectively as silicates may result in reduced growth and other changes in mineral levels. Thisstudy used tetraethylorthosilicate (an organic silicon compound), sodium zeolite, which containsaluminium, and sodium silicate, which is the compound most representative of silicon in food. A moredetailed, chronic study by Takizawa et al (1988) indicated that chronic intakes of diets containing 12,500 and 25,000 ppm amorphous silica (equivalent to 600 and 1900 mg elemental silicon/kg bw/ day) werenot associated with any adverse effect in rats and mice respectively. The study did not investigatemineral levels but it is likely that any significant effects attributable to mineral deficiency would haveExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 3114Part 4 Minerals4 become apparent during the course of the study or would have been observed in the pathological examination. The adverse effects noted at 50,000 ppm (transient reductions in growth rates in mice andreduced liver weights in female rats) were likely to be due to nutritional imbalance and are notconsidered relevant to human exposure. Silicon does not have significant genotoxic potential. The Safe Upper Level of 700 mg/ day for supplemental intake of elemental silicon has been derived from a chronic dietary study in rats where no relevant adverse effects were observed at doses of up to50,000 ppm silica in the diet, corresponding to 2500 mg/kg bw/ day. Uncertainty factors of 10 for inter-species variation and 10 for inter-individual variation have been applied. Assuming an estimatedmaximum intake of 60 mg silicon from food and water, a Safe Upper Level for total silicon intake of 60+ 700 = 760 mg/ day can be estimated. This is equivalent to 13 mg/kg bw/ day for a 60 kg adult No groups particularly vulnerable to silicon toxicity have been identified. References Bowen, H.J.M. and Peggs, A.

SACN is currentlyconsidering salt intakes and health as part of a review and their recommendations are due to bepublished later this year. Chemistry Sodium chloride is the simple ionic salt of sodium and chlorine. It is an odourless clear or white softcrystal with a distinctive taste. Natural occurrence Sodium chloride occurs naturally as halite, known as rock salt, which is typically 95 to 99% sodiumchloride. The principal impurity of rock salt is calcium sulphate, with smaller amounts of calciumchloride and magnesium chloride. Occurrence in food and food supplements The salt content of natural foods varies widely. The main sources of sodium intake (excluding table salt)in the British diet are cereals and cereal products (particularly bread) and meat and meat products.Crisps and savoury snacks tend to be high in salt and can make a significant contribution to sodiumintakes. The main sources of chloride are the same as for sodium. The majority of salt intake in the UKdiet comes from processed foods, with about 10% from the natural salt content of unprocessed foods. Other sources of exposure No data were identified. Recommended amounts In adults, the RNI for sodium is 1600 mg/ day and for chloride 2500 mg/ day. COMA recommended areduction in the average intake of sodium chloride from food by the adult population from the currentlevel of 9000 mg/ day (150 mmol/ day) to 6000 mg/ day (100 mmol/ day) (COMA, 1994). Analysis of tissue levels, sodium and chloride status The steady-state concentrations of sodium and chloride in mammalian skeletal muscle are 12 mmol perlitre and 3.8 mmol per litre in the intracellular fluid respectively and 145 mmol per litre and 120 mmolper litre in the extracellular fluid respectively. In nerves, depolarisation is a manifestation of Na +influx. Serum sodium levels are well maintained at approximately 140 mmol per litre even in studies involvinghigh or low salt diets and elderly subjects.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 3134Risk Assessment Sodium chloridePart 4 Minerals4 Brief overview of non-nutritional beneficial effects Sodium chloride is an essential nutrient for the normal functioning of the body. It is important for nerve conduction, muscle contraction, correct osmotic balance of extracellular fluid and the absorption ofother nutrients. Function Sodium, together with potassium, is an essential mineral for regulating body fluid balance. Sodium is themost abundant cation in the extracellular fluid and sodium salts account for more than 90% of theosmotically active solute in the plasma and interstitial fluid. Consequently, sodium load is the majordeterminant of extracellular volume. Chloride is also important in maintaining the fluid balance and isan essential component of the gastric and intestinal secretions. Deficiency Sodium deficiency is highly unusual, but can lead to low blood pressure, dehydration and musclecramps. A normal diet will always supply sufficient chloride. Interactions Patients on salt restricted diets who also take lithium carbonate, prescribed for the treatment of manicdisorders, are susceptible to development of lithium toxicity. The excretion of lithium appears to beproportional to the intake of sodium and increased sodium intake can reduce both therapeuticresponses to lithium and its side effects. Absorption and bioavailability Sodium is absorbed passively from the lumen of the entire length of the intestine. Chloride is alsoabsorbed passively, but with decreasing efficiency along the length of the intestine and is not absorbedat all in the colon. Ionic sodium can also be absorbed actively from the lumen of the small intestineand colon. Once in the intestinal epithelium it is actively transported to the interstitial fluid. Distribution and metabolism Sodium is the principal cation of the plasma. Excretion Under normal conditions, gastrointestinal and respiratory excretion of sodium is negligible and sodium isexcreted primarily by the kidneys. Chloride excretion is by passive diffusion, but it also leaves thetubular lumen by active transport. 3144Toxicity Human data Although rare, acute toxicity may be caused by ingestion of 500 - 1000 mg sodium chloride/kg body weight. Symptoms include vomiting, ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract, muscle weakness and renaldamage, leading to dehydration, metabolic acidosis and severe peripheral and central neural effects. Opinion is divided concerning the long-term influence of dietary sodium chloride intakes greater then 6000 mg per day, on the development of essential hypertension. Significant increases in both systolicand diastolic blood pressures have been shown in studies in which normotensive adults have receivedsupplementary sodium. Reduction of dietary sodium is generally recommended as a non-pharmacological treatment for patients with essential hypertension. In normotensive adults a significantreduction in sodium intake is needed to achieve a modest reduction in blood pressure. In hypertensivepatients, the most pronounced effects of dietary salt restriction have been shown to be in people agedgreater than 44 years. Left ventricular hypertrophy, an important risk factor in premature cardiovasculardisease ,appears to be associated with high dietary sodium. High sodium chloride intakes increase calcium excretion and may increase the risk of kidney stone formation. However, there is no substantial evidence to suggest a relationship between excess sodiumchloride intake and reduced bone mineral density. Animal data Unilaterally nephrectomised rats treated with deoxycortisone acetate (DOCA) are used as a salt-sensitive model of hypertension, whereas two kidney one clip (2K1C) rats are used as a salt-resistanthypertensive model. Using these models it has been shown that high dietary sodium chloride (21% inchow) significantly increased systolic blood pressure in DOCA treated rats, but not in controls or 2K1Crats. The high salt diet exacerbated renal arterial and arteriolar and glomerular lesions in both the salt-dependent and salt-independent hypertension models. Ad libitum feeding of rats with diets containing sodium chloride or sodium citrate, or sodium-free diet, for four weeks showed that dietary sodiumrestriction prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Reproductive toxicity In rodents, extremely high doses of sodium chloride during pregnancy caused musculoskeletal abnormalities, foetotoxicity and foetal death and post-implantation mortality and abortion. High dietarysodium chloride intakes throughout gestation and during the early life of offspring have been shown topredispose to high fluid retention in the rat. Administration of a high sodium chloride diet fromconception to weaning increased adult blood pressure, whereas exposure only at weaning had no effecton blood pressure. Rats born to mothers on a normal sodium diet, but fed by females on a high sodiumdiet, and then weaned and raised on a high sodium diet, developed more hypertension than those onlyraised on a high sodium diet after weaning. Thus it appears that the transfer of sodium via maternal milkis an important factor in the development of high blood pressure in adult rodents.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 3154Part 4 Minerals4 Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity Sodium chloride has been demonstrated to be a gastric tumour promoter in experimental animals and high sodium chloride intakes have been associated with incidence of stomach cancer in humanpopulations with traditional diets of highly concentrated, salted foods. Vulnerable groups It has been suggested that the blood pressure of some individuals is far more sensitive to the effects ofsodium depletion or loading than others. These individuals are considered to be salt-sensitive. In anormotensive population (320 subjects) approximately 30% were shown to be salt-sensitive, irrespectiveof ethnic origin. Characteristics shared by 'salt-sensitive' individuals include differences in responses ofthe renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems, renal function, body fat distribution, insulinresistance and intracellular ion transport. Since urinary calcium excretion increases with elevated dietary sodium chloride (by approximately 1 mmol calcium (40 mg) for each 100 mmol (2300 mg) increase in sodium chloride), high salt intakeincreases susceptibility to calcium salt crystallisation in urine. In calcium stone-forming patients, highsodium chloride intake has been associated with low bone density. Very young babies cannot excrete excess sodium chloride through their kidneys, which gives rise to the advice that salt should not be added to baby foods. Genetic variations It has been shown that in a hypertensive population in the USA, 73% of black people were salt-sensitive,compared with 55% of white people. An increase in salt sensitivity with increasing age and at lowerrenin levels appears to be common in the three ethnic groups most commonly studied (whites, blacksand Japanese). Compared with white populations, black populations have higher blood pressure earlierin life and have a greater incidence of more severe hypertension and thus a greater risk ofcardiovascular complications. Considering hypertension and associated cardiovascular complications,males are a higher risk group than females. Mechanism of toxicity Experiments in salt-sensitive rats indicate that increased blood pressure results initially from acombination of increased cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Dose response characterisation The effect of sodium chloride on hypertension is a continuous response with no threshold. Susceptiblepeople are affected at intakes that would not cause an effect in the rest of the population. Bloodpressure is linked to salt consumption, and the magnitude of the increase in blood pressure is linkedto age. 31644Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 317Studies of particular importance in the risk assessment: (For full review see http:/ /www.food.gov.uk/ science/ ouradvisors/vitandmin/ evmpapers or the enclosed CD) Human data Mascioli et al., 1991 In a randomised, double-blind cross-over trial normotensive subjects (n = 48, average age 52 years) were placed on a low sodium basal diet (35 mmeq sodium/ day or less, approximately 800 mg sodium/ day).After six weeks acclimatisation this group received capsules containing supplementary sodium chloride(96 mmeq sodium/ day, approximately 2200 mg sodium/ day) for four weeks. They then entered a two-week washout phase, followed by a four-week placebo period. A second group had a four-weekplacebo period first, then a two-week washout period, which was followed by four weeks of sodiumchloride capsules. Total sodium chloride intake during the treatment period was estimated to beapproximately 7500 mg/ day. On average, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increasedsignificantly (3.6/2.3 mm Hg) during the sodium chloride treatment periods, compared with the placebocontrol. Increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded in 65% and 69%, respectively,of study participants during the sodium chloride treatment period, compared with the placebo control. Ganry et al., 1993 A small crossover study, of six normotensive patients (males and females), examined the effect of sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate on blood pressure regulation. The subjects were given a basaldiet containing 85 mmol sodium chloride and each of the two treatments gave an additional 151 mmolsodium per day for six days with similar water intake. Additional sodium chloride was given in the formof nine capsules, 9 x 986 mg = 8,874 mg/ day, leading to a total sodium chloride intake of approximately13,900 mg/ day. Sodium loading in the form of bicarbonate had no effect on blood pressure, whereassodium chloride for the same period significantly increased the blood pressure. Exposure assessment Total exposure/intake: Food Mean: 1986/1987 NDNS) Note 1: this does not include salt added at the table or during cooking.Note 2: Supplements do not contain sodium chloride, but some contain chloride at up to 72 mg/ daily dose. Estimated maximum daily intake:13000 mg/ dayNo potential high intake groups have been identified.Risk assessment Although rare, acute sodium chloride toxicity may be caused by ingestion of 500 - 1000 mg sodium chloride/kg bodyweight. Symptoms include vomiting, ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract, muscleweakness and renal damage, leading to dehydration, metabolic acidosis and severe peripheral andcentral neural effects. This is however, normally self-limiting. High sodium chloride intakes increase calcium excretion and may increase the risk of kidney stone formation. There is evidence for a causal relationship between the consumption of sodium (mainly fromcommon salt) and both blood pressure and the age-related rise in blood pressure. Data suggest that30% of a normotensive population may be salt sensitive. In rodents, extremely high doses of sodium chloride during pregnancy caused musculoskeletal abnormalities, foetotoxicity and foetal death and post-implantation mortality and abortion.Administration to rats of diets containing high levels of sodium chloride throughout pregnancy andduring the early life of offspring have been shown to permanently alter fluid retention and to increaseblood pressure in the offspring. EVM OPINION It is not possible to establish a Safe Upper Level for sodium chloride because there appears to be agraded response across doses that include the current estimated intake in the UK. Increased blood pressure is seen in susceptible sectors of the population (those who are 'salt sensitive'), at intake levels that are not above average for the population as a whole. Results are available fromnumerous trials in hypertensive individuals, in which decreasing sodium chloride intake has been shownto have beneficial effects, by lowering blood pressure. However, the data from administration ofincreased levels of dietary sodium chloride are minimal. Opinion is divided concerning the long-terminfluence of dietary sodium chloride intakes greater then 6000 mg per day on the development ofessential hypertension. Increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed innormotensive adults receiving 2200 mg/ day supplementary sodium, with estimate total sodiumchloride intake of 7500 mg/ day. Two small trials in normotensive individuals have shown that intakes ofsodium chloride of approximately 14,000 mg/ day lead to increased blood pressures. The assumption ismade that similar or greater effects might follow augmentation of sodium chloride intake inhypertensive individuals. Sodium chloride causes an increase in blood pressure at customary dietary intakes in susceptible individuals, leading to the COMA and SACN recommendations for a reduction in intake. Sodiumchloride is not ordinarily suitable for use in supplements.Part 4 Minerals4 3184References COMA (1994). Nutritional Aspects of Cardiovascular Disease.

Sulphur was included as an essential element.However, elemental sulphur is not essential per se, since the body's requirements are met via themetabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine obtained from dietaryprotein. Inorganic or elemental sulphur compounds are not available in dietary supplements. Sulphur is present in a wide variety of compounds that occur in food. For example, as well as being naturally present in foods, sulphites, and to a lesser extent sulphates, are widely used as food additivesand their safety in this context has been assessed by a variety of regulatory bodies. As noted previously,sulphur is also present in amino acids and, in other food components such as glucosolinolates. Theconsideration of such compounds, particularly food additives, is not within the remit of the EVM. Elemental sulphur is used as a folk remedy. However, relatively few data in either humans or animals are available. Absorption of elemental sulphur is poor in man and other monogastrics. Absorbed sulphur islikely to be rapidly oxidised to sulphate; unabsorbed sulphur is likely to be reduced to hydrogensulphide by gut flora. There are a few case reports suggesting that intakes of several hundred grams of elemental sulphur are associated with symptoms such as chest pain, lethargy, confusion and, in particular, metabolic acidosis.However, in all these cases, underlying medical conditions such as renal disease and constipation mayhave contributed to the observed symptoms. Few data are available on dietary sulphur intake. It has been estimated that the human diet contains approximately 1% sulphur. Assuming that adults consume 1 kg food/ day, this would represent a sulphurintake of 10 g or, 143 mg/kg bw for a 70 kg adult. However, this intake would largely consist of sulphurcontaining amino acids and other food components. In view of the scarcity of relevant data and since the majority of sulphur-containing compounds are not within its remit, sulphur has not been fully reviewed or assessed by the Group. 3204EVM Statement SulphurAnnexesAnnexes Annex 1.

Assessment of Information Introduction The scientific data considered by the EVM in the assessment of a particular vitamin or mineral were obtained from both human and animal studies. The EVM has also considered exposuredata taken from nutritional surveys conducted by UK Government Departments and fromother published scientific literature. When assessing and comparing the design and conduct of scientific investigations, a range of factors which determine the quality of the study and the reliability of the results must beconsidered. Formal guidelines are available for clinical trials and increasingly in otherepidemiological studies, whereas in other areas assessment is more dependent on the opinionand experience of the reviewer as to the characteristics of a good study. There are manypublished articles available discussing the issue. This annex considers the strengths andweaknesses of different types of studies in more detail. The authors of the EVM reviews have considered the strengths and weaknesses of study design and conduct in assessing the quality and reliability of particular studies and, whereappropriate, will have included their views in both the review and risk assessment papers. EVMMembers have also discussed these aspects in their assessment of the data. However, becauseof the diversity of the available data no formal systematic review methodology has been usedduring the assessment process. Human Studies The examination of the influence of nutrient intake upon human health may depend uponobservational and interventional studies, whilst experimental studies assist characterisation ofunderlying metabolism, including metabolic or other aberrations. In this context, humanstudies therefore include nutritional and toxicological studies and may derive support fromcomparable studies in animals. Some human data are available from case reports of accidental or deliberate poisonings. However, there may be difficulties in determining the precise nature of the exposure in suchcases. Case reports may also be difficult to compare because of the different circumstancesof exposure. Interventional trials These may vary from clinical trials of classic design with randomisation of individuals to receive the intervention under study and a comparator (placebo or alternative treatment), tosimple field studies in which a community, or group-wide intervention is made openly and thesubsequent occurrence of disease is examined. These studies also include nutritionalinvestigations of absorption, metabolism and nutrient balance in human volunteers. 324Observational studies Observational studies can include ecological studies, which investigate groups of individuals such as those living in a particular city or country, and studies which investigate exposure andhealth effects (both adverse and beneficial) in individuals in, for example, cross-sectional,cohort and case-control studies. Ecological studies include geographical studies of spatial patterns and time trend studies. In geographical studies, the relationship between the spatial patterns of exposure (for exampleregion, work-site or school) and disease are described. Time trend studies assess theassociation between changes in exposure and disease over time. Cross-sectional studies focus on individuals at a particular point in time, i.e. they represent a 'snapshot'. They are limited to describing the frequency of the disease at that time and thevariation between exposure subgroups, where exposure is also ascertained at that time. Theyare most useful for exposures or parameters that cannot change over time, e.g. blood group. Cohort studies (follow-up or prospective studies) follow a group of people with a particular exposure and compare disease occurrence in the exposed group with that in a non-exposedgroup. Cohort studies enable rates of disease in the exposed and non-exposed populations tobe estimated and any associations to be evaluated. However, they may be time consuming andcostly and need large numbers of subjects where rare diseases are considered. In case-control studies (retrospective studies), individuals with a particular condition (cases) are compared with a group of individuals without the condition (controls). Information onpast exposure to possible risk factors is obtained for both cases and controls. The level ofexposure in the cases is compared to that of the controls. Case-control studies are useful forstudying rare diseases and can be quick and cost efficient. However, recruitment and selectionof controls and exposure estimation may present problems when considered retrospectively. BiasAlmost all epidemiological studies are subject to some degree of bias. The three most important types are: confounding bias information bias selection bias Confounding occurs when another variable is both associated with the disease of interest and differently distributed across different exposure groups. Confounding factors can be adjustedfor either at the design stage, e.g. matching on the factors in a case-control study, or at theanalysis stage. Information bias can occur in correctly identifying both the individuals with a disease and in allocating an exposure to an individual (e.g. recall bias). This may cause misclassification (in either disease and/ or exposure classification) and can affect estimates of risk.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 325Annexes Selection bias arises in the selection of study subjects from the target study population and can be particularly problematic in case-control studies. Causality An association between an exposure and an effect does not necessarily mean there is a causal relationship. Case-control and cohort studies can both evaluate potential causal relationshipswith the magnitude of the relative risks or odds ratios giving an indication of a possible causalrelationship. Evidence of a exposure-response relationship would also indicate causality.However, such results need to be considered in the context of other epidemiology studiesand mechanistic or toxicological investigations. Assessing human studies When assessing the quality of human studies a number of points should be taken intoaccount, though not all will apply to all studies. There should be a clear description of the study objectives and the hypothesis to be tested. The study design should be appropriate to achieve the objectives. There should be a clear description of the study population (including control or comparison groups if appropriate) and how the main variables were measured, in particularhealth effects and exposures. Validity and reliability of measurements should be addressed. The size of the study should be adequate to provide sufficient power to address the objectives. Appropriate statistical analysis methodology should be used and adequately described or referenced. Response or tracing rates should be reported and any potential bias through non-response discussed. The results should be clearly presented and include both statistical significance levels and confidence intervals if appropriate. Potential bias due to confounding, subject selection and data measurement should be addressed in the analyses and discussed. The results should be interpreted in the light of evidence from other research, both epidemiological and toxicological, including consistency, strength of association andexposure-response, and biological plausibility. Human studies considered by the EVM The EVM has considered a wide range of experimental, observational and interventional studies. Due to the difficulties in assessing the effects of individual micronutrients, thedatabase is a limited one. The experimental studies have been relatively few but have includedlarge clinical trials such as the Alpha Tocopherol-Beta Carotene (ATBC) study in male smokers.The observational studies have included investigations where populations have been exposedto trace elements such as boron or manganese in drinking water, these have generally been ofpoor quality, with very limited information on exposure. Other observational studies haveincluded investigations of occupational exposure to elements such as manganese, and havegenerally been better conducted and reported. 326Experimental studies (such as ATBC) involved large numbers of subjects but focused on specified endpoints such as cancer or stroke and did not provide information on more minorside effects. In many studies, only a single dose level was investigated. Many of the clinicaltrials considered by the EVM were designed to examine the potential beneficial effects ofvitamins or minerals and did not consider the issue of adverse effects in detail, if at all. One particular difficulty has been the lack of information on total exposure to a particular nutrient, the effects of supplemental nutrients on particular parameters being investigatedwithout quantifying the exposure from the rest of the diet. Animal and in vitro studies The majority of the animal data considered by the EVM are toxicity studies. However, some nutritional experiments have also been conducted in laboratory animals. These can be feedingtrials to assess the effects of deficiency or of excess nutrients, studies on bioavailability ormetabolic studies. When assessing such studies, the following section on assessingtoxicological data covers most of the relevant issues. Types of toxicity data Toxicity studies in animals can be single dose (acute) studies or repeat dose studies of various lengths (generally 1 week to 2 years/lifespan) or which cover specific periods or processesduring the life of the animal such as reproduction and development or cell division (for in vivo mutagenicity) studies. In vitro studies usually investigate specific tissues or cell types to investigate pre-defined end points. The most common in vitro studies investigate mutagenicity. Assessing toxicity data In practice, toxicity studies can be broadly divided into two categories: regulatory studies and investigative studies. Regulatory studies are conducted to assess the safety of a substance, tomeet regulatory requirements prior to marketing, or in support of health and safety orenvironmental legislation. Regulatory studies are usually part of a standardised package andindividual studies use well defined methods, and study a wide range of body tissues, withoutany a priori hypothesis of possible effects. Investigative studies are concerned with researching a particular issue, such as studying the mechanism of a particular effect, and havea more specialised design. Guidelines exist for the conduct of regulatory studies. For example, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) set minimum criteria for acceptability ofdata under the Mutual Acceptance of Data agreement. (These apply to chemicals other thanpharmaceuticals, which are covered by other harmonisation agreements). A guideline isproduced for each type and/ or length of study, ranging from in vitro mutagenicity studies to multi-generation animal studies. These provide specific criteria for study design and areformulated to ensure harmonisation of approach and thus mutual acceptance of data by thedifferent regulatory agencies worldwide. Studies that comply with current OECD guidelinesshould be of high quality since they reflect the consensus on the most up-to-date practice.The OECD guidelines are broadly similar to the guidelines produced by the European Unionwhich are listed in Annex V to Directive 67 /548/EEC on the Classification, Labelling andExpert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 327Annexes Packaging of Dangerous Substances. Regulatory bodies such as the US FDA also produce detailed guidelines for the conduct of regulatory studies. Guidelines for test methods used inmutagenicity studies have been produced by the United Kingdom Environmental MutagenSociety (UKEMS). Other bodies such as the EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and the UK Committees on the Toxicity, Mutagenicity and Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products andthe Environment (COT, COM and COC) have also issued guidelines. These tend to be moreflexible, indicating the information or data package required rather than specifying in detail theway to obtain it. Advice has also been issued by international bodies such as the JointWHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Regulatory studies should be conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). This is a system which aims to ensure that laboratory studies areproperly planned, performed, monitored and recorded. All information is recorded andtracked so that the results and conclusions can be verified. Quality assurance is an essentialcomponent of GLP. Laboratories must be registered for GLP compliance by a nationalauthority. In the UK, GLP is regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare products RegulatoryAgency, an executive agency of the Department of Health. There are no guidelines covering investigative studies (although they may in some instances be conducted in compliance with GLP). This means that professional judgement has to be used toassess the quality of the study. A well reported study should provide enough detail of themethods used to allow the work to be reproduced by others. Data from investigative studiesmay be used to support or elucidate the findings of regulatory studies. Assessing animal studies A list of factors considered in assessing the quality of a study is given below. Other more specialised points will apply to different types of study. Not all the factors below will applyto every study and where information is missing, this does not always indicate that the study isof poor quality, though it may reduce confidence in a study. The methods used should be clearly stated and adequate results provided. The appropriate species and strain of animal should have been used. The numbers should be such that the study has adequate power. For example, 50 animals of each sex per dose group would be used in rodent carcinogenicity studies to ensure that anincreased incidence of tumours can be identified. Fewer animals would be used for studiesof shorter duration or involving non-rodent species (although in the latter case the scientificand statistical justification is not clear). The animals should be healthy and housed in suitable conditions. Infections may occur in laboratory animal populations and affect the results and interpretation of a study. It isimportant to have information on body weights and preferably on food and waterconsumption, since substances that affect the palatability of food or water may confusefindings by reducing intakes and causing, for example, weight loss and dehydration. Whereanimals have died during the study it needs to be clear whether this was scheduled orwhether the animals were found dead or moribund. The cause of death should be stated asthis may not always be treatment related. 328Ideally, the doses used should cover the range of adverse effects, from no-observed effect, through subtle effects to clear effects. In long-term studies, the dose used should notexceed the maximum tolerated dose. Use of excessive doses may affect survival and thusshorten duration of treatment, as well as leaving too few survivors to assess the statisticalsignificance of the effect. It may also produce secondary toxic effects that are of little or norelevance to lower doses. Although the dose regime should produce some indications oftoxicity, feeding animals large amounts of non-toxic compounds can result in nutritionaleffects if the quantity of test substance in the diet results in inadequate levels of othernutrients. The limit dose for all studies is considered to be 2 g/kg bw/ day to ensure that theresults are meaningful. Other limits apply to different methods of dosing such as gavage sothat the animal is not harmed by the procedure. The dosing should cover the appropriateperiods in the animals' life/ development. This is particularly important for reproductive anddevelopment toxicity studies. It is helpful for EVM purposes when the dose is given inmg/kg bodyweight/ day. Appropriate statistical analyses should be conducted. Appropriate measures of effect, adequate pathology of all major organs (macroscopic and microscopic), biochemistry, haematology and optimised methods (especially enzymeimmunoassay kits and reaction conditions for enzyme assays) should be used. Assessing in vitro studies Many of the points discussed above have analogies for in vitro testing. For example The methods used should be clearly stated and adequate results provided. Appropriate concentrations should be used, taking into account the possible effects of the test article on the test system (e.g. pH, osmolality, cytotoxicity etc). This also depends onthe test concerned since some may require testing into the cytotoxic range. The cells ortissues should be exposed in the correct part of the cell cycle. Appropriate exogenous activation systems and both negative and positive controls should be used. In addition, it is important to consider whether the tests have been validated. Test methods which are included in regulatory guidelines can be considered adequately validated. Otherassays may provide supporting information, but may not be adequate in the absence of resultsfrom the accepted test battery. Interpretation When considering the interpretation of the study, it is important to consider whether the data support the conclusions that have been drawn. It is not possible to conclude a lack of effectsfrom an inadequate study and the evaluation of positive effects may be confounded by poorconduct or poor reporting of a study. Where there are uncertainties due to a limited study ora poor database this may be accounted for by the use of uncertainty factors. Other factors to consider include whether there was a dose-related response (an effect in a single group may indicate a random effect such as a statistical anomaly, a design problem or ahighly specific adverse effect).Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 329Annexes The findings, if any, need to be assessed for their relevance to humans. Certain effects can be either species specific or may be related to the experimental method, such as the dosingmethod used. Where investigations have been published, it is worth considering whether this is as a peer- reviewed article or as a letter, abstract or conference report. It is also worth noting thebackground and reputation of the authors in the field. Toxicity data considered by the EVM As noted elsewhere in this report, the available database for most of the nutrients considered by the EVM is poor, with few recent good quality toxicity studies being available for themajority. This was surprising in view of the wide availability of, and interest in, supplementproducts. The vast majority of studies considered by the EVM were investigative and did notcomply with either GLP or regulatory guidelines. There were a few exceptions to this, such asthe studies produced by the US National Toxicology Program on selenium compounds. As the EVM considered the complete database for each vitamin and mineral, many older studies were reviewed. Though these may have been conducted in accordance with thestandards prevailing at the time, they would not meet modern standards. Such datanonetheless have been considered on their merits. Exposure data Assessing food consumption and nutrient intake in the UK There are currently two major survey programmes in the UK that collect data on food consumption and nutrient intake: National Food Survey23which provides information about household food purchases National Diet and Nutrition Surveys which provides detailed information on the diets of individuals In addition there is the Total Diet Study in which foods representative of the national diet are purchased on a continuous basis some of which are analysed for a range of food constituentsincluding nutrients. The National Food Survey Household surveys use information on household food purchases to provide useful data on population trends in food expenditure, consumption and nutrient intakes. The National FoodSurvey (NFS) is a continuous survey of UK households over the last 50 years which continuestoday. The information obtained during the survey, which is published on an annual andquarterly basis, provides population average data on long term trends in food consumptionand nutrient intakes per person. Results can also be broken down by various householdcharacteristics such as region, income group and household composition. However, as the NFSis a household survey, it gives no information about age/gender sub-groups nor about thedistribution of food consumption or nutrient intakes in the population. 23The National Food Survey was replaced with the Expenditure and Food Survey from April 2001. 330The National Diet and Nutrition Survey The National Diet and Nutrition Survey programme (NDNS) provides cross-sectional information on the dietary habits and nutritional status of nationally representative samples ofspecific population age groups: children aged 1 12-412years; young people aged 4-18 years; adults aged 19-64 years; adults aged 65 years and over have been published. The most recentNDNS of adults aged 19-64 years was carried out in 2000/2001. Publication of the first reportof the findings is expected in Autumn 2002 with further reports to be published in 2003. Eachsurvey collects detailed, quantitative information on food consumption and nutrient intakeusing a weighed dietary record, kept by the participant for four or seven days. Information onnutritional status is collected via a blood sample and physical measurements and a detailedinterview provides information on socio-economic, demographic and lifestyle characteristics.Data from the NDNS provides detailed and robust food consumption data for individuals anddata on diet, nutritional status and related characteristics in the same individuals to allowanalysis of the links between them. The Total Diet Study The Total Diet Study (TDS) is a continuous study in which foods representing the average UK diet (based on the National Food Survey) are purchased, prepared and combined into 20groups of similar foods for analysis. The TDS is widely used to estimate exposure to non-nutrients such as contaminants as well as some nutrients. It can be a useful, relativelyinexpensive method for estimating average population intakes of some nutrients where foodcomposition data are lacking. The TDS can also provide information on trends. The maindrawback of the TDS is that it only provides information at population level and notfor individuals. Commonly Used Methods of Dietary Assessment of Individuals Duplicate meal analysis and metabolic balance studies Duplicate meal analysis is a part of metabolic balance studies and allows an accurate assessment of dietary intake with laboratory analysis of the nutrient content of the diet. Anexact copy of the meal offered to the subject is prepared and analysed as are the leftoversfrom the subject's meal. Actual intake is thus derived. The metabolic balance study included,in addition, analysis of all output (urine, faeces and, in some cases, sweat and other bodyfluids). Such studies are time consuming, labour intensive, expensive and involve smallnumbers of subjects usually studied over periods of weeks. Metabolic balance studies allowcalculation of intake, output and retention of nutrients and have been used to estimate bodyrequirements. Weighed record The subject weighs and keeps a diary record of each food item immediately before consumption and all plate waste at the end of each meal, usually for 4-7 days. Thismethodology is time-consuming and demanding of the subjects and so is prone to under-reporting. However, weighed intake records are considered one of the most accurate methodsof assessing current food intake.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 331Annexes Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) The Food Frequency Questionnaire is a questionnaire in which the respondent is presented with a list of foods and is required to record how often each food is eaten in broad termssuch as x times per day/per week/per month etc. The foods listed are usually chosen for thespecific purposes of the study so that the FFQ may not assess the total diet. Assessment ofthe quantities of each food consumed on each eating occasion/ day may also be included.The advantages of this method are that it is quick and easy to complete; it may be the onlysuitable method for large scale epidemiology studies. The main disadvantage is that it canonly provide imprecise estimates of usual food consumption or nutrient intake for bothindividuals and groups. Because of the imprecision of this method it is better used withgroups. However, the FFQ can be used as a cross-check for other methods for individualintakes to ensure that consumption of certain foods is not overlooked. Diet histories Diet histories provide a retrospective estimate of 'usual' consumption. The respondent is questioned about 'typical' or 'usual' food intake by a trained interviewer with the aim ofconstructing a typical seven day eating pattern. The diet history may be preceded by a 24-hour recall, and/ or supplemented with a checklist of foods usually consumed. This method isfairly quick to carry out and involves little work for the subject. The disadvantages are that it isinaccurate, especially regarding quantities consumed, and relies on the memory of the subject. 24-hour recall The respondent is asked, through a systematic repetition of open-ended questions, to recall and describe the types and quantity of all food and drink consumed in the 24 hours prior tothe interview. For assessment of individual diets, multiple 24-hour recall may be neededdepending on the level of precision required. The main advantage of this method is that it isrelatively quick to carry out and involves little work for the respondent. The disadvantagesrelate to inaccuracy in the number of foods recalled, the quantities, and an inability toestimate the habitual diet of individuals. Estimated record Estimated records require a diary recording all food and drink consumed but foods are not weighed. Instead, amounts of foods and drinks consumed are estimated, usually with portionsdescribed in household measures, with or without the aid of photographs or models. Thismethod is easier to complete than a weighed record so there is less risk of under-reporting orchanging food consumption. The disadvantages are that descriptions of quantities tend to beinaccurate and that processing such descriptive data is very time-consuming. 332Data interpretation All methods of estimating the amounts of food consumed are associated with some degree of error, some sources of which are discussed above. For example: the dietary recording period may not be long enough to provide information about foods that are consumed only occasionally. subjects may mis-report foods consumed or change their habitual diet during the recording period. For these reasons, caution is needed in the interpretation of dietary survey data.Survey data considered by the EVM The EVM has considered data from a range of nutritional surveys. The quality of the nutritional surveys has been generally good, though for some of the less common minerals,the data have been sparse. However, even the data from some of the most detailed surveys(such as the NDNS adult survey) may no longer be completely up to date because of thesignificant changes in eating habits and the increase in supplement use which has taken placein the years since the survey was conducted. Other nutritional studies assessed by the EVMhave been of variable quality.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 333Annexes Annex 3.

Current Usage of Vitamin and Mineral Supplements in the UK24 Introduction The data that follow have been provided by the manufacturers of vitamin and mineral supplements (VMS) sold as food supplements under food law in the UK. It does not includevitamin and mineral supplements sold as medicines, either on prescription or 'over thecounter' (OTC). The associations which have provided the data are: Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) Health Food Manufacturers' Association (HFMA) Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB) All the products and sales reported here have been manufactured in the UK under the industry's self-regulatory code of 'Good Manufacturing Practice' (GMP). The data provided are the best that the associations can provide and have been assembled from information provided by individual member companies. The data do not includeproducts that are imported into the country by non-members. Inevitably there could be someproducts not represented by the summary tables that follow. Nevertheless, it is reasonable toconclude that the data which follow provide a reliable guide to the content and nature of thefood supplement industry in the UK. The information is organised into sections as follows:Size and structure of the UK market; Individual products - declared levels and sales in 1998 and 1999; Products formulated for children; Manufacturing practice; Chemical forms of nutrients used in product manufacture; Appendix: Dietary Reference Values and Recommended Daily Allowances. Size and structure of the UK market A Mintel Study of 1999 (courtesy of a VMS manufacturer) reported that the retail sales values of VMS in 1998 and 1999 were \u00a3347 million and \u00a3326 million respectively. A 'Taylor Nelson Superpanel' report, prepared for the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), summarised the sources of VMS, their use in the animal feed and food industries, and theroutes of sale of supplements in the UK. The market values quoted are from ex-factory stockand will, in some cases exclude the costs of packing and labelling.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 24This annex is based on a paper presented to the EVM in 2000. It has not been subsequently updated. 335Annexes In 1998 comparable amounts of VMS were sold from pharmacies/ drug stores and from grocery/health stores. Individual products - declared levels and sales: 1998 & 1999 These are summarised in Tables 1, 2 and 3 from an amalgamation of the information provided by the associations. It is reasonable to conclude that data quoted are representative of at least70% of the UK market for vitamin and mineral supplements (VMS) sold under food law. Thevalues quoted have been calculated from these data to provide an average annual estimate ofsales of VMS. The sales volumes for micronutrients sold individually can be totalled. The corresponding data for micronutrients sold in combination cannot be totalled because of the many permutationsof blends of the same micronutrients that comprise combination products, which could resultin duplication of data within the final figures. The lowest and highest declared levels quoted cannot be used to predict the limits from sales from other sources and it is possible that, from time to time, products will be marketed withhigher declared levels than those quoted here by the minority of companies that are notmembers of the associations and hence are not subject to their self regulatory standards ofGood Manufacturing Practice . The data does not include products sold by e-commerce but may include some sold by mail order. Whilst both sectors are expected to grow, currently both are small relative toconventional sales through retail outlets. Median data are not available and for this reason the products have been listed with their lowest and highest unit declared levels together with total sales for all declared levels inmillions units (1 unit is one tablet or capsule). For information, tables 1-3 include the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) for adult males aged 19- 50 years and the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) 25. However, for some nutrients COMA could not set an RNI as there were insufficient reliable data on human requirements to do so.In some instances they set a Safe Intake 26. Additionally, RDAs are only set for some vitamins and minerals. Where no RNI or RDA appears in the table, no such figure exists. 25Dietary Reference Values are not a single figure and they change with age and gender and between EU Member States. This level o f detail is inappropriate for food labelling, as it is impractical to provide more than a single reference number for intake. An earlier co nvention was to use the highest number from the range as the 'labelling RDA'. More recently the adult male value has been favoured. Within the EU t he numbers to be used for 'nutritional labelling' are defined in a Council Directive of 1990 (10). These are the numbers that appear under the h eading 'RDA' on the labels of nutritional supplements, as well as on all other pre-packaged foods, and are used in Tables 1 & 3. An EU labelling RD A is not available for all nutrients. For infants and young children Labelling Reference Values (LRV) have been set for foods intended for infants and young children in Schedule 5 of the The Processed Cereal-based Foods and Baby Foods for Infants and Y oung Children 1997. The Labelling Reference Values are based on Population Reference Intakes for infants and children aged 6 months to 3 years. 26A level or range of intake at which there is no risk of deficiency, and below a level where there is a risk of undesirable effe cts. 336Table 1.

Zinc at 50 mg is sold for short term use, usually from outlets with trained staff.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 337Annexes Products formulated for children The declared levels of the formulations for children are given in Tables 4, 5 and 6. Their source is dominantly from two large companies but, although there may be other products on themarket, especially from imports, it is the most representative summary that is currentlyavailable. There are few, if any, single product brands and no data are available on the sales volumes of the multi-brands. Their volume, in relation to the total market, is small and is of the order of12% of the sales of multi-brands for adults. The RNIs used in Tables 4-6 are those for infants and children aged 7 months to 10 years. There are no labelling RDAs for children. Labelling Reference Values for infants and youngchildren have been set and are laid down in Schedule 5 of The Processed Cereal-based Foodsand Baby Foods for Infants and Y oung Children Regulations 1997. The Labelling ReferenceValues are based on Population Reference Intakes for children aged between 6 months and 3years. Where no RNI or LRV appears in the table no such figure exists. Table 3.

The manufacturing processes for food supplements of tableting or encapsulating can, in some instances, result in the destruction of some of the active components of the product. Wherethis is likely it is customary to over-formulate so that the product at the point of sale fulfilsthe claim for content that is displayed on the label.

Acute : Short term, in relation to exposure or effect. Acute toxicity : Effects that occur over a short period of time (up to 14 days) immediately following exposure. Adenoma : A benign growth (neoplasm) arising from a gland-forming surface tissue ( internal or external) tissue such as colon, stomach or respiratory tract. ADI: see Acceptable Daily Intake Adverse effect : Change in structure, function, biochemistry, growth, development or lifespan of an organism which results in impairment of capacity to function, or impairment of capacityto compensate for additional stress, or increase in susceptibility to the harmful effects ofother environmental influences. Allergy: The adverse health effects that may result from the stimulation of a specific immune response. Allergic reaction: an adverse reaction elicited by exposure to a previously sensitised individual to the relevant substance or item causing the reaction (antigen). Ames test : In vitro (qv) assay for bacterial gene mutations (qv) using strains of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium developed by Ames and his colleagues. Bias: In the context of epidemiological studies, bias is a systematic tendency to underestimate or overestimate the parameter of interest because of a deficiency in the design or executionof a study. It includes: selection bias in which subjects studied are not representative of thetarget population about which conclusions are to be drawn; information bias such as errors inmeasuring disease or exposure. Bioavailability : A term referring to the proportion of a substance which reaches the systemic circulation unchanged after a particular route of administration. Body burden : Total amount of a chemical present in an organism at a given time. Cancer : Synonym for a malignant neoplasm - that is, a tumour (qv) that grows progressively, invades local tissues and spreads to distant sites (see also tumour and metastasis).Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 351Annexes Carcinogenesis : The origin, causation and development of tumours (qv). The term applies to benign as well as malignant growths (neoplasms) and not just to carcinomas (qv). Carcinogenicity study : Tests carried out in laboratory animals, usually rats and mice, to determine whether a substance causes cancer. The test material is given throughout life togroups of animals at different dose levels. Carcinogens : The causal agents which induce tumours. They include external factors (chemicals, physical agents, viruses) and internal factors such as hormones. Chemicalcarcinogens are structurally diverse and include naturally-occurring substances as well assynthetic compounds. An important distinction can be drawn between genotoxic (qv) carcinogens which have been shown to react with and mutate DNA, and non-genotoxic carcinogens which act through other mechanisms. The activity of genotoxic carcinogens canoften be predicted from their chemical structure - either of the parent compound or ofactive metabolites (qv). Most chemical carcinogens exert their effects after prolongedexposure, show a dose-response relationship and tend to act on a limited range of susceptibletarget tissues. Carcinogens are sometimes species- or sex-specific and the term should bequalified by the appropriate descriptive adjectives to aid clarity. Several different chemical andother carcinogens may interact, and constitutional factors (genetic susceptibility, hormonalstatus) may also contribute, emphasising the multifactorial nature of the carcinogenic process. Carcinoma : Malignant tumour arising from epithelial cells lining, for example, the alimentary, respiratory and urogenital tracts and from epidermis, also from solid viscera such as the liver,pancreas, kidneys and some endocrine glands. (See also 'tumour'). Case-control study : (Synonyms - case comparison study, case referent study, retrospective study) A study which starts with the identification of a group of people with the disease ofinterest (the cases) and a suitable group of persons without the disease (the controls). Acomparison is made of the proportion of cases that have been exposed to a particular hazard(e.g. a carcinogen) with the proportion of controls that have been exposed to the hazard. Cell transformation : The process by which a normal cell acquires the capacity for neoplastic growth. Complete transformation occurs in several stages both in vitro and in vivo . One step which has been identified in vitro is 'immortalisation' by which a cell acquires the ability to divide indefinitely in culture. Such cells do not have the capacity to form tumours in animals,but can be induced to do so by extended passage in vitro , by treatment with chemicals, or by transfection with oncogene DNA. The transformed phenotype so generated is usually, but notalways, associated with the ability of the cells to grow in soft agar and to form tumours whentransplanted into animals. It should be noted that each of these stages of transformation caninvolve multiple events which may or may not be genetic. The order in which these eventstake place, if they occur at all, in vivo is not known. Chromosome aberrations : Collective term of particular types of chromosome damage induced after exposure to exogenous chemical or physical agents which damage the DNA. 352Chromosome : In simple prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria and most viruses, the chromosome consists of a single circular molecule of DNA containing the entire geneticmaterial of the cell. In eukaryotic cells, the chromosomes are thread-like structures,composed mainly of DNA and protein, which are present within the nuclei of every cell. Theyoccur in pairs, the numbers varying from one to more than 100 per nucleus in differentspecies. Normal somatic cells in humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, each consisting oflinear sequences of DNA which are known as genes (qv). Chronic effect : Consequence which develops slowly and has a long-lasting course (often but not always irreversible). Chronic exposure : Continued exposures occurring over an extended period of time, or a significant fraction of the life-time of a human or animal. Clearance : Volume of blood or plasma, or mass of an organ, effectively cleared of a substance by elimination (metabolism and excretion) in a given time interval. Total clearance is the sumor the clearances for each eliminating organ or tissue. Cohort : A defined population that continues to exist through time. Cohort study : (Synonyms - follow-up, longitudinal study) The study of a group of people defined at a particular point in time (the cohort), who have particular characteristics incommon, such as a particular exposure. They are then observed over a period of time for theoccurrence of disease. The rate at which the disease develops in the cohort is compared withthe rate in a comparison population, in which the characteristics (e.g. exposure) are absent. Complementary DNA (cDNA) : cDNA is DNA that is synthesised in the laboratory from mRNA by reverse transcription. A cDNA is so-called because its sequence is the complement of theoriginal mRNA sequence. Confounding factor : (synonyms - confounding variable, confounder) An extraneous variable that satisfies BOTH of 2 conditions: (1) it is a risk factor for the disease under study (2) it isassociated with the study exposure but is not a consequence of exposure. For examplecigarette smoking is a confounding variable with respect to an association between alcoholconsumption and heart disease. Failure to adjust for a confounding variable results indistortion of the apparent magnitude of the effect of the exposure under study. (In theexample, smoking is a risk factor for heart disease and is associated with alcohol consumptionbut is not a consequence of alcohol consumption.) Congeners : Related compounds varying in chemical structure but with similar biological properties. Covalent binding : Chemical bonding formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms. Molecules are combinations of atoms bound together by covalent bonds.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 353Annexes Cytochrome P450 (CYP) : An extensive family of haem-containing proteins involved in enzymic oxidation of a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic (qv) substances and their conversionto forms that may be more easily excreted. In some cases the metabolites produced may bereactive and may have increased toxicity. In other cases the substances may be naturalprecursors of hormones (e.g. steroids). DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) : The carrier of genetic information for all living organisms except the group of RNA viruses. Each of the 46 chromosomes in normal human cells consistsof 2 strands of DNA containing up to 100,000 nucleotides, specific sequences of which makeup genes (qv). DNA itself is composed of two interwound chains of linked nucleotides (qv). Dose : Total amount of a substance administered to, taken or absorbed by an organism. Endocrine modulator : Pertaining to hormones or to the glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood stream. Epidemiology : Study of the distribution and the aetiology of disease in humans. Epithelium : The tissue covering the outer surface of the body, the mucous membranes and cavities of the body. Erythema : Reddening of the skin due to congestion of blood or increased blood flow in the skin. Estrogen : (See oestrogen) Exogenous : Arising outside the body. Foetotoxic : Causing toxic, potentially lethal effects to the developing fetus. Forestomach : The stomach in rodents consists of two separate regions - the forestomach and the glandular stomach. Only the glandular stomach is directly comparable to the humanstomach. Gavage : Administration of a liquid via a stomach tube, commonly used as a dosing method in toxicity studies. Gene : The functional unit of inheritance: a specific sequence of nucleotides along the DNA molecule, forming part of a chromosome (qv). Gene expression : The process by which the information in a gene is used to create proteins or polypeptides. Genetic predisposition : Susceptibility to a disease which is related to a polymorphism, which may or may not result in actual development of the disease. Genotoxic : The ability of a substance to cause DNA damage, either directly or after metabolic activation (see also carcinogens). 354Genotype : The particular genetic pattern seen in the DNA of an individual. 'Genotype' is usually used to refer to the particular pair of alleles that an individual possesses at a certainlocation in the genome. Compare this with phenotype. Half-life : Time, in which the concentration of a substance will be reduced by half, assuming a first order elimination process. Hazard : Set of inherent properties of a substance, mixture of substances or a process involving substances that make it capable of causing adverse effects to organisms or the environment. Hepatic : Pertaining to the liver. Hepatocyte : The principal cell type in the liver, possessing many metabolising enzymes (see 'metabolic activation'). Hepatotoxic : Causing toxicity to the liver. Hyperplasia : An increase in the size of an organ or tissue due to an increase in the number of cells. Hypertrophy : An increase in the size of an organ or tissue due to an increase in the volume of individual cells within it. In vitro :A Latin term used to describe effects in biological material outside the living animal (literally 'in glass\"). In vivo :A Latin term used to describe effects in living animals (literally 'in life\"). Incidence: Number of new cases of illness occurring during a given period in a specific population. Intraperitoneal : Within the abdominal cavity. Isomer : Isomers are two or more chemical compounds with the same molecular formula but having different properties owing to a different arrangement of atoms within the molecule.The \u00df-isomer of alitame is formed when the compound degrades and the atoms within themolecule are rearranged. LD50 : The dose of a toxic compound that causes death in 50% of a group of experimental animals to which it is administered. It can be used to assess the acute toxicity of a compound,but is being superseded by more refined methods. Leukaemia : A group of neoplastic disorders (see tumour) affecting blood-forming elements in the bone marrow, characterised by uncontrolled proliferation and disordered differentiation ormaturation. Examples include the lymphocytic leukaemias which develop from lymphoid cellsand the myeloid leukaemias which are derived from myeloid cells (producing red blood cells,mainly in bone marrow).Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 355Annexes Ligand : A molecule which binds to a receptor. Lipids : Fats, substances containing a fatty acid and soluble in alcohols or ether, but insoluble in water. Lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) : The lowest administered dose at which an adverse (qv) effect has been observed. Lymphocyte : A type of white blood cell that plays central roles in adaptive immune responses. Lymphoma : Malignant tumours arising from lymphoid tissues. They are usually multifocal, involving lymph nodes, spleen, thymus and sometimes bone marrow, and other sites outsidethe anatomically defined lymphoid system. (See also 'tumour'). Malignancy : See 'tumour'. Metabolism : Chemical modification of a compound by enzymes within the body, for example by reactions such as hydroxylation (see cytochrome P450), epoxidation or conjugation.Metabolism may result in activation, inactivation, accumulation or excretion of the compound. Metabolite : Product formed by metabolism of a compound. Metaphase : Stage of cell division (mitosis and meiosis) during which the chromosomes are arranged on the equator of the nuclear spindle (the collection of microtubule filaments whichare responsible for the movement of chromosomes during cell division). As the chromosomesare most easily examined in metaphase, cells are arrested at this stage for microscopicexamination for chromosomal aberrations (qv) - known as metaphase analysis. Metastasis : The process whereby malignant cells become detached from the primary tumour mass, disseminate (mainly in the blood stream or in lymph vessels) and 'seed out' in distantsites where they form secondary or metastatic tumours. Such tumours tend to develop atspecific sites and their anatomical distribution is often characteristic; it is non-random. Mouse lymphoma assay : An in vitro assay for gene mutation in mammalian cells using a mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y, which is heterozygous for the gene (carries only onefunctional gene rather than a pair) for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK +/-). Mutation of that single gene is measured by resistance to toxic trifluorothymidine. Mutant cells produce twoforms of colony - large, which represent mutations within the gene and small, whichrepresent large genetic changes in the chromosome such as chromosome aberrations. Thusthis assay can provide additional information about the type of mutation which has occurredif colony size is scored. Mucosal : Regarding the mucosa or mucous membranes, consisting of epithelium (qv) containing glands secreting mucus, with underlying layers of connective tissue and muscle. 356Mutation : A permanent change in the amount or structure of the genetic material in an organism or cell, which can result in a change in phenotypic characteristics. The alteration mayinvolve a single gene, a block of genes, or a whole chromosome. Mutations involving singlegenes may be a consequence of effects on single DNA bases (point mutations) or of largechanges, including deletions, within the gene. Changes involving whole chromosomes may benumerical or structural. A mutation in the germ cells of sexually reproducing organisms maybe transmitted to the offspring, whereas a mutation that occurs in somatic cells may betransferred only to descendent daughter cells. Neoplasm : See 'tumour'. Nephrotoxicity: Toxicity to the kidney. Neurotoxicity : Toxicity to the nervous system. No observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) : The highest administered dose at which no adverse (qv) effect has been observed. Non-genotoxic : See 'carcinogens'. Nucleic acid : One of the family of molecules which includes the DNA and RNA molecules. Nucleic acids were so named because they were originally discovered within the nucleus ofcells, but they have since been found to exist outside the nucleus as well. Nucleotide : the 'building block' of nucleic acids, such as the DNA molecule. A nucleotide consists of one of four bases - adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine - attached to aphosphate-sugar group. In DNA the sugar group is deoxyribose, while in RNA (a DNA-relatedmolecule which helps to translate genetic information into proteins), the sugar group is ribose,and the base uracil substitutes for thymine. Each group of three nucleotides in a gene isknown as a codon. A nucleic acid is a long chain of nucleotides joined together, and thereforeis sometimes referred to as a 'polynucleotide.\" Odds ratio (OR) : The odds of disease in an exposed group divided by the odds of disease in an unexposed group. Oedema : Excessive accumulation of fluid in body tissues. Oestrogen : Sex hormone or other substance capable of developing and maintaining female characteristics of the body. Parenteral nutrition : The administration of nutrients to patients who cannot maintain adequate nutrition themselves by a route other than the alimentary canal, e.g. intravenously. Polymer : A very large molecule comprising a chain of many similar or identical molecular sub units (monomers) joined together (polymerised). An example is the polymer glycogen, formedfrom linked molecules of the monomer glucose.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 357Annexes Protoporphyrin : The most common of a rare group of disorders due to inborn errors of metabolism in which there are deficiencies in the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis ofhaem. Receptor : A small, discrete protein in the cell membrane or within the cell with which specific molecules interact to initiate a change in the working of a cell. Reference nutrient intake (RNI): An amount of the nutrient that is enough, or more than enough, for most (usually at least 97%) of people in a group. If the average intake of a group isat the RNI, then the risk of deficiency in the group is very small. Relative risk : A measure of the association between exposure and outcome. The rate of disease in the exposed population divided by the rate of disease among the unexposedpopulation in a cohort study or a population-based case control study. A relative risk of 2means that the exposed group has twice the disease risk compared to the unexposed group. Renal : Relating to the kidney. Risk: Possibility that a harmful event (death, injury or loss) arising from exposure to a chemical or physical agent may occur under specific conditions. RNA (ribonucleic acid): a molecule similar to DNA (qv), which helps in the process of decoding the genetic information carried by DNA. Safety : Practical certainty that injury will not result from a hazard under defined conditions. SCF: The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food (formerly the Scientific Committee for Food). Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) : Exchange of genetic material between two sub-units of a replicated chromosome. Systematic review : A review that has been prepared using a documented systematic approach to minimising biases and random errors. TDI: See 'Tolerable Daily Intake'. Teratogen : A substance which, when administered to a pregnant woman or animal, can cause congenital malformations (structural defects) in the baby or offspring. Teratogenicity : Potential to cause structural malformations or defects in the offspring. Threshold: Dose or exposure concentration below which an effect is not expected. Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) : An estimate of the amount of contaminant, expressed on a body weight basis (e.g. mg/kg bodyweight), that can be ingested daily over a lifetime withoutappreciable health risk. 358Toxicodynamics: The process of interaction of chemical substances with target sites and the subsequent reactions leading to adverse effects. Toxicokinetics : The description of the fate of chemicals in the body, including a mathematical account of their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. (see pharmacokinetics) Tumour (Synonym - neoplasm): A mass of abnormal, disorganised cells, arising from pre- existing tissue, which are characterised by excessive and uncoordinated proliferation and byabnormal differentiation. Benign tumours show a close morphological resemblance to their tissue of origin; grow in a slow expansile fashion; and form circumscribed and (usually)encapsulated masses. They may stop growing and they may regress. Benign tumours do notinfiltrate through local tissues and they do not metastasise (qv). They are rarely fatal.Malignant tumours (synonym - cancer) resemble their parent tissues less closely and are composed of increasingly abnormal cells in terms of their form and function. Welldifferentiated examples still retain recognisable features of their tissue of origin but thesecharacteristics are progressively lost in moderately and poorly differentiated malignancies:undifferentiated or anaplastic tumours are composed of cells which resemble no knownnormal tissue. Most malignant tumours grow rapidly, spread progressively through adjacenttissues and metastasise to distant sites. Tumours are conventionally classified according to theanatomical site of the primary tumour and its microscopical appearance, rather than by cause.Some common examples of nomenclature are as follows: Tumours arising from epithelia Tumours arising from connective tissues such cartilage or bone: benign tissues are and are called lymphomas (qv); they are often multifocal. Malignant proliferations of bone marrow cells are called leukaemias. Benign tumours may evolve to the corresponding malignant tumours; examples involve the adenoma carcinoma sequence in the large bowel in humans, and the papilloma carcinoma sequence in mouse skin. Tumour promotion: An increasingly confusing term, originally used, like 'tumour initiation' to describe events in multistage carcinogenesis in experimental animals. In that context,promotion is regarded as the protracted process whereby initiated cells undergo clonalexpansion to form overt tumours. The mechanisms of clonal expansion are diverse, butinclude direct stimulation of cell proliferation, repeated cycles of cell damage and cellregeneration and release of cells from normal growth-controlling mechanisms. Initiating andpromoting agents were originally regarded as separate categories, but the distinction betweenthem is becoming increasingly hard to sustain. The various modes of promotion are non-genotoxic, but it is incorrect to conclude that 'non-genotoxic carcinogen' (qv) and 'promoter'are synonymous.Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003 359Annexes Uncertainty factor: Value used in extrapolation from experimental animals to man (assuming that man may be more sensitive) or from selected individuals to the general population: forexample, a value applied to the NOAEL to derive an ADI or TDI. The value depends on thesize and type of population to be protected and the quality of the toxicological informationavailable. Xenobiotic : A chemical foreign to the biological system. 360\u00a9 Crown copyright Published by Food Standards Agency "}
