Dr. Charlotte specializes in the following services: Dr. Charlotte is a 2009 graduate from the University of Missouri-Columbia with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Psychology. When you first meet, you will quickly learn how and why she incorporates the importance of mental health into every aspect of what she does. As an avid athlete and performer, she spent many years breaking down and building up her body through gymnastics, running, weight lifting, yoga, and drum corps training. After encountering an injury while training for a half marathon, Dr. Charlotte sought chiropractic care for pain relief but soon realized alternative healthcare provided her with a leading edge in overall physical performance, which then sparked her interest in pursuing a career as a chiropractic physician. In addition to improved physical performance, she discovered her passion and reason why she chose chiropractic as her profession when she experienced the healing benefits of a truly balanced system first hand. After suffering for many years with an autoimmune condition known as Graves' Disease, she noticed her body was expressing less symptoms simply by adding chiropractic adjustments into her health routine. Throughout her own healing journey, she learned how to access the deeper knowledge and intelligence hidden within her own body which sparked a passion for sharing her experiences with others who need it. She received her Doctorate of Chiropractic degree from Logan University in 2017, graduating at the top of her class with Summa Cum Laude honors. As a graduate student, Dr. Charlotte helped tutor fellow students in the areas of biology, biochemistry, physiology, and clinical reasoning. She spent additional hours attending various seminars related to nutrition, functional medicine, acupuncture, applied kinesiology, pregnancy and pediatric care, and the diagnosis of complex health conditions. She was also the co-founder and developer of Logan University's Women's Leadership Council, which is an organization that provides encouragement, positive motivation, and the opportunity to build business skills that empower students to become future leaders in their home communities. Passionate about bridging the mind-body-spirit connection, Dr. Charlotte Meier combines her knowledge of several ancient healing modalities into her holistic practice, thus enabling her to guide and encourage individuals to actively care for all aspects of their inner being. She creates a safe space for those ready to embark on their spiritual quest by helping individuals reconnect to their innate intelligence and wisdom within. As a Dual-Board Certified Chiropractic Physician and Acupuncturists, she embraces energy as the ultimate medicine, alchemising all necessary parts to empower every individual along their journey.
