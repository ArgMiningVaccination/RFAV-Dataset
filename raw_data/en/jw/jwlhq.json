Methods We developed a search strategy, and cond ucted a systematic search of relevant databases in February 2015. One researcher screened all identified references to assess inclusion according to predefined criteria; these assessments were then checked by another researcher. Results We identified 175 potentially relevant referenc es. Of these references, 17 were postential systematic reviews, investigating the effect of rela tionship/marital intervention s. 13 of these investigated the effect of relationship/marital interventions in general, wher eas 4 summarized the effect of rela tionship/marital interven tions among population s with a somatic or menta l disorder (e.g., cancer, depression, substance abuse). We identified 158 primary studies examining the effect of different relationship/marital interv entions. - 129 of thes e references investigated the effect of relationship/marit al interventio ns in general. 81 of thes e appeard to be randomized controlled trials, while 48 appeared to be controlled studies without random group assignment. - 29 primary studies examined the effect av relationship/marital interventions among populations with a somatic or mental disorder (e.g., cancer, depression, substance abuse). 25 of these appeared to be randomized controlled trials, while 4 had a different controlled study design. The findings of our search suggest that there is a need to assess the quality, scope, and relevance of the identified systematic reviews prior to initiating work on a new systematic review. However, the search shows that a range of primary studies exists. These studies might be suitable for inclusion in a systematic review if the identified reviews do not meet the commissioner's knowledge needs.

The negative effects of family instability on children and adults have captured th e attention of legislators and policymakers wondering if something could be done to help at-risk couples form and sustain healthy relationships and marriages. For a decade now, public funds have supported grants to provide couple and relationship education (CRE) to lower income indi- viduals and couples. This meta-analytic study reviewed 38 studies (with 47 inde pendent samples) assessing the effective- ness of CRE for lower income couples (defined as more than two-thirds of the sample below twice the poverty level) in an attempt to inform current policy debates. Overall effect sizes for control-group studies suggest that CRE for diverse, lower income couples has small, positive relationship effects (overall d = .061), especially on self-reports of relationship quality, communication, and aggression. There were somewhat stronger effects for studies with more married couples (d = .091), mostly \"near-poor\" (vs. poor) participants (d = .074), and more (vs. fewer) participants in relationship distress (d = .072). I n comparison to the effect sizes for control-group studies, the effects of one-group/prepost studies were larger (overall d = .352). Practitioners will need to continue to innovate curriculum design and pedagogy, improve other programmatic ele- ments, and find ways to increase participant engagement to achieve greater success with the limited public funds that sup- port CRE.

This systematic review examined the measurement of outcomes in couple therapy research ov er the previous ten years. Eighty-one couple therapy outcome studie s were systematically examined. Relative to previous two reviews that included both couple and family interventions, this review focused solely on couple therapy outcome studies and identified that a greater diversity in outcome measurements have begun to emerge in the field. Additionally, couple therapy outcome studies are beginning to explore the impact of couple interventions in the context of problems traditionally associated with individual pathology and individual treatment. Our review reinforced findings and recommendations from previous reviews, including the need for rigorous research design and explication of couple therapy models of intervention. Additionally, we recommend that qualitative analyses of unexpected findings or outcomes t hat may be interpreted as negative outcomes may assist cou- ple therapy researchers in better understanding these findin gs.

Doherty, 2003) have asserted that premarital educat ion programs have a positive ef- fect on program participants. Using meta-analytic methods of current best practices to look across the entire body of pub- lished and unpublished evaluation research on premarital education, we found a more complex pattern of results. We coded 47 studies and found that premarital education programs do not improve relationship quality/satisfaction when unpublished studies are included in the analysis, although studies that follow couples past the honeymoon stage to detect prevention effects are rare. In contrast, premarital education programs ap pear to be effective at improving couple communication, with studies that employed observational measures rather than se lf-report measures producing la rge effects. Still, given the mixed, modest results, there is ample room and a real need to improve the practice of premarital education. Meta-analyse Blanchard, V. L., et al.

This meta-analysis probes into previous research substantiating the positive effects of marriage and relationship education (MRE) on couples' communication skills. We reviewed 97 MRE research reports that yielded 143 distinct evaluation studies. We found modest evidence that MRE functions both as a universal prevention and as a selective or indicated prevention. That is, MRE demonstrates program effects at longer term follow-ups for well-functioning couples and at postassessment and shorter term follow-ups for more distressed couples. In addition, we found that observational assessments produced larger effects than self-report assessments, although interpreting the meaning of this difference is difficult.

In this meta-analytic study, the authors examined the efficacy of marriage and relationship education (MRE) on 2 common outcomes: relationship quality and communication skills. A t horough search produced 86 codable reports that yielded 117 studies and more than 500 effect sizes. The effect sizes for relationship quality for experimental studies ranged from d = .30 to .36, while the communication skills effect sizes ranged from d = .43 to .45. Quasi-experimental studies generated smaller effect sizes, but these appeared to be due to pretest group differences. Moderate-dosage programs produced larger effect sizes than did low-dosage programs. For communication skills, published studies had larger effects than those of un- published studies at follow-up; there were no publication differences for relationship quality. There was no evidence of a Meta-analyse 16 Resultat Referanse Sammendrag Design gender difference. Unfortunately, a lack of racial/ethnic and economic diversity in the samples prevented reliable conclu- sions about the effectiveness of MRE for disadvantaged couples, a crucial deficit in the body of research. In addition, inter- vention outcomes important to policy makers, such as relationship stability and aggression, rarely have been ad- dressed.Copyright (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved. Skauli, G.

This meta-analysis summarizes results from 30 randomized experiments that compare behavioral marital therapy with no- treatment control with distressed couples. Results showed that behavioral marital therapy is significantly more effective than no treatment (d=.585). Although behavioral marital therapy research studies tend to be conducted under conditions that are less clinically representative than other samples of studies, representativeness was not significantly related to outcome. However, evidence also suggested that publication bias may exist in this literature whereby small sample studies with small effects are systematically missing compared with other studies. This bias may inflate the effects of behavioral marital thera- pies reported in previous meta-analyses, though we also explore a number of alternative explanations for this small sample bias.Copyright 2005 APA.

By converting pre and post-test scores from marital research into the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, it was possible to separate studies and treatment groups by mild, moderate, and severe levels of distress. Results confirm previous research that overall, marital therapy is significantly better than no treatment. Some data suggest however that Behavioral Marital Therapy and its various components are more helpful on mildly distressed groups. Emotionally Focused Therapy had the largest mean effect sizes of any one treatment approach for moderately dis- tressed groups and was significantly better than isolated components of Behavioral Marital Therapy. Little research has been done targeting severely distressed couples and more work needs to be done in this area. Clinical implications of this study are that therapists should focus on delivering a complete treatment model rather than using isolated interventions from different models. Future research on marital therapy needs to define marital distress levels across the field as a whole. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2 012 APA, all rights reserved). Jakubowski, S. F., et al.

Behavioral couple therapy (BCT) is an efficacious treatment for maritally distressed couples. The current article includes a meta-analysis of BCT and waiting-list control groups from BCT outcome investigations. The findings indicate that, on aver- age, distressed couples who are placed on waiting lists make no improvement during the waiting period. These results are consistent across 17 controlled investigatio ns conducted in different countries. Given the consistency of these findings, the current investigators propose that marital therapy outcome inve stigators consider employing these effect-size estimates ra- ther than using scarce resources to place distressed couples in waiting-list control conditions. Such a strategy circumvents the ethical dilemma of withholding efficacious treatment from cl ients and encourages effectiveness studies in real-world con- ditions.

Waring (1996). \"A critical review of marital therapy outcome research.\" Canadian Journal of Psychiatry - Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie 41(7): 421-428. OBJECTIVE: This review critically examines conceptual and methodological issues of outcome research designed to evalu- ate the efficacy of marital therapy (MT). Behavioural marital therapy (BMT), cognitively orientated marital therapy (COMT), emotionally focused marital therapy (EFMT), and insight-oriented marital therapy (IOMT) have provided evidence for effi- cacy. METHOD: The initial literature search involved the use of the MEDLINE and Psychlit CD-ROM data bases. A secondary Systematisk oversikt 18 Resultat Referanse Sammendrag Design literature search based on citations in articles discovered in the initial search was also conducted. Three broad categories involving the delineation of the client sample, study design considerations, and determination of treatment effects were ad- dressed to investigate the quality of evidence concerning the efficacy of MT. RESULTS: None of the 4 approaches has proven superiority in efficacy, and the research does not provide evidence for the superiority of any one approach in distinct types of marital di scord. There is some evidence to indicate that future outcome research should avoid the use of \"waiting list control groups,\" since their use appears to be neither ethical nor humane in marital discord research. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that the concept of treatme nt efficiency may be more clinically relevant to outcome research. A gold standard for \"efficiency\" would suggest that a marital therapy approach should produce subjective and ob- jective improvement in 50% of eligible couples, and this improvement should be maintained in half of these couples at the one-year follow-up assessment. This standard would be comparable to the data on the 4 effective approaches described in this review. [References: 22] Dunn, R. L. and A. I.

This meta-analytic review examines the findings of 15 methodologically rigorous marital therapy outcome studies reported in 19 journal articles. These findings were used to assess the efficacy of three treatment approaches in fostering change in spouses' relationship-related behavior, cognitions, affect, and general assessment of their relationship. Behavioral marital therapy (BMT), cognitive-behavioral marital therapy (CBMT), an d insight-oriented marital therapy (IOMT) were all found to be more effective than no treatment in bringing change in spouses' behavior and in the general assessment of their relation- ship. IOMT was more effective than BMT or CBMT in bringing change in spouses' general relationship assessment, while CBMT was the only approach that induced significant change in spouses' posttherapy relationship-related cognitions. The role of meta-analytic reviews of marital therapy approaches is also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). 3: Li, Q.

Objective With the research focus on fa mily caregiving shifting from the individual to the dyadic level, it is sug- gested that the caregiver-patient dyad as a unit be the focus and direction of caregiving interventions for families coping with cancer. The objectives in conducting this revi ew were to explore the existing interventions for spousal couples coping with cancer in terms of type of intervention, contents, approach, and outcome measurements; and to identify directions for the development of interventions. Methods A systematic search of four databases was conducted to identify articles published in English or Chinese from the launch of the databases to March 2013. Studies were located using an electronic search, a manual search, and an author search. Results A total of 17 articles were identified and included in this review. These interventions focused mainly on patient caregiving and caregiver self care, and usually lasted for 6 weeks using a face-to-face group mode, with follow-up at around 3 months. The outcome measures can be grouped into three main dimensions: dyadic appraisal, dyadic coping, and dyadic adjustments. Positive outcomes were reported for these interventions, including improvements in commu- nication, dyadic coping, the quality of life of both the patients and their partners, psychosocial distress, sexual functioning, and marital satisfaction. Conclusions These findings highlighted the positive outcomes of couple- based interventions that focus on couples coping with cancer. Future studies on couple-based interventions should be conducted in different cultures, such as in Asian countries. Collaboration between researchers and clini- cians is crucial to ensure the development of effective and accessible supportive interventions targeting couples coping with cancer.

Data from clinical trials of couple therapy for depression have never been subjected to systematic analyses. We performed a meta-analysis of eight controlled trials involving 567 subjects. No difference was found on depressive symptoms between couple therapy and individual psychotherapy. Relationship distress was significantly reduced in the couple therapy group. Too few data are available for comparisons with drug therapy and no treatment. The findings are weakened by small sample sizes, assessment s at the end of treatment or short follow-up, unclear sample representativeness, heterogeneity among studies. The mediating role of improvement in quality of couple relationships is not supported by data. However, it has no t been adequately tested. Evi dence on efficacy of couple therapy as a treatment for depression is inconclusive. The evidence for improvement in couple relationships may favor the choice of couple therapy when relational distress is a major problem. Meta-ana- lyse Depresjon Powers, M. B., et al.

However, the strength and consis tency of this effect favoring BCT has not been exam- ined because a meta-analysis of BCT studies has not been reported. This meta-analysis combines multiple well controlled studies to help clarify the overall impact of BC T in the treatment of substance use disorders. A compre- hensive literature search produced 12 randomized controlled trials (n = 754) that were included in the final anal- yses. There was a clear overall advantage of including BCT compared to individual-based treatments (Cohen's d = 0.54). This was true across outcome domains (frequency of use d = 0.36, consequences of use d = 0.52, and relationship satisfaction d = 0.57). However the pattern of results varied as a function of time. BCT was superior to control conditions only in relationship satisfaction at posttreatment (d = 0.64). However, at follow-up BCT was su- perior on all three outcome domains (frequency of use d = 0.45, consequences of use d = 0.50, and relationship satisfaction d = 0.51). In addition to other control conditions, BCT also outperformed individual cognitive behav- ioral therapy without couples therapy (d = 0.42). Larger sample sizes were associated with higher effect sizes (p = 0.02). However, treatment dose and publication year were not related to effect size. Overall, BCT shows better outcomes than more typical individual-based treatment for married or cohabiting individuals who seek help for al- cohol dependence or drug dependence problems. The benefi t for BCT with low severity problem drinkers has re- ceived little attention and one study suggests its efficacy may not extend to this subgroup. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004188.pub 2 Background: Marital therapy for depression has the two-fold aim of modifying negative interaction patterns and increasing mutually supportive aspects of couple relationships, thus changing the interpersonal context linked to depression.Objectives: 1. To conduct a meta-analysis of all intervention studies comparing marital therapy to other psychosocial and pharmacological treatments, or to non-active treatments. 2. To conduct an assessment of the internal validity and external validity. 3. To assess the overall effectiveness of marital therapy as a treatment for depression. 4. To identify mediating variables through which marital therapy is effective in depression treat- ment.Search methods: CCDANCTR-Studies was searched on 5-9-2005, Relevant reference lists were checked.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled tria ls examining the effectiveness of marital therapy ver- sus individual psychotherapy, drug therapy or waiting list/no treatment/minimal treatment for depression were in- cluded in the review. Quasi-randomised controlled trials were also included.Data were extracted using a standardised spreadsheet. Where data were not included in published papers, two at- tempts were made to obtain the data from the authors. Data were synthesised using Review Manager software. Dichotomous data were pooled using the relative risk (RR), and continuous data were pooled using the standard- ised mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The random effects model was employed for all comparisons. A formal test for heterogen eity, the natural approximate chi-squared test, was also calculated.Main results: Eight studies were included in the review. No significant difference in effect was found between marital therapy and individual psychotherapy, either for the continuous outcome of depressive symp- toms, based on six studies: SMD -0.12 (95% CI -0.56 to 0.32), or the outcome of proportion of sub- jects remaining at caseness level, based on three studies: RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.32 to 2.22). In comparison with drug therapy, a lower drop-out rate was found for marital therapy: RR 0.31 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.61), but this result was greatly influenced by a single study. The comparison with no/minimal treatment, showed a large significant effect in favour of marital therapy for depressive symptoms, based on two studies: SMD -1.28 (95% CI -1.85 to -0.72) and a smaller significant effect for persistence of depression, based on one study only. The findings were weak- ened by methodological problems affecting most studies, such as the small number of cases available for analysis in almost all comparisons, and the significant heterogenei ty among studies.Authors' conclusions: There is no evi- dence to suggest that marital therapy is more or less effe ctive than individual psychotherapy or drug therapy in the treatment of depression. Improvement of relations in di stressed couples might be expected from marital therapy. Future trials should test whether mari tal therapy is superior to other interv entions for distressed couples with a de- pressed partner, especially considering the role of potential effect moderators in the improvement of depression.

Although earlier studies have demonstrated pr omising effects of relationship education for military couples, these studies have lacked random assignment. The current study evaluated the short-term effects of relationship education for Army cou- ples in a randomized clinical trial at two sites (476 couples at Site 1 and 184 couples at Site 2). At both sites, participant satis- faction with the program was high. Intervention and control couples were compared on relative amounts of preintervention to postintervention change. At Site 1, not all variables showed the predicted intervention effects, although we found significant and positive intervention effects for communication skills, confidence that the marriage can survive over the long haul, posi- tive bonding between the partners, and satisfaction with sacrificing for the marriage or the partner. However, at Site 2, we found significant and positive intervention effects for communication skills only. Possible site differences as moderators of intervention effects are discussed.

While existing literature has begun to explore risk factors which may predict differential response to marriage education, a history of couple infidelity has not been examined to determine whether infidelity moderates the impacts of marriage educa- tion. The current study evaluated self-report marital satisfac tion and communication skills in a sample of 662 married Army couples randomly assigned to marriage education (i.e., PREP) or a no-treatment control group and assessed prior to inter- vention, post intervention, and at 1 year after intervention. Of these, 23.4% couples reported a history of infidelity in their mar- riage. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that having a hist ory of infidelity significantly mo derated the impact of PREP fo r marital satisfaction, with a trend for a similar effect on communication skills. However, couples with a history of infidelity as- signed to PREP did not reach the same levels of marital satisfaction after intervention seen in the group of couples without infidelity assigned to PREP, although they did show comparable scores on communication skills after intervention.

Despite the overall efficacy of psychotherapy, dropouts are substantial, many clients do not benefit, therapists vary in effec- tiveness, and there may be a crisis of confidence among consumers. A research paradigm called patient-focused research--a method of enhancing outcome via continuous progress feedback--holds promise to address these problems. Although feed- back has been demonstrated to improve individual psychotherapy outcomes, no studies have examined couple therapy. The current study investigated the effects of providing treatment pr ogress and alliance information to both clients and therapists during couple therapy. Outpatients (N = 410) at a community family counseling clinic were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: treatment as usual (TAU) or feedback. Couples in t he feedback condition demonstrated significantly greater improve- ment than those in the TAU condition at posttreatment, achieved nearly 4 times the rate of clinically significant change, and maintained a significant advantage on the primary measure at 6- month follow-up while attaining a significantly lower rate of separation or divorce.

However, comparisons among active treatment conditions showed few significant differences among treatments; the treatments were equally effective in increasing marital adjustment. Thus, the addition of CR and EET did not appear to increase the overall effectiveness of treatment. Possible reasons for the current findings are provided, and suggestions for future marital outcome investigations are outlined. RCT Baucom, K. J., et al.

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 79, 565-576 DOI: 10.1037/a0025121 OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in observed communication after therapy termination in distressed couples from a ran- domized clinical trial. METHOD: A total of 134 distressed couples were randomly assigned to either traditional behavioral couple therapy (TBCT; Jacobson & Margolin, 1979) or integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT; Jacobson & Christensen, 1998). Videotaped samples of each couple's interactions were coded from pre-therapy, post-therapy, and 2-year follow-up assessments. At these 3 time points, each partner chose 1 curre nt relationship problem to discuss. Relationship satisfaction was assessed at 2-year follow-up, and clinically significant tr eatment response and marital status were assessed 5 years af- ter treatment. RESULTS: Observed negativity and withdrawal decreased from therapy termination through the 2-year follow- up as expected, but problem solving did not change, and observed positivity decreased. IBCT produced superior changes from post-therapy to the 2-year follow-up assessment compared with TBCT. Post-therapy levels and changes in communica- tion over follow-up were associated with wife satisfaction at 2-ye ar follow-up; only post-therapy to 2-year follow-up changes i n communication were associated with husband satisfaction at 2-year follow-up. Post-therapy levels of problem solving and changes in wives' positivity from pre-therapy to post-therapy were associated with 5-year relationship outcomes. We found some counterintuitive results with positivity, but they were no longer significant after controlling for withdrawal. CONCLU- SIONS: We found support for improvements in observed communication following treatment termination, with IBCT demon- strating greater maintenance of communication improvement over follow-up. We found limited evidence of associations be- tween communication and relationship outcomes at 5-year follow-up. RCT Baucom, K. J., et al.

Observers rated discussions of relationship problems at 3 time points (pre-therapy, post-therapy, 2-year follow-up) and relationship outcomes (i.e., treatment response and relationship stability) were measured at a 5-year follow-up. Consistent with previous examinations of individual partner co mmunication (K.J.W. Baucom et al., 2011; Sevier et al., 2008), TBCT produced greater improvements from pre-therapy to post- therapy (d = 0.27-0.43) and superior communication at post- therapy (d = 0.30-0.37). However, IBCT produced greater improvements from post-therapy to 2-year follow-up (d = 0.32- 0.39). Both levels of, and changes in, dyadic communication were associated with relationship outcomes, even when control- ling for individual communication. Our findings lend additional support for theoretical and practical differences between these two therapies and the utility of assessment at the level of the couple. Furthermore, they contribute to a broader pattern of findings in which relationship outcomes are more consistently linked with constructive communication than with destructive communication.

Emotion-focused therapy (EFT; Greenberg & Johnson, [Greenberg, L., 1988] Emotionally focused therapy for couples. New York: Guilford Press) is anchored in attachment theory (Joh nson, 2003 Attachment processes in couples and families. New York: Guilford) and considers change in attachment schemas essential in the process of improving satisfaction in relation- ships (Johnson, 1999, Research and couples therapy: Where do we go from here? American Family Therapy Academy Newsletter). However, there are little data on how measures of attachment change over the course of EFT or any other cou- ple therapy. The current study examines whether increases in attachment security predict improvements in marital satisfac- tion during behavioral couple therapy, which would suggest that change in attachment style is a key process variable even for a non-attachment-focused treatment. Multilevel models of data from 134 couples participating in a randomized clinical trial of integrative behavioral couple therapy and traditional behavioral couple therapy (Christensen et al. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 72, 2004, 176) indicate that although there is a trend for early change in attachment-related anxiety and avoidance to predict later change in marita l satisfaction, early change in marital satisfaction strongly predicts change in at- tachment-related anxiety through the end of treatment and 2-year follow-up. These findings suggest that changes in satisfac- tion may lead to changes in attachment rather than the revers e and that change in attachment may not be the mechanism of change in all efficacious couple therapy.

There is still a lack of indicated prevention programs for couples who, although subjectively concerned about their relation- ship, do not seek marital therapy. In a previous randomized controlled study, the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioural psy- choeducational program delivered on a weekend by two trainers for groups of four couples was established. The program consists of communication and problem-solving training, couples' discussions to clarify their relationship expectations, and exercises to enhance their sensual/sexual relationship. In the current study, the effectiveness of adding two booster sessions with each couple individually one and three months after the weekend training program was investigated. Sixty-two couples were recruited by newspaper announcements. At post assessment couples emitted significantly more positive and less nega- tive verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours during a conflict discussion task than at pre-assessment, thus replicat- ing the previous findings. At the 1-year follow-up, couples with booster sessions reported significant higher marital satisfac- tion ratings and fewer problem areas than couples receiving the weekend program only. Booster sessions seem to be effec- tive in enhancing the long-ter m effectiveness of preventive interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).

Attachment issues are viewed by many therapists as lying at the heart of couple distress. It is critical to empirically validat e therapy processes that facilitate couples in responding to ea ch other's attachment needs. This study examined enactments as a therapy process and change mechanism to promote secure attachment in couple therapy. Sixteen couples were ran- domly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups--1 group received 3 therapist-centered sessions followed by 3 enactment- based sessions, and a second group received 3 enactment-based sessions followed by 3 therapist-centered sessions. To measure between-session and within-session change, each spouse completed presession and postsession measures of at- tachment security each week. Results showed that couples who received enactment-based sessions first reported greater increases in attachment security than t hose receiving therapist-centered sessions first. These same couples continued to show improvement after switching to the therapist-centered sessions. Conversely, couples who received therapist-centered RCT 27 Resultat Referanse Sammendrag Design sessions first did not increase attachment after switching to enactment-based sessions. For wives, enactment-based ses- sions produced the greatest improvement in attachment, yet both therapy process modalities led to some improvement. Con- versely, for husbands, attachment improved only when they received enactment-based sessions first. Enactment-based ses- sions may therefore be more important for husbands than wives. Overall, with some qualification it appears that enactment- based therapy process may improve attachment more than a therapist-centered process. These observed trends and find- ings are generally consistent with previous research supporting use of enactments in couple therapy.Copyright 2011 FPI, Inc. Buzzella, B. (2012). \"The initial evalu- ation of a relationship education pro- gram for male same-sex couples.\" Dissertation Abstracts International: 73(6-B): 3945. Same- and other-sex relationships involve similar patterns of development and are subject to similar predictors of relationship distress and dissolution; however, same-sex couples are subject to more varied and intense versions of these predictors (e.g., lack of support for the relationship). Negative relationship outcomes are associated with poorer mental and physical health highlighting the importance of couple-focused interventions to prevent relationship distress. Unfortunately, most pro- grams were explicitly designed for other-sex couples. This proj ect involved the initial evaluati on of the acceptability and uti lity of a relationship education program specifically designed for same-sex couples. The intervention utilizes evidence-based techniques (e.g., communication training) as well as material thought to be especi ally relevant for sa me-sex couples (e.g., coping with discrimination). Twelve married or engaged male same-sex couples were randomized to either an immediate intervention ( N = 7) or waitlist (N = 5) condition. Those completing the intervention participated in a three month, post inte r- vention, follow-up (N = 11). Although participants rated all intervention components as highly useful for enhancing their mar- riages, several recommendations for program refinement were suggested during an exit interview (e.g., increasing focus on sexual connection). Effect size estimates comparing change acro ss the waitlist, reveal that involvement in the waitlist was associated with improvements in communication and problem solving, relationship outcomes (i.e., satisfaction, confidence, and quality), perceived support for the relationship, social su pport, perceived stress, and physical well-being. This may be a consequence of study assessment methodologies (e.g., engagement in a problem solving discussion) and/or the couple's decision to participate in a relationship education program. To ex amine the specific impact of the intervention, a series of ef - fect sizes were calculated, each comparing data at post-waitlist and post-intervention (for the immediate treatment group only) time points. These results suggest that involvement in the intervention was associated with improvements in communi- cation, relationship outcomes (i.e., satisfaction, confidence, an d quality), perceived support for the relationship, social sup - port, perceived stress, and mental well-being. Intervention effects were generally maintained three months later, suggesting that this program may result in lasting improvements in individual and relational outcomes. Future research will evaluate the intervention among a larger sample of couples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). RCT 28 Resultat Referanse Sammendrag Design Carlson, R.

The disturbing and pervasive adverse consequences of the high rate of marital discord and divorce highlight the need for ex- panded preventive efforts. Recent research shows that stress and poor stress coping abilities are crucial determinants of re- lationship quality and stability (Karney & Bradbury, 1995), yet existing prevention programs have not targeted stress and cop- ing. Using a randomized wait-list controlled design, this study evaluated the impact upon clinically non-distressed couples of a manualized group relationship enhancement intervention modeled on the mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction program (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Dependent measures assessed not only relationship functioning but also individual well-being. Summary measures were administered before and after the intervention and 3 months later, and daily measures were rec- orded for 2 preintervention weeks and the final 3 weeks of the 8-week program. Hypotheses predicted the mindfulness condi- tion would be superior to the wait-list condition on both summary and daily measures. Attrition from the two conditions was equal, and the final sample consisted of 44 couples (37 married, 7 cohabitating) evenly divided between conditions. No signif- icant pretest condition differences were found on dependent me asures, demographics or expectancy. Attendance during the intervention was good, and participants averaged 32 min. per day of mindfulness homework practice. As predicted, at post- test the mindfulness condition demonstrated superior outcomes on summary relationship measures (relationship distress, Global Distress Scale; relationship satisfaction, Quality of Marriage Index; autonomy and relatedness, Autonomy & Related- ness Inventory; acceptance of partner, visu al analogue scale [VAS]) an d individual measures (psychological distress, Brief Symptom Inventory; optimism, LOT-R; sp irituality, INSPIRIT; relaxation, VAS). Multilevel model analyses of daily VAS measures provided a finer-grained confirmation, showing improvements in day-to-day relationship stress, relationship happi- ness, and individual stress coping efficacy. Those who spent more time practicing mindfulness had better outcomes, and well-controlled within-person analyses showed greater practice on a given day led to decreased relationship stress and in- creased relationship happiness on the following day. Follow-up summary results showed maintenance of benefits. This study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the mindfulnes s program in preventing relationship distress.

A randomized clinical trial compared the effects of traditional behavioral couple therapy (TBCT) and integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT) on 134 seriously and chronically distress ed married couples, stratified into moderately and severely distressed groups. Couples in IBCT made steady improvements in satisfaction throughout the course of treatment, whereas TBCT couples improved more quickly than IBCT couples early in treatment but then, in contrast to the IBCT group, plateaued later in treatment. Both treatment s produced similar levels of clinically signif icant improvement by the end of treatment (71% of IBCT couples and 59% of TBCT couples were reliably improved or recovered on the Dyadic Adjustment Scale; G.

Follow-up data across 2 years were obtained on 130 of 134 couples who were originally part of a randomized clinical trial comparing traditional versus integrative behavioral couple t herapy (TBCT vs. IBCT; A. Christensen et al., 2004). Both treat- ments produced similar levels of clinically significant improvem ent at 2 years posttreatment (69% of IBCT couples and 60% of TBCT couples). Both treatments showed a \"hockey-stick\" pattern of change in which satisfaction dropped immediately after treatment termination but then increased for most of follow-up. The break point when couples reversed courses and gained in satisfaction occurred sooner for IBCT than TBCT couples, and th ose couples who stayed together generally fared better in IBCT than in TBCT. Finally, there was evidence of greater stab ility during follow-up in IBCT than in TBCT couples. There was little change in individual functioning over follow-up, but when change occurred it was strongly related to change in marital satisfaction. Given that this sample was selected for its signif icant and chronic distress, the data are encouraging about the long-term impact of behavioral couple therapy.Copyright ((c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).

OBJECTIVE: To follow distressed married couples for 5 years after their participation in a randomized clinical trial. METHOD: A total of 134 chronically and seriously distressed married couples were randomly assigned to approximately 8 months of either traditional behavioral couple therapy (TBCT; Jacobson & Margolin, 1979) or integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT; Jacobson & Christensen, 1998). Marital status and satisfaction were assessed approximately every 3 months during treatment and every 6 months for 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: Pre- to posttreatment effect sizes on marital sati sfaction were d = 0.90 for IBCT and d = 0.71 for TBCT, which were not significantly different. However, data through 2- year follow-ups revealed statistically significant superiority of IBC T over TBCT in relationship satisfaction, but subsequent data showed increasing similarity and nonsignificant differences in outcome. At 5-year follow-up for marital sati sfaction relative to pretreatment, effect sizes were d = 1.03 for IBCT and d = 0.9 2 for TBCT; 50.0% of IBCT couples and 45.9% of TBCT couples showed clinically significant improvement.

The primary objective was to evaluate the mechanism through which violence was reduced. It was hypothesized that IPV would be reduced via use of therapeuti c skills taught during the intervention (i.e., friendship, sex/ro- mance/passion, shared meaning, and conflict management skills).

Thirty-five couples were randomly assigned to the 5-week intervention (n=18) or a waitlist control group (n=17), and followed up 1 and 3 months later.

Treatment was also effective in secondarily improving women's marital satisfaction, reducing husbands' levels of psychological distress and depression-specific burden, and im- proving both partners' understanding and acceptance of depres sion. The treatment was implemented in five 2-hour sessions, representing an efficient, cost-effective app roach.

This study examined the effect of selected sexual and nonsexual aspects of pre-marriage counseling on the marital satisfac- tion of Iranian newlywed couples. A sample of 200 couples was divided randomly into two groups, one group receiving ordi- nary education (the no intervention group, NIG), the other grou p receiving special education (the intervention group, IG). IG couples attended four lecture sessions given by the researchers consisting of family planning, personal health, different as- pects of sexuality, communication and conflict resolution skil ls. NIG couples attended lectures presented in the normal prepa- ration program, based on just family planning and personal health. All lectures were given a few months prior to marriage, and then marital satisfaction was assessed 4 months after marriage with 40 questions of the ENRICH questionnaire. Final analysis was based on 64 completed questionnaires.

Follow up period 36 weeks (mean length of time until final session). Setting: Community based therapy practices, Los Angeles and Seattle; November 1997 to February 2001 Patients: Seriously and chronically distressed married couples repeatedly reporting substantial relationship distress In =134 couples). Inclusion criteria: average score of less than 100 in t he Marital Adjustment Test in a phone interview; at least one of the partners with a T score of >/= 59 on the Global Distress Scale at two subsequent screenings by questionnaire and one partner scoring one standard deviation below the population me an (<98) in the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Participants were 18-65 years, fluent in English, and educated to at least high school level. Exclusions: mildly distressed or unstably distresse d couples, people with psychotic disorders, couples in alternative concurrent therapy, and wife reports of violence. Intervention: Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy (TBCT): therapists used three treatment strategies: mutual positive be- havioural changes, communication training, and problem solving training. Couples were also given a communication guide to read. Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT): enhanced TBCT using three major strategies: empathic joining (identify- ing vulnerable feelings underlying response), unified detach ment, and tolerance to responses to problems. A maximum of 26 sessions were allowed (mean: 23 sessions). Outcomes: Relationship satisfaction (Dyadic Adjustment Score and Global Distress Scale) and relationship stability (Marital Status Inventory) determined at intake, and at 13 and 26 w eeks. Communication was measured using the Problem Solving Communication and Affective Communication of the Marital Satisfaction Inventory (Revised). Patient follow up: 94% of couples completed treatment (10+ sessions). MAIN RESULTS At final assessment, there was no significant difference between IBCT and TBCT (p = 0.34) although both treatments re- sulted in clinically significant improvement (71% of couples showed reliable improvement or recovery in IBCT v 59% showing improvement in TBCT). CONCLUSIONS TBCT and IBCT are equally effective for distressed couples. Marital therapy is associated with significant change over time in relation-ship satisfaction, stability, and communication.

Assessment and feedback of relationship strengths and challenges is a widely used brief approach to couple relationship education (CRE). It can be fatly automated through the internet, with couples self-interpreting the feedback. This study as- sessed whether therapist guidance of couples to interpret the report and develop relationship goals enhanced the benefits of the feedback. Thirty-nine couples seeking CRE were randomly assigned to either self-interpretation of an internet-based rela- tionship assessment report (RELATE), or therapist-guided inte rpretation of the sa me report (RELATE+). Participants were assessed on relationship satisfaction and psychological distress pre- and post-CRE, and at 6-month follow-up. RELATE and RELATE+ were not reliably different in outcome. Couples in both conditions sustained high relationship satisfaction and showed an overall decline in psych ological distress. However, consumer satisf action was substantially higher for the RE- LATE+ condition than the RELATE condition. RCT Halford, W., et al.

Relative to RELATE, RELATE + Couple CA RE produced more improvement in cou- ple communication, and high relationship satisfaction across the next 12 months in women.

Although personal happiness is highly associated with social relationships, basic questions remain regarding the causal effect of improved social relationships on happiness. The main aim of this study was to test whether emotional and cognitive dimen- sions of personal happiness can be increased by means of a self-directed relationship enhancement program, which aims to increase relationship-relevant skills such as dyadic coping, communication, and conflict resolution. N = 220 couples were randomly assigned either to an intervention or to a waiting li st control group (survey: pre-, post-, 3- and 6-month follow-ups) . Multi-group latent change score models reveal that (1) personal happiness can be increased through a couple intervention; (2) change in personal happiness was predicted by an increase in skills and relationsh ip satisfaction thro ugh the intervention; (3) the least happy participants benefited most from the intervent ion.

All Ss participated in a pretreatment assessment that included a conjoint interview with the therapist, individual interviews with each spouse, comple- tion of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale and an areas-of-change questionnaire, and a videotaped communication assessment. Posttreatment assessments were also conducted immediately fo llowing treatment and 6 mo later. Between-groups compari- sons were based on the proportions of Ss improved in specified areas of change, the clinical significance of changes, and whether the changes were statistically reliable. In terms of marital satisfaction, differences between groups began to emerge at the 6-mo follow-up.

Although traditional behavioral couple therapy (TBCT) has garnered the most empirical support of any marital treatment, con- cerns have been raised about both its durability and clinical significance. Integrative behavi oral couple therapy (IBCT) was designed to address some of these limitations by combining strategies for fostering emotional acceptance with the change- oriented strategies of TBCT. Results of a preliminary clinical trial, in which 21 couples were randomly assigned to TBCT or IBCT, indicated that therapists could keep the 2 treatments distinct, that both husbands and wives receiving IBCT evidenced greater increases in mari tal satisfaction than couples receiving TBCT, and t hat IBCT resulted in a greater percentage of cou- ples who either improved or recovered on the basis of clinical significance data. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that IBCT is a promising new treatment for couple discord. RCT Kaiser, A., et al.

However, there is a lack of indicated prevention programs fbr married couples who do not seek marital therapy although they are subjectively concerned about their deteriorating marriage. In this study the effi - cacy of a compact psychoeducational group prevention program (EPL II) was investigated in a randomized controlled study with 67 couples. The couples were recruited by newspaper announcements, then randomly assigned to the EPL-II prevention program or to awaiting-list control group. The EPL II lasts 16 hours and is carried out by 2 trainers on a weekend. It consists of communication and problem-solving training, discussions of the couples to clarify-their relationship expectations, and an excercise to enhance their sensual/sexual relationship. At postassessment 15 weeks after the training, EPL-II couples showed more positive verbal and nonverbal communication behavior during a conflict discussion task than control couples, who reported significantly more relationship problem areas and displayed more negative communication behavior. At the 1- year follow-up, EPL-II couples reported fewer problem areas in comparison to the preassessment. RCT Karahan, T. F.

We analyzed the dyadic data with hierarchical linear modeling in a two-level model. Significant improvements on scores of anxiety corresponded with large effect sizes for both partners. Yet significant improvements on depression scores were only found for the unfaithful partner with moderat e effect size. Results suggest that the treatment can improve individual complaints, but not relationship satisfaction in a sufficient amount for both partners.

Although the RCT 41 Resultat Referanse Sammendrag Design and Clinical Psychology 26(8): 940- 959. CCET does not target specific child-rearing issues, but rather focuses on stress and coping, communication and problem solving in general, it is hypothesized that the program should be able to not only improve partners' communication and dyadic coping skills but also reduce tensions and disagreements that might arise between partners regarding matters related to their children. This study addresses this question based on an evaluation of 100 couples who were randomly assigned either to the CCET or to a control group that received no skills training.

A history of physical aggression in the current relationship before marriage and before intervention showed a similar pattern as a moderator, but the e ffect was only marginally sign ificant. Family-of-origin back- ground (parental divorce and/or aggression) was not a significan t moderator of prevention effects across the two kinds of ser- vices. Implications for defining risk, considering divorce as a positive versus negative outcome, the practice of premarital re la- tionship education, and social policy are discussed. RCT McMurray, S. K.

This is the first study to examine the effects of therapist treatment adherence on outcome in marital therapy. Treatment ad- herence and outcome was studied for 35 distressed married couples who were part of a larger randomized clinical trial of traditional behavioral couple therapy (TBCT) and integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT). Use of TBCT interventions was not related to outcome with either TBCT or IBCT couples. IBCT adherence had a fairly strong relationship to outcome with IBCT couples when used early and late in treatment. Adherence to compatible interventions had a strong, significant relationship to outcome for IBCT couples when used late in treatment.

Poverty and economic hardship create tremendous stress for families, and subsequently are risk factors for child psycho- pathology. The Fatherhood, Relationship, and Marriage Education (FRAME) program is a 14-hour psychoeducation interven- tion developed specifically to strengthen the ability of low-income mothers and fathers to reduce conflict, cope with stress, and co-parent effectively, hopefully helping to create more stable and secure environments for children. The FRAME study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a couples-based intervention in a sample of 301 ethnically diverse low - income cohabiting mothers and fathers who are parenting at least one child together. Couples were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups or to an assessment-only contro l condition. The current research evaluated the impact of the intervention program on a range of parenting behaviors and child outcomes across four time points for both mothers and fa- ther, and examined relationships between economic strain and parenting, and parenting and symptoms of psychopathology across four time points. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for primary analyses. FRAME effectiveness results showed significant time by group interactions for Anxious/Depressed and Thought Problems symptoms, as well as Parent-Child Posi- tive Interaction, indicating im provements for intervention participants as opposed to controls, as well as a time by group by gender interactions indicating that mothers in the intervention groups reported the steepest decline for Anxious/Depressed symptoms and Internalizing Problems symptoms across all four time points. Economic strain was significantly related to a number of parenting difficulties, and parenting variables were significantly associated with symptoms of psychopathology for all participants across time. Implications for future studies involving interventions with low-income families are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2 014 APA, all rights reserved).

Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of couple relationship education in assisting couples to sustain relationship functioning and parenting sensitivity, and whether benefits were moderated by risk of maladjustment in the transition to parenthood (\"risk\"). Method: Two hundred fifty couples expecting their first child were assessed on risk and randomly as- signed to either the Couple CARE for Parents (CCP), a couple relationship- and coparenting-focused education program (n = 125), or the Becoming a Parent Program (BAP), a mother-focused parenting program (n = 125).

Observed parenting and self-report parenting st ress were assessed at 4 months postpartum, and parenting stress was assessed again at 16 and 28 months postpartum. Resu lts: Risk was associated with greater relationship and par- enting adjustment problems. Relative to BAP, CCP women decreased their negative communication and showed a trend to report less parenting stress irrespective of risk level.

The intent of the study was to assess whether facilitated imagery is a successful technique for improving marital satisfaction. Changes in individual psychological functioning were also mo nitored. Twenty marital couples were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. Both groups received three one-hour sess ions of a structured marital enrichment program. Couples in one group received three addition al one-hour sessions of facilit ated imagery. The Marital Sati sfaction Inventory and the Brief Symptom Inventory were utilized to assess change, and were ad ministered pretreatment and at two points posttreatment: at one month and four months. A series of 2 x (3) repeated measure analyses of variance were used to detect changes for hus- bands and wives. Subjects exposed to fa cilitated imagery reported significantly greater improvement than enrichment-only subjects on some scales of the Marital Satisfaction Inventory. Imagery husbands were significantly more improved on Prob- lem Solving Communication while imagery wives reported significantly greater improvement on Disagreement About Fi- nances and Global Distress. Imagery subjects also recorded significantly greater improvement on several scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Imagery husbands reported significantl y greater improvement on Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms, while their wives showed significantly greater gains on Interpersonal Sensitivity, Hostility, Global Severity, and Positive Sym p- tom Total. Of the imagery subjects, wives tended to achieve vivid imagery faster than their husbands. Two subjects were never able to achieve successful imagery. The majority of imagery subjects reported that the process had been helpful to them.

This study's primary objective wa s to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of an abridged videotape/workbook version of the Prevention Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP).

RCT 47 Resultat B: The Sciences and Engineering 62(4-B): 2076. This study also explored the effects of adding a therapist/consu ltant on couples' acquisition of targeted communication and problem-solving skills, and it examined indi vidual and relationship characteristics as predictors of treatment outcome. Thirty- eight couples in committed or married relationships were randomly assigned to a videotape only, a videotape-consultant, or a waitlist control condition. All couples self-administered the three-session PREP videotape/workbook Couples in the videotape-consultant condition completed skill-building exer cises with the assistance of a trained therapist/consultant whereas couples in the videotape condition practiced skills alone with their partner as guided by the PREP workbooks. Re- sults indicated that couples in both the videotape and videota pe-consultant condition reported a high degree of satisfaction with the PREP videotape/workbook program. As compared to couples in the waitlist control group, treatment couples dis- played significant improvements in relationship danger signs such as negative escalation, negativity and invalidation/valida- tion. Treatment couples also displayed significant gains in communication and problem-solving skills that counteract relation- ship danger signs. Results indicated virtually no outcome differences between couples who completed the videotape program with their partner in private and those who practiced the PREP skills with a trained consultant. Treatment outcome was pre- dicted by participants' age and relationship length, and to a lesser degree by females' relationship satisfaction. Overall, thi s study's positive results suggest that the self-guided PREP vide otape was effective in improving couples' commu- nication and problem-solving skills. Findings are discussed in terms of the implications for future research and the potential benefits of self-directed videotape programming for expanding access to preventive and interventive services for couples that are married or planning marriage.

This study examined the efficacy of Support-Focused Marital Therapy (SFMT), a short-term, marital intervention outlined in manual form for use by a wide-range of therapists. Forty-three distressed couples were randomly assigned to the SFMT or waitlist condition. Couples completed two relationship measures, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) and the Areas of Change Questionnaire (ACQ), and three well being measures, the Spielberger Trait Anger Inventory (STAI), Rosenberg Self- Esteem Inventory (RSE), and Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), prior to assignment and after the intervention or waiting period. Doubly-repeated measures MANOVA analyses revealed that the SFMT group experienced significantly greater improvements over time as compared with the control group on the relationship measures, but not on the well-being measures. Chi-square analyses indicated that significantly mo re SFMT than control wives experienced clinically-significant change in marital satisfaction, using Jacobson and Truax's (1991) change criteria, while significantly more control than SFMT husbands deteriorated. Also, significantly more SFMT than cont rol couples experienced clinically-significant change in the number of desired relationship changes. No significant group differences in individual distress using clinically-significant RCT 48 Resultat Referanse Sammendrag Design change criteria were detected. For the SFMT group, husbands' lower reported household income and education level corre- lated with greater improvements in husbands' marital satisfacti on, and older age for wives' age correlated with greater im- provements in wives' marital satisfaction. Lower initial levels of marital satisfaction correlated with greater improvements in marital satisfaction for husbands and couples. Lower initial levels of marital satisfaction for wives correlated with greater r e- ductions in wives' anger. Therapist variables and a specific couple profile type did not predict change in partners' marital sa t- isfaction. Marital satisfaction could not be found to mediate (t ransmit) the relationship between group assignment (SFMT vs. control) and individual distress because no relationship between group assignment and individual distress was detected. This first study addressing SFMT efficacy showed that SFMT meets C hambless and Hollon's (1998) criteria effica- cious treatment.\" As a time-limited, manualized approach that can be effectively administered by therapists regardless of age, experience level, or marital status, SFMT shows promise as a valuable addition to the available therapies.

Forty-two couples were randomly assigned to either individual couple or multi-couple group tr eatment. Nine couples served as the compar ison group. Male violence recidivism rates 6 months after treatment were significantly lower for the multi-couple group (25%) than for the comparison group (66%). In contrast, men in the individual couple condition were not si gnificantly less likely to recidi vate (43%) than those in the co m- parison group.

Cognitive Marital Therapy is a brief, structured couple therapy, which involves spouses in reciprocal self-disclosure of personal constructs. The control group received the same number of sessions of self- disclosure from a programmed marital enhancement text. Persona l distress, marital adjustment, marital quality, and aspects of self-disclosure were measured before and after treatment. Symptoms of depression as well as somatic and compulsive complaints showed significant improvement in both groups. The wives exhibited a trend suggesting that they were making more self-disclosures to their spouses after counseling. No discernable differences in outcome were found between the mari- tal therapy group and the control group.

Method: Engaged and newlywed couples (N = 130) were randomized into 1 of 3 relationship education programs. Indi- vidual and relational risk factors assessed at baseline were tested as moderators of 3-year changes in relationship satisfac- tion, overall and in each of the 3 treatment conditions. Results: Treatment effects varied as a function of risk, and more so with variables capturing relational risk factors than individual risk factors. High-risk couple s (e.g., couples with lower leve ls of baseline commitment and satisfaction) tended to decline less rapidly in satisfaction than low-risk couples following treatment. Couples with acute concerns at baseline, including higher leve ls of physical aggression and alcohol use, benefitted less from intervention than couples without these concerns. Comparisons ac ross treatment conditions indica te that couple s with rela- tively high baseline satisfaction and commitment scores decl ined faster in satisfaction when assigned to an intensive skill- based intervention, as compared with a low-intensity intervention.

Objectives: To evaluate whether or not the use of a self-help video compared to usual care improves outcomes in couples with relationship problems. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Specialist out patient service in Sheffield. Partici- pants: 18 couples referred to a couples and sexual problems clinic. Interventions: A project developed two culturally sensitive self-help videos for couples with relationship problems. These were evaluated against a no treatment 12 week waiting list for couples referred to a couples and sexual problems clinic. Outcomes: GRIMM (primary), GRISS, BDI, and DAS collected at baseline and 12 weeks post randomisation. Results: 8 couples were randomised to the video group and 10 to the no video control group. Recruitment was extremely difficult from natural referrals to the clinic as well as from primary care practices despite the opportunity of rapid access to self help materials. The study was suspended due to low recruitment numbers. We calculated the average baseline and follow-up scores and used these in the subsequent analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the video and control groups at baseline or at follow-up. Even by adjusting for the baseline score there were still no statistically si gnificant differences between the video and control groups at follow-up. Conclusions: Although the results suggest that use of self help visual inst ructional material did not produce any significant differences, t his may have been due to low recruitment alone as only 8 couples were randomised to video. A number of key learning points were identified and suggestions are presented for future studies of a similar nature.

Second, there was a statistically significant improvement for the alternate demanding /with- drawal communication pattern sub-scales of dysfunctional communication pattern of CPQ-SF for the experimental group compared to control group. Third, there was a statistically sign ificant improvement of The Sexual Satisfaction for the experi- mental group compared to control group. This effects was maintained for following six weeks after the termination of this pro- gram. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that Couple Comm unication program in combination with Sexual Training Com- munication Program can be helpful for the marital sa tisfaction, and beneficial for distressed couples.

This study determined if one treatment, Relationship Enhancement Therapy (RE), would increase marital adjustment, trust and intimacy, marital communication, and perceived ability to handle problems in distressed marital relationships. The re- search was conducted in a private practice in Southwestern Georgia and used experienced therapists to colead small groups of couples who met weekly for 12 weeks. Twenty-two couples (N = 44) completed the communication therapy and ten (N = 20) were in the wait control group. The average treatment hus band and wife were middle-aged, with established careers, well off financially, and involved in religious activities. Dependent variables were measured with the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), the Interpersonal Relationship Scale (IRS), the Marital Communication Inventory (MCI), and the Handling Problems Change Scale (HPCS). Clinical and statistically significant results in a positive direction were found on the DAS in marital adjustment using Relationship Enhancement Therapy (RE) for the treatment group when compared to the control group. After three months, results continued to be statistically and clinically significant. Statistically significant results in a positive direction were also found on measures of trust and intimacy and marital communication.

Comparison of groups using analysis of covariance, with the pretest entered as the covariate, found no significant treatment effects, but both groups showed gains in relationship quality. Paired t- tests showed significant gains within the Treatment Group in the Children and Parenting subscale (p \u00cb=.002) and in the Total ENRICH average score (p \u00cb=.02). An analysis of change using the Reliable Change Index (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) found significant positive gains in 53.1% of Treatment Group couples and in 65.5% of Comparison Group couples. In both Treat- ment and Comparison Groups, higher percentages of couples experienced positive change than a previous study of marital enrichment with newlyweds had shown, suggesting that the transition to parenthood may be a time of increased sensitivity to change in relationship quality. When Treatment Group couple gains were examined within Circumplex Model (Olson, 1989) family functioning typologies, couples classified as midrange sh owed the most gains, involving both the Total ENRICH score and the Children and Parenting subscale. Balanced couples showed significant gains only in the Children and Parenting sub- scale, and extreme-nonbalanced couples showed no gains. Interpretati on of the effect of treatment was confounded by signif- icant pretest differences between groups. There were more single couples, couples with previous divorce, and parenting con- cerns in couples who selected the Treatment Group.

To investigate the effects of the prog ram, three groups(i.e., experimental, comparative, and control groups) were compared. Among three groups, the experimental gr oup was significantly higher in self-differentiation and mari- tal satisfaction after treatment, and in self-differentiation, co uple relationship, communications , marital satisfaction at one month after treatment.

Men in the treatment group significantly improved in relationship satisfaction, mindfulness, and nega- tive affect; women had no significant treatment effects. Small to large effect sizes were present for treatment group men and women in multiple areas. Mixed-methods analyses demonstrated that this intervention may be especially helpful for men be- cause of differences in social support needs, effects of program enrollment, and relational processes in the prenatal period.

Couple relationship education has be en offered in an attempt to reduce thos e risks and enhance couple outcomes. The current effectiveness study had two aims: to assess (a) the long -term effects of relationship education and (b) the ability of partners to remember the skills typically taught during the communication skills training. One hundred and one couples from two studies, in which the effectiveness of the EPL (Ein Partnerschaftliches Lernprogramm fur Paare [A Learning Program for Married Couples]) was investigated, were followed-up 11 years a fter the training. In the first study, EPL-takers had a signifi- cantly lower divorce and separation rate (27.5%) than non-EPL-takers (52.6%). This finding was replicated in a second study, showing a 20% dissolution rate in EPL-takers. For those couples still together, the rate of happy relationships was 80% at the eleven-year follow-up - thus, there is optimism for longer married couples who are willing to focus on improving their relation - ships. Only about 55% of the partners co uld remember at least one speaker skill whereas 70% remembered at least one lis- tening skill taught during EPL.

Methodology: This experimental study was conducted on a control and a case group using a pretest and a post-test. The case group and the control group both consisted of seven couples who were selected through convenience random sam- pling. The measurement instruments included a 32-item questionnaire with 8 dimensions on marital intimacy and a 44-item questionnaire with three dimensions on marital commitment. The data were analyzed using ANCOVA (analysis of covari- ance) method. In this respect, the pretest and the post-test were conducted on both the case and the control groups; how- ever, the independent variable (the solution-focused therapy) was only performed on the case group.

This group was divided into two subgroups: testing group and controlling group. The pre and post tests were conducted against these two subgroups, and the levels of self-esteem, fury, emot ional communication, communication for problem-solving, and sexual intimacy were used as measuring instrument. Afterwards, an experiential couple group therapy program was con- ducted against five couples before analyzing its effects quantitatively. Identical analyses criteria were applied to qualitativ e analyses in all research questions, and the analyses were based on the levels of changes in self-esteem, fury, emotional communication, communication for problem-solving, and sexual intimacy. The study findings led to the following conclusions: First, the quantitative analyses by the experiential couple gr oup therapy program developed by this study showed a positive result in improving self-esteem, inner feeling, and self-cognition. Second, as a result of conducting this program, revealed th at the effect in alleviating the accumulated fury of couples with chronic marital discord was insignificant, Third, the emotional communication between couples improved with the change in in dividual's intrapsychic system, the communication ability for the solution of problem significantly enhanced, and meaningful change in the sexual intimacy was observed.

A comparative evaluation was conducted in a community mental health center between two types of brief, marital therapy in groups. The experimental group of four couples was exposed to behavioral methods based on social learning principles. The primary interventions were training the spouses in discriminating and monitoring the occurrence of pleasing events and be- haviors; behavioral rehearsal of communication skills using pr ompting, modelling, feedback, and 'homework' assigments; and contingency contracting. The comparison group of five couples was led in an interactional format with the leaders encourag- ing ventilation of feelings, problem solving through discussion, and mutual support and feedback. Both groups were led by the same three clinicians. Outcome was measured on multiple levels before, during and immediately after treatment. Follow up assessments were conducted at one, two, and six months after treatment. Response measures included the self report by clients on marital satisfaction; on consumer satisfaction with the treatment experience; on their observations of pleasing be- haviors given and received as recorded on wrist counters; and direct observation of client via 'live' time sampling and coding of videotapes of problem solving discussions before and after treatment.

The current research is one of the first studies to look at th e outcomes of a CRE program with fragile families in the areas of couple stability and marriage formation. Data were from the Family Formation Project, a federal and state funded program working with fragile family couples (n = 96) in a metropolitan area. A historical cohort control group quasi-experimental re- search design was used with a matched control group from the Fragile Family and Child Well-being Study. The intervention consisted of in-home education and support, group educational events, and social service referrals. Findings showed that couples had the same rate of couple stability as the control group but an increased rate of marriage. These findings suggest that CRE can help fragile families achieve marriage when that is their goal, but that some fragile families may need more than CRE to help them stabilize their re lationship, or they ma y be better off separati ng.

In terms of drinking outcomes, the advantage for BMT over control noted during treatment was no longer apparent after treatment. Although BMT and interactional couples group did not differ on drinking or marital adjustment, both types of marital therapy had fewer days separated than c ontrols suggesting that the common effects of both types of marital therapy may be to promote relationship stability during the long and arduous period of recovery from al- coholism.

OBJECTIVE: Although women's breast cancer affects both women and their male partners, as well as their rela- tionships, few interventions have been developed to work with couples confronting breast cancer. The current in- vestigation presents the pilot results from a new couple-based intervention program for breast cancer that teaches couples how to minimize negative effects and maximize positive functioning dur ing this difficult time. METHOD: In this pilot study, 14 couples in which the wife had early stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions: Couple-based relationship enhancement (RE) or treatment-as-usual (TAU). RESULTS: The results from this study suggest that co mpared with couples receiving treatment-as-usual, both women and men in the RE condition experienced improved functioning on individual psychological variables as well as relationship functioning at posttest and 1-year follow-up.

This study evaluated the effects of a structured couples treatment program on the psychosocial discomfort following a mastectomy. Twenty couples were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions and were administered an assessment battery be- fore and after treatment that measured change in marital happiness, sexual satisfaction, depression, self-esteem, helplessness, anxiety, alienation, and emotional discomfort. An analysis of variance yielded no significant differ- ence between experimental and control conditions on any of the dependent variables. A supplemental analysis of covariance using the pretest as a covariate found that the treatment reduced emotional discomfort in both partners, reduced depression in the patient, and increased sexual satisfaction for both spouses. Recommendations were made for further study of the treatment, controlling fo r the subject's level of distress prior to treatment. RCT Brystkreft Jacobson, N. S., et al.

The purpose of this study was to compare cognitive-behavioral therapy (CT; n = 20), behavioral marital therapy (BMT; n = 19), and a treatment combining BMT and CT (CO; n = 21) in the alleviation of wives' depression and the enhancement of marital satisfaction. BMT was less effective than CT for depression in maritally nondistressed cou- ples, whereas for maritally distressed couples the two treatments were equally effective. BMT was the only treat- ment to have a significant positive impact on relationsh ip satisfaction in distressed couples, whereas CO was the only treatment to enhance the marital satisfaction of nondistressed couples. On marital interaction measures CO was the only treatment to significantly reduce both husband and wife aversive behavior and to significantly in- crease wife facilitative behavior.

Journal of Con- sulting and Clinical Psychology 61, 516-519 This study investigated the effects of behavioral couple therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and their combina- tion on female depression 6 and 12 months after therapy ended. We predicted that couples receiving a behavioral couple treatment would be less likely to relapse than those receiving a cognitive-behavioral treatment for the de- pressed spouse alone. Relapse rates, however, did not discriminate between treatments at any follow-up point. Reductions in husband and wife dysphoria and increases in wife facilitative behavior during therapy predicted re- covery. Moreover, high rates of husbands' facilitative behavi or at posttest were associated with wife recovery and predicted low levels of depression at the 1-year follow-up.

METHOD: Twenty-seven depressed patients experiencing marital distress were randomly assigned to either indi- vidual behavioural-cognitive therapy or marital therapy. The individual treatment condition focused on depressed mood, behavioural activity and dysfunctional cognitions, wh ereas in the marital condition the partner was involved in the treatment and the focus was on the communication process in the marital relationship. MANOVAs revealed that treatment led to statistically significant improvem ents in depressed mood, behavioural activity and dysfunc- tional cognitions, an increase in relationship satisfaction and improvement of communication in patients and spouses. A significant interaction effect was found, showing that marital therapy had more impact on relationship variables than the individual treatment. CONCLUSION: Both individual cognitive-behaviour therapy and marital therapy lead to less depressive complaints, and both treatment conditions have a positive effect on the relationship, although the effect on the relationship is significantly stronger in couples who were tested by marital therapy compared with patients who were treated indi- vidually.

Thirty-six maritally discordant couples with depressed wives were randomly assigned to marital therapy, cognitive therapy, or a waiting-list control condition. The women gi ven marital or cognitive therapy showed significant and clinically meaningful reductions in their depression. The women given marital therapy showed greater increases in marital satisfaction than did those given cognitive therapy or no therapy; these differences were maintained at 1- year follow-up. These findings suggest that marital therapy may be the most effective and appropriate treatment for clinically significant marital discord with coexisting clinically significant depression.

Background: Infertility is a major cause of marital problems and sexual dissatis faction. This study was conducted to determine the effects of counseling on infertile couple's marital relationship and sexual satisfaction. Materials and methods: This study was performed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which 100 infertile couples (200 par- ticipants) who visited Reproductive Health Research Center Tehran, Iran were randomly assigned into two groups: intervention (n = 50 couples, 50 wives and 50 husbands) and control (n = 50 couples, 50 wives and 50 husbands). Intervention was defined as three counseling sessions per week, each lasting 60-90 min. Counseling in the inter- vention group was conducted separately for each couple. Demographic characteristics and marital and sexual sat- isfaction were investigated using three questionnaires through interviews. The outcomes, including changes in marital satisfaction and sexual satisfaction, were compared between the two groups 3 months later. Results: Based on the data collected 3 months after the intervention period, the mean scores of marital and sexual satisfaction in intervention and control groups for wives were 49.62 +/- 11.09 +/- 36.63 +/- 6.52 (P = 0.025), respectively. It should be noted that higher scores in questionnaires inspecting marital and sexual satisfaction indicate lower satisfaction.

When one member of a couple develops a serious illness, the lives of both partners are likely to be affected. Inter- ventions directed at both partners are generally lacking, however. In the present study, a brief counseling program directed at couples confronted with cancer was evaluated. The intervention focused mainly on the exchange of so- cial support and help between both partners and was aimed at restoring perceptions of equity. Couples were ran- domly assigned to an experimental group or a waiting-list group. After the intervention, both patients and their part- ners reported lower levels of perceptions of underinvest ment and overbenefit, and higher levels of relationship quality. Moreover, among patients psychological distress de creased after the intervention. These effects were gen- erally maintained until follow-up three months later. Associations between perceptions of equity and relationship quality and psychological distress were also examined. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. RCT Kreft McLean, L. M., et al.

Twenty-eight patients were included both in the treat- ment group and in the control group. Outcome measures were self-reported psychologi cal distress, marital satis- faction, health locus of control, pain and disability as well as clinical exam inations. The reliab ility of the outcome measures was statistically analysed and found acceptable. At the 5-yr follow-up assessments, psychological dis- tress was found to be decreased in the treatment group and increased in controls. The difference between the groups was significant.

This was a controlled, prospective study on the effectiveness of couple therapy in 63 chronic low back pain patients (CLBP) from primary health care centers. They were rand omly allocated to a couple therapy (T) group, N = 33, and to a control (C) group, N = 30. Couple therapy consisting of five monthly sessions was conducted by two family therapists. All patients and their spouses participated in a 12-month follow-up. Marital communication improved in CLBP patients of the T-group, whereas it worsened in the C-group. Psychological distress decreased in male pa- tients of the T-group, whereas it increased in male patient s of the C-group. However, due to high initial levels of distress in male patients of the T-group no firm conclusion of therapy effect can be done. The trends in health atti- tudes of the patients were similar during the study year. No significant differences in any of the measures were found in spouses. It is concluded that couple therapy im proves the quality of life in CLBP patients by enhancing marital communication. RCT Kronisk ryggsmerte Rasoli, R., et al.

(2008). \"A marital in- tervention program for couples with chronically ill children.\" Dis- sertation Abstract s 68(7-B): 4851. Research indicates that parents of ch ronically ill children are more likely than the norm to experience marital dis- tress as well as depressive symptomatology. It is important to address these issues because chronic illness in chil- dren, unlike acute illness; necessitates that parents become the major caregivers of the child's day to day health care needs. The present study was a randomized control trial that evaluated a marital intervention program for these parents. Emotionally Focused Therapy, a demonstrated efficacious marital intervention for couples in other populations, was modified for couples with chronically ill children. Thirty-two couples with a chronically ill child at- tending clinics at a tertiary care children's hospital participated in the study and were randomly assigned to either individual marital therapy (n=16) or to a waiting-list control group (n =16). Multi-method assessment of marital func- tioning was done at pretreatment, posttreatment, and at a 5-month follow-up. Results indicated that self-reported marital adjustment significantly improved for treatment couples as compared to control couples. A similar pattern was observed for couples' reported inti macy. These gains in marital adjustment and intimacy were also reflected in an objective assessment of the couples' communication pa tterns with treatment couples demonstrating a signifi- cant decrease in their negative interactions compared to control couples'. In addition, parents' psychological func- tioning improved after receiving the marital intervention: the proportion of depressed treatment parents decreased significantly at posttreatment and follow-up while proporti ons of depressed control couples slightly increased at both time periods. Results also indicated that after receiving the marital intervention, parenting stress decreased significantly for treatment parents as compared to controls. Moreover, the subgroup of parents who experienced co-occurring depression and marital distress at pretreatment moved from the clinical range into the non-clinical range in the degree of parenting stress th ey experienced in relation to their ill child. It is concluded that Emotionally Focused Therapy is an effective marital intervention for maritally distressed couples with chronically ill children, that not only impacts on marital functioning, but also on the parents' psychological functioning and the parent-child rela- tionship.

Living with a chronic illness such as multiple sclerosis (MS) has significant psychosocial ramifications. In particular, the patient's relationship with a spouse or significant other is often negatively affected. Programs are needed to address the psychosocial challenges of the illness and help improve outcomes for both the person with MS and his or her romantic support partner. Relationship Matters (RM) is a relationship enrichment program that integrates information and resources of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society with empirically based marriage education. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the RM program in increasing relationship satisfac- tion and aspects of health-related quality of life in couples living with MS over a 3-month follow-up period. Couples were given 8 hours of programming via in-person workshops disseminated across the country or teleconferences.

The results indicate that RM significantly improved relationship satisfaction over time compared with no inter- vention (P < .05). Additional findings include significant improvements in mental health-related quality of life as well as reported improvements in communication, conflict resolu tion, and ability to handle MS-specific relationship is- sues. Overall, these findings show that RM results in improved couple functioning and additional psychological health benefits for individuals with MS and their romantic support partners. Ma, L.-H., et al.

Objectives; To determine the effect of marriage therapy among married women with panic disorder. Methods: 53 women with panic disorder were randomized into study group and control group. A stressful events survey and rou- tine medication, together with cognitive therapy were carried out for six months in both groups. Couples in the study group received regular couples therapy additionally. The OLSON marriage quality questionnaire was carried out before and after treatment. Results: Among the study group, 89.2% suffered from marriage and family stress events one year before, and the rate was 92% in the control group. There was no significant difference in the scores of all factors between the two groups before treatment (P > 0. 05). The study group had higher scores than controls in marriage satisfaction (34.7 +/- 6.1/31.3 +/- 5.6, t = 2.19), communication between husband and wife (31.9 +/- 5.2/29.0 +/- 5.0, t = lems (33.2 +/- 4.4/30.1 (32.9 +/- 4.8/30.1 +/- 5.3, t = 2.02, all with P < 0.05).

Findings from this study suggest: (1) CECT results in favourable coping for men and their partners across all ages immediately postintervention. (2) Younger men and their partners appear to benefit most from CECT and show favourable psychological outcomes immediately post-intervention. (3) This cohort of men and their partners each responded differently to the cancer experience. (4) CECT did not affect marital functioning outcomes. RE- SEARCH IMPLICATIONS: Low uptake rates in this study su ggest further research is needed to develop creative approaches to enrol men in psychologic al interventions, and effectively capt ure psychological distress. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Younger men and their partners appear to be more susceptible to psychological distress, but, are also amenable to change in a structured psychological intervention delivered by mental-health specialists. CECT has clinical relevance for men and their partners requiring support, and may provide a useful manualised approach for therapists in the setting of PCa. Monson, C. M., et al.

This study examined whether participation in couples therapy, compared with individual therapy, had a differential effect on the day-to-day relationship between substance use and occurrences of intimate partner violence (IPV) among married or cohabiting substance-abusing men. Patients (N = 207) were randomly assigned to either part- ner-involved behavioral couples therapy (BCT; included non-substance-abusing conjoint ses- sions) or individual-based treatment (IBT; male partners only). Couples in BCT reported lower levels of IPV and substance use at a 12-month posttreatment follow-up compared with couples with male partners in IBT. Moreover, treatment assignment was a significant moderator of the day-to-day relationship between substance use and IPV. Likelihood of nonsevere and severe male-to-female partner violence on days of male partners' substance use was lower among couples who received BCT compared with IBT. These findings indicate couples therapy may play an important role in the treatment of IPV among substanc e-abusing couples.
