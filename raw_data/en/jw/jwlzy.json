Pharmacy Law Newsletter was created in 1993 by the late Robert M. Cooper, PharmD, a long-time UB faculty member and a member of the New York State Board of Pharmacy. It was his dream to bring current, concise and accurate information to practicing pharmacists. Dr. Cooper's vision was then carried on by Karl Fieblkorn, BS, RPh, MBA who served as the school's authority on pharmacy law for the next 25+ years, helping thousands of students pass the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination. He also worked diligently to keep practicing pharmacists updated through the Pharmacy Law Newsletter, contributing over 85 law updates during his tenure. After Fiebelkorn's retirement in 2023, Anthony Pattin, PharmD, will now continue the proud tradition of guiding New York State pharmacists and UB PharmD students through the intricacies of pharmacy law.

Erie County's [Public Health Protection Act of 2018](http://www2.erie.gov/legislature/sites/www2.erie.gov.legislature/files/uploads/Session_Folders/2018/Session15/LL%20Intro.%207-1_7-23-2018.pdf) designated a series of new rules that will increase protection of children against secondhand smoke, and expand the prohibition of smoking. The tenets of this Act include the following: - Smoking of tobacco products in motor vehicles when children are present will be prohibited. Knowing violation of this rule will result in fines of $50 for the first offense, $100 for the second offense, and $150 for the third offense. - Smoking in or near bus shelters will be prohibited, with knowing offenses punishable by fines of $50 for the first offense, $100 for the second offense, and $150 for the third offense. - The sale of tobacco products or e-cigarette products in healthcare institutions and pharmacies will be prohibited. A violation of this rule will result in a civic penalty of $300 to $1000 for the first offense, and $500 to $2000 for any additional violations. This local law takes effect immediately upon being filed with the New York State Secretary of Health. A grace period of 90 days will be in effect after the Act is signed into law, during which only warnings will be given and fines will not be imposed. Additionally, New York City amended Title 20, Chapter 2, \u00a7 20-201 of the Administrative Code of NYC, which may be accessed [here](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/New%20York/admin/newyorkcityadministrativecode?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:newyork_ny).

DEA Proposes Quotas on Controlled Substances for 2019 A final order was published in the Federal Register Volume 83, Number 248 on December 28, 2018 concerning the Drug Enforcement's Quota reduction for 2019. This final order establishes the initial 2019 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in schedules I and II of the Controlled Substances Act and the assessment of annual needs for the list I chemicals ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. Aggregate production quotas for Schedule I and II drugs and List 1 chemicals are determined for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs domestically, for lawful export requirements and for maintenance of reserve stocks. The DEA considers: - The total net disposal by all manufacturers during the current and two years preceding the year in question. - Trends in the national rate of disposal - Total actual, or estimated inventories of all substances or chemicals manufactured in the class and any inventory accumulations - Projected demand, which has dropped recently according to the DEA - Any other factors affecting the medical, scientific, research and industrial needs in the US and the lawful exports of the drug. The purpose of the quotas are to provide the uninterrupted supply for legitimate medical needs of Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances while limiting the amounts available to prevent diversion. Established quotas for 2019 may be found in this Federal Register, which may be located at [https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2018/fr1228.htm](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2018/fr1228.htm). Pharmacies Now Required to Provide Patients with Information about Controlled Substance Prescriptions As of October 22, 2016, pharmacies are now required to give information to the patient about any controlled substance prescription that is being dispensed. This information is provided by the NYS Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (NYS OASAS) and the NYS Department of Health Bureau of Controlled Substances (BNE) and must include the \"...dangers of misuse and the potential for addiction to prescription controlled substances, the physical and behavioral warning signs of addiction, treatment resources available and the proper way to dispose of unused prescription controlled substances...\" among other items. The pharmacy may provide additional information and resources for the safe disposal if so desired. Further, this information must be provided in languages other than English as deemed appropriate by the NYS Commissioner of Health (up to the 10 most common languages in NYS). Pharmacies may provide this information to the patient electronically if so requested by the patient.
