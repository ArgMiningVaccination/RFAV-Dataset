Acupuncture with natural herbal decoction and Enzyme rich detox drink along with our special nutritional supplement helps you to lose 10-15% of your total body weight, including fat after 2weeks! Proven protocols/results backed up by years of experience! What is Detox and Why do we need it? Today, we are more at risk than ever for toxic chemicals such as industrial chemicals, contaminated water, insecticides, food additives, heavy metals, drugs and environmental hormones. In addition, our erroneous eating culture and life style inhibits the effective excretion of external toxins as well as the serious condition of mass production of other toxins from the inside. The toxins generated in and out of the body fundamentally change the ecological environment in our body, and cause damage to the tissues and deterioration of the sensory function as well as cause various diseases. The detoxification process refers to a method of removing toxins from our body through natural remedies without medication or surgery to promote health. This method is a fundamental way to treat any illnesses, but it has more significance in preventing it by removing the cause of the disease before treatment. When detoxified, the body is born again with a clean body, balanced and full of physical, mental and sexual energy. Not only does this revive your creativity, but general appearance and character will also change. The advantages of detox are as follows ; 1. Wastes accumulated in your digestive system and bacterial yeast causing fermentation are cleaned. 2. Excessive mucus and congestion are removed. 3. Liver and Kidney's blood, which are difficult to improve with normal eating habits, are purified. 4. Your mind becomes clear. 5. Dependence on sugar, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, etc. is reduced. 6. By improving bad eating habits, the size of the stomach returns to normal and your weight is controlled. This helps you to lose fat too. 7. Your immune system is stimulated and enhanced. Importance of Enzymes It is no exaggeration to say that the human body is an enzyme mass. Of the hundreds of chemical factories in the human body, enzyme plants are the most abundant. In the mouth, an enzyme called ptialin is released through the saliva and decomposes the starch of the food into maltose. It is because of this maltose that it is sweet to chew rice. Protein enzymes, called pepsin, break down the meat proteins and trypsin, erepsin and lipase digest the fat and remaining proteins of the food to make them easy to absorb. Through these processes, digested and absorbed nutrients become members of energy sources and various cells. Therefore, the human body needs a lot of enzymes, and since most of us lack this enzyme, we have problems digesting and our waste cannot be removed efficiently. The reason why we lack so many enzymes is because the optimum condition of the enzyme is destroyed by the unbalance of the acidic foods in modern people's diet. Enzymes are produced in each organ through the digestion process of food. However, the enzymes are directly or indirectly reduced by pollution of air, water, soil, chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and instant food, so our physical strength is weakened. If this condition persists for a long time, the balance in the body breaks, and finally becomes the cause of various diseases. In addition, it is no exaggeration to say that our whole body is gradually dying in the reality that all kinds of agricultural products are cultivated without seasonal differences, treated with chemicals for quick cultivation and overuse of all kinds of pesticides. Six major physiological functions of enzymes are; 1. Digestive absorption. 2. Decomposition and discharge function. 3. Anti-bacterial effect. 4. Detoxification action. 5. Blood purification function 6. Cellular renewal function. Effects of enzymes are; Metabolism, promote sufficient growth for children, Anti-aging, Improvement of constitution, Proliferation of intestinal beneficial bacteria, reduce weight and control obesity, Lipolysis, Prevent various incurable diseases, Promote digestion, Purification, detoxification, Constipation, nephritis, cystitis prevention, Promotes nutrients and oxygen uptake, Anticancer effect and many more.
