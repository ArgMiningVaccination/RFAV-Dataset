INTRODUCTION During the last decade, there has been an explosion in the fabrication, characterization and applications of nanomaterials, which can potentially revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of diseases [1-4]. Knowledge at the cellular and molecular levels has increased greatly, catalyzing a shift towards using more specific and targeted nano-therapies. With the recognition of the important multi-faceted roles carbohydrates play in many biological systems [5-7], tremendous advances have been made in recruiting sugar- functionalized nanocomposites for biological applications. Glyco- nanomaterials have attracted a great deal of attention owing to their carbohydrate functionality, small sizes, polyvalency, biocompatibility, as well as beneficial optical, electronic and magnetic properties. In this review, we will summarize the development of glyco-nanotechnology and their applications in sensing, imaging and therapeutic interventions [8-10]. 2. THE \"GLYCO\" PERSPECTIVE Signal transduction and appropriate communication between two cells are critical for cell growth and development. The bio- conversation between two cells involves a ligand from the sender and a receptor on the cell surface receiving the signal. Due to their rich structural variations, carbohydrates are uniquely suited for biological information transfer [5,11,12]. As one of the common cell-surface ligands, carbohydrates can direct the initiation of many medicinally important physiological processes where they are involved in a wide variety of events [13-16], including inflammatory and immunological [22,23], and anticoagulation [24]. To realize the full potential of carbohydrates in diagnosis and therapeutic applications, several obstacles need to be overcome. The interaction between a single carbohydrate and its receptor is usually weak, typically with mM affinity. Nature solves this problem by simultaneously engaging multiple ligands for binding [25,26], leading to enhanced avidity through the mu ltivalency effect [27]. Thus, a suitable platform is required to display carbohydrates in a polyvalent format in order to improve the binding strength and selectivity. The second challenge is that unlike the lock-and-key type of specific molecular recognition common in antigen and antibody binding [28], there can be several types of *Address correspondence to this author at the Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA; receptors recognizing the same carbohydrate ligand. Strategies need to be developed to differentiate these receptors. The third challenge relates to the availability of pure car bohydrates for biological studies. It is difficult to purify large quantities of complex oligosaccharides from natural sources due to the heterogeneity of carbohydrates on cell surfaces and proteins. Although chemical and enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides and glyco-conjugates has undergone tremendous progress [29], it is still restricted to specialized laboratories. Therefore, the realization of full potential of carbohydrates in biomedical applications requires a multi-disciplinary approach bringing together glyco-biologists, materials chemists and synthetic chemists. 3. THE \"NANO\" PERSPECTIVE At the nanometer dimension, materials often have novel optical, electronic, structural and surface properties as a consequence of their small sizes. Nanomaterials have attracted wide attention where extensive efforts have been devoted to methodological studies toward their synthesis, surface modification and biological applications [30-33]. Advances in nanoresearch have led to the development of novel nanoparticles (NPs) where size, geometry and surface functionality can be controlled at the nanoscale [34,35]. Diverse metal and semiconductor core materials have been used to construct nanomaterials with important physical and electronic properties ranging from high optical extinctions (gold) [2], surface- enhanced Raman effect (silver and gold) [36,37], stable photoemission (quantum dots) [38], and super-paramagnetism (iron oxide) [39]. When coupled to affinity ligands such as antibodies [40], or peptides [41], oligonucleotides [42], or carbohydrates [43], nanomaterials are excellent vehicles for biological applications at the cellular and molecular level. However, several features need to be fine-tuned including ligand density, particle diameter, surface charges, magnetic, electronic or optical properties, stability, and targeting specificity. Nanomaterials can serve as promising platforms for displaying carbohydrates for biological recogn ition. Due to the smaller sizes of NPs compared to their micrometer sized counterparts, NPs have much larger surface areas, which can enable higher capacity in receptor binding. In addition, multiple carbohydrate ligands can be immobilized onto one NP, which can potentially enhance the weak affinities of individual ligands to their binding partners. There are reports of many types of NPs bearing carbohydrates. Herein, we will focus on NPs functionalized with carbohydrates that play key roles in the molecular recognition processes rather than those where carbohydrates mainly function as NP stabilizing agents [44-47]. Furthermore, we will concentrate on several types of nanomaterials, Glyco-Nanomaterials Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 2061 i.e., magnetic NP, gold NP, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and dendrimers. In the following, we will divide our discussions according to the NP core composition and discuss the applications of each type of glyco-nanomaterial. In addition, as magnetic glyco- NPs and gold glyco-NPs have been extensively explored, sessions regarding their synthesis and fabrications are included. 4. MAGNETIC GLYCO-NPs Magnetic NPs are a class of NPs possessing magnetic moments when placed in an external magnetic field. The most used type of magnetic NPs is the Fe 3O4 magnetite NPs. Some of the chief attributes of Fe 3O4 NPs are: a) biocompatibility: these NPs are well tolerated by human bodies, as exemplified by the FDA approval of the usage of a type of magnetite NP, i.e., Feridex for liver imaging [48]; b) magnetic properties: the magnetite particles are highly magnetic in an external magnetic field, which can enable magnet induced separation thus facilitating biological purifications [49]. In addition, controlling the synthetic aspects can yield to magnetic NPs that respond rapidly to an applied magnetic field, but retain no magnetism once the external field is removed. This so called superparamagnetic attribute is important for preventing NP aggregation and ensuring colloidal stability. With their high magnetic relaxivities, the magnetic NPs can be used as contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which are useful for non-invasive label free biological detection both in vitro [50-52] and in vivo [40,41,53,54] applications; c) functionality: innovative methods are available to functionalize the NPs with a variety of biologically important carriers for immunoassay [42], biosensing [55], bioseparation [56] as well as drug delivery [53]. In this session, we will provide a general discussion on the synthesis of magnetic glyco-NPs followed by their in vitro and in vivo applications. 4.1. Synthesis of Magnetic Glyco-NPs The magnetic NPs consist mainly of two parts: a) a magnetic Fe 3O4/Fe 2O3 core and b) a coating that functions to keep the metal oxides dispersed and colloidal through combined electrostatic and steric stabilization effects. Attention should be paid to the synthetic methods as they can significantly affect the size, shape, magnetic properties and hence the fate of nanocomposites in biomedical applications. Many chemical methods have been developed to synthesize such particles: co-precipitation, thermal decomposition, pyrolysis [30,32]. Herein, we will focus on two most extensively studied methods, i.e., co-precipitation and thermal decomposition. 4.1.1. Co-Precipitation Method The co-precipitation technique is probably the simplest chemical pathway to obtain magnetic NPs with a good control in size, shape and uniformity. Iron oxides, either Fe 3O4 or \u0001-Fe 2O3, are usually prepared via the Massart method [57] by aging appropriate stoichiometric ratios of Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts in an aqueous basic media in the presence of stabilizing molecules. The magnetic NPs produced through this procedure are spherical, and hydroph ilic. According to the therm odynamics of this reaction, complete precipitation of Fe 3O4 in the presence of a base should be expected at a pH ~8-14 with a stoichiometric ratio of (Fe3+/Fe2+ 2:1) under nitrogen. An increase of the mixing rate tends to decrease the particle size. A decrease of the size and polydispersity is also noted when the base is added to the salt mixture as compared to the opposite process. Moreover, the size is strongly dependent upon the acidity and the ionic strength of the precipitation medium. The higher the pH and ionic strength, the smaller the particle size and size distribution will be. In an alkaline medium of pH > 8, polarizing or highly charged ions, such as ammonium or alkaline may give rise to flocculation (the process by which NPs clump together). The addition of chelating organic anions (i.e. carboxylate ions such as acrylic acid) surface complexing polymers (e.g. dextran, polyglutamic acid (PGA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)) during the formation of magnetite can help control the distribution, size and stability of the NPs [35]. Magnetite NPs can also be stabilized with silica to form magnetic silica nanospheres with various functional groups such as amines and carboxylates on the surface [58-61]. The size of the particles can be controlled by changing the silica/iron oxide ratio [59]. Surface functionalization of magnetic NPs can not only protect and stabilize the core, but also improve biocompatibility and bestow targeting abilities [39,62]. 4.1.2. Thermal-Decomposition Method To improve the monodispersity and magnetic susceptibility of the magnetic NPs, high temperature thermal decomposition methods were developed. Heating a 1,2-hexadecanediol solution of iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac) 3) in the presence of oleic acid and oleylamine from 200 - 300\u00b0C led to the formation of Fe, Mn, etc.) were also synthesized in the form of Fig. (1). Synthesis of highly crystalline monodispersed nanocrystals via thermal decomposition of metal-oleate complex; TEM images of 9 nm iron oxide nanocrystals [66]. (Copyright Nature Publishing Group. Reproduced with permission). 2062 Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 El-Boubbou and Huang mono-dispersed cubic and spherical NPs by the seed-mediated growth process using Fe(acac) iron-oleic metal complex using iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5) in the presence of oleic acid at 100 \u00b0C [65]. This synthesis could be scaled up in an ultra-large-scale synthesis via thermal decomposition of metal-oleate precursors in high boiling solvent (benzyl ether) with high yield, uniformity, good crystallinity and reproducibi (Fig. 1) [66]. The high-temperature thermolysis produce with hydrophobic surfaces and hence only dispersible in nonpolar organic solvents. For biological applications, it is of great importance to find an effective approach to make them fully dispersible in aqueous media. One popular method is through \"ligand-exchange\" [67], where the hydrophobic ligands on the particle surface are replaced by molecules containing polar groups. Another method is to use amphiphilic [41] or tri-block polymers [38], ilic head gr oups. The hydrophobic groups anchor the polymer onto the surface of the nanocrystals, while the hydrophilic head groups render the coated nanocrystals freely soluble in aqueous media. 4.1.3. Immobilization of Carbohydrates onto Magnetic NPs In order to attach carbohydrates onto magnetic NPs, the most direct method is through in situ immobilization using carbohydrates as the stabilizing agent during formation of the NPs (Fig. 2a) [68,69]. For example, dextran has been used to directly coat magnetite as in Feridex preparation [69]. However, the in situ immobilization typically requires a large amount of carbohydrates and it is most effective for polysaccharide coating as chelation of mono- and oligo-saccharides to the NP surface may reduce the number of available functional groups for biological recognition. An alternative to the in situ immobilization procedure is the post-synthetic functionalization approach by attaching carbohydrates to pre-fabricated NPs (Fig. 2b). This can be accomplished by functionalizing magnetic nanospheres with amines, on which carbohydrates can be covalently linked [70,71] or chemoselective formation of amidines [43]. Carbohydrates can be attached using the highly selective [3+2] Huisgen cycloaddition reaction (Fig. 2c) [72-74]. It was reported the alkyne derivatized carbohydrate reacting with azide functionalized NPs gave better efficiency compared to that using alkynated NPs with azide bearing molecules [74]. In addition, the high affinity binding between strepavidin and biotin can be utilized by incubating biotinated carbohydrates with strepavidin coated NPs [75,76]. require covalent functionalization of carbohydrates with a reactive group prior to NP conjugation. A new approach to introduce unmodified carbohydrates is through photochemically initiated coupling NPs and carbohydrates (Fig. light activation, the NP surface azide moieties can be converted to highly reactive nitrenes, which insert into CH or NH bonds on carbohydrates allowing their covalent attachment without the need to derivatize the carbohydrates. 4.2. In Vitro Biological Applications of Magnetic Glyco-NPs 4.2.1. Lectin Interactions It is crucial that upon carbohydrate immobilization onto magnetic NPs, their biological recognitions are retained. We explored this using plant lectins, which are non-enzyme Fig. (2). Schematic demonstration of common methods for synthesis magnetic glyco-NPs. Fe3O4b) Synthesis Glyco-Nanomaterials Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 2063 carbohydrate binding proteins [72]. Upon incubation with a fluorescently labeled lectin, if the magnetic glyco-NPs (MGNPs) can bind with the lectin, subsequent application of an external magnetic field to the sample should remove the lectin from the solution leading to a reduction of fluorescent intensity of the supernatant. Concanavalin A (Con A) is a well characterized mannose (Man) selective lectin with weak galactose (Gal) binding functionalized MGNP with fluorescein isocyanate (FITC) labeled Con A followed by magnetic separation led to a 89% reduction in fluorescent intensity of the solution, while the same amount of the weakly bound Gal-MGNP was able to remove only 8% of the Con A (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the known carbohydrate binding preferences of Con A [78]. High concentration of free mannose (2500 times the amount of Man on the NPs) was required to partially disrupt the Con A/Man-MGNP complex. This suggests that the avidity of Man- MGNP to Con A was three orders of magnitude higher than the affinity of the monomeric mannose on per sugar basis, which highlight the advantage of multivalent appeal of MGNP with ligand clustering leading to strong binding.

Bacterium Detection As bacterium infections present a significant threat to public health, simple and rapid methods for pathogen detection and removal are urgently needed to quantify the risks of contamination and help reduce potential infections. Many pathogens initiate the infections through the binding of extracellular lectins with host cells glycocalyx [79,80]. The understanding of such adhesion phenomena, at both the cellular and molecular levels, presents a promising approach to fight against pathogens in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance [81]. The Gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli ) was commonly used as a model pathogen and it is known that E. coli strains such as ORN178 contain mannose binding protein FimH in their pili [82]. detect E. coli , we synthesized magnetite NPs functionalized with Man [73]. Our coli detection assay involved incubation of the functionalized Man-MGNPs with E. coli for a few minutes, followed by treatment with a hand-held magnet (Fig. 4 ). The magnetic nature of the NPs enabled rapid magnet mediated separation. With just five minute incubation, 65% of the E. coli ORN178 cells were removed from the solution with a capture efficiency up to 88% after 45 minute incubation. This assay was fast and simple with a detection limit of 10 4 cells/mL. A challenge in using carbohydrates for pathogen detection is that different types of bacteria may bind with the same carbohydrate albeit with various affinities. To address this issue, in addition to Man-MGNPs, we prepared MGNPs containing Gal on the surface. Based on the response patterns to Gal-MGNPs and Man-MGNPs, three different E. coli strains (ORN178, ORN208, and an environmental strain) were easily differentiated highlighting the potential of MGNPs in bio-sensing. Thus, MGNPs presented a unique approach, which can be used not only for rapid pathogen detection, but also for strain differentiation and efficient pathogen decontamination. Yan and coworkers prepared Man-functionalized iron oxide NPs photochemically activated phosphate perfluorophenyl- azides (PFPAs) coupling chemistry [77]. Although a potential concern of this method is the alteration of carbohydrate structures by the photochemical reactions, it was demonstrated that their Man- MGNPs retained the expected recognition by Con A. Upon incubation with the mannose binding E. coli strain ORN178, the NPs were selectively attached to E. coli as visualized by TEM (Fig. 5). Instead of using NPs, Iyer and coworkers immobilized biotinylated Man on magnetic microparticles to capture and detect E. coli through a luminescent assay [76]. Capture efficiencies of 20 - 35 % for E. coli ORN 178 were observed with these Man microparticles [76]. which was lower than those using MGNPs [73]. This is presumably due to the larger surface areas of MGNPs compared to their micrometer sized counterparts allowing more efficient magnetization of bacteria, which highlights the advantages of using NPs. In addition, this study provided a head to head comparison between synthetic glyco-conjugates and antibodies for E. coli detection. They observed that the glyco-beads were better than their antibody-counterparts in both sensitivity and selectivity, as only ~ 5 - 15 % capture efficiencies for E. coli ORN 178 were achieved using antibody beads. This is likely due to the smaller size of the glycoconjugate resulting in better packing density on E. coli and thus tighter binding. Although more examples are needed to demonstrate the generality of these observations, this study underscored the potential of using glycoconjugate-based high affinity reagents for biosensing. Fig. (4). Incubation of E. coli strain ORN178 and Man-MGNPs followed by magnet mediated separation detected the presence of bacteria with up to 88% of the bacteria removed by this procedure.

Pieters and coworkers detected the gram-positive pathogenic Streptococcus suis known to bind to galabiose (Gal- \u00011,4-Gal) using biotinylated sugars coated on streptavidin bearing magnetic particles [75] Through a luminescence assay that quantified the bacterial ATP, monovalent and tetravalent galabioside- functionalized particles yielded strong signals with a detection limit of 10 4 bacteria/mL, whereas N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) coated particles did not bind indicating the galabiose recognition specificity. Importantly, experiments with larger magnetic particles (diameter ~ 10 mm) did not enable successful bacterial detection, which provided additional evidence on the importance of large surface area resulting from the usage of glyco-NPs.

Cancer Cell Binding The Park group reported the fabrication of highly colloidal hyaluronic acid (HA), a naturally existing polysaccharide, coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals (~ 15.2 nm diameter) as target-specific MR imaging probes [83]. Cancer cells often express HA receptors such as CD44 [84]. Park and coworkers demonstrated that the uptake of the HA-NPs by human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells overexpressing CD44 was enhanced compared to the NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, which expressed little CD44. MR imaging revealed that upon HA-NP incubation, the contrast change of HCT116 cells was four fold that of NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 6). Incubation of free HA reduced the MR contrast of the HA-NP/HCT116 more than that from HA-NP/NIH3T3 cells supporting the role HA played in HCT116 cellular uptake of the NPs. The Mohapatra group described the synthesis of HA-Fe 2O3 hybrid nanocomposites (average diameters < 160 nm) via electrostatic interactions of oil-in- water HA nanoemulsion and Fe 2O3 NPs [85]. They these NPs were effective in delivering encapsulated atrial natriuretic peptides to the nuclei of human lung adenocarcinoma cell A549 and human kidney cell HEK293 over-expressing CD44. Nuclear targeting was also observed by our group in studying HA-NP interactions with macrophages [86]. The successful detection and differentiation of E. coli using MGNPs prompted us to explore the possibility of cancer detection [72]. The development of simple and effective nanoprobes to detect and profile cancer cells can have great potential impacts on cancer research. Thus, we prepared a small library of MGNPs functionalized with different monosaccharides (Man, Gal, fucose (Fuc), sialic acid (Sia) and GlcNAc) and embarked to systematically profile and quantify a variety of cancer cells via MRI. We examined nine different types of cancer cells together with one normal cell line and explored whether we could distinguish all these cell lines. Although mu ltiple cell types can bind the same carbohydrate, the differentiation of all ten cell lines was achieved through a statistic method, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [87], based on different response patterns ( \u0001T2 changes) of cells to the five types of MGNPs (Fig. 7). Through this approach, closely related isogenic tumor cells, cells with different metastatic potential and malignant vs normal cells were readily distinguished without prior knowledge on endogenous carbohydrate receptors. Moreover, MGNPs could significantly reduce the binding of tumor cells to the matrix, presenting a new method for anti- adhesive therapy studies of tumor. The ability to characterize and unlock the glyco-code of individual cell lines can thus facilitate both the understanding of the roles carbohydrates play in tumor development as well as the expansion of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for cancer detection via MRI. The LDA may be a general method to decipher the identities of cells/receptors where multiple types of cells/receptors can recognize the same carbohydrate ligand. 4.2.4. Stem Cell Monitoring Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown great potential in tissue engineering. It is important to be able to track stem cells non- invasively by MRI for investigating cell-tissue interactions and guiding the development of effective stem cell therapies [88,89]. In order to accomplish this, MRI contrast agents will need to be loaded into stem cells. Commercial magnetic NPs such as Feridex or Endorem especially (PLL) have been used for stem cell labeling [90,91]. However, due to the toxicity of transfection agents, it is desirable to explore other more biocompatible alternatives. Sykov\u00e1 et al . showed that mannose-modified iron oxide NPs (diameter ~ 60-70 nm) were efficient probes for labeling stem cells Fig. (6). T2 weighted MR images for CD44+ HCT116 cells and CD44- NIH3T3 cells upon incubation of HA-NPs.

They explored two procedures for NP fabrication, labeling with Man during or post NP synthesis. The NPs coated with Man post-synthetically were found to be more efficacious for cell labeling. These NPs crossed the cell membranes and were internalized well by rat bone marrow stromal (rMSCs) cells as visualized by Prussian blue staining and TEM. Compared with Endorem, lower concentrations of Man-NPs were needed and higher cellular uptake was achieved, which could be due to the presence of Man receptor on the cell surface. Fig. (7). LDA plot for the first three linear discriminants (LDs) of \u0001T2 patterns obtained with the MGNP array upon binding with 10 cell lines. Full differentiation of the 10 cell lines were achieved despite the simple structures of monosaccharide employed and the fact that different cell types can bind with the same carbohydrate [72]. (Copyright American Chemical Society. Reproduced with permission). In addition to Man, superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs have been coated with (carboxymethyl)-chitosan for MR imaging of stem cells [70]. These particles were internalized into human MSCs (hMSCs) through endocytosis. Cell viability assays indicated that these particles were biocompatible and did not affect osteogenic and adipogenic differentiations of the cells. The in vitro detection threshold of cells was estimated to be about 40 cells. Results from these studies indicated that the biocompatible carbohydrate coated NPs show promise for use with MRI in visualizing hMSCs. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate its applicability to in vivo stem cell tracking. 4.3. In Vivo Applications of Magnetic Glyco-NPs The Cho group prepared superparamagnetic MGNPs coated with a galactose polymer (Gal-SPIONs) (diameter ~ 25 nm) [92]. It is known that liver cell hepatocytes contain the galactoside binding asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) with galactose and galactosamine known to accumulate selectively in the liver via ASGP-R binding [93]. Confocal microscopy studies showed time- dependent uptake of these NPs into the cell membrane and cytosol of hepatocytes suggesting a receptor-mediated endocytosis [92]. Tail vein injection of these particles into rats exhibited a 75% T2 signal drop for rat liver by MRI, which was more than two times the contrast change (36%) observed using control NPs without any galactose (Fig. 8). In a separate study by the same group, NPs bearing mannan were fabricated [94]. The mannan not only protected the NPs from aggregating in physiological medium but also enhanced NP delivery to liver presumably through binding mannose receptor on liver macrophages for MRI. These results suggest the potential utility of MGNPs as liver-targeting MRI contrast agent. Davis and coworkers demonstrated the utility of glycan sialyl Lewis X (sLex) functionalized iron oxide coated-NP (sLex-NP) (average mean size ~ nm) to are important in recruiting leukocytes to sites of inflammation and are up-regulated on the activated brain endothelium in response to injury [95]. Specific visualization of the early-activated cerebral endothelium using magnetic NPs provides a new tool for the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of brain disease and evaluation of new therapies. To this end, selectin expression on activated endothelium in the brain was induced by microinjection of interleukin-1 \u0001 followed by the systematic injection of sLe x-NP (4 mg Fe/kg) in a rat model. Direct targeted detection of endothelial markers E/P selectin (CD62E/CD62P) in acute inflammation was achieved via MRI (Fig. 9). This raises exciting opportunities to use suitably designed glyco-NPs for early detection of neurological diseases. 5. GOLD GLYCO-NPs 5.1. Gold-NP Synthesis Gold (Au) nanocomposites, including nanospheres, nanorods, and nanoshells (size ~ 10 to 100 nm) have unique optical properties. Due to the strong plasmon resonance, absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by such nanocomposites are strongly enhanced [96]. The magnitudes of light scattering and absorption by gold nano-materials can be orders of magnitude higher than those from traditional fluorescence dyes [36,97]. The optical properties of the gold nanocomposites are highly dependent upon their diameter, shape and aspect ratio. By changing the aspect ratio as well as the structure of nanocomposites [2,36], the maximum extinction wavelength can be tuned from the visible to near-infrared region (NIR) (650-900 nm), where tissue absorption in NIR window is minimal. The unique optical properties coupled with their straightforward simple synthesis and exceptional stability have rendered Au-NPs well suited for applications in imaging, sensing, biology and medicine [36,37,98]. Fig. (8). T 2-weighted MR image ( a) preinjection and ( b) after 1-hour injection of Gal coated SPIONs; ( c) pre- and ( d) post-injection of control SPIONs without any carbohydrate coating. Significant signal drop (darkening) of liver was observed with the Gal-SPIONs compared to con trol NPs [92]. 2066 Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 El-Boubbou and Huang Although the synthesis of Au-NPs could be dated back to 1857 by Faraday [99], deeper insights into the fabrication of colloidal gold nanomaterials with controlled sizes, shapes and properties emerged only recently. Generally, reduction of metal salts such as auric acid (HAuCl 4) in aqueous media produces neutral Au atoms that gradually start to precipitate forming nanometer spherical particles upon vigorous stirring. Surfactants or chelating agents have been utilized as surface stabilizers and/or templates to control the synthesis. When bound to the NP surface, such molecules can not only decrease the surface energy and control the growth and shape of the particles, but also act as a stabilizer against aggregation. Here, the most commonly employed techniques for the fabrication of Au-NPs will be discussed. Detailed mechanistic insights and controlled-synthetic methodologies of gold nano- materials can be found in details in several excellent reviews [100-102]. A simple method to synthesize gold nanospheres involves the reduction of HAuCl 4 by citrate to produce spheres with a relatively broad size range (diameters ~ 10 to 150 nm) and low monodispersity (especially for > 30 nm particles) [103-105]. Another widely known approach is to transfer gold ions to an organic phase mediated by a phase transfer catalyst tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), followed by reduction with a strong reducing agent such as NaBH 4, which yield ~ 2-5 nm Au- NPs [106]. To prevent aggregation, a stronger binding agent, usually a thiol ligand, is added that strongly binds gold surface. To better control size of the NPs, a powerful methodology, known as seed-mediated growth, has been developed. Briefly, gold ions are reduced by strong reducing agents to form seeds, i.e. small particles that are then used in the next growth step [107]. In the second stage, the reducing agent is generally mild [108], reducing only the precursor ions which are adsorbed onto the seed surface without creating any new nucleation center. In order to fabricate gold glyco-NPs, three major approaches were developed. The most popular method involves the usage of thiol terminated carbohydrates as capping ligands during formation of Au-NPs [109-114]. This method is very convenient as carbohydrates can be readily functionalized with thiols usually at the reducing end. However, one drawback is the size of the particles obtained can vary significantly depending on the structure of the ligand as well as experimental conditions, which can be difficult to predict and control [115]. As an alternative, a post-synthetic ligand exchange procedure was developed [116-120]. Au-NPs were prepared first coated with a ligand such as CTAB, which would reproducibly generate Au-NPs with predicable sizes. The surface ligands on these NPs can then be exchanged with thiol terminated carbohydrates, leading to gold glyco-NPs. The third method involves in situ coating during formation of the NPs [121,122]. Carbohydrates bearing a free hemiacetal reducing end can function as mild reducing agents, reducing gold salt to form nanoparticles. The multiple hydroxyl groups in the carbohydrates can chelate with the gold surface providing a water soluble coating. 5.2. In Vitro Applications of Gold Glyco-NPs 5.2.1. Studying Carbohydrate-Carbohydrate Interactions Gold glyco-NPs have been successfully employed for studying carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions. Penad\u00e9s and coworkers did elegant work in this field where they prepared carbohydrate- functionalized Au-NPs to investigate carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions and carbohydrate-mediated cell-cell adhesion processes. In an early report, they demonstrated the use of either disaccharide lactose (Lacto-) or trisaccharide Lewis X Lex or lactose was functionalized with an alkylthiol at the reducing end, and the corresponding Au-NPs were prepared by reducing HAuCl 4 with NaBH 4 in presence of the glyco-thiols. Using TEM, it was revealed that only specific binding between Ca2+ and Lex-AuNPs result in self-aggregation, while Lacto-AuNPs did not show any clustering proving the importance of sugar structure in inducing aggregation. This phenomenon was also confirmed by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) study of adhesion forces between Le x antigens self-assembled on gold surfaces [123]. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of carb ohydrate-carbohydrate interactions were established by plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that Ca 2+-mediated aggregation of Lex-AuNPs was a slow but highly exothermic process, while the heat evolved in the case of Lacto-AuNPs was very low and its thermal equilibrium was quickly achieved. Measurements in the presence of Mg 2+ and Na+ cations did not induce significant aggregation of Lex-AuNPs confirming the requirement of Ca2+ for carbohydrate and carbohydrate interactions.

Glyco-Nanomaterials Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 2067 which carries polysaccharides with repeating disaccharide units of coworkers grafted the GlcNAc3S( \u00021-3)Fuc disaccharide as well as several structural analogs of the disaccharide on AuNPs. Microscopic studies revealed that the stereochemistry of the glycosyl linkage, hydrophobic groups on the sugar moiety, the linker type and the presence of Ca 2+ were crucial for carbohydrate-carbohydrate recognition. Interactions Lin and coworkers used SPR to quantitatively analyze the binding affinity of the polyvalent glyco-NPs (Man-, Glc-, or The dissociation constant K d of Man-Au NPs with Con A was determined to be 2.3 nM, representing a binding affinity over 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of the monomeric mannose. Furthermore, the change in avidity of different gold glyco-NPs with Con A followed the trend of their respective monovalent ligands. Therefore, this work quantitatively proved the high affinity and specificity of multivalent carbohydrate-protein interactions. Similar affinities were also observed by Liang et al . where K d values in the nM range were obtained [128]. Taking advantage of the high avidity between the lectin and gold glyco-NPs, Lin and coworkers reported the separation of carbohydrate binding proteins from protein mixtures aided by the gold glyco-NPs as affinity probes. Furthermore, using this approach, they determined the identity and the carbohydrate binding epitopes of the proteins by mass spectrometry analysis [112]. Russell, Field and coworkers demonstrated the utility of gold glyco-NPs to detect carbohydrate-binding lectins using colorimetric bioassays [120,129]. Au-NPs have unique surface plasmon absorption. When the particles are close to each other, their plasmon bands can become coupled, resulting in the red shift of absorbance and color change [101]. Upon incubation of gold glyco- with between carbohydrate ligands and lectins induced NP aggregation, which was easily observed through the broadening and the red shift of absorbance. Through this assay, the Man-AuNPs yielded a detection limit of 40 nM of Con A. Similar methods have been developed by the Sato group to detect and quantify Con A [130]. During tumor progression, the normal cellular carbohydrate collection is modified resulting in the exposure of \"non-self\" structures, which are referred to as tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) as exemplified by the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen. The disaccharide TF antigen (Gal \u00021-3GalNAc) is readily detectable in ~ 90% of all human carcinomas but rarely in normal tissues [131]. Immobilization of TACAs on a polyvalent NP template represents a new strategy to raise strong immune responses in vivo. To this end, Barchi and coworkers prepared water-soluble stable Au-NPs coated with derivatized The TF-AuNP caused aggregation of a TF specific antibody as well as the agglutination of a TF specific lectin, i.e., peanut the mannose specific lectin Pisum sativum agglutinin. This validated the functional nature of the TF antigen on the particles. However, the TF-AuNPs prepared were found to have high polydispersity with non-uniform size distribution, which was presumed to be the cause for inconsistent in vivo immunological results [115]. Lowering the TF ligand density afforded more uniform particles, although the immunological evaluations of the new particles have not been reported yet. OOH O AcHN OO OHOH HOOH HO TF studying NP-cell interactions, the Penad\u00e9s groups reported the preparation of gold and gold-iron NPs [132] (average core-size maltose (Malto), Glc and Lacto and evaluate their biological effects [109]. Different cellular responses were obtained for each glyco-NP type depending on the sugar, demonstrating the importance of carbohydrate in cellular-recognition. With a human fibroblast cell line, Lacto-NPs were shown to be taken up by endocytosis without provoking apoptosis while Malto-NP were endocytosed and promoted cell death (25% of the original cells surviving at NP concentrations higher than 15 M). Interestingly, Glc-NPs had a completely different behavior where it was not endocytosed and did not affect cell viability much. Furthermore, different changes in cytoskeleton organization of the cells were observed with the three types of glyco-NPs. Although the exact mechanisms of the differential behavior of the glyco-NPs were not clearly understood, these observations encouraged them to test the possibility of using Glc- or Lacto-NPs to image an experimental C6 glioma in mice in vivo which will be discussed later. Recently, the same group prepared a small library of multivalent Au-NPs functionalized with different structural fragments of the high mannose undecasaccharide of gp120 in various ligand densities and evaluated their effects on the inhibition of HIV glycoprotein gp120 binding to DC-SIGN expressing cells [133]. A major mechanism of HIV infection involved the interaction of gp120 with DC-SIGN expressed on dendritic high-mannose-type gp120 [134]. A highly significant inhib ition (~ 20,000-fold more effective in inhibiting DC-SIGN/gp120 AuNPs bearing short disaccharide Man \u00011-2Man (100% inhibition at 115 nM) than those with the corresponding monovalent disaccharide was observed (Fig. 10) [133]. Moreover, inhibition of gp120-DC-SIGN binding was evaluated in a model using DC-SIGN-transfected Raji B cells [135]. Oligomannoside-functionalized AuNPs were able to prevent the HIV DC-SIGN- mediated trans-infection of T cells at nM concentrations, while the AuNPs alone or the non-DC-SIGN binding Glc Au-NPs did not have a significant inhibitory effect on HIV infection. Therefore, they showed a successful carbohydrate-based mu ltivalent system that can function as an anti-adhesive barrier at an early stage of HIV-1 infection, prevent viral attachment to DC-SIGN-expressing cells, and subsequently inhibit trans-infection of human T lymphocytes. Besides DC-SIGN, gp120 can also interact with cell surface glycolipids such as galactosyl ceramide (GalCer). To inhibit this interaction, Gervay-Hague and coworkers prepared thiol terminated C-glycoside analogs of Gal and Glc and immobilized them onto AuNPs using the in situ reduction and coating procedure [113]. Through a competitive assay displacing recombinant gp120 from plate bound GalCer, they demonstrated that the multivalent Gal-2068 Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 El-Boubbou and Huang AuNPs were > 300 times more active than the control carbohydrate disulfides, thus suggesting this nanoplatform can potentially be useful for reducing HIV-1 adhesion to mammalian cells. 5.2.4. Pathogen and Toxin Detection Pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and other microbes) often use cell- surface carbohydrates to invade host organisms and to deliver toxins. Protein-sugar interactions between the pathogens and the host cells are crucial for the infectious process. Multivalent protein-carbohydrate interactions generate adhesive forces as an effective means of strengthening those binding events. This in turn can enable rapid and sensitive detection of pathogen and toxins using gold glyco-NPs without time-consuming procedures such as incubation or polymerization chain reaction amplification. At an early stage in this direction, Lin and coworkers demonstrated the specific binding of mannose-encapsulated gold NPs (Man AuNPs) to FimH adhesin in bacterial type 1 pili of E. coli by TEM [136]. This was one of the first examples that carbohydrate-functionalized AuNPs could be used as efficient labeling probes and multiligand carriers in a biological system (Fig. 11). Recently, they designed AuNPs (~ 4 - 20 nm) for Shiga-like toxin detection, separation and inhibition (Fig. 12) [119]. As E. coli O157:H7 is a chief cause of foodborne illness, the development of a rapid and sensitive detection method of Shiga toxins (Sts), which are produced by this strain of bacteria, is highly desirable. Sts are a family of AB 5 bacterial toxins, which specifically recognizes cell surface glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) through multivalent binding of the symmetric B-subunit pentamer. The Gb 3 glycolipid is known as the globotriose (Pk) blood group antigen or CD77, which contains the trisaccharide Gal \u00011-4Gal\u00021-4Glc. Lin and coworkers engineered globotriose-functionalized gold NPs (Pk- AuNP) with variable core sizes and linker length. They demonstrated that a 20 nm water-soluble Pk-AuNP was an antagonist for B-Slt and affinity enhancement over the monovalent Pk trisaccharide using SPR competition binding assay. Interestingly, linker length had a significant effect on binding affinity with longer linkers resulting in 5 to 75 fold affinity enhancement compared to shorter ones. This was attributed to the greater flexibility of the long linker, rendering it easier for the P k ligand to bind higher number of sites in the B-Slt pentamer. The core sizes of the NPs also significantly impacted the avidity with larger NPs (20 nm) showing stronger binding than the corresponding smaller NPs (4 nm). This was explained by the smaller surface curvature associated with larger NPs. When the AuNP surface became flatter, the ligands on the AuNP surface could interact with the B-Slt more easily. The high avidity between the GGNPs and Sts enabled the capture of the recombinant Shiga- like toxin I (B-Slt) from bacterial cell lysate with > 95% purity while maintaining its activity [119]. Russell and coworkers developed a simple colorimetric bioassay for the detection and quantification of cholera toxin (CT) within 10 minutes [137]. The bioassay is based on lactose- functionalized AuNPs that upon incubation with the toxin formed aggregates. This resulted in red-shift of the surface plasmon absorption band [101] and a solution color change from red to purple with a limit of detection of 54 nM of CT. The selectivity of the bioassay stems from the thiolated lactose derivative that mimics the GM 1 (Gal(\u00021-3)GalNAc[Neu5Ac( \u00012-3)]-(\u00021-4)Gal(\u00021-4)Glc- lipid) ganglioside, the receptor to which cholera toxin binds in the small intestine. In another example, the Perez group described a NP-based assay to assess bacterial growth by monitoring the plasmon absorbance band of dextran-coated Au-NPs [138]. Upon mixing Con A and dextran coated Au-NPs with the cell culture medium, extensive aggregates were formed resulting in large shifts of the surface plasmon band of the NPs. Under conditions of bacterial growth inhibition, the amounts of free carbohydrates in the medium were high, which competed with the dextran Au-NPs for Con A binding. This would result in blue shift of the maxima of Au-NP absorbance. The differential changes in the surface plasmon bands Fig. (10). The glyco Au-NPs can reduce the binding between DC-SIGN and gp120, which have a significant inhibitory effect on HIV infection to cells expressing DC-SIGN [133].

Glyco-Nanomaterials Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 2069 of dextran-coated Au-NP upon clustering were used as a quick indicator of the state of growth of bacteria, which was useful for evaluation of anti-microbial compounds. 5.2.5. Gene Transfection Gold Glyco-NPs have been studied as non-viral gene delivery agents. Au-NPs could be functionalized with cationic glycopolymers or simple monosaccharides such as Glc or Gal together with amine terminated PEG chains [139,140]. These particles were highly efficient DNA-binders, which condensed the plasmids into a compact globular shape. This led to comparable gene transfection efficiencies as the commercially available control Lipofectamine 2000, while bestowing much lower toxicity than Lipofectamine. The active targeting properties of carbohydrates [141,142] were not explored in these studies, which can further enhance the specificity of gene delivery and lower the systemic toxicities. 5.3. In Vivo Applications of Gold Glyco-NPs Building on the promising in vitro results, the in vivo applications of Gold Glyco-NPs have been explored both for detection and therapy. With the large surface area of Au-NPs, other moieties such as near IR optical probes and contrast agents can be immobilized onto gold glyco-NPs. Park and coworkers prepared multifunctional gold NPs functionalized for disease detection [143]. The gold NPs (~ 16 nm diameter) were coated with near IR fluorescence (NIRF) dye labeled hyaluronic acid (HA-AuNPs). Due to NP surface energy transfer (NSET) between the dye and AuNPs, the emission of the dye was quenched when it was attached on the surface of the NPs. It is known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyaluronidase (HAdase) can cleave HA, which should release the NIRF dye from the AuNP surface resulting in the recovery of emission. Indeed, treatment of HA-AuNPs with ROS (100 \u0001M) or HAdase (200 units/ml) led to more than 100 fold increases in NIRF Fig. (12). Schematic presentation of Pk-AuNPs for detection, separation inhibition of toxin [119]. (Copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Reproduced with permission). Fig. (13). a) In vivo fluorescence images upon intravenous injection of HA-AuNPs (10 pmol) in normal and tumor-bearing nude mice (becoming red color indicates higher NIRF intensity at 671 nm); b) Fluorescence images of 6 different organs obtained from tumor-bearing nude mice after 48 h post-injection of HA-AuNPs. c) Quantification of NIRF intensity in the corresponding organs [143]. (Copyright Elsevier. Reproduced with permissio n.) 2070 Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 El-Boubbou and Huang signals. This was corroborated in cellular studies as incubation of HA-AuNPs with activated macrophages and HAdase secreting cancer cells produced multiple folds of fluorescence intensity enhancement. Furthermore, the authors performed in vivo evaluations of these NPs in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and tumor (Fig. 13). Local inflammation and tumor sites were clearly identified by whole body imaging upon systemic application of the HA-AuNPs. Ex vivo examination of the tissues revealed that large amounts of the HA-AuNPs were found to be accumulated in tumor sites (Fig. 13b ,c). These results highlight the potential of using glyco-NPs for molecular imaging and disease detections. The Penad\u0003 s group developed sugar-coated AuNPs combined with Gd(III) chelates as new paramagnetic probes MRI [144]. These NPs had small diameters (2-4 nm) and their carbohydrate- coating rendered them non-toxic to cells and mice. It was shown that sugar stereochemistry (Glc, Gal or Lacto) and the relative position of the sugar with respect to the Gd ion affected the relaxivity values of these AuNPs presumably due to the differential interactions with water by the carbohydrate ligands. In vivo imaging of glioma in the mouse brain indicated that at the same Gd(III) concentration, Glc-AuNPs gave the best contrast in the tumoral zones compared with Lacto-AuNPs or the commercially available contrast agent, Magnevist. Besides imaging applications, the Penad \u0003s group reported the utilization of Lacto-AuNPs as potent inhibitors of tumor metastasis in mice and evaluated their potential as anti-adhesive tools against metastasis progression [145]. The mouse melanoma B16F10 cells are known to bind with lactose presumably due to the presence of cell surface lectins such as galectins. Pre-incubation of the B16F10 cells with the Lacto-AuNPs prior to injections into mice substantially inhibited the lung metastasis of the tumor (up to 70%), while the corresponding Glc-AuNPs did not have any effects (Fig. 14). Fig. (14). The incubation of Lacto-AuNPs with mouse melanoma B16F10 cells prior to intravenous inoculation in C57/Bl6 mice significantly reduced the lung metastasis of the tumor. In comparison, the Glc-AuNPs were ineffective in reducing metastasis [145]. (Copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Reproduced with permission). Mousa and coworkers reported the synthesis of heparin coated AuNPs (HP-AuNPs) [121]. Heparin is a class of naturally occurring polysaccharides, which can inhibit basic fibroblast growth factor-2 induced angiogenesis [146]. The HP-AuNPs were found to have significantly higher anti-angiogenesis efficacy compared with the corresponding Glc-AuNPs. In a mouse model, the HP-AuNPs demonstrated high anti-angiogenesis efficacy without much toxicity, while the free Au was lethal to the animals at the same concentration. 6. GLYCO-QUANTUM DOTS Quantum dots (QDs) are nanosized fluorescent semiconductors. Compared with organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, QDs have unique optical and electronic properties: i.e., broad absorption spectra, size-tunable emission maximum, high quantum yield, and resistance against photobleaching [38,147]. Coupled with the ability for multivalent display of ligands, these characteristics render carbohydrate immobilized QDs well suited for a variety of biological applications [45,148-156]. 6.1. In Vitro Applications QDs protected with polysaccharides were reported in 2003 by the Rosenzweig group [45]. They prepared CdSe-ZnS QDs coated with carboxymethyldextran and polylysine through electrostatic interactions, and demonstrated that glucose binding protein such as Con A had high affinities with the glyco-QDs. The incubation of the dextran coated QDs with Con A led to the formation of large bright and photostable aggregates allowing lectin detection using a conventional fluorescence microscope. Along the same line, Sun, Chaikof and coworkers reported the site-specific labeling of streptavidin-QDs with glycopolymers terminated with biotin, which retained the specific recognition by lectins [156]. In addition, the Surolia group coated CdSe-ZnS QDs with thiol terminated carbohydrates and such glyco-QDs for selective detection of lectins [151]. Barchi readily observed upon addition of TF-specific (mAb) or galactoside binding lectin peanut agglutinin but not with the control QD containing no carbohydrates confirming the functional integrity of the antigen on the surface of the QD [152]. Multivalent glyco-QDs could serve as a platform to display carbohydrates for anti-cancer vaccine development. QDs can be used to detect the presence of lectins on cells. Fang and coworkers prepared CdSe-ZnS QDs in the presence of thiol terminated GlcNAc or Man through an in situ reduction and coating procedure and incubated these glyco-NPs with live sperms from mice, pigs and sea-urchin [155]. Interestingly, GlcNAc- encapsulated QDs were found to be concentrated at the sea-urchin sperm heads, while Man-coated QDs tended to spread over the whole body of mouse sperm (Fig. 15). This was presumably due to the different distribution of the GlcNAc and Man receptors on the sperm surface. This work suggested that glyco-QDs can function as useful fluorescent tags for monitoring cellular events. Field, Russell and colleagues also used the in situ reduction and coating procedure to fabricate Man coated QDs [157]. They demonstrated that these Man-QDs induced luminescent aggregates of FimH containing E. coli strain ORN 178, which led to the detection of E. coli with a detection limit of 10 4 cells/mL. The Aoyama group reported the synthesis of 15 nm QD conjugated with calyx-[4]resorcarene functionalized sugars to of endocytosis [158]. The usage of QD allowed them to quantify the cellular uptake of the glyco-QDs and monitor their intracellular distribution. It was shown that these QD- conjugated sugar balls were taken up by Hela cells via endocytosis. The uptake efficiency was higher than the micellar homoaggregate of the amphiphile (5 nm) but lower than the virus-like conjugate bearing the same carbohydrates (50 nm). Coupled with prior results that aggregates larger than 100 nm were not uptaken effectively, this study suggested 50 nm being the optimal size for endocytosis and it was important to control the size of glyco-nanocomposite for the design of artificial delivery vehicles. Besides lectin and cellular binding studies, glyco-QDs were used in an innovative approach to detect glycosylation states of proteins. As carbohydrates attached on glycoproteins can play Lungs from animals treated with B16F10 tumor cells No B16F10 GlcAuNP (90 M) LactoAuNP (90 M)No NP treatment Glyco-Nanomaterials Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 2071 essential roles in determining glycoprotein functions, a simple assay to determine protein glycosylation is desirable. Kim and coworkers prepared dextran coated QDs and Con A immobilized Au-NPs [153]. The binding of Con A with dextran led to quenching of the fluorescence emission of QDs by the Au-NPs due to energy transfer. Addition of glycosylated proteins would compete with dextran-QD for Con A-AuNP binding, resulting in recovery of fluorescence. This allowed rapid and simple detection of degree of protein glycosylation, which was adapted for high throughput analysis of glycoproteins. 6.2. In Vivo Detection Kim and coworkers reported the of water-soluble hyaluronic acid-coated QDs (HA-QDs) (~ 50-120 nm ration QD/HA) where HA was immobilized electrostatically on positively charged QDs [ 149]. HA-QDs were able to be selectively endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE-1) over-expressing lymphatic cells (LEC) and cells, but by LYVE-1 negative human dermal fibroblasts. In contrast, QDs without HA coating were uptaken regardless of cell types. The HA coating reduced the cytotoxicity of the NPs compared with uncoated QDs as determined through cell viability and apoptosis assays. This enabled fluorescence imaging of lymphatic vessels (lymph-angiogenesis) in live mice for more than one day (Fig. 16) [149]. The binding between LYVE-1 and HA- QDs in mice was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, where LYVE-1 and HA-QDs were found to colocalize in mouse tissues. Besides lymphatic vessel imaging, HA-QDs were used to image liver in cirrhotic mice [159]. Through cellular assays, it was shown that HA-DQs were uptaken more by the cells causing chronic liver diseases such as hepatic stellate cells (HSC-T6) and hepatoma cells (HepG2) (FL83B). Upon administration of HA-QDs to cirrhotic mice, their livers showed greatly enhanced fluorescence. The clearance of the fluorescence from the cirrhotic mouse liver was much slower than that from the normal mice, allowing detection of cirrhotic liver. Instead of using HA to target liver, the Seeberger group reported the synthesis of carbohydrate (Man, Gal, GalN)-capped PEGylated QDs (~ 15 - 20 nm) to study in vivo liver imaging [148]. They demonstrated that Gal- and GalN-capped QDs were selectively uptaken by hepatocellular carcinoma cells via the ASGP-R receptor, a galactoside binding asialoglycoprotein expressed predominantly on hepatocytes. The uptake was partially inhibited by pre-incubation with poly- L-lysine galactose polymer or by the knockdown ASGP-R1 internalization , Man- and GalN-capped QDs accumulated selectively in the liver suggesting the presence of Man and ASGP-R receptors on Kupffer and hepatic cells respectively. It is worth mentioning that the same group r ecently presented an efficient synthesis of carbohydrate-functionalized QDs in micro flow reactors at 160 \u00b0C [160]. Fig. (16). Upon subcutaneous injection of HA-QDs into mouse ears, fluorescence imaging clearly showed the presence of lymphatic vessels, while they were not visible in transmission images. Images were taken 30 minutes and 1 day after injection [149]. (Copyright American Chemical Society. Reproduced with permission). 7.

Carbohydrates immobilized on the SWNT retained their specific biological recognition as proven by lectin binding. Furthermore, the cytotoxicities of the SWNTs were much reduced with the carbohydrate coating [161]. The Sun group reported that SWNT could serve as an excellent scaffold for multivalent carbohydrate ligand display [164]. The Gal- SWNTs exhibited strong cell adhesion resulting in efficient capturing of pathogenic E. coli O157: H7 strain in solution [165]. Moreover, they demonstrated that Man or Gal-functionalized SWNTs bound effectively to B. anthracis spores in the presence of a divalent cation [166,167]. This binding resulted in substantial aggregation of the spores and subsequent removal of the spores, which may potentially find applications in the pathogen decontamination and anti-bioterrorism. 8. GLYCO-DENDRIMERS Dendrimers are a class of \"smart\" branched monodispersed functional macromolecules with highly ordered symmetrical architecture [168,169]. They consist of a central core, branching units and terminal functional groups. The core dictates the environment of the nanocavities, whereas the external groups determine their solubility and biochemical behavior. When the external groups are modified with saccharides, glyco-dendrimers are produced [170]. Compared with other glyco-nanocomposites, an important feature of glyco-dendrimers is that they have much less polydispersity, which gives better control of surface ligand density and an overall better defined molecular architecture. This is important for quantitative understanding of the binding. Over the past two decades, many examples of glyco-dendrimers have been reported [170,171]. The major applications of glyco-dendrimers are to enhance the carbohydrate-receptor binding through the mu ltivalent effect. In the following, we will discuss the main biological applications of glyco-dendrimers. 8.1. Probing Carbohydrate-Lectin Binding and Carbohydrate- Carbohydrate Interactions In an early example of lectin binding, Roy and coworkers prepared mannodendrimers based on the scaffolding of multiantennary branches of L-lysine residues and tested for the inhibition of yeast mannan binding to Con A and assays [172]. The on per monomer basis in inhibitory potency compared to the corresponding monomeric ligand highlighting the power of multivalency. This phenomenon was corroborated by studies of a variety of other lectins Pisum sativum functionalized Man, Glc and Gal or mixtures of these carbohydrates in varying ratios, and studied the effects of carbohydrate loading on lectin binding (Fig. 17) [181-184]. They discovered that the amount of sugar on the dendrimer surface had a significant impact on avidity. G(4)- to G(6)-PAMAM dendrimers with 50% Man incorporation showed the highest activity in hemagglutination assays with Con A, while higher Man density actually led to a decrease in lectin binding due to unfavorable steric crowding [183]. Furthermore, they demonstrated that in optimized systems, the binding avidity can be predicted and it is tunable using a mixture of low- and high-affinity ligands. Instead of studying carbohydrate - protein binding, the Basu group employed the PAMAM dendrimers to examine carbohydrate - carbohydrate interactions. They demonstrated that lactosyl dendrimers engaged in binding with GM3 immobilized in a Langmuir monolayer [185]. This carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction requires the presence of calcium ion and was dependent on the density of both the carbohydrate on the dendrimer as well as the glycolipid within the monolayer. 8.2. The Interactions between Glyco-Dendrimers and Pathogens Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most widespread inflammatory diseases caused by uropathogens, predominately E. coli, where the bacteria attach to the urinary tract epithelial surface through fimbriael adhesion molecules [186,187]. There are three types of fimbriae: type 1 pili terminated with FimH (Man-specific), long P fimbriae covered (galabiose (GlcNAc-specific) [188]. Oligomannoside-based adhesions are most prevalent studied type of carbohydrate-specific bacterial adhesion ligands. E. coli adheres to the epithelium using type 1 fimbriae exposing a mannose-binding FimH adhesion at the tip. Inhibition of type 1 pili mediated bacterial attachment using sugar mimetics is thus a promising approach to treat UTIs. As the FimH crystal structures were available [189,190], structural based ligand design became possible to greatly improve the affinity and specificity of FimH ligands. Various Man-containing oligosaccharides [191] and aromatic antagonize type 1 fimbriae mediated bacterial adhesion were identified. Aromatic \u0001-mannosides were shown to be 500-1000 times more inhibitory than methyl \u0001 -mannoside for the adhesion of type 1 fimbriated E. coli . [192]. This is due to the presence of a hydrophobic region next to the monosaccharide-binding site of the fimbriae as recently demonstrated in the X-ray structures [189,190]. It has been shown that \u0001- D-Man based inhibitors of FimH not only Fig. (17). Schematic cartoon showing the multivalent binding of lectin Con A with G(3) to G(6) PAMAM glycodendrimers [ 183]. (Copyright American Chemical Society. Reproduced with permission.) Glyco-Nanomaterials Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 2073 blocked bacterial adhesion on uroepithelial cells but also antagonized invasion. Heptyl- D-mannose prevented the binding of type 1-piliated E. coli to the human bladder cell line 5637 and reduced both adhesion and invasion of the UTI89 cystitis isolate instilled in mouse bladder [189]. While monovalent hydrophobic \u0007- D-mannoside binds in the \u0003M range, a marked increase could be achieved using multivalent presentation of aryl mannoside epitopes. Roy and coworkers reported good inhibitory potencies of a series mannose bearing glyco-dendrimers towards the glycoprotein binding of a type 1 fimbriated E. coli K12 strain [193]. The fourth generation of the \u0001 linked aromatic mannosyl dendrimer exhibited impressive sub-nanomolar inhibition (IC 50 = 0.9 nM, 14.4 nM/Man). Building on this success, the Roy group prepared mannosylated first generation glycodendrimers using pentaerythritol and bis pentaerythritol scaffolds assembled via Sonogashira and click chemistry [178]. SPR showed that the mannosylated tetramer possessing an aryl moiety in the vicinity of the anomeric oxygen was the best ligand known to date toward E. coli K12 FimH with subnanomolar affinities (K d = 0.45 nm, 1.4 nM per Man residue). These clusters were about 5000 times more potent than monovalent Man for their capacity to inhibit the binding of E. coli to erythrocytes in vitro . This represents potential therapeutic applications for the inhibition of adhesion of E. coli toward urothelial infections. The Pieters group reported the inhib ition of P-fimbriated E. coli PapG J96 by an octavalent galabiose derivative an IC 50 of 2 \u0003M [194]. PapG J96 is the most specific PapG adhesin binding to the terminal galabiose structure. In their studies, it was found that the monovalent (IC 50 = 85 \u0003 M), divalent (IC 50 = 30 \u0003 M), tetravalent (IC 50 = 11 \u0003 M) and PAMAM-8 dendrimer (IC 50 = 14 \u0003 M) were less potent than the octavalent construct (IC 50 = 2 \u0003 M), while free mannose caused no inhibition even at 10 mM concentration. Besides studying the Gram negative E. coli , Pieters and coworkers reported hemagglutination G(1)-PAMAM dendrimer had a minimal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 = 0.3 nM with a 256- fold improvement over the monovalent galabioside [196]. These results are consistent with the report by Magnusson and coworkers that di- to tetravalent dendritic galabiosides were several hundred times more efficient than the monomeric galabiosides in inhibiting hemagglutination by S. suis , resulting in complete abolishment of bacterial adhesion with low nanomolar concentrations of glyco-dendrimers [197]. The anti-adhesive potency could be further improved by introducing aromatic subs tituents in the polyvalent construct. In addition to binding FimH, mannosylated dendrimers can also bind with other biologically significant lectins, such as DC-SIGN. As discussed earlier, DC-SIGN is involved in infection of pathogens such as HIV-1. The Rojo group investigated the inhibition of DC-SIGN mediated Ebola virus infection by mannosyl dendrimers [198,199]. They discovered that a dendrimer bearing 32 mannosyl units was able to directly inhibit DC-SIGN mediated Ebola viral entry into Jurkat cells at nanomolar concentrations (IC 50 ~ 337 nM). In addition, the binding of the glyco-dendrimer with DC-SIGN significantly reduced the binding and transfer of virus to other cells. 8.3. The Interactions between Glyco-Dendrimers and Antibodies/Immunological Cells Glycodendrimers have been investigated for their interactions with antibodies. To facilitate the development of anti-tumor treatment, Roy, Rittenhouse-Olsen and coworkers prepared glycodendrimers containing the TACA TF disaccharide and studied their interactions with tumor binding mAbs [200]. They found that two tetravalent constructs had IC 50 values around 18 nM towards inhibiting mAb binding, which represented over 100 folds increase in inhibition over the monomer. Hexavalent dendrimers actually showed lower binding presumably due to unfavorable orientations of the carbohydrate ligands in the hexamer. TF is involved in tumor metastasis to liver by binding tumor cells to the lectin asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes in the liver. With the strong binding of TACA tetramers, the cancer cell mimetics TACA dendrimers could be used as potential anti-adhesion therapy to block tumor metastasis. Another interesting application of the glycodendrimers was in anti- \u0001Gal antibody studies [201,202]. \u0001Gal (Gal \u00011-3Gal\u00021- 4GlcNAc) is an antigen expressed on the cells of non-human mammals. Humans have natural anti- \u0001Gal IgM antibodies, which causes hyperacute rejection of pig organs thus hampering primate xenotransplantation. Thus, removing anti- \u0001Gal antibodies represents a novel avenue to facilitate xenotransplantation. The Thoma group synthesized glycodendrimers containing the \u0001Gal trisaccharide epitopes, which spontaneously self assembled in water to form NPs. The third generation \u0001Gal dendrimer showed an impressive of \u0001Gal mediated lysis of pig erythrocytes. Furthermore, in vivo evaluation in monkeys showed that anti- \u0001Gal IgM concentration was significantly reduced upon administration of the \u0001Gal dendrimer and anti- \u0001Gal IgM mediated haemolytic activity was completely eliminated. Shaunak and coworkers prepared two types of PAMAM glycodendrimers, one bearing glucosamine (GlcN) and the other glucosamine (6-O GlcN) [203]. They discovered that the GlcN dendrimers was capable of inhibiting lipopolysaccharide mediated activation of dendritic cells and macrophages, while neither the dendrimers core or monomeric GlcN had any effect. This is probably due to receptor crosslinking by the dendritic GlcN structures. In addition, the 6-O GlcN glycodendrimers blocked endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Administration of these two glyco-dendrimers together in a rabbit model led to an impressive reduction of scar tissue formation following glaucoma filtration surgery, which was critical for the long term success of the surgery. Bezou\u0005ka, Kr\u0006n and coworkers investigated the effects of glycodendrimers on natural killer cells, an important class of immunological cells with major roles in rejection of tumors and virally infected cells. Aminosugars such as GlcNAc and N-acetyl mannosamine are known to have a high affinity for the natural killer cell protein-1A (NKR-P1A) protein, the major activating O O OOO O OOOHO HO HOOH O HO 2011 Vol. 18, No. 14 El-Boubbou and Huang receptor on the surface of natural killer cells. GlcNAc-containing glycodendrimers displayed strong in vitro affinity (IC 50 ~ 10-9 M) for NKR-P1A [204-206]. Administration of these compounds in vivo resulted in a substantial increase in the antitumour activity with the activation of the natural killer cells [207]. Furthermore, the glycodendrimers induced up-regulation of antibody formation due to NK cell stimulation [208]. 9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK In this review, we have discussed the applications of a variety of glyco-nanocomposites including magnetic NPs, gold NPs, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and dendrimers. It is clear that the avidity between carbohydrates and receptors can be greatly enhanced through mu ltivalent display of carbohydrates on nanomaterials. By combining the multi-faceted biological functions of carbohydrates with unique properties of nanomaterials, significant advancements have been achieved during the past decade in this field. This includes better understanding of carbohydrate-carbohydrate, carbohydrate-protein interactions, better and faster method for pathogen detection and decontamination, tumor inhibition, as well as promising in vivo molecular and cellular imaging applications. To fully realize the potential of glyco-nanotechnology especially for future clinical applications, better fundamental knowledge of how NPs interact with biological systems is required. Parameters such as size, shape, surface charge, ligand type, and ligand density should be optimized to achieve desired biological functions. Furthermore, bio- distribution, clearance and long term side effec t/toxicity of glyco- nanocomposites need to be established. With the importance of carbohydrates in human physiology and pathology firmly established, there are great potential for functionalized glyco-nanoprobes to play significant roles in biomedical applications for many years to come. A taste of sugar has already been around us, but we have just started to explore. As Dr. Richard Feynman famously proclaimed 50 years ago, \"there's plenty of room at the bottom\".
