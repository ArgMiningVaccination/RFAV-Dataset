these effects are less likely to occur with synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses; dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary; all corticosteroids increase calcium excretion Literature reports suggest apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after recent myocardial infarction; therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment; adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal; may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage; relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, reinstitute hormone therapy; if patient is receiving steroids already, may increase dosage Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients; changes in thyroid status of patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage May exacerbate systemic fungal infections; not for use in presence of such infections unless needed to control life-threatening drug reactions Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, active amebiasis before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea Use with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation; corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia; not for use in cerebral malaria Close observation necessary if corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity; reactivation of the disease may occur; during prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis Use of oral corticosteroids not recommended in treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to increase in risk of new episodes; corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex Use lowest possible dose to control condition under treatment; risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used May lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and development of osteoporosis at any age; special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations; existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may also be aggravated by corticosteroids Minimal mineralocorticoid activity Thromboembolic disorders Myopathy has been reported Delayed wound healing Withdraw therapy with gradual tapering dose May have systemic and local effects; examine joint fluid, as necessary to exclude a septic process; avoid injection into infected site; frequent intra-articular injections may result in damage to joint tissue If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated; if exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immune globulin (IG) may be indicated; if chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered Latent tuberculosis may be reactivated (patients with positive tuberculin test should be monitored) Some suggestion (not fully substantiated) of slightly increased cleft palate risk if corticosteroids are used in pregnancy Prolonged corticosteroid use may result in elevated intraocular pressure, glaucoma, or cataracts with possible damage to optic nerves, and may enhance establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses; consider referral to ophthalmologist for patients who develop ocular symptoms or use corticosteroid-containing products for more than 6 weeks Prolonged therapy has been associated with development of Kaposi sarcoma May affect velocity growth in children;
