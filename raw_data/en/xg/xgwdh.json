According to Victora CG (2016), feeding breast milk can decrease the cases or severity of infectious diseases and child mortality. Breast milk contains various antimicrobial materials, anti -inflammation components, and factors which support the development of immune system and reduce the cases of respiratory tract infec tions. Almost one third of the cases of respiratory tract infections can be tackled by feeding of breast milk. The risk of baby mortality among non breastfed baby is 14 times higher compared to exclusive breastfed baby. Pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) established by WHO on March 11th 2020 has still been continuing, and until now more than 27 million cases has been spread all over the world. The infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus -2 (SARS -CoV -2) infects all age groups, e.g pregnant women and neonatus. The information about the impact of COVID - 19 infections on pregnant women and neonatus are still limited. Based on the case study, neonatus infected by SARS -CoV -2 showed mild clinical manifestati ons or asymptomatic; the total number of severe cases , complications and good prognosis were relatively rare to happen. The risks of neonatal infections through vertical transmission from mother -baby or breast milk can not be concluded and need further re search. According to the purpose of this program is becoming a center of the research and development of technology in breast milk, therefore this international webinar with theme The 1St International Conference on Indonesia Lactation Management (ICLM) in Covid -19 Pandemic Era will be held.

Meanwhile, according to data from the Indonesian Child Profile in East Kalimantan Province in 20 18, 1,159 children married under the age of 19 (Indonesian Child Profile, 2018). According to data from the 2018 National Basic Health Research in Indonesia, 65.7 percent of children aged 0-23 months have not/never been breastfed. Meanwhile, according to d ata from the 2018 East Kalimantan Basic Health Research, 77.9 percent of children aged 0-23 months have not/never been breastfed (National Basic Health Research, 2018). The purpose of the study was to explain the analysis of the effect of providing health education on exclusive breastfeeding with video media, booklets and leaflets on knowledge of adolescents who marry early. The research design used was a meta -analysis with a pre -post contrast meta -analysis research design. Statistical data analysis was car ried out computerized by using the metamar program to analyze the Raw (unstandardized) mean difference test data on effect size and Standardized mean difference on the effect size. The results of the meta - analysis of research articles on the effect of providing health education on exclusive breastfeeding with video media on adolescent knowledge obtained a p- value of 0.0000 (< 0.005), the effect of providing health education on exclusive breastfeeding with booklet media on adolescent knowledge obtained a p -value of 0.00013 (< 0.005), the effect of providing health education regarding exclusive breastfeeding with leaflet media on adolescent knowledge obtained a p -value of 0.0000 (< 0.005) which means th at there is a significant influence between video, booklet and leaflet media with the knowledge of adolescents who are married early. Keywords : Exclusive Breastfeeding, Teenagers, Early Marriage, Health Education Media, Knowledge, Videos, Booklets, Leaflet s. INTRODUCTION Law Number 1 of 1974 Article 7 concerning Marriage states that marriage is only permitted if the man reaches the age of 19 years and the woman has reached The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 2 the age of 16 years. Law Number 16 of 2019 Article 7 concerning Marriage is only permitted if t he man and woman have reached the age of 19 years. Based on the UNICEF report, Indonesia is a country with the seventh highest child marriage rate in the world, namely 457.6 thousand women aged 20 -24 years who married before the age of fifteen (Profile of Indonesian Children, 2018). According to data from the 2018 National Basic Health Research in Indonesia, 4.1 percent of those aged 10 -14 years have been pregnant and married and 63.2 percent are pregnant and married at the age of 15 -19 years (National Basi c Health Research, 2018). Meanwhile, according to data from the Indonesian Child Profile in East Kalimantan Province in 2018, 1,159 children married under the age of 19 (Indonesian Child Profile, 2018). According to the 2018 National Basic Health Research data in Indonesia, 65.7 percent of children aged 0 -23 months have not/never been breastfed. Meanwhile, according to data from the 2018 East Kalimantan Basic Health Research, 77.9 percent of children aged 0 -23 months have not/never been breastfed (National Basic Health Research, 2018). According to Hotchkiss et al. (2016) risk factors associated with the incidence of early marriage include place of residence (urban or rural), religion, economic status, education level, age at first marriage and tolerance for domestic violence. The results of the meta -analysis of Windiarti and Besral (2018) based on an analysis of collected journals, it was found that the determinants of early marriage in Indonesia are unwanted pregnancy, peer influence, parental roles, educat ion level, knowledge of reproductive health, family economic status, Culture, Media Exposure, Temporary Rural Residence, Region, Shows the Geographical Role of Religion, Ethnicity and Others. The results of the meta -analysis research conducted by UNICEF in 2011 the determinants of child marriage in Indonesia are also influenced by three aspects. The three aspects are the condition of the individual, household, and community. According to UNICEF, there is a positive correlation between child marriage and int ernet use via mobile phones, the age of the head of the household and the number of children in the family who are in primary school. The results showed that adolescents who have knowledge that The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 3 women can experience pregnancy when having sexual intercourse 0.9 times can prevent them from having premarital sex. Someone who knows that women can experience pregnancy during sexual intercourse can make the decision not to engage in premarital sexual be havior (Fitrianingsih et al, 2015). According to Wendiranti et al (2017) risk factors for the failure of exclusive breastfeeding include breastfeeding mothers who are not supported by their husbands to do exclusive breastfeeding. have a greater risk of exp eriencing exclusive breastfeeding failure, and breastfeeding mothers who receive incorrect information from health workers are at 8.06 times greater risk of experiencing exclusive breastfeeding failure. Knowledge can be increased by providing health educat ion. Health education is a process of changing a dynamic behavior, the change is not just a process of transferring material or theory from one person to another and is not a set of procedures, but changes occur because there is awareness from within the individual, group and society itself (Mubarak et al. 2007). Health education requires media to maximize the information received by the recipient of the information. Media is something that has the nature of channeling messages and can stimulate the thought s, feelings and abilities of the audience so as to encourage the learning process in him. The use of creative media allows the audience to learn better and can improve their performance in accordance with the goals to be achieved (Mubarak et al, 2007). The results of research by Fadhillah et al (2020) show that several variables in maternal characteristics have a relationship with mother's knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and intentions. Furthermore, the researchers searched for research articles on the effect of health education media (videos, booklets and leaflets) on knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding in adolescents who married early and found that 62.24% (89 research articles) sta ted that health education media could change knowledge of early marriage. adolescents while 37.76% (54 research articles) stated that health education media could not increase the knowledge of adolescent early marriage. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 4 From the background above, it is found that there is a gap that there is still research that says there is no effect of providing health education with the video, booklet and leaflet methods on adolescent knowledge and it is not yet known significantly what health education m ethod is used to increase adolescent knowledge so that researchers intend to find out educational methods. What kind of health is good to use as a medium to provide health education to adolescents by conducting a systematic meta -analysis review from variou s journals and research articles related to meta -analysis. METHOD The type of research used is meta -analysis. Meta -analysis is research conducted by researchers by summarizing research data, reviewing and analyzing research data from several previous res earch results. The form of a pre -post comparative research design is to compare the central tendency (mean or proportion) of the variable measured at one time with the central tendency of the same variable measured at another time. Statistical data analysi s was carried out computerized by using the Meta -Mar program to perform data analysis with the Raw (unstandardized) mean difference test on effect size and Standardized mean difference on the effect size. With these very different measures, they produce different numerical values that are only meaningful in relation to the particular operationalization and scale used. Research data collection was carried out by researchers by browsing articles contained in online journals using Google Scholar, Garuda Portal and PubMed. From a search using ten keywords, \"exclusive breastfeeding\" OR \"early ooklet media and exclusive breastfeeding\" OR \"leaflet media and exclusive breastfeeding\" obtained 147 articles, then screening of articles that met the inclusion criteria was carried out. The process of screening articles in this study uses the flow protoc ols diagram of systematic reviews and meta -analyses (PRISMA -2015) obtained 25 articles that fit into the criteria. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 5 RESULTS Based on the screening with the PRISMA diagram, several articles were obtained and then the articles that met the criteria were selected, namely as many as 25 research articles.

DISCUSSION The Effect of Providing Health Education on Exclusive Breastfeeding with Video Media on Knowledge of Adolescents who Married at an Early Age The results of the meta -analysis of research articles on the effect of providing health education regarding exclusive breastfeeding with video media on changes in knowledge in adolescents who marry at an early age obtained a p -value of 0.0000 (< 0.005) which means that there is a significant effect between video media and adolescent knowledge. Before discussing the cause s of video media can change adolescent knowledge, it is necessary to know what is meant by knowledge. Knowledge is the result of \"knowing\" and this occurs after people have sensed a certain object. In the sensing process to produce knowledge, it is strongl y influenced by the intensity of attention and perception of the object. Knowledge itself is influenced by several factors, including age, education, occupation, social and culture. Knowledge is also very closely related to education where it is hoped that with higher education the person will have more extensive knowledge (Larassati & Rumintang, 2018). Adolescents who choose to marry at an early age have low knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding. The lack of knowledge of adolescents is caused by the fact that information has not been conveyed effectively. The effectiveness of delivering information is influenced by the use of media. In learning, media is needed that can help increase attention and learning atmosphere. Teenagers will not feel bored and the message will be conveyed optimally when using interesting media. Media helps the educational process so that it can be captured by the five senses. The more senses used, the clearer the knowledge obtained (Putri et al, 2019). The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 8 Media can be visual or audio visual. One of the audio visual media is motion picture. A number of studies have proven that audiovisual media can help teaching. Video media uses the senses of sight and hearing. Teenagers will understand better because they not only know through lectures but also through moving pictures (Putri et al, 2019). Video media is media that has sound and image elements. This type has a better ability, because it includes both types of auditory (hearing) and visual (seeing) media. Motion picture m edia is an audiovisual aid which means materials or tools used in learning situations to help written and spoken words transmit knowledge, attitudes, and ideas (Budiman, 2017). Videos can attract attention, improve motor skills, observe phenomena directly, analyze interactions, issues, and problem solving, can be displayed repeatedly, form attitudes, develop appreciation (Putri et al, 2019). The advantage of using video media in learning activities is not only as a tool, but also as a carrier of information or messages to be conveyed. The use of videos about Exclusive Breastfeeding can clarify the abstract description of the importance of Excl usive Breastfeeding for children of teenagers who marry at an early age, because in the process of giving it, respondents not only hear the material being delivered, but also see directly and clearly about the negative impact of not giving exclusive breast feeding. The benefits of using video media are according to the concept of learning according to the pyramid of experience written by Edgar dale, that people learn more than 50% of what they have seen and heard (Aeni & Yuhandini, 2018). According to the re sults of research from Lestari & Sundayani (2018), it was found that the p -value = 0.000 or <0.05, it was stated that there was an effect of counseling with or without video media on adolescent knowledge. Similar research results were obtained from Kusuma & Indarjo (2017), the results of statistical tests showed that there was a difference in the level of knowledge before and after the screening of the Mancur film, the p -value = 0.000, which means <0.05. That is, there is a significant difference between kn owledge before and after the screening of the Mancur film. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 9 Video media is very often used in various community service activities, according to research results by Rohmawati, Hidayah and Marwan (2020) it was found that 60 of 68 participants experienced an increase in knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding due to health education using video media. Information media and various factors influence knowledge and changes in adolescent life behavior which then affect their reproductive health beh avior (Masrizal et al., 2019). As a result of the limited research articles on video health education media, there has been no long -term evaluation of the benefits of the health education media. The Effect of Providing Health Education on Exclusive Breast feeding with Media Booklets on Knowledge in Teenagers who Married at an Early Age The results of the meta -analysis of research articles on the effect of providing health education regarding exclusive breastfeeding with booklet media on changes in the knowl edge of adolescents who marry at an early age obtained a p -value of 0.00013 (< 0.005) which means that there is a significant effect between booklet media and adolescent knowledge. Booklets or pocket books are useful media for conveying health messages in sheet form, both in writing and in pictures (Murtiyarini et al, 2020). Health education using booklet media is expected to increase knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding in adolescents who marry at an early age. The advantage of providing health educatio n with booklet media has advantages because it is a small book that can be carried everywhere so that it can be read anywhere (Murtiyarini et al, 2020). According to the results of research from Samaria in 2016, p -value = 0.002 or <0.05, it was stated that there was an effect of counseling with booklet media on adolescent knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding. The results of a similar study from Murtiyarini in 2020 obtained a p -value = 0.000 or <0.05, it was stated that there was an effect of counseling w ith booklet media on adolescent knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding. The limited research that mentions the lack of booklet media makes it difficult to compare the results of the study. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 10 The Effect of Providing Health Education on Exclusive Breastfeeding with Leaflet Media on Knowledge of Early Married Adolescents The results of the meta -analysis of research articles on the effect of providing health education regarding exclusive breastfee ding with leaflet media on increasing the knowledge of adolescents who marry at an early age obtained a p - value of 0.0000 (< 0.005) which means that there is a significant effect between leaflet media and adolescent knowledge. The Leaflet method basically has an effectiveness in increasing knowledge, this is because the treatment is a method of health education and both are one -way methods, namely health education and both are active, while the target is passive (Dewi et al, 2017). The advantage of leaflet media as a source of reproductive health information for adolescents is that leaflet media is easy to access, but it needs to be observed because not all easily accessible information has the best quality (Dewi et al, 2017). Leaflet media is effective in increasing adolescent knowledge and attitudes about health at SMA Surakarta showing an increase in the average value of knowledge and attitudes of adolescents from before being given counseling treatment with leaflet media compared to after being given cou nseling treatment with leaflet media (Afridayanti, 2020). According to the results of research from Dewi (2017), it was found that the p - value = 0.000 or <0.05, it was stated that there was an effect of counseling with leaflet media on adolescent knowledg e about exclusive breastfeeding. The results of a similar study from Elba & Wijyaya in 2019 obtained a p -value = 0.000 or <0.05, it was stated that there was an effect of counseling with leaflet media on adolescent knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding. A person's level of knowledge will affect his psychosocial maturity and thinking ability. The higher the level of knowledge, the easier it is to think rationally, describe and address problems, and make decisions (Elba & Wijaya, 2019). The presence of vari ous kinds of health education media for adolescents is The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 11 expected to increase adolescent knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding. The limited research that mentions the lack of leaflet media makes it difficult to compare the results of the st udy for further improvement. CONCLUSION The conclusion from the research results is that there is a significant effect between video media, booklets, and leaflets with adolescent knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding, with each p -value of 0.0000 for the video variable, 0.00013 for the booklet variable, and 0.0000 for the leaflet variable.

Research shows that up to 3 million people can be saved from maternal and infant mortality each year through the coverage of high -quality care provided during pregnancy, delivery and newborn care and when experiencing illness with additional surgical costs (WHO.2017). WHO and UNICEF have launched a Network to Improve the Quality of Health Care for Mothers, Infants and Children in order to reduce disease and prevent maternal and infant mortality, as well as to improve problems experienced by mothers during care through the quality of care provided by health workers, also the experience experienced by patients while being treated. (WHO. 2017). Addressing the quali ty of care that has not been felt by every mother and baby will be the basis for reducing maternal and newborn mortality in order to achieve the SDG targets related to health. The period around delivery is most important to save the maximum number of mater nal lives and prevent infant mortality. WHO has outlined a global vision in which every pregnant woman and newborn receives quality care in the mother's period during pregnancy, into labor through to termination and the postnatal period for mother and new borns through Universal Health Coverage and Quality by 2030 (WHO. 2016). Studies show that family and community support are important factors for successful breastfeeding. Many mothers benefit from breastfeeding and early initiation of breastfeeding is imp ortant. Mothers from rural areas found low knowledge about the importance of breastfeeding their babies, they tended to get less family support for breastfeeding. Without family support, it can be obtained that the implementation of early breastfeeding ini tiation in rural areas will be lower (Joshi SK, Barakoti B, Lamsal S. 2012) Education and sources of knowledge have a significant effect on breastfeeding practices. But there was a significant difference in the practice of giving the first feeding in diffe rent educational groups, the group with higher education was breastfeeding as the first choice, while the other group gave prelacteal food. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 16 Mothers have received breastfeeding guidelines from health workers and mothers with higher levels of education indicate better breastfeeding knowledge and practices (Roshan R, Sajjad S, Tanvir S. 2018) In the Chinese cultural and occupational environment, it was found that mothers with higher education levels were less likely to breastfeed their babies, compared to mothers with lower levels of education (Zhao. J, Zhao Y, Du M, Binns CW & Lee AH. (2017). If the number of women starting to breastfeed between women increases, it is carried out below and varies in ethnicity can be together with health professionals and non -health professional -led counseling and peer intervention support. But if it is done by each of them will get low -quality breastfeeding educat ion (Balogun OO, et all. 2016) Knowledge of maternal and newborn health is felt to be very important for pregnant women and their families, so that mothers and their families can obtain information about ongoing pregnancy, danger signs during pregnancy, pr eparation for delivery, early breastfeeding after birth, schedule for examination of pregnant women, postpartum, as well as immunization and infant care until the child reaches the age of 2 years (SIJARIEMAS, 2017) The 2016 Indonesian Health Profile descri bes the coverage of TTS of pregnant women 65.28%. service coverage for pregnant women K4 85.3%, coverage for delivery in health care facilities 80.61%, coverage for newborns carried out by IMD 51.9%, coverage for postpartum visits KF3 84.41%, Mortality rat e for infants and toddlers in 2015 22.23% and 26.2%,.(Indonesian Health Profile, 2017). This national condition needs attention from health services which in some aspects have shown improvement but still need to increase the knowledge and curiosity of both young women and couples of childbearing age in improving their reproductive health. Data and Information on the Indonesian Health Profile in 2016 the estimated number of fertile ages 15 -49 for East Kalimantan is 78,486, estimated pregnant women are 82,224 , estimated maternity is 78,486 people, while the estimated number of live births is 74,749, estimates for 0 years are 70,749. This data shows the need for comprehensive care. for both mother and newborn, the period after The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 17 the baby is born early initiation of breastfeeding is paramount to save maximum life and prevent stillbirth ((Ministry of Health Data and Information Center, 2017). The results of the 2016 study using the Ante Natal Risk Questionnaire (ANQR) were effective in helping early detection of postpartum depression in primiparous, multiparous and grande multiparous pregnant women. effectively used in early detection of pregnant women who can experience postpartum depression so that they can provide early breastfeed ing after giving birth (Sipasulta & Nurhayati, 2016). The psychosocial condition of pregnant women is influenced by the mother's condition during adolescence, so it requires attention for health service providers. Through maternal health education to prepa re adolescents and couples of childbearing age in their reproductive health. Reproductive health problems Riskesdas in 2013, married women aged 10 -54 years, 2.6 percent married for the first time at the age of less than 15 years and 23.9 percent married at the age of 15 -19 years. The pregnancy rate between 10 -54 years old is 2.68 percent, there are 0.02% pregnancies less than 15 years old even though it is very small and teenage pregnancies aged 15 -19 years are 1.97 percent. If a young pregnancy under 20 ye ars is still found, it will affect the process of early breastfeeding and the success of exclusive breastfeeding does not reach the target. Efforts made by the Balikpapan City Health Office to reduce maternal mortality from data on 9 maternal deaths, in ad dition to infant mortality from 78 cases and Toddler 6 cases through the issuance of KIBLA Regulation Number 9 of 2015, strengthening the use of MCH books, implementing maternal perinatal audits, as well as improve coordination of maternal perinatal progra ms in the East Kalimantan region by forming a maternal perinatal team in Balikpapan, as well as strengthening the human resources of the PONED Health Center, increasing partnerships and improving the recording and reporting system (Balikpapan City Health O ffice, 2015). In the first few days after giving birth, the mother produces a small amount of yellowish milk called colostrum. It is rich in nutrients and provides all the calories The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 18 your baby needs for the first few days. Many women worry th at their baby is not getting enough milk soon after delivery, when small amounts of colostrum are said to be normal. This is because babies are born with excess fluid and sugar stores so that they can be used when there is not much milk supply. If you continue to breastfeed, more milk will be produced within three to five days. Babies will lose weight the first few days of life but gradually two weeks after delivery they will regain their weight. Pregnant women often do not carry out or implement correctly what health workers say. Maternal health education is not carried out because the mother does not understand, or does not meet the needs during antenatal visits. The cause of the occurrence of pregnant women not understanding can be due to one -way communic ation by health workers and besides that the mother does not get enough support from her husband and family to apply the information obtained. explanation of pregnancy, childbirth and early initiation of breastfeeding (IMD), postpartum, newborn care, excl usive breastfeeding, family planning and immunization of infants. (Ministry of Health RI. 2013: WHO, 2009). I am interested in the implementation of maternal health education in the city of Balikpapan which has been achieved through classes for pregnant wo men and explanations of the MCH book during antenatal visits by health workers, but husband and family support is still needed in order to achieve the IMD target for early newborn breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding. also the red line, malnutrition in infants and toddlers can be resolved, after that the results of this study will be presented to become a data base for the city of Balikpapan; Therefore, my research is \"The Effect Of maternal health education on family support in the process of breastf eeding a newborn babies\" The purpose of implementing maternal health education for family support in the early process of breastfeeding a newborn babies in Balikpapan City The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 19 METHOD The research design used a cross sectional study, this study studied the dynamics of the correlation between risk factors and their effects, by means of an observation approach or data collection at once (point time approach), where the types of research s ubjects were only observed. Once between variables, including the effect of maternal health education on family support in the early process of breastfeeding a newborn, were observed simultaneously at the same time (Notoatmodjo, 2012). Researchers made obs ervations on maternal health education from health workers obtained by postpartum mothers during ANC visits during the first to third trimesters of pregnancy with family support in the process of breastfeeding newborns. At Sayang Ibu Hospital, Balikpapan. Hipotesa , There is no effect of maternal health education on family support in the early process of breastfeeding a newborn. The independent variable in this study was Maternal Health Education. The dependent variable is family support in the early breast feeding process. The population in this study were all postpartum mothers who gave birth at the Maternity Hospital Sayang Ibu in Balikpapan City during September to October 2018. The sample of this study was taken based on the Consecutive sample, which was done by selecting all postpartum mothers and newborns who met and met the criteria, until the desired number of samples was reached (Dharma, 2011). Inclusion criteria as a sample include postpartum mothers who give birth normally or with surgery, are will ing to be respondents, can speak Indonesian well, can read and write. Exclusion criteria for post partum mothers who have problems with Consciousness. The sampling technique that will be used in this study is non -probability example. Non -probability sampli ng is a sampling technique that does not give equal opportunity/opportunity for each element or member of the population to be selected be sample (Sugiyono,2007). The number of research samples was The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 20 determined based on the formula for propor tion data with an infinite population (unknown), with the following calculations: So the estimated proportion in 1 month is 60 samples. Research Place. This research was conducted at the Maternity Hospital Sayang Ibu in Balikpapan City. Research Time This research was conducted in the period September to October 2018. Analysis Test the normality of the data. Data analysis was carried out descriptively and analytically. Descriptive, The analysis uses a frequency distribution to calculate the frequency or number and percentage of aspects being measured. Analysis of Relationships Between Variables, Chi Square test bivariate. The analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between maternal health education and the support of husband and family in early breastfeeding for newborns in Balikpapan City using the chi square test because the study used data categories, namely ordinal and nominal. RESULT AND DISCUSSION Result Based on the results of research conducted on 60 respondents of postpartum mothers and newborns to see the process of breastfeeding in newborns through independent variables, health education given to mothers during pregnancy includes care during pregnancy , preparation for delivery, danger signs of labor and newborns until postpartum period, also look at the factors of husband and family support.

There were 7 (21.9%) postpartum mothers who did not receive assistance from health workers but received early breast feeding support. Discussion The results of the influence of maternal health education on family support in the process of breastfeeding newborn mothers did not feel the assistance of health workers as many as 32 mothers 53.3%. and postpartum mothers who did not receive early breastfeeding support as many as 38 mothers, 63.3%. The supporting data for postpartum mothers do not feel the assistance of health workers to 32 mothers. Most of them do not take advantage of Maternal and Child Health services at the Puskesmas, there are 3 mothers who have checked themselves 2 to 3 times at the Puskesmas but because there is no Ultra Sono Grafi examination to determine the condition of the fetus then they move around to check for pregnancy to the hospital or doctor's practice. Results of pregnant women do not take classes for pregnant women and classes for babies. By providing training and counseling about breastfeeding. Yurtsal & Kocoglu 2018 stated that mothers from the prenatal period to the end of the month after t he first postpartum, would increase 50.4 times higher exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months postpartum, from mothers who were not given training only 26.3%. mothers, increased when they were given training and counseling on breastfeeding UNICEF and WHO recommend following exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, starting within one hour of birth. Continuing to exclusively breastfeed without other foods for the first six months enhances sensory and cognitive development, and protects infants from infectious and chronic diseases (Selim. 2018). The attention for pregnant women is especially important when husbands provide a wide space for their future children and how to enlarge, nurture them, and the process of giving milk after birth into the world. So that the wife will not feel alone as a parent. Knowing that her husband is always present The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 23 and will provide full support for herself and those in the womb causes the wife to feel safe (Herlinda. 2016) Regular and successfu l breastfeeding is very important for the baby's health, mothers with higher education tend not to exclusively breastfeed their babies, mothers with higher education and also from high households support early breastfeeding when the baby is born. So if you are going to give breast milk, you should be able to consider issues related to the mother's level of education (Tang. K. et all. 2019). We found as many as 13 (46.4%) postpartum mothers who felt the assistance of health workers but did not receive initia l support for breastfeeding. There were 7 (21.9%) postpartum mothers who did not receive assistance from health workers but received early breastfeeding support. Mothers cannot be expected to do it themselves. Early and exclusive breastfeeding after the baby is born, because mothers need help due to fatigue after going through the delivery process. Normal postpartum mothers and cesarean sections need to be supporte d by hospitals and maternity centers, health workers, government and families so that the initial breastfeeding process is successful, supporting breastfeeding starting from the first hour after giving birth through early initiation of breastfeeding. Giving mothers all the support they need to start breastfeeding within the first hour after delivery has tremendous health benefits. But we can't stop there. Mothers should have the freedom to continue breastfeeding for as long as they choose. It is our co llective responsibility to remove the barriers in our society that make breastfeeding so difficult Of the 60 postpartum mothers, 13 mothers gave birth through cesarean section, this situation is one of the reasons why some mothers are unable to breastfeed before starting the breastfeeding process. Shrimpton. 2017 in his comments Mothers giving birth by cesarean section usually face many challenges after delivery, such as managing the effects of anesthesia, recovering from surgery, and seeking help to safel y carry the baby. However, with the right support from husbands and families who can initiate early initiation of The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 24 breastfeeding, implement breastfeeding policies in maternal wards, and involve fathers in breastfeeding, most newborns born by Caesarean section can be breastfed within the first hour. Breastfeeding education includes mother's knowledge about breastfeeding, the decision to breastfeed the baby, or initiation of breastfeeding is more effective than breastfeeding support provided to mothers including support for breastfeeding and professional and family support regarding the duration of breastfeeding (Chan Man Yi & Heung Sin Man. 2011). Direct skin -to-skin contact helps regulate the body temperature of newborns and exposes them to be neficial bacteria from their mother's skin. These good bacteria protect babies from infectious diseases and help build their immune system. Skin -to-skin contact immediately after birth until the end of the first feeding also has many other benefits. It has been shown to increase the chances of a baby being breastfed, prolong the duration of breastfeeding, and also increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding. There is no conclusive evidence supporting antenatal breastfeeding education to increase initiation of breastfeeding, the proportion of women who provide breastfeeding or exclusive breastfeeding at three or six months or duration of breastfeeding. It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of antenatal BF education, especially in low - and middle -income countries. Evidence supports antenatal breastfeeding education relevant to high -income settings (Lumbiganon. et all. 2016) Make sure the period of pregnancy is not only borne by the wife unilaterally, but also involves the full role of the husband. Husbands must also monitor the condition of their pregnant wives, there must be healthy communication between partners. and keep his wife happy and relaxed. Couples should often discuss about their prospective baby and all the preparations inc luding discussing the initial process of breastfeeding a baby who is about to be born. (Herlinda. 2016) It was found that 25 (78.1%) postpartum mothers who did not receive the support of their husbands and families also did not receive good medical educati on during their pregnancy visits because some of them worked 8 hours in The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 25 the morning so they did not check at the Puskesmas but went to a practicing doctor. So that they cannot go to the Puskesmas to obtain maternal health education, both fo r pregnant women and for babies. Some of the reasons that postpartum mothers do not carry out the initial process of breastfeeding are babies born with premature rupture of the membranes and some with meconium amniotic fluid causing 1 baby to be treated as an infant warmer, so that the baby is born not placed on the mother's stomach for the beginning of the breastfeeding process. Giving mothers all the support they need to start breastfeeding within the first hour after delivery has tremendous health benefi ts. But we can't stop there. Mothers should have the freedom to continue breastfeeding for as long as they choose. it is our collective responsibility to remove barriers in our society so that helping mothers face when breastfeeding becomes very difficult (Selim. 2018). The mother should hold the baby on her chest with skin -to-skin contact immediately after birth. But it may still take twenty minutes before the baby begins to suckle spontaneously, and most should start feeding within an hour (Shrimpton, 201 7). Early initiation of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of death, initiation of breastfeeding after the first 24 hours of life is associated with an 85% increased risk of neonatal death compared with infants who initiate breastfeeding withi n 24 hours of birth (Smith et all. 2017). All postpartum mothers already have a MCH Handbook which is a material for maternal health education when pregnant women come to check their pregnancy from trimester one to three. so that all pregnant women have re ad and understood the contents of the open MCH, but it was found that during the observation of postpartum mothers, it turned out that not all of the 60 mothers had read and understood the contents. There are some husbands who just found out the contents o f the MCH book, when they explain what the metrics of maternal health education should be known to the mother since pregnancy, the husband and family are expected to read and know which discusses the danger signs for postpartum mothers, so that if the moth er is in a suitable condition then immediately taken for help. There are still 16 postpartum mothers with anemia Hb between 8.1 and 10.5 g/dl, besides that there are 5 mothers whose Hb exceeds The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 26 normal, besides that some babies cannot bond wi th their mothers because their leukocytes are not high, this condition needs husband's support and family so that the initial breastfeeding process can be smooth and colostro can be obtained properly Poor practices in maternity hospitals can interfere with early initiation of breastfeeding with negative consequences in exclusive breastfeeding during the first month and increase the risk of neonatal death. Initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour of bi rth ends with a reduced risk of neonatal death. Neonates who started breastfeeding after the first hour of life had twice (combined odds ratio [OR] 2.02; 95% CI: 1.40, 2.93) the risk of death in the first month of life compared with those who were breastfe d within the first hour. (Shrimp. 2017) The educational status of mothers allows early initiation of breastfeeding to increase, it is necessary that long -term approaches to prioritizing education for women and girls should be explored. In the short term, l ow-educated or uneducated mothers should be the target of breastfeeding promotion strategies such as counseling and peer education. (Smith et all. 2017) Infants who start breastfeeding between 2 -23 hours after birth have a 33% greater risk of neonatal death than infants within one hour of starting breastfeeding. Babies who have just started the initial process of breastfeeding more than 24 hours after birth will experience a risk of neonatal death above 100% greater. Early initiation of breastfeeding was as sociated with a reduced risk of death, initiation of breastfeeding after the first 24 hours of life was associated with an 85% increased risk of neonatal death compared with infants who started breastfeeding within 24 hours of birth. Early breastfeeding in cludes skin -to-skin contact between the newborn and the mother, this may be one of the mechanisms that can improve neonatal survival. Causes of morbidity include diarrhea, respiratory tract infections and nutrition (Smith et all. 2017). Selim. 2018 Working women don't have to decide between breastfeeding and work. When p returns to work, nursing mothers need support from their husbands and families and employers in order to continue breastfeeding. The International Labor Organization has recommended that governments give women the right to 18 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 27 weeks of maternity leave and ensure they have time and space to continue breastfeeding when they return to work. It is very important for breastfeeding mothers in the workplace to have sufficient time and space to continue breastfeeding or express and store breast milk. The assumption of researchers prioritizing education for women and children must be explored so that they are prepared from adolescence and during preparation for marriage to know a bout the importance of breastfeeding for a mother to give her baby for life from the Health Office, so that teenagers and prospective brides already know and are ready to provide breast milk for their children. her baby. This condition requires husband's s upport and family support so that the early breastfeeding process can be smooth and the baby can get colostrum which contains lots of antibodies properly, making the baby healthy and developing and developing well. CONCLUSSION Maternal health education f rom pregnant women to postpartum has not been implemented properly. maternal health education to secondary school, when the bride and groom and antenatal care continues ETICAL CLEARENCE Permission letter as the first step to start the research will be given to the Director of the Maternity Hospital Sayang Ibu where the research is conducted.

Many accesses to health care facilities have been disr upted. This study was to document breastfeeding counselor's practices in Indonesia during the Covid -19 pandemic. A cross -sectional study was conducted using an online rapid survey with SurveyMonkey, disseminated through breastfeeding counselor networks an d social media from 12th to 31st, July 2021. There were 205 respondents. 21 who did not practice breastfeeding counseling during the pandemic were excluded. 129 work at health facilities and 139 were completely all the questionnaire. 46,04% respondents pra cticed blended counseling. Mothers with COVID -19 faced not enough breastmilk, confused breastfed their babies for fear of transmitting COVID -19. While the problems encountered in mothers who survived COVID -19 were not enough breastmilk and nipple confusion . 54,5% of health facilities did not practice rooming -in with some reasons. The most challenges for breastfeeding conselour during this pandemic were the limitation of telecounseling. The COVID -19 pandemic impacted breastfeeding counselor's practices. Moth ers faced many problems in breastfeeding. There were also gaps in practices of rooming -in and the limitation of telecounseling. Guidelines for telecounseling and continuing breastfeeding education are important to practice more optimally facing this COVID -19 pandemic. Keyword: Breastfeeding counselor; breastfeeding; COVID -19 pandemic INTRODUCTION The COVID -19 pandemic and the associated many sectors crisis pose huge global and local challenges. The health, social and economic impact has affected all segments of the population (World Health Organization, 2021). This pandemic is posing considerable c hallenges for countries to maintain the provision of high quality, essential maternal and newborn health services (UNICEF, 2020). The adverse effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal health are not limited to the morbidity and mortality c aused directly by the disease itself but Nationalwide lockdowns, disruption of health -care services, and fear of attending health -care facilities might also affect the wellbeing of pregnant people The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 33 and their babies (Roberton et al. , 2020). A systematic review and meta -analysis found global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID -19 pandemic and need urgent safe accessible (Chmielewska et al. , 2021). An observational study in primary care in Belgium found women's medical cou nseling and social support were negatively affected by the lockdown. Women without previous breastfeeding experience and in the early postpartum period experienced a higher burden in terms of reduced medical counseling and support (Ceulemans et al. , 2020). Study from Australia documented feedback from mothers seeking assistance from The Australian Breastfeeding Association during the COVID -19 pandemic that found decreased access to face -to-face lactation support (Hull, Kam and Gribble, 2020). In Indonesia, since March 2020 COVID -19 pandemic also has substantially impacted maternity health sevices (Saputri et al. , 2020). Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, access to essential services such as breastfeeding counseling through hospitals, clinics and home visits has b een disrupted. WHO and UNICEF encourege women to continue to breastfeed during the pandemic, with no separation of mother and baby, while adhering to appropriate infection and control measures (World Health Organization, 2020). The objective of this study was to document breastfeeding counselor's practices in Indonesia during the Covid -19 pandemic. METHOD Study design, population and sampling This is cross -sectional study of breastfeeding counselors. The target population was breastfeeding counselors providing counseling for maternal or breastfeeding mothers including health workers such as midwives, nurses, nutritionists, general practitioners , paediatricians or obstetricians. Sampling was non-random sampling, not intended to generate generalisable nationally representative results of all breastfeeding counselors in Indonesia. Rather, our intetion was to learn more from practices of breastfeedi ng counselors from various The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 34 contexts, services and facility types facing the COVID -19 Pandemic. This study was conducted using rapid online survey with SurveyMonkey. An invitation and link disseminated through breastfeeding counselor networ ks and social media, collected from 12th to 31st, July 2021. Respondents were encouraged to share the survey with other colleagues. Questionnaire A questionnaire was developed by research division of Indonesia Breastfeeding Counselors Association (IKMI) and reconfirmation by others committee in IKMI. It was piloted by asking three of breastfeeding counselors to complete the questionnaire and provide feedback, which used to assess face validity and refine the wording of questions and response options. Data processing and analysis We use responses collected from 12th to 31st, July 2021. From 205 respondents, we excluded from 21 respondents who did not practice breastfeeding counseling in COVID -19 Pandemic. We got Quantitative analysis from SurveyMonkey in frequencies and percentages. RESULT AND DISCUSSION Respondents' characteristics The samples included breastfeeding counselors who actively practice breastfeeding counseling during COVID -19 pandemic, there were 184 but only 139 respondents who completely all the questionnaire. The Table 1 showing breastfeeeding counselors' characterist ic. Mostly were general practitioners and then midwives and pediatricians. 28.06% of breastfeeding counselors were not health workers.

Others worked at non -government organizations, community, company clinic, campus or worke d from home. Breastfeeding Practices Table 2. Type of breastfeeding counseling practices \\ During COVD -19 Pandemic, most of breastfeeding counselors practiced counseling to maternal or breastfeeding mothers through blended counseling. This means that they did face -to-face counseling combined with telecounseling. Telecounseling through few platfo rms such as WhatsApp, zoom, Instagram, Facebook. From this survey we found that there were many challenges facing breastfeeding counselors in this pandemic. The most challenge is limitation of practice telecounseling (35.44%). The limitation was when helpi ng mother when potitioning their babies or looking forward at latch on while breastfeeding. The limitation of face -to-face counseling was using of Personal Protective of Equipments (PPE). The others challenges were facing during this pandemic are Type Breastfeeding counseling practices N % Face -to-face counseling 34 24.46 Home visit with PPE 3 2.16 Telecounseling 31 22.3 Blended counseling 64 46.04 others 7 5.04 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 36 mother and family afraid of visiting health facilities, mother afraid of transmission COVID -19 to their babies and there was still different argument between health workers about breastfeeding and COVID -19. Research from the Northeastern United States found more than half of the participants who conducting telehealth in any form, found that virtual lactation support was moderately effective compared to in -person support. Weakness of virtual support included technical and logistic difficulti es, challenges assisting with latching or reading body language over the phone or online, and accurately assessing infant growth (Schindler -Ruwisch and Phillips, 2021). Many mothers need support during the COVID -19 pandemic. Experiances of breastfeeding during COVID -19 from United States found that 27.0% of mothers struggled to get support and had numerous barriers stemming from lockdown with some stopped breastfeeding be fore they were ready. The findings are vital in understanding how breastfeeding counselors could support in many ways to make sure all breastfeeding women are better supported (Brown and Shenker, 2021). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stat ed during the COVID -19 pandemic, telehealth services help provided necessary care to patients while minimizing the transmission risk of SARS -C0V -2 to healthcare personal and patients. Many professional medical societies endorse telehealth services and provide guidance for medical practice including counseling to mothers (CDC, 2020). In Indonesia, Majelis Kehormatan Etik telemedicine services for health facilities in the COVID -19 pandemic. ( MKEK, 2020) Table 3.

The most problems are not enough breastmilk (42.05%) whether Mothers feel there were not enough breastmilk or truly not enough breastmilk. Respondents who choosed others found that they were confused of whether breastfeed their babies or not, separated from baby or afraid of transmission of the virus. For the problems facing mothers, breastfeeding counselors help them with counseling about potitioning and latch on, how to milking and give support, motivation and education particularly about COVID -19 and breastfeeding. Some research showed about transmission of virus to breastmilk. A literature review for clinical practice stated that the Coronavirus is not transmitted via breastmilk. Breast feeding benefits outweigh possible risk during the COVID -19 pandemic (Lubbe et al. , 2020). A living systematic review found that there is no evidence of SARS -CoV -2 transmission through breastmilk (Centeno -Tablante et al. , 2021). Table 4.

Breastf eeding counselors did practical to help mothers facing those all COVID -19 Pandemic with helping in potitioning and latch on. But the most was given relactation (54.88%). Research from Australia found from mothers seeking for support in breastfeeding that most common breastfeeding concerns were related to insufficient milk or weight gain, painful The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 38 breast, relactation and reducing supplemental milk. Respondents reported that mothers were worried that stress had reduced milk supply that impact o n their breastfeeding (Hull, Kam and Gribble, 2020). Table 5.

Respondents who choose others found that theird health facilities did not accepting patients with COVID -19, did not work at health facilities, did not know or the health facilities did n ot have inpatient facilities. The reasons did not practice rooming -in because there were no guidelines at their health facilities, mother could not take care of her babies because of her illness, afraid of transmission and lack of isolation room. Many cou ntries in South East Asia already had guidelines for rooming -in, breastfeeding and skin to skin contact for the COVID -19 pandemic but there were still gaps in practices (Olonan -Jusi et al. , 2021). A rapid online global survey found that substantial knowled ge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID -19. There was a wodespread perception of reduced of rutine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence -based practices (Sem aan et al. , 2020). CONCLUSION The COVID -19 pandemic impacted breastfeeding counselor's practices. There was limitation of telecounseling to support breastfeeding mothers. Mothers with COVID -19 or survived COVID -19 had many problems in breastfeeding. Ther e were also gaps in practices of rooming -in at health facilities. Guidelines for telecounseling and continuing breastfeeding education are important for breastfeeding counselors to work more optimally especially in this COVID -19 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 39 pandemic. Advocay and socialization needed to health facilities as an effort to support maternal health services. With all the limitations, further research is needed for this topic.

Health care support (midwife) and exposure to the promotion of breast milk substitute products have a considerable relationship related to the success of breastfeeding. Midwives as the main provider on maternal and child services should be the main fulcrum that can support and provide breastfeeding protection. However, there are still many and often encountered practices. There are still many of them who do not comply with the In ternational code of marketing of breast milk substitute products or government regulations related to breastfeeding. This study aims to find out the background of why there are midwives who do not comply with the international code of marketing of breast m ilk substitute products as well as government regulations related to breastfeeding protection. Method: This study used qualitative methods with a case study approach. The study was conducted in sub -district X of East Jakarta. There were eight midwife infor mants and eight patients who participated in this study. Result: The majority of midwives did not know about the international code of breast milk replacement products and did not have appropriate practice. Conclusion: Some midwives did not comply with the marketing code of breast milk substitute products because of their ignorance, regulations in health facilities where they did not support, also there is no clear regulation related to this regulation. Keyword: Breastf eeding, Code, Breastmilk Substitutes INTRODUCTION The protection of breastfeeding is a joint task of all components of government and society. It is in line with all the commitments of the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's F und (UNICEF) and the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA). Midwives as health workers have a major role in helping the success of the breastfeeding process. In addition to health personnel factors, a very influential factor is the exposure to the promotion of breast milk Substitute (BMS) both in patients and health workers themselves. Many studies show that improper exposure to BMS promotion affects The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 43 the success of breastfeeding and health care support services related to the breast feeding process. (McFadden et al, 2016;Robinson et al, 2019; Rollins et al, 2016). This has been regulated in the International Code of Marketing of Breast -Milk Substitutes and subsequent resolutions adopted by the World Health Assembly (the Code) in 1981. The International Code of Marketing of Breast -Milk Substitutes is a guide to the protection and promotion of breastfeeding through the regulation of the marketing of BMS, bottles, and teats. (WHO, 1981). The rules regarding health facilities and health wo rkers are entirely regulated in articles 6 and 7 of this code. (WHO, 1981). Some of the contents of the article include a ban on the promotion of formula in Health Care Facilities, a ban on giving gifts or samples to Health Workers. (WHO, 1981). By 2020, 136 countries were judged to have had some form of legal action related to the Code, and 44 countries had strengthened this rule compared to the 2018 report. (WHO; UNICEF; IBFAN, 2018; WHO; UNICEF; IBFAN, 2020) However, only 79 countries have national laws that include provisions. organize BMS promotion in health facilities. Indonesia itself actually has regulations related to breastfeeding protection that refers to the code. The regulations include Undnag - Law No. 36 of 2009 article 128 on health, Government Regulation No. 33 of 2012 on Exclusive Breast Milk. However, the im plementation, monitoring and evaluation of the government has not been maximal. Therefore, there are still often found forms of violations of the management of this government and the international code itself. (UNICEF, 2020) . In a 2019 study on the pract ice of feeding babies it is known that there are still many people who feed babies (including breastfeeding) that are not appropriate. Specifically, it is known that there are influences from health workers including midwives who provide inadequate breastf eeding support, including providing inappropriate breast milk replacement products. (Ambarwati, 2019). So a deeper study was conducted, especially on midwives related to breastfeeding support and the application of government regulations and international codes for BMS The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 44 METHOD The study used qualitative methods with a case study approach complemented by verification. The study was conducted in sub -district X of East Jakarta. There were eight midwife informants and eight patients who particip ated in this study. Data collection techniques with interviews, observations, verification and documenting. The validity of the data is done by source triangulation and triangulation techniques. Data is processed by data induction and reduction techniques. RESULT AND DISCUSSION The results of this study include informant characteristics and forms of code application in breastfeeding protection. This data was presented in the following table. Tabel 1.

Table 3. Characteristics of Midwife Informants based on Reasons of Non -compliance with the implementation of the International Code of BMS Informants Reasons ignorance workplace procedure BMSMarketing Exposure Other M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 Resource: 2021 Table 3 shows that this non -compliance is due to their ignorance and exposure to the promotion of BMS products to midwives. The results of informant interviews, generally this non -compliance occurs outside the health service. This is in line with studies that have been done, that generally health workers provide less precise BMS in the place of health services. (Hernandez et al ,2019; Pries et al, 2016; Rosenberg et al, 2008). The majority of non -compliance caused by exposure to BMS promotion is highly relevant to existing studies. That this exposure greatly affects the attitude of health workers in providing support and protecti on of breastfeeding. (Piwoz et al 2015; Nguyen et al,2016;Tang et al, 2014; Li et al, 2020) The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 46 Table 1 shows that the midwife's knowledge of code -related is different, even though it has been the same following training with the same materials and modules. In -depth interview results show that the methods and training times organized by the three institutions are very different. This ignorance becomes a very wide opportunity for corporations to use health workers to provide their products to pat ients. It's a dilemma where midwives are victims. The same opinion is also found that generally, many health workers do this due to their ignorance. Baker et al, 2016; Rothstein et al, 2020; Appleton et al, 2020) CONCLUSSION Some midwives do not comply with the marketing code of breast milk substitute products because of their ignorance, regulations in workplace health facilities, also there is no clear regulation regarding this regulation. There needs to be special education included in obstetric education related to breastfeeding protection, especially the topic of international code marketing of breast milk substitute products to protect valuable breastfeeding processes.

The extent of BMS advertising in Indonesia's medical journals was restricted bygovernment regulations, The purpose of this study was t o verify the compliance of BMS advertisement in medical under the scope of government regulation. This cross - sectional study was conducted to analyzed the compliance to attributes of the Law for Food Labeling and Advertising, Marketing of Foods for Infant s and Toddlers, and Advertisement Ethics in three medical journals for pediatrician. The main attributes assessed were: the presence of. In 30 editions of 2020 -2021 medical journals reviewed, 14% of pages carried advertisements of which 72% were for BMS. T he products varied markedly between different journals, there were two manufactures dominantly adverts their BMS. The main noncompliance in infant formula advertisement were the overclaimed statements of health and nutrition content. All advertisements con tained purely promotional statements and none contained all of the information and warnings about BMS stipulated in the government regulation. We verified that there were noncompliance BMS advertisements in medical journal. Health professionals should be a ware of specific regulations for BMS marketing and some advertisements in medical journals were not in accordance with the regulations. Keywords: breast milk substitutes, regulation, compliance INTRODUCTION Optimal nutrition during a baby's first year of life is critical for future health outcomes. Despite the strong health message that breast is best for growing infants, we know that marketing of breast -milk substitutes (BMS) especially within the health sys tem, combined with other factors, has a negative impact on optimal breast -feeding behaviours. Breastmilk substitute (BMS) marketing within the health system, combined with other factors, can undermine breastfeeding. The extent of BMS advertising in leading medical journals was restricted by several government regulations. Infant Formula is prohibited from being advertised in any mass media except in special print media for health The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 50 professionals. Legislation on particular nutritional purposes (medical foods/infant formula) is implemented on guidance applied across the country in response to WHO policies and WHA resolutions. The purpose of this study was to verify the compliance of BMS advertisement in medical under the scope of government regul ation. METHODS We conducted a content analysis of BMS advertisements in three leading medical journals for paediatrician, as described by the acronym: PI, SP, and BI. For each of the three journals, researchers identified all pages related to BMS adverti sements. Data were collected from January 2020 until September 2021 editions. This cross -sectional study was conducted to analysed the compliance to these five interrelated government regulations: 1) Law 18/2012 for Food, 36/2009 for Health and 8/1999 for Consumer Protection; 2) Government Decree 69/1999 for Food Labeling and Advertising, 33/2012 for Exclusive Breastfeeding; 3) Ministry Regulation 39/2013 for Infant Formula and 15/2014 for Administrative Sanction for Health Professionals; 4) Food and Drug S upervisory Agency Regulation 3/2014 Labeling and Advertising of Foods, 24/2019 and 6/2021 for Special Nutritional Needs for Infants and Toddlers; 5) Advertisement Ethics 2020. Descriptive statistics were calculated for frequency and percentage for specific BMS advertisement and for each BMS manufacturer within the three medical journals. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A total of 2,525 pages were investigated, and BMS advertisements were found in 30 editions of three paediatric medical journals reviewed. Table 1 shows that 430 (14%) of all pages carried advertisements of which 309 (72%) were for BMS products. The 24 products varied markedly between different journals, t wo (N1 and KN) were dominantly among 7 BMS manufactures adverts their brands. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 51 Figure 1 illustrated the proportion of advertisements for BMS, growing up milk (GUM), complementary food (CF), vaccine, and paediatric medicine. Iterative process was done to identify five types of content: 1) information regarding indication; 2) statement: breastfeeding professional\" or \"on medical prescription\"; 4) information that infant formula is not a substitu te for breast milk; 5) accurate information or data that is evidence -based, communicative, informative, educative and responsible. Five prohibitions of BMS advertisement also investigated: 1) idealizing their products as if they were the best; 2) informati on or statements that are untrue, false, deceptive, and misleading; 3) using pictures of healthy babies who seem to be healthy because of the use of their products; 4) using health workers to provide information about infant formula in the advertisement; 5 ) advertising infant formulas that use the same trade names as follow -up and growing -up formulas Table 2 shows the main noncompliance attributes assessed in infant formula advertisement were the presence of overclaimed health and nutrition content (42%), o r references to the nutritional benefit of human milk (0%). Claims are regulated wherever they appear on the labelling, on a website or in advertising or presentations. Required information on infant formula products are following these six elements: 1) th e words 'important notice'; 2) statement on superiority of breastfeeding; 3) statement on using only on the advice of a health worker; 4) instructions for appropriate preparation; 5) warning on health hazards of inappropriate preparation; 6) warning that p owdered formula may contain pathogens. Prohibition of pictures that may idealize the use of infant formula on label of infant formula products. (Crawley 2016) All advertisements contained purely promotional statements and none contained all of the informat ion and warnings about BMS stipulated in the government regulation. Some known risks of using infant formula in place of breast milk are: increased gastrointestinal diseases, including necrotising enterocolitis, increased infectious diseases, including res piratory tract infection, altered adiposity and intellectual development, increased maternal breast cancer The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 52 through reduced duration of breastfeeding, adverse effects related to formula contamination or reconstitution problem eg, bacterial i nfection or burn injury, and increased cost of purchasing milk. (Munblit 2020) While it is understood that health workers do need information on BMS, the Code clearly states that product information must be restricted to scientific and factual matters. (Cr awley 2016) Health and nutrition claims are commonly made for a wide variety of food products, and the level of evidence supporting such claims is variable. However, special consideration is needed for claims related to infant formula products, which we define as brea stmilk substitutes for use in the first year of life, including follow -on formula and foods for special medical purposes. Infant formula is consumed by a substantial proportion of the world's infants, often in large volumes in relation to their body weight , typically 150 -200 mL/kg/day for a young infant fed solely on formula milk, the equivalent of 11 -14 L/day for a 70 kg adult. (Munblit 2020) The current advertisement environment is permissive and associated with poorly substantiated and potentially harmfu l claims. Action is needed to break the current cycle of weak scientific evidence and unreliable claims and move to a new era where carers of infants are given accurate information about infant formula products in a manner that does not undermine breastfee ding. (Munblit 2020) Although Indonesia has adopted many provisions of the International Code into its law and regulations, the scope only covers breastmilk substitutes up to 12 months. Loopholes in the law and inadequate enforcement (partly due to its decentralised system) also allow company circumvention and infiltration, thus promotional activities are rampant. (IBFAN 2018) The government regulation aligned with WHO code on marketing of breastmilk substitutes in context of: 1) informational and education al materials intended to reach pregnant women and mothers of infants and young children should not use any pictures or text which may idealise the use of breastmilk substitutes, 2) information provided by manufacturers and distributors to health profession als should be restricted to scientific and factual matters, and not imply or create a belief that bottle feeding is equivalent or superior to breastfeeding, 3) neither the container nor the label The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 53 should have pictures of infants; nor should they have other pictures or text which may idealise the use of infant formula, 4) there should be no advertising or other form of promotion to the general public of products within the scope of the code, 5) nutrition and health claims should not be permitted for breastmilk substitutes, except where specifically provided for in national legislation. (WHO 2020) As is still the practice today, the inclusion of medical testimonials by the profession in the adv ertising copy added a veneer of \"scientific\" and medical respectability. (Hasting 2020, van Tulleken 2021). Our objective is not to drive an anti-formula campaign, as we recognize that formula milks are essential products for children with complex medical or nutritional needs and for those women for whom breastfeeding is not possible. But decisions on when and how to use infant formula are best informed by sources of unbiased evidence rather than commercial advertisements. Despite the criticisms of formula milk, including the associations with greater weight gain, it is necessary to consider the whole picture and not to be too quick to demonize formula milk completely. First, for some mothers, breastfeeding is difficult or even impossible, which can result i n infants experiencing weight loss. In such situations, formula milk can be used to supplement the infant's nutritional needs, which can reduce hospital readmittance, and has been found to not interfere with breastfeeding. In addition, for some infants, su ch as those born to mothers who are infected with HIV or those with classic galactosemia (galactose -1- phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency), formula feeding could provide a safer source of nutrition. (Beattie 2019, Bridge 2021) We believe this is the ri ght thing to do based on our desire to support the WHO code, actively promote breastfeeding, and campaign against industry influence in this area. Instead of being part of the problem, we want to be part of the solution. To confirm the study findings, more research of other platforms should be done. (Vinje 2017) Likewise, advertising campaigns on online applications, professional organization websites, scientific meetings, medical research, education and social events at medical meetings should be addressed to map the extent of government regulation and Code violations. The influence of The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 54 marketing of such products on the recommended breast -feeding behaviour should hence be further investigated. CONCLUSION We verified that there was noncompli ance BMS advertisement under the scope of government regulation. Health professionals should be aware that there are specific regulations for BMS marketing and some advertisements in medical journals were not in accordance with the regulations. All of thes e appear in spite of government regulations prohibiting them indicating a failure of monitoring and/or enforcement. The marketing of BMS must be actively monitored to be effective.

Efforts to increase breastfeeding self-efficacy can be done by providing guidance or counseling to breastfeeding mothers. This research is a pre -experimental research with the approach used is One Group Pretest -posttest. The population in this study were all breastfeeding mothers who had babies aged less than 6 months who were found in the working area of the Olak Kemang Health Center totaling 120 mothers. There are 30 samples or respondents in this study. The sample used in this study is random sampling random. Analysis of the data used is the result of univariate analysis with frequency distribution before and after being given guidance on breastfeeding techniques on knowledge of breastfeeding mothers, frequency distribution before and after being given guidance on breastfeeding techniques on breastfeeding mothers' skills, freq uency distribution before and after being given guidance on breastfeeding techniques on breastfeeding self -efficacy. efficacy. Bivariate analysis with Wilcoxon test to see the effect of the given intervention on a variable. The results showed that breastfe eding technique guidance was very influential in increasing knowledge, skills and breastfeeding self - efficacy with a value of = 0.00 ( < 0.05). Suggestion: it is hoped that breastfeeding mothers can maintain exclusive breastfeeding, and share knowledge a nd skills in breastfeeding. Keywords: breastfeeding technique, breastfeeding self -efficacy, guidance and counseling. INTRODUCTION According to the World Health Organization (2017), globally only 40% of infants under the age of 6 months are exclusively br eastfed. United Children's Fund (UNICEF), only 42% of infants in Indonesia are exclusively breastfed for up to 6 months. In 2019, exclusive breastfeeding in Indonesia was 67.74% (Kemenkes RI, 2019). The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 62 The Jambi Province exclusive breastfeed ing rate in 2019 was only 56.01% (Jambi Province Health Office, 2019). Report from the Head of Health and Nutrition regarding exclusive breastfeeding in Jambi City in 2019, only 69.67% of infants received exclusive breastfeeding for <6 months and only 56.6 4% of infants were given exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. The working area of the Olak Kemang Health Center is an area where the exclusive breastfeeding rate is low, namely only 43.84% of infants given exclusive breastfeeding <6 months, while 38.10% ( Jambi City Health Office, 2019). Breastfeeding problems develop in the postnatal phase and have a negative impact on the breastfeeding period (Shafaei & Mirghafourvand, 2020: 2). Mothers who do not breastfeed effectively can cause problems when breastfeeding such as sore nipples, babies continue to cry because they are still hungry and finally mothers are interested in trying to give formula milk to babies (Pradanie, 2015:21). Mean while, according to (Awaliyah et al., 2019: 2), states that breastfeeding problems are related to feelings of satisfaction for mothers when breastfeeding their babies. Lack of family support, especially husbands, lack of mother's knowledge about the importance of breastfeeding for babies, and lack of mother's breastfeeding technique skills that lead to lack of enthusiasm for breastfeeding. The thing that is very influential on the satisfaction of breastfeeding mothers is the mother's confide nce in the ability to breastfeed her baby, or commonly called breastfeeding self-efficacy. According to Dennis, breastfeeding self- efficacy is an important component in breastfeeding because it can predict mothers will choose to breastfeed, how much energy will be expended by mothers, self -reinforcing or destructive mentalities, and emotional responses when they face difficulties during breastfeeding. This shows that t he higher the breastfeeding self -efficacy, the harder the mother's efforts to be able to breastfeed successfully, and vice versa. Research conducted by (Handayani et al., 2010:3), proves that there is a close relationship between social support, knowledge, attitudes and self -efficacy with breastfeeding behavior. In addition, research conducted by (Rahayu, 2018:249) The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 63 showed very significant results between breastfeeding self -efficacy and the success of exclusive breastfeeding. The results of these studies prove that breastfeeding self -efficacy is closely related to the success of breastfeeding practices. Efforts to increase breastfeeding self -efficacy can be done by providing guidance or counseling to breastfeeding mothers. RESEARCH METHODS The type of research used in this research is pre -experimental with the approach used is One Group Pretest -posttest. The population in this study were all breastfeeding mothers who had babies aged less than 6 months who were found in the working area of the Olak Kemang Health Center totaling 120 mothers. There are 30 samples or respondents in this study. The sample used in this study is random sampling random. The place of this research was carried out in the working area of the Olak Kemang Health Center, J ambi City in April 2021 -May 2021. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Table 1.

The effect of breastfeeding technique guidance on the knowledge of breastfeeding mothers in the work area of the Olak Kemang Health Center was obtained with a value of =0.00 (<0.05). This means that t here is a very significant effect before and after being given guidance on breastfeeding techniques. This study is in line with research from (Matdoan & Wiwin, 2019) regarding the effect of correct breastfeeding technique counseling on knowledge and attitu des in postpartum mothers with the results of the value =0.00 because <0.05, which means that there is an influence from the provision of technical counseling. correct breastfeeding on the knowledge of postpartum mothers in the working area of the Rujali Health Center Ambon. The results of this study are also in line with the results of research (Himawati & Mawarti, 2011:10) about the effect of health education on breastfeeding techniques on knowledge and behavior of breastfeeding techniques in primiparous mothers at BPS Kalibawang District, Kulonprogo which shows that The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 66 there is an increase in health education on breastfeeding techniques on mother's knowledge. primiparous breastfeeding. Table 6 above shows the results of data analysis using the Wilcoxon test to see the effect of an intervention given on the variables. The effect of breastfeeding technique guidance on the skills of breastfeeding mothers in the work area of the Olak Kemang Health Center was obtained with a value of =0.00 (<0.05). This means that there is a very significant effect before and after being given guidance on breastfeeding techniques. The results of this study are in line with research conducted by (Mulyana & Irmayani, 2019:84) about the effect of the demonstration method on breastfeeding technique skills in postpartum caesarean mothers at the Mataram City Hospital. can affect breastfeeding technique skills in post sectio caesarea mothers. So that with this influ ence there can be behavioral changes in post sectio caesarea mothers to carry out the correct breastfeeding technique. Table 9 above shows the results of data analysis using the Wilcoxon test to see the effect of an intervention given on the variables. The effect of breastfeeding technique guidance on breastfeeding self - efficacy of breastfeeding mothers in the work area of the Olak Kemang Health Center was obtained with a value of =0.00 (<0.05). This means that there is a very significant effect before and after being given guidance on breastfeeding techniques. This study is in line with research by (Shafaei & Mirghafourvand, 2020:2) about the effect of prenatal counseling on breastfeeding self-efficacy and the frequency of breastfeeding problems in mothers who previously failed to breastfeed that there is an influence of counseling or guidance given to respondents which can affect self -efficacy. efficacy of breastfeeding mothers. The advant age of this research is that researchers directly provide guidance on breastfeeding techniques door to door to respondents to get maximum results. Researchers conducted 2 -4 meetings to provide guidance on breastfeeding techniques and were given pretest and posttest questionnaires for knowledge of breastfeeding techniques, breastfeeding technique skills and breastfeeding self - efficacy. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 67 CONCLUSION 1. Most of the respondents had sufficient knowledge of breastfeeding techniques before being giv en breastfeeding technique guidance. 2. Most of the respondents experienced significant progress in their knowledge of breastfeeding techniques when they were given guidance on breastfeeding techniques to become good. 3. There is an influence of breastfeeding technique guidance on the knowledge of breastfeeding mothers before and after being given breastfeeding technique guidance. 4.

Improper care of the umbilical cord causes the umbilical cord to become detached for a long time. WHO recommends treating the umbilical cord with the topical method of breast milk because breast milk contains a significant number of complementary components, acts as a natural antimicrob ial agent and is also equipped with protective factors that provide specific and nonspecific passive immunity. And using sterile dry gauze has the benefit of protecting the umbilical cord from exposure to bacteria and can accelerate wound healing. Method : This type of research is a quasi -experimental research design with a post-only control design. The population in this study are all Newborns in March - July 2021, The research sample in this study was 20 newborns and The sampling technique in this study is Total Sampling. Results : Results The average of umbilical cord detachment with umbilical cord care using topical breast milk was on average 4 days and dry gauze was 7 days seen from test statistics Mann Whitney with the two tail hypothesis shows p value 0.000 < alpha 0.05. Discussion : care for the umbilical cord u sing sterile dry gauze is to keep the umbilical cord dry and clean and avoid exposure to bacteria and viruses, The content in breast milk is more effective in accelerating the release of the newborn's umbilical cord, because in breast milk there are natural anti -microbials so as to avoid infection of the umbilical cord in newborns which can affect the length of the release of the umbilical cord in newborns. Conclusion : There is a significant difference in umbilical cord care using topical breast milk and dry gauze on the timing of the release of the umbilical cord for newborns. Keywords: Newborn Baby, Umbilical Cord Care, Topical Breastfeeding, Kassa INTRODUCTION The umbilical cord is a lif eline for the fetus during the womb, because it is through the umbilical cord that all the needs for the fetus are met. The umbilical cord extends from the fetus to the placenta and contains the umbilical blood The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 73 vessels, namely two arteries and one vein. Th e umbilical cord is protected and covered by Wharton's jelly, a sticky substance formed from the mesoderm. The umbilical cord is completely covered by the amnion layer along with that which covers the placenta (Umrah, 2017) . Treatment techniq ues at the time of cutting and tying the umbilical cord, as well as umbilical cord care are the main principles that are very important to prevent sepsis due to umbilical cord infection. Improper care of the umbilical cord causes the umbilical cord to beco me detached for a long time. The risk when the old umbilical cord is separated is the occurrence of umbilical cord infection and neonatal tetanus. So the care of the umbilical cord needs to be considered. If the umbilical cord is wet, smells and shows sign s of infection, be aware of umbilical cord infection. Proper care of the umbilical cord is based on aseptic and dry principles and it is no longer recommended to use alcohol or other ingredients, and not tightly closed. Although it can be closed, it is oka y to use sterile gauze and not tie it too tightly. (Maharani et al., 2018) . WHO also recommends one way to treat the umbilical cord, namely the topical method of breast milk. The topical method of breastfeeding is one of the cultural umbilical cord care practices used in Tur key. This is beneficial because of the anti -bacterial factors found in breast milk. In addition, breast milk has many immunological and anti -infective agents. Breast milk contains a significant amount of complementary components, acts as a natural antimicr obial agent and is also equipped with protective factors that provide specific and nonspecific passive immunity (A. Allam, 2015) The best way to treat the umbilical cord after birth is a controversial issue, especially in developing countries where there are local beliefs. Efforts to identify and implement afforda ble, effective, and community -based umbilical cord care interventions are still being carried out so as to reduce infections related to neonatal mortality in developing countries. Mother's Milk (ASI) contains leukocyte cells, proteolytic enzymes, and immun ological substances that help speed up the release of the umbilical cord. The faster the umbilical cord comes off will reduce the risk of infection, by paying attention to cleanliness around the The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 74 umbilical cord and washing hands before and after caring for the umbilical cord. (Dewi et al., 2018) . The timing of umbilical cord removal is influenced by the way the umbilical cord is cared for, the humidity of the umbilical cord, the sanitary conditions of the environment around the neonate, and the incidence of infection in the umbilical cord due to ac tions or treatments that do not meet hygiene requirements. and umbilical cord infection (Hartanto & Purwanto, 2016) According to the Normal Childbirth Care (APN) standards, the umbili cal cord that has been cut and tied is not given anything. Before the APN method is applied, the umbilical cord is treated with alcohol and other antiseptics. In terms of evidence -based practice, traditional umbilical cord care using breast milk has an eff ect on preventing infection and the length of time the umbilical cord is released (Simanungkalit & Sintya, 2019) . The umbilical cord care using a dry technique is covered with sterile gauze. The advantages of using a dry umbilical cord treatment are that some mothers feel safer using sterile gauze, they are afraid to handle their newborn because the baby's umbilical cord has not been separated. While the drawback of umbilical cord care with a dry technique is that it requires sterile gauze (Noorhidayah et al., 2015) . Sterile dry gauze in several studies h as the benefit of protecting the umbilical cord from exposure to bacteria and can accelerate wound healing. Caring for the umbilical cord using sterile dry gauze can keep the umbilical cord dry and clean, thereby reducing the risk of infection which can af fect the length of time the umbilical cord is released in newborns. (Megalina Limoy, 2019) Neonatal deaths caused by tetanus neonatorum in Southea st Asian states were 581 infants. Health Profile of Indonesia in 2019 there were 56 babies affected by tetanus neonatorum, Tetanus Neonatorum occurred because of birth attendant factors, childbirth with traditional birth attendants, poor hygiene of umbilic al cord care, unsterile delivery equipment and when cutting the umbilical cord still using bamboo (Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, 2020) Based on the results of the 2018 Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) The proportion of umbilical The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 75 cord care for newborns in children aged 0 -59 months according to the province of East Kalimantan regarding umbilical cord care for newborns is given nothing and dry 44.8% is given betadine/alcohol 46.5% is given sows 1 ,2% were given ine 1.3% did not know 6.1%. Kutai Kartanegara was given nothing and dry 51.95% was given betadine/ alcohol 39.01% was given sowing medicine 1.28% was given herbs/traditional medicine 1.07% Don't know 6.68% (Provincial Ministry of Health, 2018) . Based on the Preliminary Study from the maternal register book data at PMB Misliana In 2020 there were 140 maternity mothers, fr om the results of interviews conducted, from 10 maternity mothers there were 6 mothers who said how to take care of the umbilical cord at home still following the advice of parents to carry out umbilical cord care routinely. Traditionally, and some do not understand about proper umbilical cord care. With incorrect and incorrect umbilical cord care, it is one of the factors that causes neonatal tetanus as one of the causes of newborn death. In a study conducted by Intan Nurul Ilma, the umbilical cord treatm ent with topical breast milk accelerated the release time of the umbilical cord compared to open dry treatment. Breast milk can be used for safe, effective and efficient umbilical cord care (Ilma, 20 20). In research conducted by Vedjia Medhya The average time to release the umbilical cord using breast milk is 4 days, while the average time to release the umbilical cord using dry gauze is 7 days. There was a significant difference in the length of ti me the umbilical cord was released using breast milk with dry gauze with p -value = 0.05. It shows that the length of time the umbilical cord is removed using breast milk is faster than the dry gauze treatment. It is hoped that umbilical cord care with brea st milk can be recommended as a standard for newborn care, as an effort to prevent umbilical cord infection (Medhina, 2020) . Based on the results of research conducted by Diana Putri et al, stated that the average length of umbilical cord detachment with topical use of breast milk was 5.03 days, and the average length of umbilical cord detachment with dry care was 6.00 days. The re is a difference in the length of the release of the baby's umbilical The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 76 cord with the use of topical breast milk 0.97 days faster than the dry treatment. Mother's Milk (ASI) is proven to contain bioactive substances and cells that have effective functions as anti -infective and anti -inflammatory. With a variety of content of these beneficial substances, breast milk can be used as an alternative material for umbilical cord care (Sari et al., 2018) . Based on the description above, the research is interested in \"Is there a difference in umbilical cord care using topical breast milk and d ry gauze on the timing of the release of the umbilical cord for newborns at PMB Misliana\". RESEARCH METHODS This type of research is a quasi -experimental research design with a post - only control design. The population in this study are all Newborns in March -July 2021, The research sample in this study was 20 newborns and The sampling technique in this study is Total Samplig. The research group was divided into 2 groups, namely the umbilical cord care group with topical breastfeeding (intervention) and the umbilical cord care group with dry gauze (control). and each group has 10 respondents, This study uses the Mann Whitney test.

The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 80 Discussion Characteristics of Respondents Based on table 1 shows that Based on table 1 above, it can be seen that the characteristics of the respondents are known to the majority of respondents male sex totaling 13 people (65%), the majority of body weight 2500 -2999 totaling 11 people (55 %), majority of respondents The colo r of the amniotic fluid is clear, 15 people (75%), the majority of respondents with the diameter of the umbilical cord is 11 people (55%) and all respondents did not experience infection in the umbilical cord amounted to 20 respondents (100%)of a total of 20 respondents. The diameter of the umbilical cord is between 1cm -2.5cm, with a length range between 30cm -100cm, an average of 55cm, consists of rudimentary allantoin, remnants of the omphalo mesenteric, covered with a thin mucous membrane, the rest is fi lled with a gelatinous substance as mucoid connective tissue called Wharton's jelly, Wharton's jelly is a sticky, sticky substance that surrounds the umbilical cord slowing down the fall of the umbilical cord (Asia, 2017) According to the author's assumption, there are 11 respondents (55%) who have an umbilical cor d diameter of 1 cm, the smaller the diameter of the umbilical cord, the faster the umbilical cord will dry because the Wharton jelly that surrounds the umbilical cord is not thick, thus accelerating the drying process of the baby's umbilical cord. Amniotic fluid is an unfavorable culture medium for bacteria, but if there is a certain amount of meconium present in it, it can increase the growth of bacteria, especially Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Fetuses exposed to meconium -stained amniotic f luid have a higher risk of infection than infants with unclouded amniotic fluid. (Kosim e t al., 2016) According to the authors' assumptions, respondents with green and cloudy amniotic fluid (25%) in green amniotic fluid contain bacteria that can cause infection so that it will be one of the factors that can make the umbilical cord loose lon ger. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 81 When to remove the umbilical cord for newborns using Topical breast milk Based on Table 2 shows that newborns who were respondents in the umbilical cord care group with Topical Breastfeeding (Intervention) most of their umbilical cord detachment were in the fast category, namely 7 respondents (70%). the average time of umbilical cord detachment in the topical breastfeeding intervention group with a total of 10 respondents with a mean or average value of 4,400, a median value of 4.00, a standard deviat ion of 0.699 and a minimum value of 4 days for umbilical cord separation, a maximum of 6 days. This study is in line with research (Medhyna, 2020) The average time of releasing the umbilical cord using breast milk is 4 days while the average time of releas ing the umbilical cord with dry gauze is 7 days. There is a significant difference in the length of umbilical cord release using breast milk with dry gauze with p -value = 0.05 (Medhina, 2020) . After the baby is born the umbilical cord is cut, then there will be a process of tissue death. Here the umbilical cord is treated using colostrum/breast milk. This is done by applying breast milk to the newborn's umbilical cord and keeping it clean and dry to prevent infection and speed up the release of the umbilical cord from the baby's stomach. Umbilical cord care using breast milk is a new method in umbilical cord care. This is because the nutriti onal content in breast milk in the form of lactose, protein, fat and minerals directly into the cells so that breast milk can be used as a medium for umbilical cord care. The protein in breast milk is high enough to play a role in the process of repairing damaged cells, accelerating the healing process so as to speed up the release time of the umbilical cord. (Hartanto & Purwanto, 2016) Proteins in breast milk will bind to proteins in t he umbilical cord, thus forming an immune reaction and an apoptotic process occurs. Cell division and growth are under genetic control, cells experience programmed death. Genes in these cells play an active role in the process of cell death. So that it wil l speed up the drying of the remaining tissue of the umbilical cord and the umbilical cord will quickly The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 82 shrivel and become black or mummify the umbilical cord, then release it. Protein as a form of essential body bonds in breast milk will accelerate the wo und healing process at the base of the umbilical cord so that the release of the umbilical cord is faster (Simanungkalit & Sintya, 2019) In addition, breast milk has the advantage of being anti -infective and anti - inflammatory, and contains antibodies so that it can protec t the baby's umbilical cord from infection and help the healing process. In the process of leukocyte infiltration at the base of the umbilical cord, IgA is the most important immunoglobulin and direct antibacterial against pathogenic bacteria in the umbili cal cord. T and B lymphocytes function as antibody synthesis, these antibodies will form specific immunoglobulins against antigens that cause bacteriostatic effects. This effect can prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria, thereby preventing infection an d accelerating the release of the umbilical cord(Simanungkalit & Sintya, 2019) According to the author's assumption, by using breast milk as a medium for umbilical cord care, the faster the umbilical cord is needed, to accelerate the release of the newborn's umbilical co rd so as to prevent infection in the newborn's umbilical cord. When removing the umbilical cord of a newborn using gauze Based on Table 4 shows that newborns who were respondents in the umbilical cord care group with dry gauze (control), most of their umb ilical cord detachments were in the normal category, namely 6 respondents (60%). the average time of umbilical cord detachment in the control group using Kassa with a total of 10 respondents, the mean or average value of 6,9000, the median value of 7.00 St andard Deviance 0.994 and the minimum value of 5 days of umbilical cord separation and a maximum of 8 days. This research is in line with the research results (Budia rti, Astrida, 2017) the average umbilical cord release with sterile gauze is 5 -7 days, while the average umbilical cord removal with alcohol gauze is > 7 days. Mann Whitney statistical test showed that there was a difference in the effectiveness of using sterile dry The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 83 gauze compared to alcohol gauze on the length of umbilical cord detachment p = 0.000 (p<a=0.05). Sterile dry gauze in several studies has th e benefit of protecting the umbilical cord from exposure to bacteria and can accelerate wound healing. (Megalina Limoy, 2019) Caring for the umbi lical cord properly and according to standards, namely using sterile dry gauze is to keep the umbilical cord dry and clean. Caring for the umbilical cord using sterile dry gauze can keep the umbilical cord dry and clean, thereby reducing the risk of infect ion which can affect the length of time the umbilical cord is released in newborns. (Megalina Limoy, 2019) According to the author's assumption, u mbilical cord care using sterile dry gauze is to keep the umbilical cord dry and clean. Caring for the umbilical cord using sterile dry gauze can keep the umbilical cord dry and clean throughout the day, so that the umbilical cord in newborns will be relea sed normally without any side effects. Differences in the length of the release of the baby's umbilical cord using topical breast milk and dry gauze Based on table 5 it is known The mean rank forlompok Topical Breast milk 5.60 and sum of rank 56.00 while group kcontrol (gauze) the mean rank is 15.40 and the sum of ranks is 154.00. and fromStatistic test results Mann Whitney with the two tail hypothesis shows a p value of 0.000 which is smaller than alpha 0.05, sso that Ho is rejected which means There is a significant difference in umbilical cord care using topical breast milk and dry gauze on the timing of the release of the umbilical cord for newborns. The results of this study are in line with research conducted by (Medhina, 2020) The average time to release the umbilical cord using breast milk is 4 days, while the average time to release the umbilical cord using dry gauze is 7 days. There was a significant difference in the length of time the umbilical cord was released using breast milk with dry gauze with p -value = 0.05. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 84 The use of breast milk as a medium for umbilical cord care is due to the nutritional content contained in breast milk itself. One of the contents of breast milk is protein, protein functions as a form of essential body bonds, regulates the balance of body fluids, maintains neutralization of the body by reacting to acids and bases so that the body's pH is balanced, forms antibodies, and plays an important role in transporting nutrients into tissues. Sterile dry gauze in several studies has the benefit of protecting the umbilical cord from exposure to bacteria and ca n accelerate wound healing. sterile dry gauze is to keep the umbilical cord dry and clean. Caring for the umbilical cord using sterile dry gauze can keep the umbilical cord dry and clean, thereby reducing the risk of infection which can affect the length o f time the umbilical cord is released in newborns. (Megalina Limoy, 2019) Breast milk also contains lymphocytes which consist of 2 cells, namely B cells and T cells. B cells function as homomoral immunity, immunoglobulin receptors that can recognize foreign antigens and can develop as plasma cells forming anibodies. T cells function as helper B cells in forming antibodies, have special receptors fo r antigens and play a role in suppressing the immune response. Physiologically when there are foreign objects in the body, B cells or T cells will be activated and make a response to macrophages to fight foreign objects, as a result B cells and T cells wil l proliferate with macrophages and mitotic division occurs. After division occurs, the umbilical cord will dry quickly so that this process will accelerate the release of the umbilical cord (Medhina, 2020) The nutritional content in breast milk such as fat, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and proteins as well as the composition of breast milk that changes at each stage such as colostrum, transitional / transitional breast milk, mature breast milk plays an important role in every phase of wound healing in the talcent. Nutrients such as colostrum (formation of antibodies / globulins), fat (formation / regeneration of cells), lactobacillus ( activator of the immune system), lactoferin (inhibits bacterial growth) and carotene (inhibits the growth of germs) indirectly play an active role in cell regeneration and help wound healing process in the umbilical cord. By using breast milk as a medium f or umbilical cord care, the The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 85 required umbilical cord release time is faster, cost -efficient and proven to be effective and safe to use as an alternative media for umbilical cord care. (Hartanto & Purwanto, 2016) According to the author's assumptions, protein content, nutrition, rich in nutrients contained in breast milk are more effective to be used as a way of caring for the newborn's umbilical cord to accelerate the release of the newb orn's umbilical cord, perform topical treatment of breast milk using sterile techniques, and wash hands first. thus avoiding infection of the umbilical cord in newborns. so that it can reduce the risk of infection which can affect the length of the release of the umbilical cord in newborns. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS During this research, there were limitations that hindered the course of the research faced by researchers, namely at the time this research was carried out it was still in good condition The Covid -19 pandemic which caused a limited number of respondents who gave birth at PMB Misliana because before giving birth the Covid 19 screening was carried out and an antigen swab examination was carried out to detect the Sars virus. Cov -2 so that res earchers need a lot of time to meet the number of respondents required in this study CONCLUSION The average umbilical cord detachment with umbilical cord care using topical breast milk was an average of 4 days and using gauze an average of 7 days, There is a significant difference in umbilical cord care using topical breast milk and dry gauze on the timing of the release of the umbilical cord for newborns because treatment using topical breast milk releases faster than using only dry gauze.

The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 88 THE RELATIONSHIP OF EXCLUSIVE BREAST MILK WITH BABY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 6-12 MONTHS AGES IN BUKIT BIRU Program, Poltekkes Kemenkes Kaltim Lecturer of the Department of Nursing, Poltekkes Lecturer of the Department of Midwifery, Poltekkes Kemenkes Kaltim Lecturer of the Department K emenkes Kaltim Abstract: Preliminary : Mother's Milk is a liquid milk produced naturally by the breast glands which is highly nutritious and good for babies. Breastfeeding should be given to infants because it greatly affects the growth and development of babies. The age of 0 -24 months is a period of rapid growth and development, so it is often termed the golden period as well as a critical period. So it is necessary to increase knowledge and awareness for mothers to provide exclusive breastfeeding to suppo rt the growth and development of babies. Methods : The research method was retrospetive, the population of infants aged 6 - 12 months in the Bukit Biru Public Health Center. Results: From the results of the Chi Square Test with the Alternative Likelihood Ratio Test, it was found that p value = 0.077 > 0.05, Ha failed to be accepted and Ho was accepted, meaning that exclusive breastfeeding was not related to infant growth. The results of the chi square statistical test with Fisher's exact test value obtained p v alue = 0.028 (p < 0.05). This means that there is a relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and infant development. Conclusion: Babies who get exclusive breastfeeding with a good stimulus will also have better development. Keywords: : Exclusive Breast feeding, Growth, Development INTRODUCTION Mother's Milk (ASI) is a liquid in the form of milk that is produced naturally by the breast glands which is highly nutritious and very good for babies (Mufdlilah et al, 2019). Breastfeeding is one of the efforts to prevent death and malnutrition in infants and toddlers. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newborns be breastfed until the age of 6 months without providing other food or fluids. Accord ing to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), in 2012 as many as 30,000 infant deaths in Indonesia and 10 million under -five deaths in the world each year could be prevented through exclusive The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 Samarinda, Indonesia 89 breastfeeding. (Wahyuningsih & Machmudah, 2013) . Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 4 -13.8% of children under five worldwide have poor nutritional status. Then motor development disorders reach 25% (Minist ry of Health RI, 2019) . Meanwhile, according to the Indonesian Child Profile (2019), in Indonesia, around 30.8% of children under five are stunted (nutritional disorders) and it is known that the normal growth and development of toddlers according to th eir age is 69.2%. The percentage of malnutrition in East Kalimantan Province in 2019 reached 7.40%. Meanwhile, in Kutai Kartanegara Regency, around 14% of babies are born with low weight, and 28% of children under five years are stunted. Meanwhile, in the Bukit Biru Village, Tenggarong District, in November 2020, a 75% increase in infant weight was found and from a preliminary study, it was found that from 10 babies who were weighed 4 of them did not receive exclusive breastfeeding, therefore it is necessar y to do research on growth and development that is influenced by exclusive breastfeeding. . The reason is that Bukit Biru's breastfeeding rate in 2019 is still low at 61.54% and the infant mortality rate in Kutai Kartanegara Regency is still high. Based on the data above, it is necessary to provide exclusive breastfeeding as an effort to support the growth and development of babies. Based on research conducted (Riyanti & Hanifah, 2014) states that there is a relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and the development of infants aged 6 -12, as well as research by Sandewi (2018), there is a relationship between breastfeedi ng and infant growth and development. Based on the data and research results that have been mentioned, researchers are interested in researching \"The Relationship of Exclusive Breastfeeding with the Growth and Development of Infants Age 6 -12 Months in Buki t Biru Village, Tenggarong District in 2021\". This study aims to determine the relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and the growth and development of infants aged 6 -12 months in Bukit Biru Village, Tenggarong District in 2021. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 90 RESEARCH METHODS This study uses a quantitative research type with a retrospective research design, where the independent variable in this study is exclusive breastfeeding seen as a past history and resulting in current events or affecting current conditions with the depend ent variable being growth and development in infants aged 6 - 12 months. This research was conducted in July 2021 at the Bukit Biru Sub -Puskesmas. The population in this study were infants aged 6 -12 months in the Sub District Health Center, Bukit Biru Villa ge. The sample of this study used a total sampling technique, namely 39 babies in the Bukit Biru Sub -district Health Center Area. In December 2021 with the criteria of mothers who were willing to be respondents, babies aged 6 -12 months, mothers living in t he Bukit Biru Sub -district Health Center Work Area, infants in good health. The research instrument for breastfeeding using the Breastfeeding Checklist, the growth instrument used in the study in the form of Weight Scales, Height or Body Length Measurement tools based on World Health Organization National Statistics (WHO -NCHS) standards, MCH handbooks, and developmental research instruments using checklist of Developmental Pre -Screening Questionnaire (KPSP). The analysis used is Univariate and Bivariate ana lysis. In this study, univariate analysis will be carried out to determine the frequency distribution of maternal characteristics, namely Education, Occupation, and infant characteristics including infant age and gestational age. Data on Exclusive Breastfe eding with Growth and Development of Infants Age 6 -12 Months. In this study, bivariate analysis was used to find the relationship between the independent variable (exclusive breastfeeding) and the dependent variable (development and growth). Chi Square for mula (X2) was used with the condition that if the calculated Chi Square price was greater than the table (X2 count > X2 table). ) then the relationship is significant, which means Ho is accepted.

While those who were not given exclusive breastfeeding were 10 babies with normal growth as many as 4 (40%), 3 thin (30%) and 3 fat (30%). From the results of the statistical test with Chi Square, a p value of 0.077 > 0.05 means that there is no relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and the growth of babies in the working area of the Bukit Biru Community Health Center. The Relationship of Exclusive Breastfeeding with Baby Development in the Bukit Biru Sub -Puskesmas Working Area in 2021 Based on the results of statistical tests using the Chi -Square chapter with a 95% confidence level, the following results are obtained: Table 9.

Meanwhile, there were 10 babies who were not given exclusive breastfeeding, with 6 (60%) the development was appropriate and 4 (40%) the development was not appropriate. The results of the chi square statistical test obtained a p value of 0.028 < 0.05, which means th at there is a relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and infant development. With an OR of 9.00, it means that babies who are exclusively breastfed have a 9x greater chance of experiencing development according to the baby's age. DISCUSSION The Relat ionship of Exclusive Breastfeeding with Baby Growth and Development The Relationship of Exclusive Breastfeeding with Baby Growth Based on table 8 above, the researchers found that there was no relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and infant growth. From the results of the Chi Square test with p value = 0.077 > 0.05 so that Ha failed to be accepted and Ho was accepted, meaning that exclusive breastfeeding was not related to the growth of the baby. Growth is related to changes that are quantitative in nature which refer to large and extensive quantities, and are concrete in nature which usually involve biological sequences and structures. (Armini, 2016) . According to Supariasa (2016), balanced intake of protein, minerals and vitamins as well as carbohydrates in breastfeeding mothers can increase milk production in quantity and quality. The results of this study are comparable to the research conducted by Budi Cahyadi in Linggajaya sub -district, Mangkubumi sub -district, Tasikmalaya city in 2012 that the relationship between breastfeeding was not significant with infant growth with p value 0.153 > 0.05. Growth is a physiological change as a result of the ma turation of physical functions that take place normally in the course of a The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 96 certain time. Babies who are exclusively breastfed will generally experience rapid growth at the age of 2 -3 months, but slower than babies who are breastfed non - exclusively. (Cahyadi, 2012) . This is i n line with research (Insana et al, 2018) the results of statistical tests with chi square obtained p value = 0.696 > 0.05 which concluded that the relationship bet ween breastfeeding was not significant with infant growth. The relationship between breastfeeding is not significant and the baby's growth is probably caused by the quantity and quality of breast milk given by the mother which is still lacking and does not meet the needs of the baby so that the increase in body weight and length of the baby is not optimal. In addition, nutritional factors for mothers during pregnancy and lactation, improper and correct breastfeeding methods so that breast milk production is not perfect (Insana et al., 2018) . According to the researcher's assumption, this result could be caused by the nutritional content of breast milk produced by th e mother is not optimal. Lack of nutritional content in breast milk can occur due to lack of nutritious food intake in breastfeeding mothers. The Relationship of Exclusive Breastfeeding with Baby Development Based on table 9 above, the results of the chi square statistical test were obtained with p value = 0.028 < 0.05, which means that there is a relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and infant development. This can be seen from the results of the study that respondents who breast milkExclusively as many as 27 respondents (93%) where the development was normal and only 5 respondents (7%) whose development was not in accordance with the OR 9.00 meaning that babies who received exclusive breastfeeding had a 9x greater chance of developing according to the baby's age. Based on the results of research respondents who receivedbreast milk Exclusive development is better than respondents who do not receive breast milk Exclusive. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 97 This is in accordance with the theory which states that the content contained i n breast milk such as protein, minerals, water, fat, carbohydrates and vitamins as well as more immune substances than formula milk so that normal development is obtained. breast milkExclusive. Another factor that greatly affects the development of babies is the provision of stimulation by parents from an early age. Development is the increase in abilities or skills in the structure of more complex body functions which are the result of the maturation process. This stage is called the differentiation of bod y cells, tissues, organs and organ systems that develop so that they fulfill their respective functions. One of the results of the maturation process is the increase in fine motor development. Givingbreast milk exclusively affects development because breas t milk has a good content for the development of the baby in addition to giving breast milkcan also be a stimulation for the development of the baby. This is because when breastfeeding the baby and mother interact so as to shape the development of the baby (Maria, 2020) . This is in line with research Al-Rahmad & Fadillah, (2016) , which states that there is a significant relationship between giving breast milk with Infant Development with p value = 0.000 < 0.05. Babies who are not exclusively breastfed have the opportunity to experience psychomotor development below the standard b y an average of 2 (two) times greater than those who are exclusively breastfed. Based on the aspect of cognitive function, exclusive breastfeeding gives better results on motor development. It is different with respondents who do not get stimulus from their parents, which can be seen from the results of the study that there are respondents who get breast milkExclusive but the level of development is at risk of interference. It can be concluded that givingbreast milk Exclusive and good stimulus can affect inte lligence and fine motor development so that respondents who get breast milk Exclusive and good stimulus the development will be good (Al-Rahmad & Fadillah, 2016) . The results of this study are compara ble with research conducted by Riyanti and Hanifah, (2014) that there is a significant relationship between giving breast milkwith the development of the baby with the results of the chi square test p The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 98 value of 0.005 < 0.05. In a ddition to nutrition from breast milk environmental, stimulation, and socio -economic factors also influence the development process . This research is in line with research Ni Made, (2014) entitled the relationship of giving breast milk Exclusively with growth and development in infants aged 3 - 6 months explaine d that there was a significant relationship between giving breast milk Exclusive to the baby's growth and development. According to the researcher's assumptions, infants who get breast milkExclusive but lack of stimulus, the baby will be at risk of experie ncing developmental disorders. So it can be concluded that with a good stimulus the baby's development will also be better. The limitation of this study is that it only examines the growth and development of infants who are exclusively breastfed and those who are not exclusively breastfed by not controlling for other confounding factors such as environment, prenatal health history (pregnant nutrition, radiation, infection, etc.). CONCLUSION Most babies receive exclusive breastfeeding at the age of 6 months. Most of the baby's growth is normal and the baby's development is age -appropriate. There is no relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and infant growth (p value = 0.077 > 0.05). There is a relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and infant development (p value = 0.028 < 0.05) Suggestions for further researchers to be able to develop and research further on the factors that influence the growth and development of infants by looking at the limitations of the study, namely by controlling other triggering factors such as stimulus, environment, prenatal health history (infection, radiation and toxins).

The hemoglobin of nursing mothers is expected to be expected so that the mother's milk as baby food contains enough Fe minerals which prevent anemia in infants.PurposeThis study aimed to determine the relationship between the hemoglobin levels of pregnant women and levels of hemoglobin du ring breastfeeding.Data on hemoglobin levels during pregnancy are secondary data . Examination of lactating hemoglobin levels using the POCT method. The type of research used in this study was observational analytic with a cross -sectional design, using a s ampling technique is purposive sampling , with 30 people. This research has been conducted on ethical tests.During pregnancy, the average hemoglobin level is 11.77gr/dl, and the average hemoglobin level during breastfeeding is 12.480 gr/dl . The result of Spearman correlation analysis value 0.024 P -Value <0.005, so there is a correlation between HB levels in pregnant and lactating women with a correlation coefficient strength of 0.412 at a moderate stage.There is a correlation between HB lev els during pregnancy and lactation with a moderate level of correlation.

BACKGROUND During pregnancy there is haemodilusi so that the risk of anemia occurs, regulation of pregnancy tak es 90 fe tablets and breastfeeding period haemoglobin levels are expected within normal limits. Haemoglobin of nursing mothers is expected to be normal so that breast milk as a baby food contains enough Fe minerals that prevent anemia in infants. Assessmen t of nutritional status with Hb levels is an assessment of nutritional status biochemically. Its function to find out one disorder that most often occurs during pregnancy is nutritional anemia (Supariasa et al, 2002, p.145). Pregnant women generally experi ence iron deficiency so that it only gives a little iron to the fetus needed for normal iron metabolism. Next they will become anemic by the The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 101 time the mother's hemoglobin levels drop to below 11 gr/dl during the third trimester. Everyone has different hb l evels, Hb can be affected by sex, age, iron adequacy in the body, drug influence, smoking and consuming alcohol (Kiswari, 2014). There are also several factors that can affect Hb levels, namely blood loss due to menstruation, lack of iron in the food consu med, chronic diseases, adverse adolescent lifestyle, imbalance between nutritional intake and activities carried out (Wahyuningsih, 2012). According to Kalsum (2016) the decrease in hemoglobin levels is due to chronic blood loss, insufficient iron intake, inadequate absorption and increased need for iron to find red blood cells that usually take place including at puberty and increased activity arena, wrong diet, irregular diet and menstruation. Nutrient intake becomes one of the factors that affect the lev els of hemoglobin in the blood, the essential nutrients in the formation of hemoglobin are iron, vitamin C, and protein. Iron serves as a means of transport of oxygen from the lungs to the entire tissue, in addition iron also serves as a form of hemoglobin . Iron is categorized into two, namely heme (derived from animal foods) and non - heme (derived from vegetables and fruits). Vitamin C is beneficial as an auxiliary factor in the formation of hemoglobin to be faster when reacting with non-heme iron. (Soedijanto, 2015).Iron is a micro - essential element for the body, which is necessary in the formation of blood, namely to synthesize hemoglobin. Excess iron is stored as ferritin and hemosiderin in the liver, spinal cord and stored in lymph and muscle. Iron deficiency will cause a decrease in ferritin levels followed by a decrease in transferin saturation or an increase in protoforifin. If the situation continues there will be iron deficiency anemia, where hemoglobin levels fall below normal values (Almatsier, 2011).The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 102 METHODS The type of research used in this study is observational analytics with cross sectional design, using sampling techniques in the form of purposive sampling, with a sample number of 30 people.

Analysis of sperm correlation of hb levels of pregnant women and nursing mothers 0.024 which means there is a relationship between hb levels of pregnant wom en and nursing mothers. In a preliminary study that has been conducted at the Samarinda Acid Coral Health Center until August 2019 showed that there were 73 pregnant women who had a history of anemia, 18 pregnant women suffered from Chronic Energy Deficien cy The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 105 (KEK), and there were 66 breastfeeding mothers who had a history of anemia. This shows anemia in pregnant women is still a health problem in Samarinda. Hb levels are affected by age, gender, height of residence, smoking habits, pregnancy, and nutritiona l deficiencies. Everyone has different hb levels, Hb can be affected by sex, age, iron adequacy in the body, drug influence, smoking and consuming alcohol (Kiswari, 2014). There are also several factors that can affect Hb levels, namely blood loss due to m enstruation, lack of iron in the food consumed, chronic diseases, adverse adolescent lifestyle, imbalance between nutritional intake and activities carried out (Wahyuningsih, 2012). According to Kalsum (2016) the decrease in hemoglobin levels is due to chr onic blood loss, insufficient iron intake, inadequate absorption and increased need for iron to find red blood cells that usually take place including at puberty and increased activity arena, wrong diet, irregular diet and menstruation. Nutrient intake bec omes one of the factors that affect the levels of hemoglobin in the blood, the essential nutrients in the formation of hemoglobin are iron, vitamin C, and protein. Iron serves as a means of transport of oxygen from the lungs to the entire tissue, in additi on iron also serves as a form of hemoglobin. Iron is categorized into two, namely heme (derived from animal foods) and non - heme (derived from vegetables and fruits). Vitamin C is beneficial as an auxiliary factor in the formation of hemoglobin to be faster when reacting with non -heme iron. Protein is needed in the formation of hemoglobin levels, protein becomes a means of iron transportation in the process of erythrocy formation that occurs in bone marrow. Protein intake that is less than the body needs wil l inhibit the transportation of iron to bone marrow is disrupted, so that bone marrow fails in the erythrocyte formation process. (Soedijanto, 2015). Breast milk is the main food for babies aged 0 -6 months. The milk produced is influenced by the mother's f ood intake and nutritional history. Anemia is one of the nutritional problems caused by a lack of intake of micronutrients such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12. Maternal anemia will be related to the mother's performance, quality and quantity ofASI th at will affect the nutritional status of the baby. In a study conducted by Siti Helmyatidkk (2003), hemoglobin levels in The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 106 nursing mothers are associated with iron levels (Fe) in breast milk. Of the 158 samples of breastfeeding mothers, 55 (34.8%) found anem ia at 4 months after delivery and 103 (65.2%) did not have anemia. It was found that every 1 unit of increased hemoglobin concentration was associated with an increase of 0.098 units of iron content (Fe) (p=0.058). Breast milk production is influenced by h ormonal factors, food intake, maternal psychic condition, frequency of breastfeeding, consumption of hormonal drugs / contraceptives and breast care (Kompas, 2013). One method of breast care is to do breast massage with oketani method can increase the prod uction and excretion of breast milk that is closely related to the development and growth of the baby (Foda, et al, 2004). Machmudah (2013) explained that the combination of oketani massage and oxytocin can increase breast milk production seen in the param eters of infant frequency of breastfeeding, phlegve and BAK. This study aims to find out how the quality of colostrum before and after the massage oketani. Research conducted by Mahmudah et al in 2020 with the title hemoglobin levels and breast milk composition in postpartum mothers who do breast massage with oketani method This type of research is quasi experiment with the design used is pre post test design with control group. Statistic al test results showed that there was a significant difference between hemoglobin levels and the chemical composition of breast milk (proteins and carbohydrates) with a value of p = 0.000. To improve the nutritional status of the baby, it is necessary to i ntake macro and micro nutrients and efforts to reduce the production of breast milk one of which is massage in nursing mothers because it will stimulate the hormone prolactin and oxytocin and increase the hemoglobin levels of nursing mothers who will affec t the levels of fe in breast milk. CONCLUSION The results of hb measurements of pregnant women and breastfeeding on average there is an increase.

Keywords: breastfeeding, standard, modification, home visit INTRODUCTION Breastfeeding is a great start for both mother and her newborn baby. Mother's milk is f ollowing the needs and digestion of newborns to achieve maximum growth and development with exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of the baby's life to prevent digestive tract disorders (Backstrom CA, 2010) The success of breastfeeding in infants c an be influenced by infant factors and maternal factors. The baby factor is influenced by the development of oral -motor function which is very dependent on the gestational age. (Suradi R et al, 2010). The psychological is the most important factor of the m other which can cause a The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 111 mother stop to breastfeed her baby even though she does not experience breast problems. Psychological factors can affect the process of milk production/prolactin reflex and milk ejection reflex/oxytocin reflex so that milk productio n is not optimal or mothers feel that their milk production is not optimal. Psychological conditions that play a major role are sadness, fear, lack of self - confidence, and lack of support for breastfeeding (Suradi R et al, 2010). Previous research has show n positive results to help breastfeeding mothers through family support, especially husbands, support from health workers, and support from peers. The support of health workers through home visits is believed to be able to support the success of breastfeed ing mothers in term babies compared to mothers who only receive hospital treatment. Increased knowledge about the importance of breastfeeding for infants through outreach activities in health services has not been able to increase the rate of continuity of breastfeeding mothers in East Kalimantan, indicated by the low rate of breastfeedin g continuity of 70.5% for exclusive breastfeeding and continuity of breastfeeding until the age of 23 months ( Riskesdas, 2018). Balikpapan is one of the cities in East Kalimantan province with an overall exclusive breastfeeding coverage in 2018 which only reached 78.61%. The factors that cause it are unsupportive breastfeeding behavior, feeding/drinks before the milk comes out, the mother's lack of confidence that breast milk is sufficient for her baby, the mother returning to work after maternity leave, t he lack of breastfeeding support from the office and the lack of breastfeeding facilities/facilities, and incessant promotion of formula milk (DKK Balikpapan, 2018). Researchers have researched increasing self -confidence in breastfeeding mothers through ho me visits and self -care methods. The results showed that home visits can increase the confidence of breastfeeding mothers and are expected to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding. Many studies have been carried out on the factors causing the failur e of exclusive breastfeeding, but the research that relates postpartum home care to breastfeeding in the city of Balikpapan has not been widely studied. The purpose The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 112 of this study was to determine the effectiveness of home visits with modified methods of br eastfeeding in the city of Balikpapan. METHODS This research is a comparative analytic study using a quasi -experimental design. The population was mothers who gave birth to babies with normal birth weight in Balikpapan City, East Kalimantan. The sample was mothers who gave birth to live babies at the time when the research was conduct. Samples were obtained by a consecutive sampling of research subjects who came to hospitals/clinics/BPM in the city of Balikpapan and met the research criteria until the numbe r of samples was met. The sample size formula used is the sample size formula for comparative analytics. The number of samples is 23 people per group. After getting the number of samples for this study, then the number of samples was increased by 10% to av oid the risk of being lost to follow -up during the study so that the number of samples for each group in this study was 25 people. The subjects selected in this study met the inclusion criteria and were not included in the exclusion criteria. 1) The inclus ion criteria in this study are: a. Mothers who gave birth to a baby for the first time and were treated at the hospital/BPM/Clinic where the research was conducted. b. Gestational age greater than or equal to 37 weeks at the time of delivery c. Minimum birth weight 2,500 gr 2) The exclusion criteria in this study are: a. The mother is sick and is not recommended by the doctor to breastfeed her baby due to her illness b. Babies who are seriously ill and need to have fasted This study explai ns the effect of home care on breastfeeding. The independent variable in this study was the home visit care method. The dependent variable in this study was breastfeeding. The confounding variables in The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 113 the study were age, parity, and education, and history of attending classes for pregnant women. Data collection in this study took place in 2019. All mothers in the study (both home visit group A and home visit group B) were followed from the beginning of the postpartum to 1 month of age of the child being bor n. At the beginning of the puerperium, the subject was asked to fill out a consent form after the explanation. Mothers and babies who are included in the conventional model home visit group will receive postpartum care and BBL care by standards from the Mi nistry of Health. Meanwhile, mothers and babies in the model B home visit group will receive home visits on the first, second, and third days. The model B home visit is a modification of the standard home visit from the ministry of health and strengthening the breastfeeding process and is carried out in the first week of postpartum. The midwife will conduct an assessment of the mother's breastfeeding skills including the attachment of the mother and baby during breastfeeding, and observe signs of the baby g etting enough milk. Mothers' breastfeeding skills were assessed using breastfeeding observation sheets from UNICEF and WHO. Midwives provide care according to breastfeeding problems faced by mothers. The Data was analysis using a computerized system. Data before and after treatment for each group were analyzed to obtain differences in the increase in self-confidence using paired t -test and Wilcoxon test. The data on the confidence comparison of the hom e visit group and the self -care group were tested by t -test and Mann -Whitney test. The significance of the test results was determined based on the p -value < 0.05. RESULT AND DISCUSSION The results of the study for general characteristics of respondents sh ow in the table below. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 114 Table 1. General Characteristics of Research Subjects Characteristics Group Home Visit A Home Visit B n=23 n=23 P Breas t milk Breast milk and formula Breas t milk Breast milk and formula Age: < 20 years > 20 years 1 13 3 6 2 18 1 2 0,042 Education Elementary Junior Senior College 1 0 8 4 1 1 6 2 2 1 15 2 0 0 2 1 0,269 History of attending maternity classes Never Once Twice Three Times or more 10 2 2 1 7 1 0 0 19 0 1 0 2 1 0 0 0,458 Breastfeeding Problems Yes No 12 11 52,2 47,8 18 5 78,3 21,7 0,015 Table 1 shows that most of the respondents in both groups are over 20 years old, with primary and secondary education levels, and have never attended classes for pregnant women. Meanwhile, the problem of breastfeeding was more experienced by respondents at home visits in group B. There is a significant relationship between age and breastfeeding after 1 month. The age of the subjects in the two groups which are not much diff erent allows for the similarity of emotional maturity, experience, and information possessed by the subject. Mothers with an older age are expected to have more knowledge and better emotional maturity in carrying out their roles as mothers. Age is also associated with the increasing amount of experience and information obtained so that it can build a good self -concept and be able to grow self-confidence in carrying out an activity The education level of the research subjects also did not diff er in the two research groups. The respondent of the two research groups has the same ability to receive and analyze new information. A person's ability to read is crucial to The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 115 finding information about breastfeeding a baby through various ways and storing it in memory. Breastfeeding knowledge is also obtained through classes for pregnant women that can attend by pregnant women at the primary health care center or hospital. Most respondents had never taken a class on pregnant women, so they did not have a cle ar picture and sufficient knowledge about breastfeeding. Lack of knowledge and experience of breastfeeding can affect the confidence of breastfeeding mothers (Cindy Lee, 2012) Dennis stated that mothers with higher education tend to have higher confidence in breastfeeding their babies. Mother's education will influence the mother in receiving and analyzing the new information received. Intellectual capacity such as reading will affect the retention stage of new behavior observed. Meanwhile, the new behavior that has formed is very dependent on physical abilities, communication, and learning abilities to behave in the same way as the model exemplified. Respondents in the home visit group A experienced fewer breastfeeding problems than respondents in the home visit group B. This happened because the midwives identified more difficulties with breastfeeding at the beginning of the postpartum because they had more frequent contact with respondents in the home visit group B than those in the home visit group A. The comparison of the two methods for feeding infants after one month shows in the table below: Table 2. Comparison of home visits for group A and group B on breastfeeding Home visit Food after one month Mann - Whitn ey Wilcox on P Breastm ilk % Breastm % 135,0 A (modifi kation) 20 86,9 5 3 13,0 4 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 116 The table shows, it can conclude that there is an average difference between group A and group B with p < value. Respondents in group B more exclusively breastfed their babies than respondents in group A even though they had difficulties in breastfeeding example wrong breastfeeding position, and the lack of breastfeeding syndrome. Breastfeeding problems can be resolved faster and without complications and higher risks after receiving care by a midwife during a 3 -day home visit in the first week of the postpartum. In addition, it can increase postpartum mother's satisfaction with the midwifery care she gets during the visit Schedu ling home visits at the beginning of the postpartum can provide an opportunity for midwives to detect breastfeeding problems, especially in the first week of a baby's life. The ability of mothers and babies to adapt can also affect the breastfeeding proce ss. By having home visits for 3 times in a row in the first week, it can help mothers in overcoming breastfeeding problems. The results of this study indicate that model B home visits are effective in increasing breastfeeding for infants aged 1 month. Eve n though, further research is still needed. CONCLUSION Based on the results of research and discussion on the effectiveness of home visit care for breastfeeding, it can be concluded that there is a difference between home visits B and home visits A for bre astfeeding and home visits B tend to be more effective in breastfeeding than home visits A. Midwives are expected to develop home visit care methods to support exclusive breastfeeding programs. Midwives are advised to increase the confidence of breastfeed ing mothers by providing individual breastfeeding support to mothers, through modification program for home visit to achieve exclusive breastfeeding.

In East Kalimantan, exclusive breastfeeding in 2019 became 78.53%. Breast milk is perfect, and clean for baby, contains all nutrients that babies need. The purpose of this study was to determine an effect of traditional music sape' and classical music Mozart on milk production of breastfeeding mothers at Rapak Mahang Health Center. This research method was quasi -experimental research with Non -equivalent c ontrol group design. The sampling technique used purposive sampling. The sample in this study amounted to 22 mothers. This study was carried out around one month. The results showed that were differences in breast milk production after treatment with tradi tional music p -value 0.004 and classical music p -value 0.003 (p < 0.05). Classical and traditional music aims as relaxation therapy because it affects the system in the brain, has soft strains and functions to calm mind so that it gives a calming effect. The results showed that H 0 was rejected, and Ha was accepted, i.e. there was a difference in milk production after the music intervention was given, both in the sape' traditional music, and in the Mozart classical music. Music therapy can be used as an opti on in relaxation for smooth breastfeeding.

In 2017, around 150.8 million children under five in the world were stunted. Data on the prevalence of stunting under five collected by WHO, Indonesia is included in th e third country with the highest prevalence in the Southeast Asia/South -East Asia Regional (SEAR) region. The average prevalence of stunting under five in Indonesia in 2005 -2017 was 36.4%. WHO in 2016 still shows the average rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the world is around 38%. East Kalimantan the coverage of infants who received exclusive breastfeeding in 2 019 around 78.53% and got second rank in terms of The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 120 exclusive breastfeeding coverage (Kemenkes RI, 2020). This figure has been increasing every year , but this figure is still below the target of 80%. The coverage of exclusive One of the factors that can affect breast milk production are prolactin and oxytocin hormones, lack of mother's knowledge, self -confidence and lack of family support. Disturbances in the breastfeeding process are also influenced how mother's feel and relaxed mood, it will cause breast milk production easy to come out and the mother 's nutrition while breastfeeding must also be fulfilled (Sulistyoningsih, 2011). Classical music therapy is based on the belief of many music experts, that the rhythm and tempo of most classical music follows the speed of the human heart rate, which is around 60 beats per minute. That's why babies are often soothed with classical music, especially music composed or arranged by Chopin, Mozart, and Vivaldi which consistently uses a tempo that is reminiscent of the human heartbeat (Sulistyorini , 2014). In East Kalimantan , there is a strain of music that is also known to foreign countries, namely the strains of Sape' music which is played by picking from the Dayak tribe. According to Khalish's 2016 research, the strains of Sape music can reduce stress levels and relax with slow tempo strains that can calm the mind and relax muscles (University of Nevada, 2012) MET HOD This study uses quasi -experimental research, Non -equivalent control group design. The time of the study was carried out around one month start from June until July 2021 and the research location was in the Work Area of the Rapak Mahang Health Center, Kutai Kartanegara Regency. The population of this study were all primiparous breas tfeeding mothers with infants aged 0 -6 months. Researchers used non -probability sampling with purposive sampling technique. The samples in the experimental group and in the control group each amounted to 11 people who were taken according to the inclusion criteria.

Respondents of traditional music for babies aged 2 months were 57.1%, 50% of mothers were aged 20 -35 years, most of mothers' education was high school 54.5%, and mothers did not work 52.6%. Asrifah (2018) stated that of 29 pregnant women ag ed 20 -35 years who had a low-risk pregnancy of 58.6%, this is the ideal age of pregnancy until delivery and breastfeeding because get pregnancy, delivery until breastfeeding at this age is considered sufficient. They will mature in psychology and reproduct ive organs. The good frequency of breastfeeding baby about 10 -12 times a day. Breastfeeding is the process of expelling breast milk involving the let down reflex by oxytocin which be stimulated to produce breast milk. Breast milk which fed to the baby can help to empty the mammary alveoli, by signaling the hypothalamus to increase prolactin secretion. Therefore, mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies every 2 -3 hours. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 122 The result of this study is similar to research (Saraung et al., 2017) stated that most of the research respondents have the latest high school education as many as 16 breastfeeding mothers (53.3%). Education is an important element that determines the nutritional status of the family. Mothers who have a high educational background are easier to understand the received information. Fadlliyyah's research (2019) stated that mothers who work outside and must leave their baby for more than 7 hours will be hindered by the time to have breastfeed, meanwhile housewives can breastfeed their chil dren everytime. Working mothers also cannot give exclusive breastfeeding because apart from working factors, which no facilities such as a special room for expressing breast milk so that the practice of exclusive breastfeeding is not achieved. Other factor s that can affect breast milk production include regular diet, high protein nutrition and regular consumption of water, breast care will stimulate the mammary glands and affects the pituitary to stimulate hormones in milk production, rest patterns that wil l affect because the condition of mothers who are tired and exhausted due to work tends to affect breast milk production (Aprilia & Krisnawati, 2018). Table 2. Differences in Breast Milk Production in Traditional Music Groups Test Breastfeed Production showed that the p -value of paired t -test is 0.004. It means , there is a significant difference in average milk production in the sape' traditional music group. This statistical difference can be influenced by the intervention carried out by researchers through routine activities of listening to traditional sape' music by the respondents. Erwin & Antoro's (2019) state d that trad itional music therapy modulates pain through the release of endorphins and enkephalins. Theory of hormonal changes The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 123 said, it suggests the role of endorphins substances neurotransmitters resembling morphine our body produces naturally. Increased endorphins r elated to reduc e pain, improv e appetite, blood pressure and breath e. Endorphins have a relaxing effect and endorphins are also an ejector of the feeling of relaxation and calm that arises. Traditional music therapy will also reduce muscle tension, and increase serotonin, induce calm, provide comfort, relaxation, happiness and relieve stress so that traditional music therapy will affect the milk production of nursing mothers. Tabel 3. Differences in Breast Milk Production in Classica l Music Groups Test Breastfeed that the p -value paired t -test is 0.003. It means, there is a significant difference in the average milk production in the Mozart classical music group. This statistical difference could be influenced by the intervention carried out through regular activities of listening to Mozart classical music by the respondents. The results of Damayanti's research (2019) in Magelang which states that classical music has an effect on relieving postpartum wound pain and breastfeeding mothers' milk production. Meanwhile, Dewi's research (2016) states that there is an eff ect of giving Mozart classical music therapy on postpartum mother's milk production. Classical music therapy aims as relaxation therapy because it can affect the system in the brain that will suppress the function of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrena l glands to inhibit the release of stress hormones so that the production of oxytocin and prolactin hormones is maximized. Classical music has the function of calming the mind and optimizing regular tempo, rhythm, melody, and harmony so that it provides a calming effect that will affect the increase in breast milk production (Maryatun et al., 2019). The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 124 Table 4. Differences in Breast Milk Production in the Two Groups at Pretest Group Breastfeed Production Mean p-value Traditional 110.00 0.041 Classical 168.90 Sumber: Data primer, 2021 The results showed that p -value of independent t -test is 0.041. It means , there is a significant difference of average milk production between the traditional music group sape' and the group Mozart classical music. This can be influenced by several factors that affect the milk production of a nursing mother. The difference in milk production between the two groups can show many things, one of which is psychological factors and mothers who do not work. Musrifa's research (2018) explains that a good mother's psychological condition has a good impact on breast milk production and motivates her to always breastfeed her baby. Syukur & Purwanti (2020) stated, factors that affect the composition of breast milk include gestational , post-natal age, breastfeeding stage. Breastfeeding mothers are advised to eat foods that are high in protein. Animal protein can be obtained from meat, fish, milk, and eggs while vegetable protein can be obtained from soybeans and their products such as tempeh and tofu. Protein is very good for the growth and development of babies. Table 5. Differences in Breast Milk Production in the Two Groups at P osttest Group Breastfeed Production Mean p-value Traditional 141.81 0.014 Classical Sumber: Data primer, 2021 The results indicate p -value of the independent t -test is 0.014. It means , there is a significant difference in the average milk production between two group at the The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 125 posttest. This can be a measure of the effectiveness of increasing breast milk production with classical music therap y. The results of this study different with the research of Somoyani et al., (2017) stated that there is no difference between traditional and classical music in alleviating anxiety and emotions in mothers. Purba's research (2017), state d that therapy with classical music affects the milk production of breastfeeding mothers based on the frequency of the baby's defecation. Music therapy can be used to relaxation for smooth breastfeeding which known as the Hypnobreastfeeding Technique. This is a natural effort to use subconscious energy so that the breastfeeding process runs smoothly, by positive affirmation when the mother is relaxed or concentrated so that the mother can produce sufficient breast milk for the baby's growth and development needs. Table 6. Effectiveness of Breast Milk Production in Both Groups Group Breastfeed Production Mean p-value Traditional 37.27 0.626 Classical 33.18 Sumber: Data primer, 2021 Based on the results showed p -value the independent t -test on the effectiveness of breast milk production between the two groups is 0.626. It means, there is no significant difference in the average effectiveness of milk production between the traditional music and the classical music group (p < 0.05). The results of Arisdiani's et al. (2021) research stated that Mozart's cla ssical music has a slow tempo, balanced high and low tones and has a low and rhythmic sound level. The arrangement in Mozart's simple music, as well as a stable melody can help mothers in the process of releasing endorphins in the body so that they feel co mfortable and have an effect on the prolactin hormone and milk production. Jesica Dwi Prananda (2020) stated traditional sape' music can produce beautiful and serene tones so that it can make the hearts of those who hear it The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 126 happy. It will have a good impac t on milk production, because a happy heart will send a signal to the hypothalamus to produce the hormone prolactin and will increase milk production. Compared to other classical music compositions, the melodies and high frequencies in Mozart's works are a ble to stimulate and empower the creative and motivational areas of the brain. No less important is the purity and simplicity of Mozart's music itself. His compositions have succeeded in bringing back the regularity of sounds experienced by babies both in and out of the womb. Sape' in the daily life of the Dayak people is to mention the name of the musical instrument itself, and to refer to the practice of playing music both solo and in ensembles.. The art of music and musical instruments of the Dayak tribe is one of the media needed in the implementation of traditional ceremonies in the daily life of the Dayak tribe, besides that it also functions as a means of entertainment (Haryanto, 2016). CONCLUSSION There is no significant difference related to breast milk production with the intervention of traditional sape' music and classical mozart music. Traditional and classical music has advantage of being soft, pleasant and soothing, who hear it. Then this will keep the mother from anxiety, as well as other psyc hological disorders that will affect the increase in breast milk production. REFERENCES Aprilia, D., & Krisnawati, A. M. (2018).

This raises concerns about transmission to mothers with COVID -19 who wish to breastfeed. We want to explain about the p otential transmission of COVID -19 during breastfeeding and tips to prevent it. Methods: We included ten studies (articles) in the Pubmed journal database. The article discusses the potential for transmission and breastfeeding tips for mothers with COVID -19. Every article has been reviewed. Result: The mainstay of transmission of SARS - CoV -2 is by symptomatic people to others through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Options fo r infant feeding and measures for a mother with COVID -19: Direct breastfeeding Infant cared for by mother (rooming -in) or HCP/caregiver; Expressed human milk and than Infant cared for by HCP/caregiver; and No breastfeeding and mother's own milk is not prov ided. Conclusion: Risk of transmission to mothers and babies during breastfeeding is to those who are symptomatic and the possibility of breastfeeding can still be done if the mother is asymptomatic or has mild to moderate symptoms who are not using antivi ral drugs.

INTRODUCTION Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) (formerly also known as Wuhan Novel Coronavirus) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) which is closely related to the SARS virus.1 The number of cases of COVID -19 in the world has reached more than 200 million cases with 4 million deaths. The number of cases of COVID -19 in Indonesia has reached 3.5 million cases, of which 114 cases died.2 This infection is spread from one person infected with COVID -19 to another through respiratory droplets produced by the airways which are often expelled with coughing. The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 130 between 2 -14 days, with an av erage of 5 days.3 COVID -19 pandemic has come about in changes to perinatal and neonatal consideration, focusing on limiting dangers of transmission to the infant and medical services staff while guaranteeing clinical conside ration isn't compromised for both mother and newborn child.4 Many of the health -promoting effects of breastfeeding are due to the provision of passive immunity via immunoglobulins andother bioactive factors (e.g., lactoferrin), and previous studies have shown that milk -borne antibodies are produced in response to viral infection.5,6 Few studies have examined the presence of antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 in human milk.In one recent study, milk from 12 of 15 women previously infected with SARS -CoV -2 contained IgA that was reactive to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS -CoV -2 spike protein.5 Current proposals on baby care and taking care of when mother has COVID - 19 territories from mother -newborn child detachment and aversion of hu man milk taking care of, to inception of early skin -to skin contact and direct breastfeeding. Medical services suppliers dreading dangers of extreme intense respiratory disorder Covid 2 (SARS -CoV2) maternal -newborn child transmission might veer toward limi ted breastfeeding rehearses.7,8 It's critical all doctors caring the family discuss in detail about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding with parents in order to indiv idualize any feeding choice. All women admitted to the hospital for delivery should be tested for SARS -Cov2 taking into account the context and the local epidemiological situation.9 We want to explain about the potential transmission of COVID -19 during breastfeeding and tips to prevent it. MET HOD We included ten studies (articles) in the Pubmed journal database. The article discusses the potential for transmission and breastfeeding tips for mothers with COVID -19. Every article has been reviewed. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 131 RESULT AND DISCUSSION The mainstay of transmission of SARS -CoV -2 is by symptomatic people to others through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Options for infant feeding and measures for a mother with COVID -19: Direct breastfeeding Infant cared for by mother (rooming -in) o r HCP/caregiver; Expressed human milk and than Infant cared for by HCP/caregiver; and No breastfeeding and mother's own milk is not provided.10-12 World Health Organization's (WHO) as of late refreshed rules suggest that moms with suspected or affirmed COVID -19 disease ought to be urged to start and keep breastfeeding on t he grounds that advantages of breastfeeding significantly offset the potential dangers of transmission. Therefore, we actually face vulnerabilities in the ideal administration of infant care and breastfeeding.7,13 Pace et al did not detect SARS -CoV -2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS -CoV -2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS -CoV -2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti -RBD IgA correlated with SARS -CoV -2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS -CoV -2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted.14 Many of the health -promoting effects of breastfeeding are due to the pro vision of passive immunity via immunoglobulins andother bioactive factors (e.g., lactoferrin), and previous studies have shown that milk -borne antibodies are produced in response to viral infection. However, few studies have examined the presence of antib odies to SARS - CoV -2 in human milk.In one recent study, milk from 12 of 15 women previously infected with SARS -CoV -2 contained IgA that was reactive to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS -CoV -2 spike protein.5 They also reported that antibodies in milk from previously infected women and milk collected prior to December 2019 (prepandemic) exhibited low -level The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 132 cross -reactivity to RBD. However, levels of secretory IgA with r eactivity to RBD were higher in milk from previously infected women. Cross -reactivity of antibodies in serum samples collected from healthy individuals and those infected with seasonal human non -SARS coronaviruses (sCoV) have also been reported.5,14 This cross -reactivity is thought to stem from homology of the spike protein of sCoVs and SARS -CoV -2. The extent to which milk -borne antibodies hav e cross - reactivity to sCoV and whether these cross -reactive antibodies are associated with neutralization of SARSCoV -2 is currently not known.5 Mei et al (2020) accept policyma kers and HCP ought to be given a state -of- the-art survey of the scope of care proposals fromprofessional and public bodies (with their masters and con) to devise practical rules locally.12 In general, pub lished guidelines for breastfeeding mirror those for maternal influenza infection, which encourage breastfeeding, while the mother adopts infection control precautions. This is the position taken by the WHO and many national health authorities with few exc eptions.13 The WHO concluded that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID19 should not be separated from their infants, therefore skin -to-skin contact and breastfeeding should be initiated from birth while taking precautions to avoid spreading virus to her infant, primarily through contact with mother's infectious respiratory secretions.13 The WHO's recommendations on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) are that mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID -19 should be counseled about droplet and contact precautions dur ing contact with their infant.13 However the decision about whether or not to separate mother and neonate must be individualized, taking into account the parents information -consent, good health status of both the mother and her neonate and capacity to care for her neonate, the results of RT -PCR -RNA test for COVID -19, the context and the local epidemiological situation of current COVID -19 pande mic.9 Option A involves direct breastfeeding with the infant being cared for by the mother or caregiver. In option B, the infant is cared for by another caregiver and The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 133 receives mother's expressed milk. In the third option, the infant is not breastfed directly and does not receive mother's expressed milk. We recommend joint decision making by parents and the health care team.12 This decision is also flexible as situation changes. We also provide a framework for co unseling mothers on these options using a visual aid and a corresponding structured training program for health care providers.12 An article propose different choices that could be considered for newborn child taking care of, and suggest choice An as the ideal mode for safe and mother - and-child agreeable breastfeeding. In individual cases, in view of maternal conditions, and divided dynamic among medical services suppliers (HCP) and guardians, different al ternatives might be considered with its dangers and advantages comprehended.15 Breastfeeding practices can also be adapted to the administration of drugs obtained by the mother. The two most questionable drugs for safety are favipiravir and remdesivir. Favipiravir first appeared in Japan in 2014 as a new therapeutic option for influenza because the virus showed increas ed resistance to oseltamivir.7,16 This drug has a broad spectrum effect against a wide variety of influenza viruses and has been used against other viral families, in addition to being effective against the Ebola virus, where its use is associated with longer patient survival. This medicine is not recommended for pregnant and lactating women.16 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 134 Figure 1. Infographic for counseling a mother with COVID -19 on breastfeeding. COVID -19, novel coronavirus disease 2019; HCP, health care provider12 Favipiravir can be used in combination with other antiviral drugs and shows a synergistic effe ct. Favipiravir is considered a potential drug against COVID -19. However, available studies have not provided sufficient evidence to recommend routine use of favipiravir for the treatment of SARS -CoV -2 infection. No information is available on the use of f avipiravir during breastfeeding or its excretion into breastmilk.16 Favipiravir is a small molecule that is about 60 % protein bound in plasma, so it would be expected to appear in breastmilk and be absorbed by the infant, probably in small amounts. In clinical trials, favipiravir has been well tolerated, but has caused liver enzyme abnormalities, gastrointestinal sympto ms, and serum uric acid elevations.16 Remdesivir is a drug developed in 2016 for the Ebola virus.17 Study tested the use of remdesivir against SARS -CoV -1 and MERS -CoV in vitro with good results. This drug is an antiviral analogue of adenosine, which is incorporated into the RNA polymerase chain when metabolized in cells, thereby preventing viral replication. Remdesivir is an RNA Polymerase inhibitor known to shorten recovery time in nonpregnant women.16 Pregnant women have been excluded in most studies. Some studies show that remdesivir does not cause side effects for pregnant women. Based on a randomized control trial conducted during the Ebola epidemic, Remdesivir is safe for use in pregnant women.18,19 There is no information regarding the presence of remdesivir in breast milk, its effect on breastfed infants, or its effect on milk production. Remdesivir is given intravenously because it is poorly absorbed orally, s o infants are not likely to absorb clinically important amounts of the drug from milk.16 Counseling may be done thro ugh teleconversation, videoconference, or face - to-face encounter with personal protective equipment (PPE) precautions. The first meeting is ideally done before baby's birth, once mother has been diagnosed with COVID -19. However, with the widespread range o f COVID -19 presentations, The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 135 HCP may be confronted with various scenarios, ranging from a mother with confirmed, probable, suspect, presymptomatic infection or an asymptomatic carrier. There is even an emerging proposal for routine screening of obstetric patients admitted for labor, regardless of maternal symptomatology. HCP should discuss with the mother options available to her, with an appropriate visual aid for her reference. CONCLUSION Risk of transmission to mothers and babies during breastfeeding is to those who are symptomatic and the possibility of breastfeeding can still be done if the mother is asymptomatic or has mild to moderate symptoms who are not using antiviral drugs.

The present study aimed to examined the impact of facility -based isolation compared to self -isolation at home on the continuing direct breastfeeding practice. This cross -sectional study target ed positive COVID -19 confirmed mothers who had under -twelve -months infants during February -August 2021 period. Data was collected through an online survey using self -administered questionnaire form to assess impact of the pandemic on breastfeeding practice s. In total, 308 women participated and reported that before they confirmed to have tested positive for SARS -CoV -2, their infant feeding were 43.5% exclusive breastfeeding, 41.2% partial breastfeeding, 15.3% formula feeding. Nearly 48% mother responded tha t breastfeeding is safe during COVD -19, but 65% of them raised concerns about medicines they consumed. More than 59% mother with mild cases considered to stop direct breastfeeding and practicing indirect feeding, using her own milk, donor milk, or formula . About 57% women with previous breastfeeding experience had intention to relactate after recover from isolation. Insufficient knowledge, lack of intention, and poor breastfeeding self -efficacy reduce the likelihood of breastfeeding during isolation. Keywords: COVID -19, breastfeeding, knowledge, attitude INTRODUCTION The COVID -19 outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2), was identified at the end of 2019. The pandemic has been affecting every aspect of life around the world since then. Breastfeeding mothers and infants are not excluded (Kotlar 2021). The World Health Organization (WHO) stated breastmilk as clinical gold standard feeding for infants because it is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. It provides all the nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a child's nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 138 third during the second year of life (WHO 2020). Breastfeeding also supports healthy brain development and is associated with higher performan ce on intelligence tests among children and adolescent (Kim 2020) . Furthermore, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to reduce neonatal mortality to at least 12 per 1000 live births , under -5 mortality to 25 per 1000 live births by 2030 (Tefera 2021). Studies have shown an inverse relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and infant mortality rates in developing countries. Appropriate infant feeding practices are required to achieve this goal (Azuine 2015). The COVID -19 pandemic has also intensified the concerns of mothers regarding breastfeeding. The fear of vertical transmission through breastfeeding is currently a core concern of new mothers, and the evidence is still conflicting (Kotlar 2021). In March 2020, Word Health Organization (WHO) support s the continuation of breastfeeding as well as postpartum skin -to-skin contact following certain recommendations and precautions. Word Health Organization (WHO) recommend that women with COVID -19 can breastfeed based on the idea that through breastmilk the babies would get antibodies and anti -infective factors that help protect newborns from getting infections (WHO 2020). In addition, the World Health Assembly (WHA) has set a global target in order to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for infants aged 0 -6months up to at least 50% in 2012 -2025 (Azuine 2015). Adherence to these guideline, I ndonesian National Household Health Survey in 2020 showed that the practice of exclusive breastfeeding was 66,06%. It still needs to be increased in order to ach ieve SDGs target to reduce infant mortality (Kemenkes 2020). Indonesia's COVID -19 guidelines allowed mother with mild cases to continue direct breastfeeding with infection prevention protocol and the provision of expressed breastmilk upon family's preferen ce according to clinical conditions and after receiving education. Of the various barriers to breastfeeding, limited information is available for mothers during the COVID -19 isolation. In fact, even though there are some guidelines available, there are sti ll concern about breastfeeding. Mothers' good knowledge and positive attitude play key roles in the process of breastfeeding (Dukuzmuremyi 2020). A study reported that mothers The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 139 with higher knowledge of EBF were 5.9 times more likely to practice EBF than their counterparts (OR 5.9; 95% CI 2.6, 13.3; p<0.001) and higher scores of breastfeeding knowledge (OR 1.09; CI 1.04 -1.14), attitude (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00, 1.09), and practice control (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.02, 1.20) were associated with a higher preval ence of exclusive breastfeeding.7 Based on the data above, this descriptive study therefore set out to assess describe the knowledge and attitudes among mothers with mild cases COVID -19 positive during isolation in Indonesia. The present study aimed to ex plore the knowledge and attitudes about breastfeeding of mother with mild cases. We examined the impact of facility - based isolation compared to self -isolation at home on the continuing direct breastfeeding practice. METHODS This cross -sectional study targ eted positive COVID -19 confirmed mothers who had under -twelve -months infants at all mode of feeding. Systematic random sampling method was employed for selecting participants in proportion to facility - based and self -isolation at home during February -August 2021 period. Data was collected through an online survey using self -administered questionnaire. The survey was anonymous and data confidentiality will be protected. A questionnaire consisting of both closed and open -ended questions was used to collect all data on socio -demographic factors, knowledge, attitude and practice of breastfeeding. The respondents who didn't complete all of the questionnaire were being excluded. The obtained data were organized in MS excel and results were obtained in percentage . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Characteristic of mothers with mild case COVID -19 In total, 308 women participated and reported that before they confirmed to have tested positive for SARS -CoV -2. The mean age of the respondents was 28,2 years old, 97 (31,4%) of the respondents have infant with 1 -3 years old . The data showed that 152 (49%) of the respondents graduated from university. Of the 308 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 140 respondents, 137 (45%) were experiencing the birth of the first child (primiparous) and 171 (55%) had two or more childr en (multiparous). 195 (67%) of the respondents work from home during pandemic, majority 152 (49%) of the respondents live in Java area (Table 1). The result showed that the proportion of the exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) before mother confirmed COVID -19 was 127 (61%), partial breastfeeding was 134 (43%) and formula feeding (FF) was 47 (15%) (Table 1). Knowledge The COVID -19 pandemic has been affect ing every aspect of life around the world since then. The data showed that of the 308 respondents, 148 (48%) mothers responded that breastfeeding is safe during COVD -19, majority 134 (44%) of them still believe that COVID -19 medicine is not safe for breast feeding and 200 (65%) of the respondents also believe that vaccine give no benefit to breastfed infant. The result showed less than 22 (7%) of them had vaccinated. On the contrary, Word Health Organization (WHO) already give recommendation to support the continuation of breastfeeding as well as postpartum skin -to-skin contact following certain recommendations and precautions (WHO 2020). Moreover, the Union of European Neonatal and Perinatal Societies advise direct breastfeedi ng under strict measures of infection control in asymptomatic COVID -19 mothers, but when the mothers are too sick, the neonates will be managed separately with fresh expressed breastmilk (Davanzo 2020). A series of 22 case studies of newborns to mothers wi th COVID - 19 infection from March 14th to April 14th, 2020 conducted by Pereira et all also conclude that breastfeeding is safe with correct infection and control measures to decrease the risk of contagion by droplets and by contact with the respiratory secretions between mother and infant (Pereira 2020). The result showed that they get about COVID -19 and breastfeeding information from several sources. These are health care provider, webinar, television or newspaper, social media, and also family or friends. Majority of the respondents get the information from social media. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 141 This is similar to the report by Abdelhafiz et al. where social media was the main source of information for young adults in their survey in Egypt (Abdelhafiz 2020). On the other hand, Ro y et al. reported 67% of Indians felt worried after receiving social media updates on the global burden of COVID -19 (Roy 2020). Thus, we need to ensure that the source information given in social media can be trusted. Attitudes and Practices The result sh owed half of the respondents 154 (50%) decide to do the isolation at home, while 145 (47%) was facility -based isolation. We found that only 9 (3%) of the respondents with mild case COVID -19 choose to isolation at the hospital (Table 2). After mother confir med COVID -19, there was a difference of attitude and practices in how to fed their babies. The result showed that 66 (21%) of the respondents still choose to give Direct Breastfeeding (DBF), but mother with mild case COVID -19 176 (57%) consider to stop dir ect breastfeeding and practicing some another ways, these are 43 (14%) decide to give Indirect Breastfeeding, 17 (5,5%) using Donor Milk Feeding (DMF) as an alternative, 58 (18%) still choose Formula Feeding (FF), while 124 (40%) choose combination between breastfeeding and formula Of the 308 respondents, 176 (57%) women with previous breastfeeding experience had intention to relactate after recover from isolation, despite a higher burden in terms of reduced medical counseling and psychosocial support durin g isolation (Table 2). This is aligned to the online survey conducted by Brown and Shenker, their study showed that breastfeeding experiences were influenced by the COVID -19 pandemic, either positively (41.8%; e.g., spending more time at home, experiencing less social pressure, and fewer visitors), negatively (27%; e.g. less perceived support, worries about safety of breastfeeding, and isolation), or neutrally (29.5%). Women who perceived the breastfeeding experience during the pandemic as more challenging were less likely to describe themselves as ready to stop breastfeeding. These authors also found a strong significant association The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 142 between breastfeeding perceptions and current feeding method. In terms of how COVID -19 had affected their decision to stop br eastfeeding, 70.3% attributed a lack of face -to-face support, 20.9% worries about the safety of breastfeeding and 6.5% their symptoms of COVID -19 to stopping breastfeeding (Brown 2020). In addition, when the time of birth was before the pandemic, 50.1% of women rated their experience of breastfeeding as positive, and 10.7% as negative. When giving birth after the pandemic, only 36.2% of women rated their breastfeeding experience as positive, while 34.8% rated it as negative (Pacheco 2021). The research does have limitations. Using online research data collection methods is an increasingly popular approach and one that was necessary during the pandemic. However, it would likely have excluded participants from the most deprived groups who could not access the internet. CONCLUSION Insufficient knowledge, lack of intention, and poor breastfeeding self -efficacy reduce the likelihood of breastfeeding during isolation. Facility -based was associated with significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding practices compared with self -isolation a t home. Supportive and consistent messaging from health professionals were very important to help mothers handle the stress and uncertainty of the infant feeding practices in the midst of the pandemic.

Some regions in Indonesia still hav e certain dietary restrictions for breastfeeding mothers. This food taboo is related to cultural, health, and religious reasons. Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis, sourced from Health Ethnographic Research data in 2012 which aims to determine the nutritional fulfillment behavior of breastfeeding mothers in Javanese and Madurese ethnic groups. The data collected includes the taboos for breastfeeding mothers in the two ethnic groups. Results: We found that there are several public beliefs regardi ng dietary restrictions for mothers during breastfeeding. This dietary taboo is not only found in ethnic Madurese and Javanese, but also in several ethnic groups and even other countries. Conclusion: Dietary taboos for breastfeeding mothers, even though it has become a tradition, are not proven in health. Women who are breastfeeds should increase their energy and nutrient intakes since breast milk has to supply an adequate amount of all the nutrients for an infants needs for growth and development. Keyword : Breastfeeding , COVID -19, Dietary taboos INTRODUCTION Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) throughout the first 6 months of life. World Health Assembly resolution 65.6 in 2012 supports a plan for a more complete im plementation of maternal, infant and child nutrition and mentions 6 global nutrition targets by 2025. One of the targets is to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding to at least 50%. Currently, only 37% of infants are exclusively breastfed.1 The coverage of exclusive breastfeeding in Indonesia in 2020 is 66.06%. This figure has exceeded the 2020 Strategic Plan target, which is 40%. The highest percentage of exclusive breastfeeding coverage was West Nusa Tenggara Province (87.33%), while the lowest was West Papua Province (33.96%).2 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 147 Various obstacles are faced to be able to breastfeed optimally, one of which is the existence of myths about breastfeeding that will affect the quality and quantity of breast milk. In some areas in Indonesia, a mother must follow the traditions and myths that exist during pregnancy until the postpartum period, including certain dietary restrictions during breastfeeding.3 In terms of culture and tradition, Indonesian people both in urban and rural areas have the obliga tion to follow this belief. Whereas due to wrong knowledge and avoiding certain foods can make women do not get adequate nutrition. It is important to maintain a balanced diet considering the increasing needs of women during pregnancy and lactation.4 The nutritional needs of mothers need to be considered during breastfeeding because the nutrition that comes in must not only meet their needs but also for their babies through adequate breast milk content. Breast milk is important because it is the main and first nutrient that is suitable for the digestion of newborns. This study is designed to provide an overview of dietary restrictions in several ethnic Indonesians. METHOD The data comes from a secondary data analysis, sourced from Health Ethnographic Research data in 2012 and other journal databases which aims to determine the nutritional fulfillment behavior of breastfeeding mothers in Javanese and Madurese ethnic groups. The data collected includes the taboos for breastfeeding mothers in the two ethnic groups. The purpose of this study was to overview food taboos in Indonesia, Madurese and Javanese ethnic groups. RESULT We found that there are several public beliefs regar ding dietary restrictions for mothers during breastfeeding. This dietary taboo is not only found in Madurese and Javaneseethnic, but also in several ethnic groups and even other countries. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 148 DISCUSSION Breast milk contains colostrum which is rich in antibo dies because it contains protein for the immune system and is useful for killing high numbers of germs so that exclusive breastfeeding can reduce the risk of death in infants. Colostrum is yellowish in color which is produced on the first day to the third day. On the fourth to the tenth day, breast milk contains less immunoglobulin, protein, and lactose than colostrum but has higher fat and calories with a whiter color. In addition to containing food substances, breast milk also contains certain enzymes that function as substances absorbent that will not interfere with other enzymes in the intestine. Formula milk does not contain these enzymes so the absorption of food is completely dependent on the enzymes found in the baby's intestines.2 Nationally, the coverage of infants receiving exclusive breastfeeding in 2020 is 66.06%. This figure has exceeded the 2020 Strategic Plan target of 40%. The highest percentage of exclusive breastfeeding coverage is in West Nusa Tenggara Province (87.33%), while the lowest percentage is in West Papua Province (33.96%). There are four provinces that have not reached the 2020 Strategic Plan target, namely Maluku and West Papua. The full coverage of infants receiving exclusive breastfeeding can be seen in Figure 1.2 Figure 1. Coverage of babies getting exclusive breast milk by province in 2020 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 149 Breastfeeding is not optimal even though the advantages and benefits of breastfeeding have been proven to support the survival of babies. Many mothers have difficulties in breastfeeding. One of the factors is food intake. The quality and quantity of breast milk produced by the mother can be influenced by the intake of certain foods.5 There is a myth that has developed and become a tradition in some areas related to some foods that are not good during breastfeeding. The eating pattern of the mother after giving birth is shaped by a culture that is not in line with the diet recommended by balanced nutrition guidelines. Although not all mothers do dietary restr ictions, there are still some who do and this can affect daily intake such as energy, protein and other macronutrient components.6 Intake needs to be more than during pregnancy because all the nutritional content in breast milk must be adequate enough to meet the needs of the baby for the period of growth and development. It takes 200 more calories per day and the source of calories should be from a nutritionally complete diet that contains carbohydrates, protein, fat, and other micronutrients.7Lactatio n is the phase of human reproduction that requires the most energy. The energy cost of breast milk production in the first six months of exclusive breastfeeding increases the mother's daily energy needs by 30% or 1260 kJ/day above the energy needs of pregn ant women. An additional 500 kcal for the first six months, and 400 kcal for the next six months, are required for nursing mothers.8 Some of the reasons food is taboo are due to health, cultural, and religious issues. The factors related to food consumpt ion patterns such as income, education, occupation, ethnicity, family support, and husband. Other food taboos are related to traditions and cultural norms that have been passed down from generation to generation. Based on data from the East Kalimantan Heal th Office in 2013 which showed a figure of 106 deaths per 1000 births and an objective assessment conducted at the hospital on the portion of food intake consumed by mothers after giving birth. They tend not to eat certain food sources of protein such as f ish and eggs. They believe that some of these foods will affect the quality of breast milk or the healing process after giving birth.5,7 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 150 In the ethnic Madurese, there are several taboos for mothers while breastfeeding their babies, among them are mothers are not allowed to eat sea fish because they are afraid that their breast milk will smell fishy. In addition, mothers should also not consume too much chili because breast milk will taste spicy and cause the baby's eyes to be dirty and red. The following is the informant's statement regarding dietary restrictions while breastfeeding, \"...you can't eat fish because it makes breast milk fishy. It's also not allowed to use chili, because later the baby's eyes can get dirty, ma'am..\".9 In Javanese, there are not only food taboos, but also drink taboos. There is a belief about food and drink taboos that should not be done while the mother is breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers should not drink ginger water because it is feared that small blisters will appear. Ginger water is believed to have a bad effect on baby's skin because it is hot. In addition, it is also forbidden to eat sweet in large quantities because it can inhibit the process of drying the wound in the baby's navel and food that smells and tastes f ishy should also be avoided by nursing mothers because it will affect the health of the baby10. The same thing happened in Barito Kuala, South Kalimantan. There are as many as 11 foods that are taboo for breastfeeding mothers. The list of foods and their reasons can be seen in Table 1.11 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 151 Table 1. List of taboo foods for breastfeeding mothers No. Food Reasons 1 Egg Will get pregnant again 2 Fresh fish Bleeding after 40 days of delivery and the child's urine smells Fever 3 Fish There will be red spots on the child's skin 4 Sugar There will be red spots on the child's skin Fever 5 Salt There will be red spots on the child's skin Fever 6 Kalui fish Poisoned 7 Jackfruit Itchy 8 Fatty food Bleeding after 40 days of delivery and the child's urine smells 9 Spicy food Bleeding after 40 days of delivery and the child's urine smells Mother's milk will be sour and the child will have diarrhea 10 Sour food Mother's milk will be sour and the child will have diarrhea There will be red spots on the child's skin 11 Coconut cream Mom can get sick This taboo food is not only in Indonesia, but also in other country. A cross - sectional study was done in Guadalajara, Mexico to identify food taboos among nursing mothers who participated in a breast -feeding programme. The study includes 493 nursing mothe rs who were interviewed 10 -45 days after delivery. A chi- square test was used for finding an association among food taboos, mother's characteristics, and demographic variables. 50.3% of the mothers avoided at least one food in their diet after childbirth due to beliefs that it was harmful during breastfeeding. Forty - seven percent avoided three or more foods. Fruits and vegetables (62%) and legumes (20%) were the most avoided foods. These food The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 152 taboos were associated with living more than 10 years in Guadal ajara city, breast feeding experience, no prenatal information about breast feeding and other people's suggestion to complement breast feeding. A supportive approach and efficient communication, taking into account mother's characteristics, might reduce th e gap between scientific recommendations and nutritional practices of mothers willing to nurse their infants.12 In Karnataka, South India, 110 women who have given birth in the past three months were followed by a focus group discussion (FGD) among twelv e consenting mothers at a rural health centre. Among 110 women, more than 80% of women have increased their food intake postpartum. Vegetables such as eggplant and fruits such as papaya were avoided by 65.5% and 73.6% of women, respectively. This is influe nced by the socio -economic status and educational status of the woman.13 Good nutritional intake to support the mother's stamina, patience and self - confidence when breastfeeding her baby. It is important for us to be able to help mothers achieve the righ t nutritional status for optimal breastfeeding and need to consider energy and nutritional needs.8To get a healthy diet we need to eat many different types of food each day including fruit and vegetables, grains, roots, beans, nuts and animal products an d other. It is not healthy to eat the same food with the same components every day. Consumption of a wide variety of foods is likely to increase nutrient adequacy, good nutrition is the key to good mental and physical health.7 Among these taboos is to av oid foods that contain protein such as fish and eggs. Though it needs adequate protein intake during the period of growth or recovery from disease. Protein requirements during pregnancy are approximately 60g/day over a nine -month period. This is an increas e of 10 to 15g/day above the needs of a non -pregnant woman. During lactation, it is necessary to increase 15 - 20 g/day above the pre -pregnancy requirement because protein is responsible for various functions, namely cell growth, tissue repair, energy source , maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, acid -base balance, and the immune system.8 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 153 Fat is the main source of energy in breast milk. A breastfeeding woman has a particularly higher need for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) because her baby uses a lot fo r the development of the central nervous system during pregnancy as well as brain growth and eye development. The content of DHA in breast milk directly reflects the mother's intake. On average, milk lipids comprise about 4% of human milk.8 During breast feeding, maternal status or intake of B vitamins (except folate), vitamin A, selenium, and iodine greatly affect breast milk concentrations of these nutrients. This can result in the baby consuming less than recommended and further depleting the mother's n utritional reserves.The daily energy intake of women who are breastfeeds should be increased when compared to women who are not pregnant and who are not breastfeeding. This can be seen in Table 2.8\\ Table 2. Summary of nutritional needs of pregnant and lactating women compared with non - pregnant adult women aged 19 to 50 years. CONCLUSION Efforts to reduce belief in food taboos still need to be done, especially taboo foods for pregnant and lactating women. This effort can be carr ied out by officers from the Health Service and Posyandu cadres online. The approach must be broader to the environment and must be with effective communication. Mothers The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 154 are also expected to improve literacy so that taboos/misconceptions are expected to be reduced.

This causes the mother or family to often give PASI for replace breast milk so that the baby is not fussy. Therefore, efforts were made to massage oketani and massage oxytocin to facilitate milk production. The purpose of this research is to analyze the difference between oketani massage and oxytocin massage on breast milk production in postpartum mothers. Methods quasi experiment , that is by design using the Non -equivalent control group pretest approach and posttest. The sample studied was 16 people who were divided into 2 intervention groups. 8 people in the oketani massage intervention group and 8 in the oxytocin massage interv ention group. Using univariate analysis and bivariate analysis , this study used thetest Shapiro Wilk to determine the normality of the data. This study uses a Dependent t test and Independent t test because the data is normally distributed with the help o f a computer program SPSS 25. Results after the oketani massage were p value 0,057 and after massage Oxytocin p value 0,058. p (0.05) with 95% Confident Interval, then H0 is accepted, where it can be concluded that there is no significant difference between Oketani Massage and Oxytocin Massage on the production of breast milk. Discussion Oxytocin massage can stimulate the release of the hormone oxytocin, in addition to releasing hormon es that can provide comfort to the mother. Oketani massage can increase the production of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin. Oketani massage also causes the mammary glands to become more mature and wide so that milk production can increase. Conclusion Oketani Massage and Oxytocin Massage are interventions that both have success on smooth milk production. Keywords : Oketani Massage, Oxytocin Massage, Breast Milk Production, Postpartum Mother INTRODUCTION According to WHO, globally, the average rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the world in 2017 was only 38%. This is not in accordance with the WHO target, The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 157 namely increasing exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months to at least 50%. This is the fifth tar get of WHO in 2025. Breast milk is a source of life for children which is very important in a child's first life, where in mother's milk there are many nutrients needed by children that support the growth and development of a child ( Imam et al, 2018). Ma ny complaints experienced by mothers at the beginning of the breastfeeding process include breast milk not coming out, breast milk in small quantities, blistered nipples and so on (Macheasy. et al., 2019). Many things can be done such as oketani massage an d oxytocin massage (Kusumastuti et al., 2018). Oketani massage is a massage around the breast from the 4th rib to the 9th rib. Oketani massage is a method to stimulate the strength of the pectoralis muscle to increase milk production and make the breasts s ofter and elastic so that it can correct problems lactation and makes it easier for the baby to suck breast milk besides massage can also provide comfort to the mother. According to research (Cho et al., 2012) there are differences after the oketani massag e, namely the increase in milk production, changes in the nipples and the absence of signs of breast milk dam symptoms after being given the oketani massage. Source: Cho et al 2012 Figure 1. Oketani Massage Oxytocin massage can affect the hormone prolactin which functions as a stimulus for breast milk production in mothers during breastfeeding. This action can also relax the mother and smooth the flow of nerves and milk channels The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 158 in both breasts (Umbarsari, 2017). Oxytocin massage in addition to red ucing tension and stress can also increase milk production (Jannah & Widyawati, 2017). Source: Ministry of Health RI, 2009 Figure 2. Oxytocin Massage METHODS Type of research is a quasi -experimental design using a non -equivalent control group pretest and posttest approach (Notoatmodjo, 2018). The sample studied was 16 people who were divided into 2 intervention groups. 8 people in the oketani massage intervention group and 8 in the oxytocin massage intervention group. The research instrument used was SOP for oketani massage and SOP for oxytocin massage, olive oil, observation sheets as well as cell phones and stationery in the form of pencils, pens and notebooks. The data that has been collected were analyzed by univari ate analysis with dependent t test and bivariate analysis using independent t test , this study used the Shapiro Wilk test to determine the normality of the data. by using the computer program SPSS 25. Ethics of data collection in research Ethical clearance , Informed consent, Confidentiality, Benefit, Justice The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 159 Research time is 1 month, from May - June 2021 RESULTS Table 1. Characteristics of Respondents Mostly, 11 respondents (68.75%) are in the age range of 20 -35 years, meaning that the average age of respondents in both the oketani massage group and the oxytocin massage group is in the healthy reproductive period and there are 9 respondents (56.25%) inc luded in Parity (Multipara) so that in this case the mother has have experience in terms of breastfeeding and milk production is better. Because the sample is less than 50, the .used test is Shapiro Wilk for normality test which serves to determine whethe r the data is normally distributed or not. From the results obtained before massage Oketani p value (0.366) and after massage Oketani p value (0.365) while before massage oxytocin p value (0.067) and after massage oxytocin p value (0.429) it can be conclud ed that the data is normally distributed (p > 0, 05) .

DISCUSSION Identifying the characteristics of maternal age and parity in breast milk production The results showed that the majority, namely 11 respondents (68.75%) were between the ages of 20 -35 years, this age was included in healthy reproduction. And there are 9 respondents (56.25%) with Parity (Multipara), where in this parity The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 161 the mother already has experience in breast feeding and breast milk production is better. The healthy reproductive age range is at the age of 20 -35 years, this period is the best period for pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. In a healthy reproductive period, breast milk production will be suff icient because the function of the reproductive organs can still work optimally according to research (Leiwakabessy & Azriani, 2020). The experience gained by multiparous mothers in caring for children affects knowledge about breastfeeding (Soetjiningsih, 2014). According to research by Frieska, et al (2018) in research (Leiwakabessy & Azriani, 2020) explaining that parity is related to early lactation. The beginning of this lactation will determine the success of the next breastfeeding. From the results of observations, the age of 20 -35 years is a mature age both in terms of thinking, physically, mentally and psychologically in readiness to face pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. Multipara parity has more knowledge and experience about the breastfeedi ng process so that it can be applied properly. Identifying breast milk production before and after the oketani massage Based on the results of the study, thevalue of p value = 0.000 (0.05) then Ha is accepted and H0 is rejected, which means that there is a difference in breast milk production before and after the oketani massage. This means that oketani massage can affect milk production. Oketani massage is a massage around the breast from the 4th rib to the 9th rib. Oketani massage can provide stimulation to the lactiferous canal. In accordance with research (Kusumastuti et al, 2018) oketani massage is very helpful for launching breast milk production and milk secretion so that it can prevent the occurrence of breast milk dams. The research of Yuliati, et al (2017) also explains that oketani massage will cause the mammary glands to become more mature and wide so that milk production can increase. And according to research by Macheasy et al (2018) that with oketani massage can increase the production of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 162 From the observations that oketani massage is very help ful in milk production and prevents and can treat breast milk dams. Identifying breast milk production before and after oxytocin massage Based on the results of the study, it was found that p value = 0.001 (0.05) then Ha was accepted and H0 was rejected, which means that there was a difference in milk production before and after oxytocin massage. This means that oxytocin massage can affect milk production. Oxytocin massage is a massage along the spine (vertebrae) to the 5th and 6th ribs in the mother's bod y. According to research (Jannah & Widyawati, 2017) that Oxytocin massage has been proven significantly through several studies to stimulate the release of the hormone oxytocin, in addition to the release of hormones that can provide comfort to the mother. The research (Sulaeman et al., 2016) also said that oxytocin massage was effective for increasing breast milk production in postpartum mothers. Likewise with research (Isnaini and Diyanti, 2015) oxytocin massage can stimulate the anterior and posterior pi tuitary to secrete the hormone oxytocin. Thus frequent breastfeeding is good and it is important to empty the breasts so that breast engorgement does not occur, but on the contrary accelerates the release of milk. From the results of the interview, it was found that oxytocin massage can make the body relax and provide a sense of comfort and reduce fatigue after giving birth. Analyzing differences in milk production after oketani massage and oxytocin massage Based on the research results, breast milk produc tion was obtained after Oketani massage p value = 0.57 and after oxytocin massage p value = 0.58 where p (0.05) with Confident Interval 95%, then Ha is rejected and H0 is accepted, that there is no significant difference between Oketani massage and Oxytoci n massage The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 163 on milk production. This means that Oketani massage and Oxytocin massage can both facilitate milk production. According to research (Buhari et al, 2018) there is a difference in the increase in the frequency of breastfeeding in mothers who receiv ed oketani massage compared to mothers who received oxytocin massage. There is a difference in the effectiveness of oxytocin massage with oketani massage with an average of 102.35 ml of oxytocin massage and an average of 78.35 ml of oketani massage with a difference of 24 ml on milk production in postpartum mothers (Andani, 2019) According to research (Sihotang et al, 2020) there is a difference breast massage with oxytocin massage. Where oxytocin massage produces more milk than breast massa ge. From the discussion above and the results obtained through observations made that Oketani massage and oxytocin massage are equally effective in smooth milk production and prevent breast milk damming. CONCLUSION There is no significant difference betwe en Oketani massage and Oxytocin massage on milk production. This means that Oketani massage and Oxytocin massage can both facilitate milk production. The difference between the two is that after the oketani massage is performed on the mother with the nippl es pulled inward ( inverted ) and stretched ( flat) for 3 consecutive days, the nipples that are pulled inward become stretched and the nipples that are stretched become prominent. Oketani massage can also treat breast milk dams so that milk becomes smooth. While Oxytocin Massage can provide a sense of comfort so that the body becomes relaxed.

The problem that is often faced by post partum mothers is that breastfeeding has not come out, this causes the failure of exclusive breastfeeding. For this reason, eff orts are needed in the form of interventions to help accelerate the release of breast milk and increase milk production, namely through oxytocin massage and marmet massage. Methods : aresearch method quasi -experimental with a randomized two group pre-test post-test design, the population of all healthy postpartum mothers and their babies. The number of samples is 20 people.sampling technique of sampling Total g. The research instrument is SOP and observation sheet. Univariate data analysis technique used the value of central tendency and bivariate analysis used dependent test,test tindependent t . The results of the study : The milk production before oxytocin massage was obtained ( mean ) 1.890 and after oxytocin massage the value (mean ) was 7.920. The milk production before the marbled massage was obtained ( mean ) 1,920 and after the marmet massage the value ( mean ) was 7,760. There are differences in breast milk production before and after oxytocin massage in maternity with p value 0.000 with a difference of 6.030. There are differences in milk production before and after marmet massage in maternity mothers with p value 0.000 with a difference of 5,840. There is no difference in milk production between oxytocin massage and marmet ma ssage in maternity mothers Mutia Clinic, North Penajam Conclusion: oxytocin massage and marmet massage are interventions that can increase milk production in postpartum mothers. Keywords: Oxytocin Massa ge, Marmet Massage, Breast Milk Production INTRODUCTION Referring to the 2025 Strategic Plan target of 60%, nationally the coverage of exclusive breastfeeding for infants aged less than 6 months of 54.8% has not reached the target. Of the 34 provinces, only 3 provinces have not reached the target, namely Gorontalo 34.2%, Riau 41.5% and Central Kalimantan 50.6%, The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 167 while in East Kalimantan province ASI coverage is 53.4% in 2019 (Ministry of Health RI, 2019) . Exclusive breastfeeding coverage in N orth Penajam Paser Regency in 2018 was 73.07% and in 2019 it was 73.60%, an increase of 0.53%. Exclusive breastfeeding coverage even though there was an increase, namely in 2019 by 73.6% but this value is still below the national target of 80%. (East Kalimantan Provincial Health Office, 2019). Efforts to facilitate breast milk production can be done with oxytocin massage (WHO, 2011). Oxytocin massage can reduce swelling ( engorgement ), reduce breast milk blockage, stimulate the release of the hormone ox ytocin, maintain milk production when mothers and babies are sick (Kemenkes RI, 2012). The oxytocin reflex can be stimulated by expressing and pumping breast milk for 10 - 20 minutes until the baby can suckle. In addition to oxytocin massage, it can also be done with a marmet massage technique which is a combination of blushing and massaging techniques (Roesli, 2012). Marmet massage causes the milk secretion reflex to be optimal. The principle aims to empty the breast milk from the lactiferous sinus which is under the areola so that it is hoped that emptying the breast milk in the lactiferous sinus area will stimulate the release of the hormone prolactin and will further stimulate the mammary alveoli to produce breast milk. Research conducted by Delima et al.

Discussion Characteristics of Respondents Based on the findings that most of the age 20 -35 years old in both the mothers who received oxytocin massage and those who received marmet massage. Maritalia (2017) also said that a healthy reproductive age will affect breast milk production because in addition to a healthy age, the psychological condition of mothers at the age of 20 -35 years is better prepared so that it affects the release of hormones that stimulate milk production. Based on the results of the study, the most parity was multiparity, both in mothers who received oxytocin massage and those who received marmet massage. It is clear that the majority of respondents are in parity groups are not at risk as proposed in Manuaba (2010) parity is good for pregnancy and maternity and breastfeeding is the parity of 2 to 3. Based on the results of educational research that most of the good high school education in the mother oxytocin massage and marmet massage. According to Notoatmodjo (2003), a higher level of education will make a person's knowledge better. Respondents with higher education are more likely to breastfeed because they have good knowledge about nutritious food. Based on the results of th e research, the most occupations were housewives, both for mothers who received oxytocin massage and those who did marmet massage. This explains that most of the respondents do not work. There is a relationship between mother's work and breastfeeding pract ice. According to Roesli (2013), working mothers tend to not pay too much attention to the care of their babies and are less patient in breastfeeding their babies so that they fail in the breastfeeding process (Trianita, 2018). The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 172 Milk production before an d after Oxytocin Massage The results showed that the average milk production before the intervention was 1.8 90 ml with a minimum milk production of 1.2 and a maximum milk production of 2.7, thevalue was standard deviation 0.5065. The results showed that in the group that received oxytocin massage before the intervention, there was still a small amount of milk coming out. Differences in milk production ma sing each different respondents from 1.2 ml to 2.7 ml, these differences s een in the different characteristics, wherein the new mothers breastfed their first child very small amount compared with mothers who already have children over 1. this difference is also evident from the age of the mother where the mother's age <20 years ba nyak whose supply out very little because milk production is also affected by maternal age. Based on the results of this study, it was shown that before the oxytocin massage on the first day 6 hours postpartum, the mother's milk production was still low. After that, an intervention in the form of oxytocin massage was carried out to the mother where the results of breast milk production increased where the milk production measured on day 2 increased on average to 7,920 with a minimum milk production of 6.4 ml and a maximum milk production of 9.3 ml. Thus, it was seen that there was an increase in breast milk production before and after the intervention. Breast Mi lk Production Before and After Marmet Massage The results showed that the average milk production before the intervention was 1.920 ml with a minimum milk production amount of 1.4 and a maximum milk production of 2.4, thevalue was standard deviation 0.3048 . The results showed that in the group that received marmet massage before the intervention, there was still little milk coming out. The difference in the milk production of each respondent differs between 1.4 ml to 2.4 ml, this difference can be seen in different characteristics, where in mothers who have just given birth to their first child the amount of breast milk is very little compared to mothers who already have more than 1. this difference i s The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 173 also evident from the age of the mother where the mother's age <20 years banyak whose supply out very little because milk production is also affected by maternal age. Effect of Oxytocin Massage on Breast Milk Production The results showed that there was an effect of oxytocin massage on breast milk production, seen from the significant difference in milk production before and after oxytocin massage, seen from p value 0.000 < 0.05. This proves that oxytocin massage is effec tive in increasing breast milk production in postpartum mothers, this can be seen from the milk production before the intervention has an average of 1.898 ml and after the intervention for 2 days and measured milk production increases to 7.920 ml or there is an increase in the amount of production Breast milk is 6.030 ml. Oxytocin massage is a massage carried out along the spine ( vertebrae ) to the fifth - sixth costae bone and is an effort to increase the production of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin af ter childbirth which aims to increase milk production (Rahayu et al., 2015). This oxytocin massage action is able to increase the production of the hormone oxytocin which can increase comfort for breastfeeding mothers. In addition, the production of the ho rmone oxytocin is also able to increase myoepithelial contractions of the mammary glands so that the production of breast milk is more and more smoothly. When breastfeeding mothers experience stress or discomfort, there will be an inhibition of thereflex let down so that it will reduce milk production. This is because there is a release of the hormone adrenaline which causes vasoconstriction of theblood vessels alveolar, so that only a small amount of oxytocin is able to reach the target organ of the myoepi thelium of the mammary gland. In addition, there will also be the release of the hormone noradrenaline in the central nervous system so that in accordance with the mechanism of action of these two chemical substances, it will cause thebe inhibited milk ejection reflex to and eventually breast milk production will decrease (Riordan & Auerbach, 2010). The results showed that oxytocin massage affects milk production, this is in The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 174 accordance with the theory put forward by Widyani (2015) that the working oxytocin hormone will stimulate smooth muscles to squeeze out the breast milk in the alveoli, lobes, and ducts containing breast milk and then expel it. through the nipple. One of the alternative actions taken to increase milk production is oxytocin massage (Lestari, 2017). Another benefit of oxytocin massage is that it can stimulate let-down reflexes in infants, provide comfort to mothers, reduce swelling in the breasts, reduce blockage of breast milk, stimulate the release of the hormone oxytocin, and maintain milk production when mothers and babies are sick (Delima et al., 2016). Effect of Marmet Massage on Breast Milk Production The results showed that there was an effect of Marmet massage on breast milk production seen from the significant difference in milk production before and after Marmet massage seen from the p value 0.000 < 0.05. The use of the marmet method is one of the efforts made to increase milk production. This method is often referred to as back to nature because it is simple and does not cost money and effectively stimulates the breasts to produce more breast milk (Norlita, 2017). Differences in the effectiveness of Oxytocin Massage and Marmet Massage Against Breast Milk Production The results of the research conducted to determine the effectiveness of differences in breast milk production between oxytocin massage and marmet massage were analyzed by independent t -test and the results showedvalue p = 0.709 0.05 whereanalysis independe nt t-testshowed no significant difference. There is a significant difference between oxytocin massage and marmet massage where the results of breast milk production in the group given oxytocin massage, which is 7.920, does not show a significant difference with the group receiving marmet massage, which is 7.780 or there is a difference of 0.1600 ml. Oxytocin massage and guinea pig massage are equally useful interventions in the lactation process, especially in the first days after birth because these two The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021 , Samarinda, Indonesia 175 interventions help maximize the release of lactation hormones such as prolactin and oxytocin (Guyton, 2015). CONCLUSION The characteristics of post partum mothers at the Bidan Mutia Clinic are mostly between 20 -35 years old in the oxytocin massage group as many as 5 people (50%) and the marmet massage group 6 people (60%), mostly multiparity in the oxytocin massage group as many as 5 people. (50%) and the marmet massage group were 4 people (40%), the education level of most of the senior high school student s in the oxytocin massage group was 5 people (50%) and the marmet massage group was 6 people (60%) and most of the occupations did not work or IRT at the oxytocin massage group was 8 people (80%) and the marmet massage group was 7 people (70%). Breast milk production before oxytocin massage obtained an average value (mean ) of 1.890 and after oxytocin massage the data obtained an average value (mean ) of 7.920. The production of breast milk before the marbled massage obtained the average value ( mean ) 1,920 and after the marmet massage the average value data (mean ) was 7,760. There is an effect of oxytocin massage on breast milk production in maternity with a p value of 0.000 with an average difference of 6.030. There is an effect of marmet massage o n breast milk production in maternity with a p value of 0.000 with an average difference of 5,840. There is no difference in the effectiveness of oxytocin massage and marmet massage on milk production in maternity mothers at Bunda Mutia Clinic, North Penaj am Paser Regency in a p value of 0.379.

Keyword : Moringa leaf, ASI, increasing infant weight. INTRODUCTION Breastfeeding is a time when a mother feels closer and intimate with her baby. During breastfeeding, there are many factors that can make the breastfeeding process successful or not. The mother's focus on caring for the baby during breastfeeding is also su pported by nutritional intake as well as socio - psychological support. There are many factors that can affect the productivity of breast milk. The factors that most influence the success of mothers in giving breast milk to their babies include insufficient milk production. (Jeniawaty et al., The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 181 2016) . Referring to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, breastfeeding is one of the first steps for a human being to get a healthy and prosperous life. In Indonesia, almost 9 out of 10 mothers have given breast milk, but the IDAI study found that only 49.8% gave exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months according to WHO recommendations. The coverage of infants receiving exclusive breastfeeding in Indonesia in 20 18 was 68.74%. This figure has exceeded the 2018 Strategic Plan target of 47%. The highest percentage of coverage of exclusive breastfeeding is in West Java Province (90.79%), while the lowest percentage is in Gorontalo Province (30.71%). A total of six pr ovinces have not reached the 2018 Strategic Plan target (Ministry of Health RI, 2018) . However, the same data source also shows that the percentage of exclusive breastfeeding decreases with increasing age of the child . For children under one month the percentage is quite high, 67%. This figure decreases to 55% in children aged 2 -3 months, and falls again to only 38% in children aged 4 -5 months. This means that the exclusive breastfeeding rate of 67% is actually a false achievement because it does not de scribe the percentage of babies who actually get only breast milk during the first 6 months of life, without other intakes such as formula milk (factory -made milk substitute), bananas, starch water, and food. /other drinks. Based on the Basic Health Resear ch in East Kalimantan Province in 2018, exclusive breastfeeding was not significantly increased, in 2013 by 69% to 70% in 2018 (Kemenkes RI, the Kutai Kartanegara Regency, exclusive breastfeeding in 201 8 was only 59% and decreased to 53% in 2019 (Kukar Health Office, 2019). When a Consuming foods that contain laktagogum is one of the efforts to increase milk production. Moringa leaves contain phytosterol compounds including campesterol, stigmasterol, and B-sitosterol which are laktagogums which can increase breast milk production. (Mutiara, 2011) . Preliminary study was conducted in the working area of the Loa Kulu Health Center, out of 10 acceptors to mothers who visited the KB Poly, 3 of them The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 182 dropped out of breast milk in the second and third months. One of the reasons is the lack of milk product ion in the second and third months, so mothers switch to formula milk. There alot of Moringa leaf plants in Loa Kulu sub -district makes researchers interested in researching Moringa leaf vegetables to increase breast milk production. In addition to overcom ing the production of breast milk, the utilization of natural resources and local wisdom is also carried out. This study aims to determine the effect of giving Moringa Leaf vegetables to breastfeeding mothers on increasing infant weight. RESEARCH METHODS The type of research used is Quasy Experimental research method with pretest and posttest design with control group design. The research location was conducted in the Loa Kulu Health Center Working Area in March -May 2021. The target population was all mothe rs breastfeeding babies under 6 months in the LoaKulu Health Center area. The affordable population in this study were breastfeeding mothers and infants under 6 months of age who gave birth normally in the working area of the Loa Kulu Health Center. In t his study, respondents were divided into 2 groups: the experimental group was treated with 1 serving of Moringa leaf vegetable per day (1x100 gr) for 7 days and the control group was only treated with regular food without treatment. The day before the stud y, all respondents (babies) were weighed, The number of research samples using Federer's formula so that each group contains 16 people, and the division of groups is done by using purposive sampling technique. Respondents in this study were breastfeeding m others aged 20-35 years, mothers and babies were in good health, babies born with normal weight, babies aged less than 6 months, babies had never received food other than breast milk, babies were given breast milk 6 times or more in a day, living in the working area of the Loa Kulu Health Center. In order to avoid bias in this study, the researchers excluded respondents from breastfeeding mothers with sunken/flat nipples, mothers who consumed milk or breast -feeding pills, and infants with congenital abnor malities (labio/labiopalatokisis). Mothers who use hormonal The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 183 contraception Pill / Combination Injection. The instruments used in this study were observation sheets, characteristic questionnaires, and baby scales. Baby scales have been tested and calibrated by comparing them with similar scales. Bivariate analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between 2 variables, namely each independent variable and the dependent variable. That is to assess the difference in the average treatment group before and after the intervention using the Paired T Test. Meanwhile, to assess the difference in the average increase in infant weight gain between the two treatment groups and the control group, the Mann Withney test was used. RESEARCH RESULT Univariate Analysis The data in this section describe the characteristics of mothers who are respondents in the study. Table 1 .

As for ag e31 Years old totaled 11 people (34.4%). Respondents' education reported that most of the mothers involved in this study had high education (SMA -Bachelor), 22 people (68.75%), with low education (SMP -SD) 10 people (31.25%) College education The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 184 12 people (20.0% ). The description of mothers about work was obtained as many as 8 people (25%) working mothers, and mothers who did not work or only took care of the household as many as 24 people (75%). According to parity, there were 14 (43.75%) Primigravida mothers an d 18 (56.25%) Multigravida mothers. Based on the baby's age, of the 32 babies studied, 12 babies (37.5%) were 1 -2 months old, and 20 babies (62.5%) were 3 -4 months old. Meanwhile, based on gender, 14 babies were male (43.75%), while 18 babies were female ( 56.25%). Bivariate Analysis Normality test Prior to the test using the formula, the normality test was previously carried out to test whether the data to be calculated was data that was normally distributed or not. The following are the results of the Normality test using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov formula. Table 2. Normality test Based on the results of the Normality Test, the value of the difference between the BB of the Treatment group and the Control group, it was found that the p value = 0.02 is smaller than 0.05, so the data is not normally distributed so that using the Mann W ithney test. Meanwhile, for the treatment group, BB before and after treatment, the p value = 0.200 is greater than 0.05, so it can be concluded Kolmogorov -Smirnov Note: Statistics df Sig BB BB after ,107 32 ,200* Normal BB difference ,204 32 ,002 Abnormal The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 185 that the data is normally distributed. Then the test that is used is the Paired T Test. Differences in the wei ght gain of infants in the treatment group and the weight in the control group with the Mann Withney test. Table 3. Analysis of differences in the weight gain of infants in the treatment group and the weight in the control group From the different test with the Mann Withney T test, it can be seen that the results of the p value = 0.00 < 0.05, thus there is a difference in the average weight gain of infants whose mothers received treatment with Moringa leaf vegetables (treatment gr oup) with infants whose mothers were not treated (group). controls). The increase in body weight in the group that was given the treatment had a difference of 206 grams higher than the group that was not given the treatment. This means that breastfeeding m others who are given Moringa leaf vegetables increase their breast milk so that they can increase the baby's weight. Increase in baby weight before and after treatment in the treatment group with paired t test . Table 4. Analysis of the baby's weight gain before and after treatment From the Paired T test, it can be seen that the p value = 0.00 <0.05 p is smaller than 0.05, meaning that there is a significant difference in the weight of the baby increase in bb Group N Sum rank P Value Treatment group 16 365.50 0.00 Control Group 16 159.50 Difference 206 N mean P (values) BB after treatment - BB before treatment BB Before 16 5850, 6118, 0.00 BB After 16 Average increase 268 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 186 before and after the mother received the treatment with Moringa leaf vegetables. In the tr eatment group, the average body weight before treatment was 5850 grams, while after treatment it was 6118 grams. The group that was given the treatment with Moringa leaf vegetables showed an average increase in body weight of 268 grams after being treated. DISCUSSION Analysis of the effect of giving Moringa leaf vegetables to breastfeeding mothers on increasing infant weight.

Because breast milk can meet all the baby's needs for the nutrients needed for the baby's growth and development, so that the ideal body weight can be achieved (Mutiara, 2011) . Moringa is a nutritional super plant. Nutrient content is spread in all parts of the Moringa plant and all parts of the plant can be consumed, from the leaves, bark, fl owers, fruit, to the roots like radishes. These compounds include nutrients, minerals, vitamins, and amino acids (Septadina & Murti, 2018) . The treatment group that received Moringa leaf vegetables showed a higher weight gain of 206 grams compared to the control group. Accord ing to Weni (2009) there are several factors that affect the increase in breast milk production, one of which is the food consumed by the mother. Moringa leaf vegetables affect breast milk production because they contain phytosterol compounds that function to increase and facilitate breast milk (Mutiara, 2011) . In addition, Moringa leaves also have very good nutritional content, s o that the production of breast milk in the treatment group contains high nutritional value. This is in line with research conducted by Johan (2018), which obtained p value of 0.038 <0.05 where The results showed that there were differences in breast milk p roduction as seen from the increase in infant weight, frequency of urination and defecation, and frequency of breastfeeding in the intervention group which were more significant than the The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 187 control group. The results of this study indicate that there is a sig nificant weight gain when the mother is given additional nutritional intake in the form of Moringa leaves . This is in line with research conducted by Zakaria (2016) which stated that the increase in breast milk volume before and after the intervention in the two groups was significantly different after being given Moringa leaf extract, namely p value 0.001 <0.0 5. With the complex content of Moringa leaves, breastfeeding mothers who are given Moringa leaf vegetables will produce more milk and of course sufficient nutrition for the baby, so that it can increase the baby's weight significantly. This shows that Moringa leaf as a super food is very good to be given to nursing mothers because it contains lagtogogum as a breast milk stimulant. The results of this study are also in line with research from (Purnanto et al., 2020) which indicates that the milk production at the post test stage has a mean value greater than the pre test stage, which is 6.50. This means that the consum ption of Moringa leaves has been shown to be able to increase the amount of milk production in breastfeeding mothers. Infant weight gain before and after treatment Efforts to increase breast milk according to Mansyur (2014) include breastfeeding the baby every 2 hours day and night for 10 -15 minutes at a time. Mother should increase rest and drinking. Consumption of balanced nutrition such as consuming additional calories at least 500 calories a day. By consuming Moringa leaves, the calories and nutrition of breastfeeding mothers can be met. With the fulfillment of nutrition for breastfeeding mothers, milk production will increase. This increase in milk production is expected to significantly increase the baby's weight. From the results of measuring the weight of infants who were included in the treatment group, the p value of 0.00 < 0.05 was obtained, so there was a significant difference before the mother was given treatment and after the treatment. According to Wong (2 009), the weight gain of infants 0 -6 months is The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 188 140-200 grams per week. From the results of the analysis, the average increase in infant weight before and after treatment was 268 grams. This means that there is a very significant effect on the increase in t he average weight of babies, which is as much as 268 grams in the group given the Moringa leaf vegetable treatment. Mother's nutritional status It will increase the quality and quantity of breast milk which will have a direct effect on the baby's weight. According to the Ministry of Health (2013) the increase in infant weight is influenced by internal and external factors. One of the external factors is nutrition during pregnancy and nutrition during infancy. One of the nutrients that babies get is from bre ast milk which contains all the nutrients that babies need. Breast milk production is strongly influenced by the food consumed by the mother on a regular basis. This is in line with research conducted (Aliyanto & Rosmadewi, 2019) which compared Moringa leaf vegetables with unripe papaya on breast milk production, the increase in infant weight in the group given Moringa leaf vegetables was higher than those given unripe papaya. While research by Putri & Fitria (2021) the results of the analysis of the group giving Moringa leaf extract and the group giving katuk leaf extract effectively were both able to increase breast milk production with an increase in baby weight. This is different from the result s of Mia & Pratiwi's (2020) study which stated that there was no significant difference in the weight gain of babies whose mothers received moringa leaf pudding with the control group with p value 0.317> 0.05. The difference in these results can be influen ced by how often the mother gives her breast milk, psychological factors and family support that are not examined as disturbing factors. (Pratiwi & srimiati, 2020) . In this study, the treatment group was given Moringa leaf vegetables as much as 100 grams per day, by including protein and carbohydrates into the Moringa leaf vegetable menu in the form of eggs and sugar. Moringa leaves contain calories, protein, carbohydrates, minerals, iron, vitamins and many more, including phytosterols that can increase breast milk production. By giving Moringa leaf vegetables regularly for 7 days, it can add nutrients needed by the The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 189 body including carbohydrates as an energy source for the body, protein needed to become energy for the body. Vitamins help chemical reactions in the body. Minerals work in the same way as vitamins. (Supariasa et al., 2016) . In line with research (Zakaria et al., 2016) Moringa leaves contain a variety of nutrients as well as a source of phytochemicals. Researchers make a different menu every day while maintaining the elements that must exist in the study, namely Moringa lea f vegetables as much as 100 grams per serving. From the results of the data obtained and comparisons with journals, other people's research and supported by book reference theories, the provision of Moringa leaf vegetables is very influential on increasing the baby's weight. Moringa leaves contain phytosterols which function to stimulate milk production in nursing mothers so that they can increase milk production The limitations of this study include: Researchers process Moringa leaves by mixing with other ingredients such as eggs, sugar and others then cooked by boiling or frying, researchers cannot ensure that the nutritional levels contained in these preparations are the same or reduced by processing different. The selection of respondent groups was not d one randomly but adjusted to the needs of the researcher so that the characteristics of the respondents were spread evenly between the treatment group and the control group. This study did not examine how much volume of breast milk and content of breast mi lk produced by mothers who were given the treatment of giving Moringa leaf vegetables so it is recommended for further researchers to continue this research more deeply. Researchers did not examine other factors that can affect the baby's weight gain such as other foods consumed by the mother during the study. In this study, the control group was not given any treatment at all as a comparison. CONCLUSION Breastfeeding mothers who were given Moringa leaf vegetable treatment The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 190 increased their milk production, resulting in a significant increase in body weight in infants. In conclusion, giving Moringa leaf vegetables to breastfeeding mothers affects the weight of infants 0 -6 months in the Loakulu Health Center Work Area. This s tudy only examines the effect of Moringa leaf vegetables with indicators of increasing infant weight, it is recommended for further researchers to continue this research more deeply by examining how much breast milk volume and milk content are produced by mothers who are given Moringa leaf vegetable treatment and control variables Other variables that can affect the baby's weight gain.

Fulfillment of good nutrition will affect the nutritional status of breastfeeding mothers and also for the growth and development of babies, therefore local food -based snacks are needed that can meet the nutritional needs of breastfeeding mothers. Moringa leaves are one of the local foods that are rich in nutrien ts. A study showed that the administration of Moringa leaf powder could increase the milk production of rats. This study aims to determine the level of preference and the calorie and protein content of the product. This research is experimental research wi th organoleptic tests and nutritional value analysis. The results of the organoleptic test showed that the trained panelists generally preferred the A1 Nugget Moringa Leaf formulation for color and aroma, while the panelists preferred the A2 formulation fo r taste and texture. In laboratory tests, it was found that formulation A1 has higher energy and protein content than formulation 2. It can be concluded that giving this product can help increase the energy and protein needs of nursing mothers and is accep table in terms of color, taste, texture, and aroma Breastfeeding mothers; Moringa oleifera; Moringa Leaf Nuggets; Rich Nutrient INTRODUCTION Chronic energy deficiency is one of the nutritional problems in Indonesia experienced by women of childbearing age, including breastfeeding and pregnant women. According to WHO, chronic energy deficiency is another term for protein - energy deficiency which is intended for women who are thin and less fat due to chronic lack of energy. Another study in Senegal by Joshi (2010), concluded that Moringa leaf powder has a positive effect on the prevention and control of malnutrition in infants, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers. Fulfillment of good nutrition will affect the nutritional status of breastfeeding mothers and the growth and development of babies. Therefore, it is necessary to The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 193 have high -energy and protein -based snacks based on local foods that can help meet the nutritional needs of breastfeeding mothers. Moringa leaves are one of the local foods that are rich in nutrients. Moringa plants have an important role in the prevention of metabolic diseases and several infectious diseases because they have the potential as a major source of several nutrients and therapeutic elements, including anti -inflammatory, antibiotics, and stimulate the immune system considering that the iron and protein content is quite high which has the potential for supplementatio n therapy for malnourished children (Fuglie, 2001). Moringa is known as a magical plant dubbed the Mother Best Friend and Miracle Tree because it is naturally proven to be a source of medicinal nutrients whose contents are outside the usual plant content ( Toripah, et al., 2014). The use of Moringa leaves is generally only limited to vegetables. In the fact Moringa leaves that are dried and made into powder can provide more benefits. Based on previous research, it showed that Moringa leaf flour had a yield of 20% (w/w), water content 6.64%, ash content 11.67%, fat Wijayanti, 2018). In other studies regarding the active substances contained in Moringa leaves that have the potential as antioxidants are v arious types of vitamins (A, C, E, K, B1, B6), flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and a study research by Yuliani and Dienina (2008) regarding the antioxidant activity test of Moringa leaf infusion, it was still smaller than vitamin C. Another study showed that the average volume of breast milk increased significantly were the group with Moringa flour increased 33.7% after being given the intervention (Zakaria et al., 2016). One form of processed food product that is in demand by all ages, from the lower economic community to the upper economic community is nuggets. The The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 194 addition of Moringa leaf flour to nuggets is attempted to fulfill balanced nutrition for breastfeeding mothers who require additiona l energy and protein. A study showed that the administration of Moringa leaf powder could increase the milk production of rats (Titi Mutiara K, 2011). For mothers who are breastfeeding for the first 6 months, they need an additional 330 kcal of energy and an additional 20 grams of protein from their normal daily needs. Mothers who are breastfeeding for the second 6 months require an additional 440 kcal of energy and 15 g of protein from normal requirements. In the process of making products that have low nu tritional content, the addition of Moringa leaf flour can help increase the nutritional value of these products. Research conducted by Augustyn, Tuhumury and Dahoklory (2017) obtained the results of the analysis of Moringa leaf flour: water content (9.57%); ash content (7.85%); carbohydrate content (51.91%); fiber content (4.03%); fat content (2.53%); protein content (26.02%); levels of vitamin C (1,92%). According to Sauveur and Broin (2010), 100 grams of Moringa leaves contain iron equivalent to 200 grams of fresh beef. This study aims to determine the level of preference and the calorie and protein content of the product. METHOD This research is experimental research with organoleptic tests and nutritional value analysis. The sample used in this st udy was Nugget with the addition of Moringa leaf flour. The tools used are digital scales, basin, steam pot, knife, tablespoon, aluminum foil, blender, filter, oven, and grater. The ingredients used are chicken, Moringa leaf flour, wheat flour, tapioca flo ur, breadcrumbs, milk powder, onions, garlic, pepper, salt, powdered broth, eggs, and carrots. Each sample was given a different treatment at the stage of the coating process where A1 (coated with breadcrumbs and wheat flour), and A2 (not coated with breadcrumbs and wheat flour), The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 195 The stages of making Moringa leaf nuggets: First, wash and dry the Moringa leaves then puree with a dry blender next strain to separate them from coarse powder. Second, puree chicken, breadcrumbs, tapioca flour, wheat flour, eggs, carrots, onions, stock powder, pepper, and salt, then wrap the dough in aluminum foil. Third, steam for 25 minutes, then remove and cut the nuggets. Fourth, the coating process is carried out according to each treatment where A1 is coated with breadcrumbs and wheat flour, while A2 is not coated with any flour. Fifth, fry the nuggets in hot oil, remove and serve RESULT AND DISCUSSION Colour Figure 1. Color preference chart Based on the results of organoleptic tests conducted by panelists on the color of Moringa leaf nuggets, the preference level of \"like\" was more in the A1 formulation with a percentage of 80% while the lowest percentage was in the A2 formulation of 20%. The color of the Moringa leaf nuggets, formulation A1, is the color most favored by the panelists. Panelists tend to like the color of the A1 formulation because the resulting color is more attractive, brighter, not darker than the A2 formulation. The color o f the A2 formulation is Nugget which is less attractive in The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 196 color because of the color given by Moringa leaf powder. So that panelists tend to choose a color that is commonly seen and attractive, namely yellow. Aroma Figure 2. Aroma preference rate chart Based on the results of organoleptic tests conducted by panelists on the aroma of Moringa leaf nuggets, the highest percentage of the \"like\" level of preference was in the A1 formulation of 66.67% and the A2 formulation of 60%. Based on these data, it can be seen that the addition of a dressing to the A1 formulation did not significantly affect the aroma of Moringa leaf nuggets. The strongest aroma of Moringa leaf nuggets is given by the aroma of chicken and fine spices such as onions and garlic. The stron g aroma given by the onions and garlic assesses liking for the aroma of the two samples more than the assessment of do not like it much and dislike. Taste Figure 3. Taste preference rate chart The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 197 Based on the results of organoleptic tests on the taste of Moringa leaf nuggets conducted by panelists on the level of \"like\" preference, namely the A1 formulation which was 66.67% smaller than the A2 formulation 86.67%. This is because the A1 formulation was coated with breadcrumbs and wheat flour while the A2 fo rmulation was not given any In line with the research of Evivie, et al. (2015) which states that the addition of different levels of Moringa leaf powder affects the acceptability of the product's taste. Because the addition of Moringa leaf powder affects t he taste of the nuggets. So that when given the addition of Moringa leaf powder, the taste formed on the nuggets is reduced. Texture Figure 4. Texture preference rate chart Based on the results of the organoleptic tests that have been carried out on the A1 and A2 formulations, there is a difference in terms of texture with the percentage of \"Like\" the A1 formulation 66.67% while the A2 formulation 80%. This is because the A1 formulation is coated with breadcrumbs which has a coarse and soft texture, while in the A2 formulation the texture is dominantly smoother and softer. The soft texture of Moringa leaf nuggets is due to the addition of Moringa leaf powder into the dough. Th is is due to a large amount of Moringa leaf powder added to the formulation.

This is in line with research conducted by Kholis and Hadi (2010) and Suarti et.al (2015) where each treatment with the addition of Moringa leaf extract and flour has a significant effect on the carbohydrate, prote in, mineral, and organoleptic content of biscuits. From the results of the nutritional value. It was found that the formulations A1 and A2 were sufficient to contribute to the addition of energy and protein for breastfeeding mothers, namely 330 kcal - 440 kcal and protein of 15 -20 g. CONCLUSSION Based on the table of nutrient analysis results. It can be seen that the amount of energy and protein in Moringa leaf nuggets per serving (200 grams) is 477.1 kcal and 21.4 g for the A1 formulation, while for the A2 formulation, it is 450.7 kcal and 20. 6 grams. It can be concluded that giving this product can help increase the energy and protein needs of nursing mothers and is acceptable in terms of color, taste, texture, and aroma.

Breastfeeding is proven to support optimal growth and development of babies and strengthen the immune system. It is very important for mothers to eat healthy foods according to their needs, especially at this time, many unhealthy snacks are popping up. The purpose of this research is to create a snack product for breastfeeding mothers in the form of healthy and economi cal manday dumplings. The methodology used is experimental research by making processed manday dumplings using 3 modified formulas. Subsequent, there is an organoleptic test and calculation of the nutritional value of the product. The results showed that t he selected formula 3 was acceptable in terms of taste, aroma, texture, and color. The nutritional contribution value of the product (per serving/50 grams) is also sufficient to meet the needs of breastfeeding mothers, namely energy: 211 kcal, carbohydrate s: 44.8 grams, protein: 4 grams and iron: 2.6 mg. The conclusion is that dumpling manday products can be used as an alternative snack to meet the needs of nursing mothers with good nutritional content, economical and environmentally friendly. Keywords : Siomay, Mandai, Breastfeeding Mother and Economical INTRODUCTION A healthy diet is eating foods that contain the right amount of calories and nutrients, such as carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals, fiber and water. Mothers who have not previously br eastfed the frequency of eating only three times a day, during breastfeeding the frequency of feeding should be increased. In addition to facilitating the production of breast milk, this right is also to accelerate the process of restoring health to the m other after childbirth (Krisnatuti & Hastoro, 2000). Maternal diet during breastfeeding is closely related to milk production. The content in breast milk is taken from the mother's body so that the adequacy of the nutrition that the mother consumes determi nes the optimal production of the The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 202 hormone prolactin and the work of the glands that play a role in producing breast milk. Therefore, the diet of breastfeeding mothers will indirectly determine the nutritional status of the baby. If breastfeeding mothers ha ve a good diet, the nutritional status of breastfeeding mothers and the nutritional status of infants will also be good (Manggabarani et al, 2018). Nowadays, breastfeeding mothers often consume food or snacks and do not pay attention to the mother's need t o increase milk production for her baby. Breastfeeding for babies is proven to support optimal growth and development of babies and can strengthen the baby's immune system so that they are not easily infected with disease and are smarter (Nurdiasnyah, 2011). Mandai is a traditional Kalimantan food made from jackfruit dami or cimpedak dami which is fermented with the addition of 15% salt, then 500 ml of water is added and soaked for 7 days for the fermentation process (Aswita Emmawati, 2015). The nutriti onal content of mandai is also very good. Utilization of this mandai is still lacking, even the skin on the cempedak fruit is immediately discarded and becomes waste. In addition, the price of mandai is very economical and can be used as a substitute for f ood such as chicken because the texture of mandai is similar to meat. Siomay is one of the foods that is loved by many people, especially breastfeeding mothers, besides being easy to process, in terms of taste it is also very delicious. So that it can be u sed as one of the derivative products of Mandai which can be an alternative and economical snack for nursing mothers. The purpose of this research is to create a snack product for breastfeeding mothers in the form of healthy and economical manday dumplings . METHOD The methodology carried out is experimental research by making processed manday dumplings using 3 modified formulas, then testing the organoleptic of manday dumplings to determine the feasibility of the product from maturity, appearance, aroma an d taste of mandai dumplings with students and lecturers majoring in nutrition and randomly sampled to become panelists. as many as 15 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 203 people. The Ingredients used in this product are Manday, wheat flour, tapioca flour, carrots, scallions, chicken eggs, gar lic, fried shallots, pepper, oyster sauce and seasonings. With the difference in formula 1: without using seasoning, pepper and oyster sauce. In formula 2: using seasoning, pepper and oyster sauce and 2 eggs. In formula 3: using seasoning, pepper and oyste r sauce and 1 egg. RESULT AND DISCUSSION Siomay Manday Performance Test Figure 1.

Siomay Manday Results Source : Data Primer 2020 Based on the results of organoleptic tests conducted by the panelists on the appearance of manday dumplings, the largest percentage for \"regular\" mandai dumplings was in experiment 3 with a value of 60%. Of the three studies that researchers conducted the third experiment was the best, because the value given by the respondent was better than the value given in The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 205 the first and second experiments. In the first experiment, spices such as garlic, fried shallots, scallions, pepper and seasoning were not added. In the second experiment, it had a higher taste value than the first experiment because it had been given seasoning. However, in the second experiment, too much water was added when b lended and too many eggs were added when mixing the dough, making the texture of the dumplings not chewy. Meanwhile, in the third experiment, the taste, maturity and appearance values were higher than the first and second experiments. Because, in the third experiment, the dough was given seasoning, so it had a better taste than the first experiment, and reduced the amount of eggs, making the texture of the dumplings more chewy than the first experiment. Mandai dumplings have a nutritional content that is no less good than dumplings in general, the nutritional content of this mandai dumplings are: Table 1.

REFERENCE Chasanah, U., International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 207 KALAKAI NUGGET ( Gea of East Borneo, Samarinda Abstract: Introduction : Based on data obtained from RAD -PG East Kalimantan Province, the percentage of pregnant women with anemia in 2017 was 30.24% in 2018 decreased to 29.12%. although it has decreased, it has become a public health problem because it is still above 5%. So when breastfeeding mothers can experience anemia. Anemia in breastfeeding mothers has a negative impact, because it can reduce the production, quality and quantity of breast milk. Kalakai nuggets are an innovation that can be used to prevent anemia, which are mixed with kalakai leaves with a mixture of tofu, carrots, and a little meat to add a savory taste. so that this Kalakai nugget innovation is expected to be accep ted by the community, especially pregnant and lactating women, which can be used to treat anemia, especially in nursing mothers. Methods: this research uses quantitative methods using LSD (Least Significance Difference) Organoleptic/Hedonic Test with descr iptive statistics and ANOVA test. Results: The overall test carried out starting from the taste, aroma, texture, and color of the kalakai nuggets showed a significant difference between the two samples, this can be seen from the significant column where th e data obtained was 0.042. Conclusion: Most of the panelists preferred the Kalakai nugget sample 2 as a whole compared to the Kalakai nugget sample 1 with a percentage of 80% and sample 1 nugget 76.7%. Keywords : Anemia, Breastfeeding Mothers, Kalakai (Ste nochlaena Palustris) INTRODUCTION East Kalimantan is a province with a fairly large area but access to health facilities is not optimal, so that nutritional problems have not been completely resolved. Iron nutritional anemia, especiall y in breastfeeding mothers, can occur due to iron deficiency during pregnancy. The results showed that all breastfeeding mothers (100%) had iron deficiency, with the recommended nutritional adequacy rate (RDA) 2004 of 32 mg per day. The incidence of anemia in breastfeeding mothers will reduce the production, quality and quantity of breast milk (Arisman, 2014). This is related to the work of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin, and will affect the fulfillment of the needs of infants aged 0 -6 month. Furtherm ore, mild The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 208 anemia in breastfeeding mothers only affects the quality of breast milk, while for severe anemia (<8 mg/dL) it will affect the quality and quantity of breast milk. So that new innovations are needed that can reduce anemia in breastfeeding mothers . According to TAD data (1981) in MaCKinnon (2000) Kalakai (Stenochlaena Palustris) is a source of food for the Dayak Kenyah tribe in Long S Barang (Apo Kayan) and Long Segar (S. Telen) East Kalimantan which can be used to treat anemia, especially in breas tfeeding mothers. Research conducted by Dessy Maulidya M, et al (2005) Fe content in kalakai leaves was 291.3 mg per 100 g and 221.4 mg per 100 g in stems. In addition, kalakai is also high in calcium, vitamins and antioxidants. Kalakai plant is a type of fern which has a length of 5 -10 m. Rhizome roots that climb high, strong, flat square. Petiole 10 - 20 cm. Single pinnate leaves 1.5 - 4 cm, shiny, young leaves are pink, red often purplish, soft and thin textured, as the leaves mature, the leaves change c olor to brown and eventually become tau green and hard. The leaves are lanceolate, the tip is tapered, the edges are serrated and the base is rounded (Steenis, 2003). The growth of kalakai is relatively limited on soils containing sulfuric acid compared to peat soils. This plant grows wild along roads in vacant lands that are not maintained or in forests that experience fires. Broadly speaking, there are 2 (two) types of kalakai, namely red kalakai and green kalakai. Red kalakai is a type of fern / ferns wi th a reddish color, while green kalakai is a type of fern / ferns with a green color. This plant has a relatively short harvest period of 4 -6 days, and grows well in areas that have high humidity such as peatlands. According to Irawan, et al., (2002) in th e Bulletin of Agricultural Technology Innovation (2013), kalakai contains high Fe and is rich in Vitamin C and Beta Carotene. From the nutritional analysis, it is known that red kale contains 41.53 ppm of high Fe, 4.52 ppm Cu, ppm. Research conducted by Maulidya, M., et al (2005).

Innovation in the form of nuggets was chosen because apart from having a delicious taste, it is easy to package and market. Nugget is defined as a processed meat product that is printed, cooked and frozen, made from a mixture of ground beef which is coated with or without the addition of other food ingredients and permitted food additives (BSN, 2002). Therefore, acc ording to the Indonesian National Standard 01 -6683, the nutritional content of nuggets is a maximum water content of 60%, a minimum protein content of 12%, a maximum fat content of 25% (BSN, 2002).

If usually kalakai is made into vegetables and chips, this kalakai is made in the form of soft textured nuggets so that all ages can enjoy it. The presence of the Kalakai nugget also opens great hope for fast food connoisseurs who are less fond of consuming vegetables, the Kalakai nugget is a solution to enjoy vegetables through nugget packaging that tastes and looks like meat nuggets. In addition, the kalakai nuggets will be able to compete with ready -to-eat foods on the market, which are mostly produced by foreign providers. The development of marketing technology is also inseparable from these kalakai nug get markets, in marketing we use social media to attract customers so that in its development these kalakai nuggets can survive and provide new innovations in the culinary field of Indonesia and abroad.

This food has many benefits, especially for breastfeeding mothers and can be modified into biscuits. The purpose of this study was to determine the organoleptic (acceptance) of biscuits modified with cork fish and pumpkin flour. This study used an experimental method, one treatment with four levels and two repetitions. The research was carried out in 2 stages, namely making biscuit formulas and then testing the level of preference (hedoni c). The concentration of substitution of cork fish and pumpkin flour in biscuits consisted of 5 levels, namely control (without substitution), 10%, 15%, and 20% and 40%. In testing the level of preference organoleptically, the panelists used were semi -trained panelists as many as 30 people, namely students of the Nutrition Department, Health Polytechnic of East Kalimantan. The results of the study by conducting organoleptic tests based on taste, color, texture and aroma. The higher the substitution concentr ation of cork fish and pumpkin flour, the lower the preference level. Biscuits with the substitution of cork fish and pumpkin flour are suggested to be an alternative food because they can provide sufficient energy for the needs of breastfeeding mothers. Keywords: Flour Substitution; Cork Fish; Pumpkin; Preference Level; Biscuits INTRODUCTION The basic capital of quality human formation starts from the time the baby is in the womb followed by the provision of breast milk (Prawirohardjo, 2013). According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health (2011), breastfeeding is a natural way to provide food and drink at the beginning of a baby's life. During breastfeeding, the nutritional needs of the mother ne ed to be considered because the mother must not only meet her needs but also produce breast milk (ASI) for her baby. According to the 2013 Riskesdas data, breastfeeding only in the last 24 hours for babies aged 6 months was only 30.2%, and the IMD data wa s only 34.5%, while the latest Riskesdas 2018 data for mothers who successfully gave exclusive The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 221 breastfeeding, there was a slight increase of 37.3 % and IMD data of 58.2% of course this result is far from the national target of 80% (Riskesdas, 2018). Many studies show that exclusive breastfeeding is beneficial for reducing infant morbidity and mortality, maximizing infant growth, increasing children's intelligence development, and can lengthen the distance between mother's pregnancies (Edmond et.al, 2006; K ramer et.al, 2002). Exclusive breastfeeding until the baby is 6 months old is very beneficial because it can protect babies from various death diseases (Damanik, R. et al, 2015). Another risk if the baby does not get exclusive breastfeeding is in the form of nutritional deficiencies, growth disorders and malnutrition (Lawrence, 2011). The fulfillment of physical or biological needs will have an impact on the body's immune system so that the body's resistance will be well maintained and not susceptible to disease (Sulistyoningsih, 2011). Biscuits are a type of product that is considered to meet the requirements to increase milk production, so it is suitable for use as additional food for breastfeeding mothers. Biscuits are a type of food ma de from wheat flour with the addition of other food ingredients by printing and heating processes. Biscuit formulations are usually made by enriching additional ingredients such as fat, sugar (or salt) and excipients. Biscuits are made with various types, mainly distinguished by the balance that exists between the main ingredients of flour, sugar, fat, and eggs. Then also additional ingredients such as chocolate, fruits, vegetables and spices that have an influence on taste (Johantika, 2002). Biscuits can b e enjoyed from infants to the elderly with different biscuit compositions according to their needs. Biscuits have a longer shelf life and are practical to carry as a healthy and nutritious food supply. Since 2009, wheat flour as raw material for biscuits h as not been obtained from domestic sources (imported), which means that it requires a large cost to obtain these raw materials. The development of biscuit production is increasingly varied, namely by substituting wheat flour with other flours that have hig h nutritional value and are easy to obtain in their production to increase nutritional value (Syamsiah, 2018). The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 222 Cork fish and pumpkin are local foods that are easy to find and rich in nutrients. This food has many benefits, especially for breastfeeding mot hers and can be modified into biscuits. Cork fish is another alternative as a source of albumin protein. According to Ulandari et al in Yulianti, 2018 Cork fish can increase albumin levels and endurance. According to Suprayitno, the content of essential am ino acids and non -essential amino acids in Cork fish has a much better quality than egg albumin. Cork fish has an albumin content of 62.24 g/kg (6.22%) (Yulianti, 2018). Protein in Cork fish serves to improve the quality of breast milk. Another feature of Cork fish is that it contains zinc. Zinc in Cork fish can also increase immunity in nursing mothers, so nursing mothers do not get sick easily and will be healthy. If the breastfeeding mother is healthy, the breastfed baby will also be healthy. Pumpkin is a type of vegetable plant, which has a fairly complete nutritional content, namely carbohydrates, protein, several minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins, namely vitamins B and C and fiber. Pumpkin is a source of vitamin A and high -carot ene content of 180.00 SI (about 1000 -1300 IU/100g of material) (Hendrasty, 2003). Pumpkin is a food that is rich in vitamins A and C, minerals, and carbohydrates. Pumpkin contains antioxidants as an antidote to various types of cancer. Based on the above background, researchers are interested in conducting research with the aim of knowing the organoleptic (acceptance) of biscuits modified with Cork fish meal and pumpkin. MET HOD This study used an experimental method, one treat ment with four levels and two repetitions. The research was carried out in 2 stages, namely making biscuit formulas and then testing the level of preference (hedonic). The concentration of substitution of Cork fish and pumpkin flour in biscuits consisted of 5 levels, namely Control (without substitution), 10%, 15%, and 20% and 40%.

The Cork fish flour used is the result of fresh cork fish (Ophiocephalus striatus) and made by steaming, taking the meat, drying, grinding, and sifting. Meanwhile, the pumpkin flour used is the result of flouring fresh ripe pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) which is made by thinly sliced, dried, gr ound, and sieved through a 60 mesh sieve. Cork drying fish meal made with hot display at a temperature of \u00b1 120 0 C for \u00b1 2 hours, while the pumpkin flour at a temperature of \u00b1 120 0 C for \u00b1 4 hours. RESULT AND DISCUSSION Biscuit Making In making Biscuits the ingredients used are Wheat Flour, Fish Flour, Pumpkin Flour, Refined Sugar, Maizena, Cheese, Unsalted Butter, Margarine and Eggs. The manufacturing process begins by weighing the ingredients and then mixing the wet ingredients first using a m ixer. After that, it was mixed with dry ingredients (flour) according to the control formulation, 10%, 15%, 20% and 40%. After mixed well, weighed as much as 15 grams fo r each biscuit and then formed . The biscuit dough that has been formed is then baked in the oven at 120 0 C for 20 minutes. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 224 Panelist Likeness Level Test Organoleptically In testing the level of preference organoleptically, the panelists used were semi -trained panelists as many as 30 people. The selected panelists are students of the Applied Nutrition and Dietetics Study Program of the Poltekkes Kaltim who are healthy, do not smoke, and are not hungry/full. The organoleptic hedonic test was carried out by presenting five biscuit formulas to be assessed from the aspect of color, aroma, texture, taste, and overall ( overall) in the form of a score / level of preference for the biscuit formula. The results of the panelists' assessment were then processed using the Krusskal - Wallis one-way ANOVA test to determine the most preferred biscuit formula . Table 2. Average Panelist's Preference Level for Biscuit Formula Parameter Biscuit Formula Kruskall - Wallis test ( p = Primary Data, 2020 Note: Numbers followed by the same letter in the same row indicate that they are not significantly different based on the Mann -U Whitney 5% testThe International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 225 Based on the statistical tests contained in table 2, it can be seen that based on the color parameter, the most preferred formula is biscuit formu la with an average of 4.43, then 10% biscuit formula with an average of 4.20 then 15% and 20% formula with an average of 3.67 and finally 40% with an average value of 3.23. The level of preference for biscuit formulas based on color was significantly different with p = 0.000. The formula that was not significantly different from the control color preference level was the 10% formula. The most preferred biscuit aroma was 10% biscuit aroma with an average of 4.50 then the control formula with an average o f 4.47. The aroma preference levels for the 15%, 20% and 40% formulas were 4.23 and 3.87. There was a significant difference in the level of preference for aroma on the biscuits with p value = 0.000, the 10% formula was not different from the control biscu its based on the Mann Whitney test. For texture, control biscuits remained the most preferred biscuits with an average of 4.47 then 10% biscuits (4.07), 15% biscuits (3.97), 20% biscuits (3.90) and finally 40% biscuits. (3.77). Based on statistical te sts, there was no significant difference in the level of preference of the panelists on the texture of the biscuit formula with p = 0.126. For the Flavor parameter, the level of preference for the formula was significantly different with p value = 0.000 wh ere the most preferred formula was the control biscuit formula with an average of 4.57 then 10% Biscuits with an average of 4.20. Biscuits 15%, 20% and 40% each had an average taste preference of 3.97, 3.53, and 3.33. Test Mann Whitney -U showed that the level of preference taste different formula of control is the formula Confectionery 15%, 20% and 40% in the ratings liking for overall properties that exist in each formula ( Overall there is significant difference (p = 0.000) in which formula the mos t preferred overall was the control biscuit formula with an average of 4.37 then the 10% biscuit formula by 4.33 then the 15%, 20% and 40% biscuit formula respectively 3.93, 3.60 and 3, 53. The distribution graph of the panelists' preference level on the b iscuit formula can be seen in Figure 1 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 226 Figure 1. Like Level Graph Biscuit Formula Based on the Kruskal -Wallis test (p=0.05), the substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour had a significant effect on the biscuit preference level at concentrations of 15%, 20% and 40%. Substitution at the level of 10% did not significantly affect the level of preference for color, aroma, texture, taste, and overall biscuits . Color Color is the earliest organoleptic parameter identified by consumers. Usually many product properties have to do with color. After seeing the color, there will be interest because color is related to the taste of a product. The greater the addition of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour up to 40%, the less favorable the color of the biscuits is because the color of the biscuits is getting darker. This is because the color of the pumpkin is yellow so that the greater the addition the more yellow it is to the biscuit, the baking process makes the color of the biscuit darker. Although there was a decrease in the level of preference for biscuit color, the change did not significantly affect the 10% substitution (P>0.05). The results of this study are in accordance with research conducted by Elvizahro, (2011) where the add ition of pumpkin flour to biscuits makes the color of the biscuits yellow with a level of preference rather than liking. Pumpkin flour contains beta -carotene which is orange in color. The longer the beta -carotene bond, the more orange the color of the food COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 227 Scent The substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour had a significant effect on the level of preference for biscuit aroma (P=0.000). The greater the substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin up to 40%, the less favorable the biscuit aroma. This is because the aroma of pumpkin flour and Cork fish will increase in biscuit products. Cork fish has a fishy smell of fish and pumpkin flour has a bad smell. The most preferred substitution product was biscuits with 10% formula and the level of p reference was not significantly different from control biscuits. Texture The substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour had no significant effect on the level of preference for biscuit texture (P=0.126). The greater the substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour, the less favorable the texture of white biscuits. This is because the crunchy texture of the biscuits will decrease with the addition of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour. This change in texture was also associated with an increase in the moisture content of the biscuits, but the difference in the level of preference for the biscuit texture was not significantly different. The flouring process using mesh 60 also affects the texture of the biscuits by substituting Cork fish meal and pump kin, where the resulting texture is less smooth and gritty than wheat flour. Flavor Taste is an important factor in determining the decision for consumers to accept or reject a food. Even if the other parameters are good, if the taste is not good or not l iked, then the product will be rejected. There are four basic types of taste that are recognized, namely sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. While the other flavors are a combination of the basic taste. The taste of the biscuits is sweet and savory which comes from powdered sugar, pumpkin flour and cheese. In the substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour, there was a significant difference between the substitution biscuit formula and the control The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 228 biscuit (P=0.000). This is because pumpkin and fish Co rk give a new taste to the biscuit substitution. The higher the substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin, the lower the level of preference. The level of taste preference between control biscuits and 10% formula biscuits was not significantly different ( P>0.05) based on the Mann Whitney test . Overall ( Whole) For the parameter of preference for all biscuit components ( overall) it can be concluded that there is a significant difference between control biscuits and substitute biscuit formulas. Overall, the biscuits favored by the panelists were control biscuits, then biscuits with the addition of 10%, then 15%, then 20% and the last one was 40%. Based on the Mann Whitney test, it was found that the biscuits that were not different from the control biscui ts were the 10% formula biscuits. Based on the research conducted, substitution of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour in biscuits significantly affected the level of preference for color, aroma, taste and overall of biscuits (P=0.000) where the greater the f lour substitution, the lower the level of preference for biscuits. Changes in the nature of the biscuits produced by substitution of fish meal and pumpkin were not preferred by the panelists also related to the panelists' eating habits. Biscuits without the addition of pumpkin and fish Cork are biscuits that are usually consumed by panelists so that when biscuits are substituted, panelists will compare their properties with biscuits that are usually consumed daily. CONCLUSION The substitution of Cork f ish meal and pumpkin flour had a significant effect on the level of preference for color, aroma, taste, and overall biscuit (P<0.05) but did not have a significant effect on the level of preference for the texture of white biscuits (P=0.126). The higher th e substitution concentration of Cork fish meal and pumpkin flour, the lower the preference level.

The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 231 UTILIZATION OF RED DRAGON FRUIT peel and kelakai leaves are plants that have benefit for health, but have not been utilized optimally in commercial products such as functional drink. Both hav e been shown to contain high antioxidant compounds, while the kelakai also contain high levels of Fe (41.53 ppm) and folic acid (11.30 ppm). Research has shown that kelakai increases the hemoglobin levels and stimulates the production of breast milk for br eastfeeding mothers. This study aims to make a functional drink in the form of teabags made from red dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves which have antioxidants and good sensory reception. This was an experimental study, creating the product, testing of a ntioxidant content and organoleptic properties. The tea formulation chosen was using a ratio of 75% dragon fruit peel and 25% kelakai leaves. The antioxidant activity test was carried out quantitatively using the DPPH method. It was found that the products had good antioxidant activity to ward off free radicals at a concentration of 150 g/mL (7.19% inhibition). The results of the organoleptic test showed that the product was acceptable to the panelists for all parameters. It conclude that this product poten tial developed as functional drink for breastfeeding mothers. Keywords : Antioxidants, Dragon Fruit Peel, Functional Drinks, Kelakai Leaves, Tea INTRODUCTION Breastfeeding is the process of giving milk to babies from the breasts. Breast milk is a white liquid produced by the mother's breast glands through the breastfeeding process. The most important nutrient that is obtained for the first time when a baby is b orn is breast milk, because in addition to containing a fairly high nutritional value, breast milk also contains immune substances that will protect against various types of diseases that can inhibit the baby's growth. Food is one of the main factors that affect the quality of mother's milk. Some medicinal plants can be used to improve the quality and expedite the production of breast milk. Indonesia has a very large biological wealth, including local fruits and The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 232 vegetables (Supriatna, 2008). Dragon fruit pl ant is a cactus that has fruit and flowers. One of the dragon fruit that is currently widely cultivated in Indonesia is the red dragon fruit ( Hylocereus polyrhizus ) (Ministry of Agriculture, 2009). The part of the dragon fruit that is widely used is the flesh. Until now, dragon fruit peel which weighs 30% - 35% of the fruit weight has not been utilized and is only disposed of as garbage, even though dragon fruit peel also has potential as a medicinal ingredient because it contains cyanidin 3 et al., 2011). In addition to dragon fruit, there are types of plants typical of Kalimantan which are widely used as medicinal plants, these plants are kelakai or often also called haruan nails (Stenochlaena palustris ). Kelakai is also one of the plants that are rich in health benefits. This plant produces fertile leaves containing sterile leaves and spores (Giesen et al., 2006). The bioactive substances from these leaves are terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolics (Ho et al., 2010). The extract can be used as an anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, and antioxidant according to empirical studies (Chai et al., 2015). The active substances present in mantle such as phenolic compounds, tannins, and -carotene can reduce free radicals. Research on the bioactivity of the worms also shows antibacterial (Erwin e t al, 2016) and antifungal properties. Kelakai also contain high levels of Fe (41.53 ppm) and folic acid (11.30 ppm). Research has shown that kelakai increases the hemoglobin levels (Sayny, 2020) and stimulates the production of breast milk for breastfeeding mothers. The utilization of the two plants above is still not maximized in accordance with their great potential for health, so that appropriate modifications of food products need to be carried out to maximize their utilization more optimall y and can be felt directlyby the public, such as the manufacture of powdered or instant beverage products. Tea is the most consumed beverage in the world, after water (Sharma et al., 2013). Tea in general is a powder derived from the leaves of plants that are The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 233 processed by drying. Tea processing in principle is to dry parts (sheets) of plants in the form of leaves and skins with the aim of reducing the water content in these parts (Ghani, 2002). As development innovation products of natural ingredients, this research aims to get the combination tea of dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves as functional drink with antioxidant benefits and good sensory reception values. It is hoped that it can be developed as a standardized functional drink for breastfeeding mothers. METHOD Design, location, and time The research conducted was experimental, namely the manufacture of tea products with a combination of dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves are obtained in wild land along the roads of the Samarinda, testing of antioxidant content, and testing of organoleptic properties. The tea formulation chosen was using a ratio of 75% dragon fruit peel and 25% kelakai leaves. based on research by Ihromi, et al (2019) regarding Ashitaba Leaf Herbal Powder Tea and Dragon Fruit Peel.This study was taken on July 2021. Location of this study are in food technology laboratory of Nutrition Department, Health Polytehnic of East Borneo and chemistry laboratory of Agricultural Technology Department, Agricultural Polytechnic of Samarinda. MATERIALS AND TOOLS The material used in this method is red dragon fruit peel obtained from fruit market seller in Samarinda.

The tools used in this study were a knife, cutting board, oven, 20x20x2cm aluminum pan, analytical scale, digital scale, blender, plastic, basin, furnace, desiccator, spoon, utensil. writing, paper, aluminum foil, while the tools for analysis include vortex, The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 234 thermometer, oven, micropipette, volume pipette, spectrophotometer, measuring flask, cuvette, rubber pump, tip, measuring cup, test tube and equipment for sensory evaluation. PROCEDURES Tea Bag Making The skin of the dragon fruit is separated from the flesh and kelakai leaves are separate d from the stalk, then dried at 60oC. After drying, blend until smooth. Then the dragon fruit peel (75 g) and the kale leaves (25 g) were weighed, mixed, and put in a tea bag of 2.5 g each per bag. Antioxidant Activity Test with DPPH Antioxidant activity was tested with 1,1diphenyl -2-picrylhydrazyl reagent [6]. A total of 1 mL of methanol extract from tea with a concentration of 50 g/mL. 75 g/mL, 100 g/mL, 125 g/mL and 150 g/mL were added to 2 mL of 0.1 mM DPPH. The mixture was t hen shaken and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark. This solution was then measured its absorbance at 516 nm. DATA ANALYSIS Free radical activity of DPPH (2,2diphenyl -1-picrylhydrayl) was analyzed based on linear regression equation followed by determination of the median value of Inhibitory Concentration (IC50). RESULT AND DISCUSSION Organoleptic Test Organoleptic test or commonly called sensory test is a test method using the human senses as the main tool for measuring product acceptance. Based on the results obtained the following data : The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 235 Figure 1. Tea Steeping Taste Assessment Res ults Taste Taste is the most important oraganoleptic assessment that will determine whether a product is accepted or not in the community. In general, there are four agreed flavors, namely sweet, bitter, sour, and salty. Sesnsitivity to taste is found in the taste bu ds on the tounge. Based on the results of organoleptic properties research conducted on 30 panelists, it showed that the panelists' level of preference for the brewed taste of the dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves tea was as many as 4 panelists felt somewhat displeased, 6 panelists felt normal, 6 panelists liked it somewhat, 7 panelists liked it. , 5 panelists feel very like it, and 2 panelists feel very much like it. This shows that the taste of the steeped tea is acceptable but still requires the addition of either flavoring or the like in order to be liked by all panelists. 012345678 Rather dislike Normal Rather like Like Very like Very much likeTotal of panelist Preference levelTasteThe International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 236 Figure 2. Tea Steeping Aroma Assessment Results Aroma The aroma of food products can be influenced by the ingredients used in the processing. The use of high temperatures in food processing causes volatile compounds to be lost due to the evaporation process (Rahmi, 2004). The aroma of the drink can affect the freshness of the drink. 30 panelists indicated that the level of preference of the panelists on the aroma of the steeped tea combination of dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves was 1 panelist stating that they did not like it, 7 panelists stated that they did not like it somewhat, 6 panelists said it was normal, 4 panelists said they liked it somewhat, 9 panelists said they liked it, 1 panelists stated that they liked it very much, and 2 panelists stated that they really liked i t. This shows that the aroma of the tea produced can be accepted by the panelists but still requires the addition of other ingredients so that the aroma produced can be in accordance with the tastes of each panelist. 012345678910 Dislike Rather dislikeNormal Rather like Like Very like Very much likeTotal of panelist Preference levelAromaTotal of panelist The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 237 Image 3. Tea Steeping Colour Assessment Results Steeping Color Based on the results of organoleptic properties research conducted on 30 panelists, it showed that the level of preference of the panelists to the color of the tea infusion of the combination of dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves was as much as 2 panelis ts gave a score of somewhat like, 7 panelists liked, 8 panelists very liked, and 13 panelists liked very much. This shows that the color of the tea is very attractive to the panelists. Figure 4.

Antioxidant Test In this study, antioxidant testing was carried out on 1 sample, namely in 1 bag containing 2.5 grams of a combination of dragon fruit peel tea and kelakai leaves which were then brewed with 100 mL of w ater. Antioxidant activity was tested with 1,1 -diphenyl -2-picrylhydrazyl reagent. A total of 1 mL of brewed tea from a combination of dragon fruit peel and kale leaves with concentrations of 50 g/mL, 75 g/mL, 100 g/mL, 125 g/mL and 150 g/mL were added to 2 mL of 0.1 mM DPPH. The mixture was then shaken and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark. This solution was then measured its absorbance at 516 nm. The comparison compound used is vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin C is a natural antiox idant compound that is often used as a comparison compound in testing antioxidant activity, because natural antioxidant compounds are relatively safe and do not cause toxicity (Lung and Destiani, 2017). The following are the absorbance results obtained fro m the test results of vitamin C samples using a UV- Vis spectrophotometer (Table 1). Table 1. Absorbance of DPPH on Vitamin C Concentration (\u00b5g/mL) Vitamin C Absorbance Control see the results of the reduction of DPPH free radicals in this study, brew The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 239 the tea that has been made with a brewing time of thirty minutes at a temperature of 100oC. After obtaining the absorbance measurement results using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, calculations were carried out using the % inhibition formula. The test results using a UV -Vis spectrophotometer are presented in (Table 2). Table 2. Absorbance of DPPH in Herbal Tea Steeping Concentration (\u00b5g/mL) the absorbance to see the high antioxidant activity of the infusion of dragon fruit peel tea and kelakai leaves, it can be seen from the IC50 value by making a curve with a ratio of % inhibition (y) and concentration (g/mL) in the sample. So that the linear regression equation y=bx +a will be obtained. Then the curve of the relationship between % inhibition and concentration (g/mL) in the brewed tea sample is presented in image 5 and 6. Figure 5.

It can be seen that at a concentration of 150 g/mL has the ability to inhibit free radicals of 7.19%. The greater the concentration, the higher the inhibition ability. Although the effectiveness of the brewing tea is not as high as pure vitamin C, the serving of 2.5 g/100 ml (25,000 ppm) ready to serve is able to ward off free Sample 8.00 y=0.0276x+2.9518 R\u00b2=0.9837 6.00 4.00 2.00 50 100 Concentration(\u00b5g/mL) 150 200 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 241 radicals. Compared to similar research conducted by Purwanti (2019), the antioxidant ability of herbal teas is higher than black tea with 3 different packaging trademarks, namely Goalpara black tea (A), Walini black tea (C) from PTPN VIII Bandung, Dempo b lack tea (B) comes from PTPN VII South Sumatra, DPPH (Sigma -Aldrich). CONCLUSION The combination tea of dragon fruit peel and k elakai leaves is an innovation made as a functional drink that can boost the immune system for breastfeeding mother. With the potential of the nutrients it contains in the form of natural antioxidants. Based on the research that has been done, it can be conclude d that the herbal tea of dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves contains natural antioxidants that are good for consumption. The results of the organoleptic test carried out on 30 untrained panelists obtained the average results, namely the level of preferen ce of the panelists to taste was somewhat like, aroma was rather like, powder color was very like, and steeping color was very like . In addition to having the main advantage as a natural antioxidant functional drink if consumed 2 -3 times a day, the combina tion of dragon fruit peel and kelakai leaves tea also has several other advantages, including as a food diversification product based on local local food, as well as empowering fruit waste that has the potential for health.

Recorded in 2020 for East Kalimantan Province the coverage of exclusive breastfeeding in infants <6 months is 76.1%. A form of eff ort to help increase exclusive breastfeeding coverage is by providing nutritious food for breastfeeding mothers, one of which is by local food modifications that have a function as galactogogue and immunity for breastfeeding mothers. This research aims to produce snack bar products into galactogogue food and immune enhancers and have good nutritional value. The methodology was experimental research by making processed snack bars using a modified formula of tolo beans: red beans: banana heart each 45%: 30%: 25%. Next is organoleptic testing and calculation of the nutritional value of the product. Obtained the result that the formula chosen can be accepted in terms of taste, aroma, texture, and color. The contribution of the nutritional value of the product is also good, especially nutrients that act as galactogogue and increase immunity. In conclusion, snack bar products can be used as galactogogue alternative food and immune enhancers for breastfeeding mothers in this pandemic period because of high palatabil ity and the contribution of good nutrition. Keyword: Breastfeeding; Tolo Bean; Red Bean; Snack Bar; Galactogogue INTRODUCTION Based on the Performance Report of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia shows that nationally, the coverage of infants aged less than 6 months who get exclusive breast milk in 2020 is 66,1%. Recorded for East Kalimantan Province the coverage of infants aged less than 6 months who get Exclusive Breast milk in 2020 is 76,1%. The Covid -19 pandemic is one of the factors inhibiting this goal, the pandemic resulted in social r estrictions that have an impact on the implementation of health services in integrated service posts and so The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 245 on (Kemenkes RI, 2020). Another fact in the field is that there are still many mothers who experience inhibitions to breastfeed their babies exclusi vely until the completion of one of them is due to lack of breast milk production (Winatasari and Mufidaturrosida, 2020) . A form of effort to help increase exclusive breastfeeding coverage is by providing nutritious food for breastfeeding mothers who have the benefit of increasing breast milk production (galactogogue) and immunity. Nutrition is a very important element so it must always be fulfilled so that the baby does not experience malnutrition. Newborn babies up to 6 months only need breast milk as a complement to their nutritional needs (Savitri, Dewi and Amalia, 2019) . In the current pandemic, the mother needs to pay attention to the body's immunity to provide breast milk to the child in good health, therefore it is necessary to intake nutrients that can increase immunity, namely proteins that play a role in the formation of specific immunoglobulins (Ig) that play a role against viruses, as well as so me vitamins and minerals that fight and inhibit the growth of viruses and bacteria including vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, and iron. The best way to get these nutrients is through the consumption of sources of nutrients in foods such as fruits and nuts (Sumarmi, 2020) . Red beans, tolo beans, and banana blossom are among the local Indonesian food whose availability is abundant. Tolo beans have the second -highest protein content under soybeans. But unfortunately, until now it s utilization has not been maximal and is seen as one eye by some people. It is added that tolo beans contain a lot of nutritional content. One of them is to have low -fat levels, so it can reduce the negative effects of the use of fatty food products (Tunjungsari, Tunjungsari and Fathonah, 2019) . Red beans also include local food that is easy to get because it has been grown in all provinces in Indonesia. According to (Jaidin, 2020) Dried red beans are a great source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, B vitamins (es pecially folic acid and vitamin B1), calcium, phosphorus, iron, and protein. Red beans are also one type of nuts that contain polyphenol bioactive compounds that have an antibacterial activity that inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria. The high prote in content The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 246 in nuts will help synthesize breast milk -producing hormones (prolactin) as well for the release of breast milk (oxytocin) for breastfeeding mothers (Winatasari and Mufidaturrosida, 2020) . The blossom of a banana is a flower produced by a banana tree that serves to produce bananas. Banana blossom are generally discarded, although the potential is used as an alternative food (Intisari and Rosnina, 2019) . In terms of its characteristics, banana blossom is safe to consume by breastfeeding mothers and can facilitate the blood cycle (anticoagulant). Smooth blood circulation can prevent the blockage of the milk ducts to facilitate the breast milk channel (Suksesty, 2020) . The three potential foods above through food modification techniques can be develo ped into alternative foods that are good for immunity and galactogogue for breastfeeding mothers. Food diversification with food modification techniques, one of which is flour -based potentially developed because it is easily accepted by the community (Siahaya, Persulessy and L ilipory, 2021) . A touch of technological innovation towards non -rice food derived from local food sources is necessary. One of them can be done by introducing local food as a functional food source (Hassan, 2014) . One of the final forms of modified food products that are familiar and practical is the snack bar. The snack bar is a stem -shaped snack made from a mixture of some dry ingredients such as cereals, nuts, an d fruits that are commonly consumed in between meals (Putri, Hermanto and Ulfah, 2020) . According to (Aini, Sulaeman and Sinaga, 2020) The snack bar is one of the foods that can be modified using local food ingredients. The selection of snack bar types because can b e used as an alternative to interludes that contribute \u00b110% of energy needs per day and is of good high nutritional value for breastfeeding mothers. Based on the background above, making the reason and goal of the Researcher is to produce snack bar product s resulting from the application of food modification techniques that can increase breast milk production (galactogogue) and have good nutritional value and as an alternative snack to increase immunity.

Then the banana heart is steamed for 5 minutes. Once steamed, place the banana heart on a baking sheet that has been given a clean paper base and th en dried in the sun for \u00b1 24 hours. Then the heart of the banana has dried in the oven for 2 hours. Then it is set aside and sedated with a sying of 80 mesh. Making Snack Bars The making of a snack bar starts with the cooking of margarine, honey, and banan a juice on top of the Teflon that has been hot to boil and mix well. Put the flour in a container with a formulation of 45% Tolo bean flour (45 grams), 30% red bean flour (30 grams), and 25% banana heart flour (25 grams). Add the cooked margarine, honey, a nd banana juice to a container filled with flour then mix well until it forms a rinsed dough, print the dough in a baking sheet that has been given a baking paper base, bake using the oven for 20 minutes over medium heat. Remove the cooked dough and serve with pieces per serving/ 60 grams. Then organoleptic tests were conducted / hedonic quality snack bar LOMESA on 30 untrained panelists. Organoleptic tests includes texture, aroma, color, and taste. Assessment scores are given based on hedonic test criteri a. In this test, the panelists were asked for their responses to scents, flavors, colors, and textures with the scale used being 1 = very like, 2 = like, 3 = rather like, 4 = rather dislike, 5 = dislike, 6 = very dislike. Organoleptic test results were ana lyzed using SPSS 20 and Microsoft Excell, while the calculation of nutritional value and contribution of the nutritional value of products to Nutrition Adequacy Figures was conducted using the Indonesian Food Composition Table 2017, Nutrisurvey, and Nutri 2008.

The determination of the quality of a food depends on several factors, but before other factors are considered visually the color factor appears first to determine the quality of food (Winarno, 2004). Based on the results of the tests of the organoleptic nature of color in 30 panelists obtained an average of 3.4 (rather like). A total of 12 Panelists gave a value of 4 (rather dislike) and 11 panelists gave a value of 3 (rather like) The other is likes and dislikes. The dislike of panelists from the color aspect because when cut the color of the product looks less attractive / less sharp (dark brown). This is caused by several things, namely the addition of banana hear t flour ingredients that produce an increasingly brown color. In addition, the time of roasting/drying also affects the color of the product, the longer the roasting of the product is 051112 2 0 051015 Very Like Like Rather Like Rather DislikeDislike Very DislikeNumber of Panelists (People) Panelist RatingOrganoleptic Properties of LOMESA Snack Bar ColorThe International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 250 produced the more brown because of non -enzymatic browning reactions, nam ely caramelization and Maillard reactions (Winarno, 2004). Figure 2 : Organoleptic Properties graph of LOMESA Snack Bar Aroma Resource: Primary Data 2020 Aroma The aroma is a smell caused by chemical stimuli that are smelled by olfactory nerves that are in the nasal cavity when food enters the mouth (Winarno, 2004). Aroma determines the deliciousness of the taste of food ingredients from foodstuffs. Based o n the results of the tests of the organoleptic nature of aroma in 30 panelists obtained an average of 2.3 (likes). A total of 13 Panelists gave a value of 2 (likes), 7 Panelists gave a value of 1 (very like) and 6 people gave a value of 3 (rather like). Bu t there are still 4 panelists who express rather dislike and dislike. The liking of panelists can be caused by mixing the three main ingredients of the product covering each other (not stinging). In addition, the composition of the materials used also does not use volatile materials. Panelists stated that they did not like to state that they smelled badly from the product. This is very possible because the basic ingredients used are nuts that have a distinctive aroma. In addition, the more the amount additi on of mixed flour will cause an unwelcome aroma. The aroma will arise and feel stronger when the cooking process is done such as baked, boiled, or fried. 713 6 2 2 0 051015 Very Like Like Rather Like Rather DislikeDislike Very DislikeNumber of Panelists (People) Panelist RatingOrganoleptic Properties of LOMESA Snack Bar AromaThe International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 251 Figure 3 : Organoleptic Properties graph of LOMESA Snack Bar Taste Resource: Primary Data 2020 Taste The taste caused by food is found from the food itself or during the process of adding other substances the original taste can be reduced or increased. Generally, food ingredients not only co nsist of one taste but are a combination of various flavors in an integrated manner that gives rise to a whole taste. Unless the taste of food is the result of other sensory cooperation (Kartika et al,1989). Based on the results of the tests of the organol eptic nature of taste in 30 panelists obtained an average of 2.6 (rather like). A total of 14 Panelists gave a value of 2 (likes), 11 panelists gave a value of 3 (rather like). The other is very like, rather dislike, and dislike. Panelists' assessments on the taste of LOMESA snack bars most panelists expressed a less sweet taste. This is due to the composition of ingredients that only use honey and bananas to give sweetness without adding granulated sugar. According to (Asmawati, Sunardi and Ihromi, 2019) the sweetness of a product is caused by the addition of granulated sugar as a sweetener. According to (Haryadi, 2006) granulated sugar has a sweet taste and helps the formation of texture. 114 11 32 0 051015 Very Like Like Rather Like Rather DislikeDislike Very DislikeJNumber of Panelists (People) Panelist RatingOrganoleptic Properties of LOMESA Snack Bar TasteThe International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 252 Figure 4 : Organoleptic Properties graph of LOMESA Snack Bar T exture Resource: Primary Data 2020 Texture The texture is a sensation of pressure that can be observed with the mouth (at the time of being bitten, chewed, and swallowed) or touch with the fingers. Factors that can affect whether or not the product is in the smoothing and mixing of the materials us ed and the absence of emulsifiers (Minifie, 1999). Based on the results of the tests of the organoleptic nature of texture in 30 panelists obtained an average of 2.3 (likes). A total of 17 Panelists gave a value of 2 (likes), 6 Panelists gave a value of 3 (rather like). The other is very like, rather dislike, and dislike. Flat panelists love the dense and soft texture of the product on the tongue. This is because the basic ingredients have been processed into flour so that it is easier and consumed by panel ists. But there is still 1 panelist who said they do not like the texture because the texture still seems wet / not dry. Panelists suggest increasing drought levels to make them crisper when consumed. According to research (Rahman, 2017) The crispness of the product is due to the content of starch levels and amylose levels while the levels of amylose and starch levels in these modified products are lower because they do not use wheat flour or starch -based foodstuffs. 417 6 210 05101520 Very Like Like Rather Like Rather DislikeDislike Very DislikeJNumber of Panelists (People) Panelist RatingOrganoleptic Properties of LOMESA Snack Bar TextureThe International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 253 Figure 5 : Organoleptic Properties Parameters Graph of LOMESA Snack Bar Resource: Primary Data 2020 Average Results of Organoleptics Properties Based on the results of organoleptic tests conducted on 30 untrained panelists, on the color, aroma, texture, and taste of snack bars with modifications of tolo bean flour, red bean flour, and banana heart flour obtained the average color parameter results of 3.4 (rather like), aroma 2.3 (like), flavor 2.6 (rather like), and texture 2.3 (like).

Conclusion : There is an effect of giving Moringa fortified pudding on milk production, while there is no effect of giving Moringa fortified pudding on Hb of nursing mothers in the UPT area of Penajam Health Center Keywords : Breast Milk Production, Baby Weight, He moglobin, Moringa Pudding INTRODUCTION Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the efforts to reduce infant mortality. In developing countries, exclusive breastfeeding has saved about 1.5 million babies/year. The lack of exclusive breastfeeding for infants at th e age of 0 -6 months is one indicator of malnutrition in Indonesia (Wahyutri, et el, 2017) Data Riskesdes reported that the pattern of breastfeeding for infants aged 0 -5 months in Indonesia was 37.7%. The East Kalimantan region in 2018 experienced a decreas e in the achievement of exclusive breastfeeding from 69% in 2013 and in 2015 to 32.2%. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 260 From the profile data of North Penajam Paser Regency, exclusive breastfeeding in 2019 was 69.4% while for the working area of UPT Penajam Health Center the achievement of exclusive breastfeeding was 76%. According to Zakaria (2015) the use of plants in the form of Moringa leaves containing laktogogum can help stimulate breast milk production. By giving Moringa leaf extract to breastfeeding mothers, the volume of breast milk increases rapidly. Moringa leaves contain 25 times more iron than spinach, vitamin A (10 times more than carrots), calcium (17 times more than bananas) and protein (9 times more than yogurt) so that it can be used as an alternative prevention. anemia in pregnant and lactating mothers ( Wahyuningtias et el, 2019) Moringa leaves have a potential effect to increase breast milk production and overcome anemia in nursing mothers, this is evident from the increase in infant weight and breast milk volume and t he increase in hemoglobin in nursing mothers, although the increase is not significant. Moringa leaves can also be processed into Moringa leaf tea drinks such as Nuryanti's research (2019) and processed into puddings such as Fathur et el's (2019) research. Phytosterol compounds are compounds that are not soluble in water, so the processing of Moringa leaves uses fresh Moringa leaves which are utilized by all parts of the leaves. According to HasnaMuthia's research (2017) pudding has a soft texture and has a long shelf life, namely at a temperature of 19 \u00b0 C the pudding lasts for 64 hours and at a temperature of 27 \u00b0 C it lasts for 59 hours. RESEARCH METHODS This research is an experimental study with a pretest -posttest design with a control group. The popula tion is breastfeeding mothers aged 0 -6 months in the working area of UPT Puskesmas Penajam. The inclusion criteria were mothers who breastfeed babies aged 0 -6 months, exclusively breastfed babies, mothers who do not smoke and drink alcohol, mothers who a re not sick and mothers who do not drink breast milk. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 261 Sampling was done by consecutive sampling technique, namely by selecting respondents who fit the predetermined criteria. The number of samples was 18 subjects per group, so that the total number of samp les was 36 subjects who met the criteria. At the beginning of the study, measurements of breast milk volume, baby weight and maternal hemoglobin were carried out in both groups (pretest). Then the intervention group was treated with 100 grams of Moringa pu dding every 12 hours for 7 days. After being given treatment, measurements of breast milk volume, baby weight and hemoglobin were measured in both groups (postets). Characteristic data obtained by filling out questionnaires by res pondents. To see the data are normally distributed using the Shapiro -Wilk test. Data on breast milk volume, infant weight and maternal hemoglobin before and after treatment in the same group were analyzed using the paired t -test, while the data before and after treatment in different groups were analyzed using the independent paired test.

Comparison of breast milk volume, baby weight and hemoglobin before and after treatment. The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 265 DISCUSSION Characteristics of Respondents Based on the results of the data analysis of the characteristics of the respondents where many mothers are aged 20 -35 years . The age category of mothers whose reproductive period is healthy and not at risk is 20 -35 years so that mothers can be able to solve the problems faced more emotionally, especially in dealing with pregnancy, childbirth, and caring for their own baby (Hartini S, 2014). The parity category has more children 1 -3. Milk production is strongly influenced by h ow often and how well the baby sucks and also how often the breasts are emptied. Nugroho (2010) where mothers who gave birth more than once, milk production on the fourth day after giving birth was higher than mothers who gave birth for the first time. Ine xperienced primiparous mothers often felt anxious and tense after giving birth which had an impact on the mother's physical and psychological condition, Psychological conditions of the mother like this can cause disruption of oxytocin where in breastfeedin g mothers this hormone functions to secrete or emit breast milk Effect of consumption of Moringa pudding on breast milk production and hemoglobin in nursing mothers Increase in Breast Milk Volume The increase in the volume of breast milk after giving Morin ga pudding is known to be 104 ml before being given and 172 ml after being given Moringa pudding. ,2014). This is in line with previous research which stated that giving Moringa leaf extract to mothers breastfeeding infants 0 -6 months resulted in an averag e volume of breast milk increasing significantly in the intervention group of 66.2%. One of the plants that can increase breast milk production is the Moringa plant because it contains lagtogogum, steroids and flavonoids in it which can increase protein le vels that can produce breast milk (Aminah et el, 2015). The mechanism The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 266 of action of lagtogogum in helping to increase the rate of secretion and production of breast milk is to stimulate the hormone prolactin which is a lagtogenic hormone to the mammary glan ds in the alveolar epithelial cells which will stimulate lactase and stimulate the hormone oxytocin which is effective in increasing the secretion and expenditure of breast milk. The more often breast milk is given to the baby, the milk production will be smoother and the baby's nutritional needs will also be met. Breast milk production refers to the volume of milk secreted in the breast and the amount of milk is assumed to be the same as milk production Baby Weight Gain Based on the results of the study, the baby's weight before being given Moringa pudding was 5.3 kg and after being given Moringa pudding it increased to 5.5 kg. Normal weight gain in 14 days will increase in accordance with breastfeeding skills and getting breast milk (Tjong, 2013) Accordin g to Sanima (2017), a factor that can facilitate breast milk production is sufficient food intake for the mother so that energy needs are met. One of the foods that can increase breast milk production is Moringa leaves which contain lagtogogum which is pro cessed into pudding. Giving Moringa pudding which is rich in phytosterols such as stigmasterol, sitosterol and kompesterol which is a substance to increase prolactin production which can stimulate the mammary gland ducts to produce milk which functions to stimulate milk production in nursing mothers. This research is supported by research conducted by Indri Pratiwi (2017) which shows that there is a difference in breast milk production after giving Moringa pudding for 7 days as much as 100 grams at a time. Giving Moringa pudding increases milk production so that the baby's needs are met which makes the baby's weight increase. Increased maternal hemoglobin (Hb) From the results of the study regarding hemoglobin before giving Moringa pudding was 12.02 g/dL an d after being given Moringa pudding it became 12.13 The International Conference on Lactation Management in COVID -19 Pandemic Era September 30, 2021, Samarinda, Indonesia 267 g/dL. The increase in maternal hemoglobin after giving the pudding was not significant with an average increase of 0.11 g/dL In Kasmayanti's study (2020) concluded that in the intervention group the admin istration of Moringa leaf capsules was not clinically significant in increasing hemoglobin levels because the average increase was 0.190 g/dL. The high content of iron in Moringa leaves, equivalent to 25 higher than spinach, can be used as an alternative t o overcome anemia in pregnant and lactating women. Moringa leaves contain iron 28.29 mg in 100 grams (Krisnadi, 2015). Iron is stored in hemoglobin, iron carries oxygen to body cells and carries carbon dioxide out of the body, supports muscle function, enz ymes, protein and energy metabolism Iron deficiency causes anemia, fatigue, headaches and apathy. The iron content is very high in Moringa leaves but will not experience a significant increase in hemoglobin (hb) of nursing mothers if the nutritional intake of nursing mothers is not met properly or breastfeeding mothers experience chronic energy deficiency. In line with Zakaria's research (2015), that nutritional needs are important for the formation of hemoglobin because iron increases during the puerperium and subsequent breastfeeding, so that the use of iron stores in the body also increases. This happens because in addition to the daily intake of iron, breastfeeding mothers do not meet the increasing needs due to the process of breast milk production and high activity, also because of insufficient intake of nutrients that help absorb iron such as vitamin C which is one of the elements that will affect the absorption of iron. determine the incidence of anemia in breastfeeding mothers. CONCLUSION There was a significant difference between giving Moringa pudding before and after giving Moringa pudding to breast milk production (p=0.000), while there was no significant difference before and after giving Moringa pudding to maternal hemoglobin (p=0.331).
