Steve Brown, Director of Public Health Devon, said: \"Starting or returning to school is an exciting time for all children. \"But as they will be mixing with lots of other children, making sure they are up to date with their routine immunisations gives them the best protection from what can potentially be very harmful infections. \"Look out for a message from the school immunisation team and please allow them your consent to give the vaccination.\" Pre-school boosters, offered to children from age three years and four months, are: - The four in one pre-school booster (diptheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio) - The MMR (measle, mumps, rubella) vaccine is given at one year (first dose) and at three years and four months (second dose) A list of all the vaccinations children should have had, by age, and by when, is [available via the NHS website.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/) Anyone not sure if their child has had all of their vaccinations should check their personal health record (the red book) and contact the child's doctor's surgery if there are any questions. The NHS website also has [vaccination tips for parents and carers](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/vaccination-appointment-tips-for-parents/), to help children's vaccination appointments go smoothly. Annual flu vaccinations are also available to all school children from reception age to year 11, and these are usually given at school. The vaccine for children is a nasal spray. Vaccinating children protects them, but also others who are vulnerable to flu, such as babies and older people. Children who are aged two or three by Thursday 31 August 2023 will be invited for vaccination at their registered GP practice, as well as any children who are at greater risk from flu to enable them to access the vaccine as early as possible in the flu season.
