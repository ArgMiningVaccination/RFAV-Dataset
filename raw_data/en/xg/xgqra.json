It was a very positive, life-changing experience. At the time, I was living in New York City, which can be very stressful. In that environment, I tended to worry unnecessarily about many things, which would disturb my peace. But once I learned the TM technique, nothing could shake the stability and deep inner happiness that had taken root inside me, no matter what came my way. An Oasis of Peace Twice a day, even with the intense traffic noise blasting in through the windows, I would sit down to mediate in my apartment. And every time I sat down to meditate, the noise and stress of the day were simply drowned out by a profound inner silence. This deep calm was not brought about by anything external-it was there inside of me, without reason or cause. After some time, I realized that this silence was simply and freely available deep within myself, any time and anywhere. This beautiful, pivotal realization transformed my life. I feel deeply grateful to have learned the Transcendental Meditation technique, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to all of my clients.
