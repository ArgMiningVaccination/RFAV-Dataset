We show in this study that formulation of a low dose of inactivated detergent-split influenza vaccine with a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist-based lipopeptide adjuvant (R4Pam2Cys) provides (i) immediate, antigen-independent immunity mediated by the innate immune system and (ii) signicant enhancement of antigen-dependent immunity which exhibits an increased breadth of effector function. Intranasal administration of mice with vaccineformulated with R 4Pam2Cys but not vaccine alone provides protection against both homologous and serologically distinct (het- erologous) viral strains within a day of administration. Vaccination in the presence of R4Pam2Cys subsequently also induces high levels of systemic IgM, IgG1, and IgG2b antibodies and pulmonary IgA antibodies that inhibit hemagglutination (HA) andneuraminidase (NA) activities of homologous but not heterologous virus. Improved primary virus nucleoprotein (NP)-specicCD8 /H11545T cell responses are also induced by the use of R4Pam2Cys and are associated with robust recall responses to provide heter- ologous protection. These protective effects are demonstrated in wild-type and antibody-decient animals but not in those de-pleted of CD8 /H11545T cells. Using a contact-dependent virus transmission model, we also found that heterologous virus transmission from vaccinated mice to naive mice is signicantly reduced. These results demonstrate the potential of adding a TLR2 agonist toan existing seasonal influenza vaccine to improve its utility by inducing immediate short-term nonspecic antiviral protectionand also antigen-specic responses to provide homologous and heterologous immunity. IMPORTANCE The innate and adaptive immune systems differ in mechanisms, specicities, and times at which they take effect. The innate immune system responds within hours of exposure to infectious agents, while adaptive immunity takes several daysto become effective. Here we show, by using a simple lipopeptide-based TLR2 agonist, that an influenza detergent-split vaccinecan be made to simultaneously stimulate and amplify both systems to provide immediate antiviral protection while giving theadaptive immune system time to implement long-term immunity. Both types of immunity induced by this approach protectagainst vaccine-matched as well as unrelated virus strains and potentially even against strains yet to be encountered. Conferringdual functionality to influenza vaccines is benecial for improving community protection, particularly during periods betweenthe onset of an outbreak and the time when a vaccine becomes available or in scenarios in which mass vaccination with a strainto which the population is immunologically naive is imperative.

The most effective way to curb the seasonal impact of influenza, which causes an average of 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually (1), is vaccination. The \"split\" influenza virus vaccine, which is pre- pared from puried virions that have been inactivated and then dis-rupted (split) with detergent, induces neutralizing antibodies di-rected against viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).Because circulating viruses mutate readily and new antigenically dis-tinct strains are continuously selected in the presence of neutralizingantibody elicited by previous strains, the effectiveness of a seasonalvaccine diminishes with time. These vaccines must therefore be re-formulated annually to include the HA and NA of the viral strainsthat are predicted to circulate in the forthcoming influenza season.RESEARCH ARTICLE crossmark November/December 2015 Volume 6 Issue 6 e01024-15\u00aembio.asm.org 1 mbio.asm.org on June 26, 2017 - Published by mbio.asm.org Downloaded from The recent emergence of swine-origin H1N1 virus as well as ongoing zoonotic spillover events involving H7N9 and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses have highlighted the real and potentialburden that pandemics pose to global health and national econo-mies in the absence of an effective vaccine. Although interven-tions, such as those employing the neuraminidase inhibitors,against novel strains can be effective at alleviating symptoms andat reducing disease severity when used preemptively (2, 3) or wheninitiated promptly after illness onset (4, 5), their efcacy is relianton a daily dosing regimen (6), and their benet does not extendbeyond the course of treatment. Furthermore, widespread or pro-longed use is associated with the emergence of drug-resistantstrains (7, 8). The need for continual development of effectiveshort-term intervention strategies as well as vaccination ap-proaches that can induce broad cross-reactive immunity, partic-ularly against heterologous virus subtypes, therefore remains apriority. The induction of regulated mucosal cellular innate responses, particularly those mediated by macrophages (9), neutrophils (10,11), and NK cells (12) as well as cytokines (13, 14), during the earlystages of infection plays a crucial role in limiting viral replicationand disease severity. This has led to the idea that an influenzavaccine that can be designed to induce short-acting innate protec-tion before longer-lasting adaptive responses come into effectcould be even more effective in limiting infection (15). Moreover,vaccines that prime or boost memory CD8 /H11001T cell responses to epitopes conserved across heterologous strains, i.e., those not sub-ject to antibody-mediated selection pressure, could provide anadditional level of cross-protective immunity to serologically di-verse influenza virus strains, including novel subtypes with pan-demic 17). Cross-reactive CD8 /H11001cytotoxic T lym - phocyte (CTL) responses induced in humans as a result ofinfection (18, 19) are closely associated with better prognosis afterreinfections (20, 21), but these responses can wane over time (22)and can differ among different age groups (23, 24). Although CTLimmunity does not prevent viral infection, it can signicantly re-duce viral load and moderate disease severity (25). A number of studies have investigated ways of improving the level of protection that can be elicited by inactivated split virusvaccines in both mice and ferrets (26-31). While these approachesare effective at inducing primarily antibody-mediated heterosub-typic or cross-clade protection, the modication of a split virusvaccine formulation to induce innate immunity to provide imme-diate protection as well as subsequent adaptive immunity, includ-ing heterologous CD8 /H11001T cell-mediated responses, has yet to be realized. Such an intervention would extend the spectrum of im-munity that can be induced by a seasonal influenza vaccine andwould be benecial in reducing disease burden during the periodbetween the onset of a pandemic and the time at which a vaccinebecomes available. We have previously shown that inoculation of soluble protein antigens formulated with anionic or cationic containing the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonistS-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]cysteine (Pam 2Cys) induces not only robust antibody but also strong CD8/H11001T cell responses (32- 34). Electrostatic association between the cationic lipopeptideR 4Pam2Cys ovalbumin (OVA) induced OVA257-264 -specic CD8/H11001T cell responses that me - diated rapid clearance of a chimeric influenza virus containing theK bOVA257-264 epitope following viral challenge (34). In addition,our studies in animals have since demonstrated that intranasal(i.n.) inoculation of Pam 2Cys alone can rapidly induce pulmonary innate responses that protect against challenge with different in-fluenza A virus (IAV) strains (35). These effects are inducedwithin a day of inoculation and can reduce disease severity, lungviral titers, and the transmission of virus for up to a week. Impor-tantly, the generation of adaptive immune responses is not com-promised by intranasal treatment with Pam 2Cys (35). In this study, we evaluated the advantages of formulating a split influenza virus vaccine with a modication of Pam2Cys and ex - amined its ability to confer immediate short-term protectionagainst challenge with the homologous virus and with a serologi-cally distinct virus as well as its ability to confer long-term protec-tion by the induction of both virus-specic antibody and CD8 /H11001T cell responses. We also investigated the role of induced adaptiveresponses in mediating vaccine efcacy against these viral strainsand report on the effects of vaccination on transmissibility of virusfrom infected animals. RESULTS Inoculation with split IAV vaccine formulated with R4Pam2Cys confers rapid antiviral protection. Our previous work (35) dem- onstrated that treatment of animals with Pam2Cys in the absence of antigen at up to 7 days prior to influenza virus challenge resultsin a reduction in viral loads postchallenge. To assess whether theseprotective effects extended to the use of an influenza vaccine for-mulation containing R 4Pam2Cys, we used a split influenza virus vaccine derived from PR8 influenza virus. This vaccine prepara-tion contained proteins corresponding to the molecular weightsof the major viral surface glycoproteins, as well as the internalnucleoprotein (NP) and the M1 matrix protein (see Fig. S1 in thesupplemental material). By determining lung viral titers in micechallenged within 7 days of vaccination, i.e., before any adaptiveimmune response would have a signicant effect, we were able todetermine any protective effects mediated by the innate immunesystem (Fig. 1A). The results (Fig. 1B) show that mice inoculated with a single dose of split virus vaccine formulated with R 4Pam2Cys and chal - lenged after 24 h with PR8 or X31 virus had signicantly reducedlung viral titers 5 days postinfection compared to naive mice orthose inoculated with split virus in the absence of R 4Pam2Cys. A greater reduction in viral titers in mice inoculated with split virusplus R 4Pam2Cys was detected when vaccinations were carried out 3 days prior to challenge. These protective effects were still evident7 days following vaccination. To evaluate protection against a lethal viral infection, vacci- nated animals were challenged with a higher dose (500 PFU) ofPR8 (Fig. 2A). While lung viral titers were not reduced in micevaccinated in the presence of R 4Pam2Cys and challenged a day after vaccination (Fig. 2B), signicant reductions in viral titers inthese mice compared to the control animals were detected whenvaccinations were carried out 3 to 7 days prior to challenge. Mice vaccinated with split virus plus R 4Pam2Cys 3 days before lethal viral challenge were also protected from the substantialweight loss (Fig. 2C) and development of severe disease symptomsassociated with infection compared to mice that received splitvirus alone, which by day 7 all had to be culled, having reached thedened humane endpoint (Fig. 2D). No protective effects wereobserved in similarly vaccinated TLR2 /H11002//H11002mice, indicating that protection mediated by R4Pam2Cys was dependent on recogni -Chua et al. 2\u00aembio.asm.org November/December 2015 Volume 6 Issue 6 e01024-15 mbio.asm.org on June 26, 2017 - Published by mbio.asm.org Downloaded from tion and signaling operating through TLR2. These observations demonstrate that an influenza vaccine delivered with Pam2Cys can induce rapid protection to reduce the impact of infectionirrespective of the viral subtype. These protective effects are alsoachieved with a lesser dose of Pam 2Cys than was previously used to confer antiviral protection (35). Antibody responses induced by vaccination of minimal doses of split IAV vaccine formulated with R4Pam2Cys. The in - duction of subsequent adaptive (antigen-specic) immunity wasstudied by measuring CD8 /H11001T cell and antibody responses at sev - eral time points after vaccination. Animals were also challenged35 days after vaccination, and recall CD8 /H11001T cell responses and viral loads were analyzed 5 days postinfection (Fig. 3A). To eval-uate antibody responses, mice were inoculated via the intranasal,subcutaneous, or intramuscular route. A low dose of split vaccinealone was unable to induce titers of antibody as high as those seenwith adjuvanted split vaccine irrespective of the inoculation routeused (Fig. 3B). In contrast, administration of the vaccine withR 4Pam2Cys resulted in signicant titers of antibody, with an ~600-fold improvement in titers following inoculation via the in-tranasal route and an ~20-fold 60-fold 4Pam2Cys-formulated were dominated and IgG2b (Fig. 3C). Similar isotype proles were observedin the lung with the additional presence of IgA, indicating a sig-nicant mucosal antibody response. Taken together, these resultsindicate that formulation of an otherwise ineffective low dose ofsplit virus vaccine combined with R 4Pam2Cys elicits strong anti - body responses characterized by the presence of a number of an-tibody isotypes, including signicant levels from mice inoculated with splitvirus plus R 4Pam2Cys were found to be comparable to or higher than the antibody titers induced by PR8 infection (Table 1). Incontrast, titers were not detected in sera of animals vaccinatedwith split virus alone. Not surprisingly, no detectable HI or NIreactivity was observed using sera from mice inoculated with vac-cine alone or with vaccine formulated with R 4Pam2Cys when tested against the serologically distinct H3N2 X31 virus. Theseresults demonstrate that antibodies induced by inoculation ofsplit virus can prevent viral HA and NA activity of homologousbut not heterologous strains. To investigate the induction of T cell responses, lymphocytes from the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) and lungs were ana-lyzed for the presence of NP 147-155 -specic CD8/H11001T cells by te - tramer straining 7 days after vaccination. Compared to vaccina-tion of split virus alone, vaccination of split virus in the presenceof R 4Pam2Cys resulted in the detection of higher numbers of NP147-155 -specic CD8/H11001T cells at both these sites, especially in the lungs (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, higher numbers of gamma inter-feron (IFN- /H9253)-, tumor necrosis NP147-155 -specic CD8/H11001T cells were also detected in lymphocyte populations derived from ani-mals vaccinated with split virus plus R 4Pam2Cys following in vitro restimulation with NP147-155 peptide for a further 7 days (Fig. 3E). Protection against homologous and heterologous viral chal- lenge. To evaluate the in vivo protective efcacy of split virus for- mulations, mice were challenged 35 days following inoculationwith split virus vaccine alone or formulated with R 4Pam2Cys and lung viral titers were determined 5 days later. Mice challengedwith the homologous PR8 virus (Fig. 4A) were not protected ifvaccinated with split virus or with R 4Pam2Cys alone as these groups of mice had lung viral titers not signicantly different fromthose of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-vaccinated contrast, that received low-dose split virus for-mulated with R 4Pam2Cys showed complete elimination of virus from the lungs. A similar approach was used to determine if vaccination could clear infection with X31 (Fig. 4B). As with PR8 challenge, inocu-lation of mice with split virus alone or R 4Pam2Cys alone provided no signicant reduction of viral loads in lungs. The titers of virusin the lungs of mice that had been inoculated with split vaccineformulated with R 4Pam2Cys, however, were signicantly reduced. These results demonstrate that the presence of R4Pam2Cys in a split virus formulation not only enhances virus-clearing adaptiveimmune responses to the homologous virus strain but also enablesthe vaccine to provide cross-reactive virus-clearing immunity toheterologous virus. Ability of antibodies induced by vaccination to mediate het- erosubtypic protection.

The results from these experiments(Table 2) demonstrated that sera obtained from naive mice orfrom mice inoculated with split virus alone were ineffective atspecically preventing PR8 and X31 infection of cells. In contrast,sera obtained from mice inoculated with split virus administeredwith R 4Pam2Cys or from mice previously primed with PR8 virus effectively neutralized PR8 infection. They did not, however, in-hibit infection by X31, indicating the absence of cross-neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization of X31 was achieved onlyusing sera from mice previously infected with the homologous(X31) virus strain. These results are consistent with the presence ofHI and NI antibodies in these sera (Table 1). We conclude that,although coformulation of the split vaccine with R 4Pam2Cys re - sults in a strong homologous neutralizing antibody response, de-tectable levels of neutralizing antibodies against a heterologousstrain could not be demonstrated in vitro. Protection against heterosubtypic viral challenge in /H9262MT antibody-decient mice. To provide evidence that the immunity to heterologous virus challenge occurred independently of anyantibody-mediated effects, /H9262MT B cell-decient mice were vacci- nated and we evaluated their ability to clear virus following chal-lenge with X31. Prior to challenge, vaccine-specic antibody titersin these mice were compared to those obtained in congenicC57BL/6 mice. In contrast to the signicant levels of antibodydetected in the serum and lung homogenates of C57BL/6 miceinoculated with split virus formulated with R 4Pam2Cys, antibody levels in /H9262MT mice that had been similarly immunized were be- low the limits of detection of the assay (Fig. 5A). When pulmonary viral titers were measured in vaccinated /H9262MT mice following challenge with X31, signicantly lower viral levels were present in mice vaccinated with split virus in the pres-ence of R 4Pam2Cys than in its absence (Fig. 5B). It therefore ap - pears that, despite a lack of antibody, /H9262MT mice can mount a virus-clearing response to a heterologous virus, indicating that thecross-protective immunity generated in the presence of R 4 Pam2Cys is antibody independent. Pulmonary CD8/H11545T cell responses in vaccinated animals fol - lowing viral challenge. We next investigated whether protection against X31 was associated with CD8/H11001T cell responses. Following vaccination, lymphocytes in the lungs were analyzed for virus-specic IFN- /H9253-producing NP-specic IFN- /H9253-producing CD8/H11001T cells in the lungs of mice 34 days after vaccination with split virus in theabsence or presence of R 4Pam2Cys (Fig. 6A). Following challenge with X31, however, the number of virus-specic IFN- /H9253- producing CD8/H11001T cells that were detected in mice inoculated with split virus formulated with R4Pam2Cys was approximately 3-fold higher than the number detected in mice that received splitFIG 2 Inoculation with split virus vaccine formulated with R4Pam2Cys also provides rapid protection against lethal viral challenge in a TLR2-dependent manner.

A large proportion of this recall response also appeared to be specic for NP147-155 (Fig. 6A). To determine the importance of these responses in mediating heterologous protection, vaccinated animals were depleted ofCD8/H11001T cells prior to X31 challenge. Non-CD8/H11001T cell-depleted mice vaccinated with split virus plus R4Pam2Cys exhibited signif - icantly higher recall responses to NP147-155 than mice vaccinated with split virus alone (Fig. 6C) at 5 days postinfection.

Taken together, these results support theview that the ability of mice inoculated with split virus formulatedwith R 4Pam2Cys to clear virus from the lung is at least in part due to the presence of a strong NP-specic CD8/H11001T cell-mediated recall response. Reduction in pulmonary viral loads of contacts cohoused with R4Pam2Cys-vaccinated index mice. To determine if the cross-protective responses observed in mice inoculated with splitvirus plus R 4Pam2Cys (Fig. 4B) also inhibited transmission of vi - rus to an unvaccinated population, we used a mouse contact-dependent transmission model (36). Mice vaccinated with splitvirus alone or combined with R 4Pam2Cys were infected with a transmissible strain (X31) 35 days after vaccination (vaccinatedindex mice) and were cohoused for 54 h with naive animals (un-vaccinated contact mice). Irrespective of whether mice were vac-cinated with split virus in the presence or absence of R 4Pam2Cys, we found similar viral titers (/H110226 log10PFU/ml) in the lungs of all vaccinated index mice (Fig. 7) after the cohousing period. Thiswas expected because the recall and virus-clearing effects of pul-monary cytotoxic T cells take at least that long to manifest. Nev-ertheless, unvaccinated contact mice cohoused with index animalsvaccinated with split virus plus R 4Pam2Cys had undetectable or very low levels of virus in the lung. This is in contrast to the 1 to 5.4log 10PFU/ml of virus found in more than 60% of contacts co - housed with index mice vaccinated with split virus alone or com-bined with PBS. It should be noted that transmissibility in thismodel is known to be dependent on the level of virus present in thesaliva of index mice. These results therefore suggest that, despiteequivalent pulmonary viral loads early after challenge, reducedlevels of virus may be present in the saliva of mice vaccinated withsplit virus plus R 4Pam2Cys compared to mice vaccinated with split virus alone (36), resulting in less viral shedding. DISCUSSION R4Pam2Cys associates electrostatically with oppositely charged re - gions on vaccine antigens, providing a means of forming com-plexes of the antigen and the TLR2 agonist without resorting to FIG 4 Protection of vaccinated animals against homologous and heterolo- gous virus.

Directing antigens to TLR2, particularly on dendritic cells (DCs), using R4Pam2Cys re - sults in improved antigen uptake and maturation of the DC and promotes proinflammatory cytokine secretion, resulting in theinduction - CD8 /H11001T cell-mediated results. vaccination regimen also mitigates contact-dependent transmission. These ndings build on our previous work, which showed that the breadth and effectiveness of responses induced with a subop-timal dose of this same vaccine are improved when the vaccine iscoadministered with a Pam 2Cys-peptide immunogen containing a cross-protective T cell epitope (37). The difference in this studywas that, when R 4Pam2Cys was used, the addition of extra antigen was not required to induce the immunogenic and protective ef-fects observed. An additional benet of a vaccine formulation thatcontains Pam 2Cys is its ability to stimulate innate cellular and cytokine-mediated responses which provide short-lived resistanceto different influenza virus strains in an antigen-independentmanner (35). This protective effect has been shown to last for upto 7 days and is characterized by neutrophils and macrophagesinltrating the lung as well as by elevated levels of IL-2, IL-6, FIG 7 Pulmonary infection of unvaccinated contact mice cohoused with vaccinated index mice.

FIG 6 Induction of CD8/H11001T cell responses in vaccinated mice following X31 challenge and its role in mediating cross-reactivity immunity. (A) BALB/c mice (n/H110055 per group) were inoculated with split virus vaccine alone or premixed with R4Pam2Cys. Lymphocytes in lungs of vaccinated mice were analyzed for virus- or NP147-155 -specic IFN- /H9253-producing T cells in an ICS assay on day 34 postvaccination. Animals were then challenged on day 35 with 104.5PFU of X31, and specic IFN- /H9253-producing T cells in the lungs were enumerated 5 days later. Each bar represents the mean and SD of the results determined for each group. (B) Concatenated dot plots of samples from virus-challenged animals are also shown, depicting the percentages ( /H11006SD) of responsive IFN- /H9253/H11001CD8/H11001T cells in the lung following stimulation with virus-infected APCs. (C) Vaccinated mice ( n/H110055 to 10) were also depleted of CD8/H11001T cells prior to X31 challenge. The total numbers of NP147-155 -specic IFN- /H9253/H11001CD8/H11001T cells in BAL fluid samples from CD8/H11001T cell-depleted or undepleted vaccinated mice were enumerated in an ICS assay 5 days later. (D) Titers of virus in lung homogenates were also determined by plaque formation. Titers in individual animals are presented, with the meanvalues for the groups represented by the horizontal bars. All error bars represent SD, and asterisks (*) indicate Pvalues of /H110210.05.Inducing Innate and Adaptive Immunity to Influenza November/December 2015 Volume 6 Issue 6 e01024-15\u00aembio.asm.org 7 mbio.asm.org on June 26, 2017 - Published by mbio.asm.org Downloaded from IFN-/H9253, and TNF- /H9251, among other inflammatory mediators (35). Unlike the use of antivirals such as oseltamivir, which has been reported to affect the induction of adaptive immune responses(38, 39), the use of Pam 2Cys, besides conferring immediate pro - tection, also permits the generation of subsequent and robustadaptive immune responses. Furthermore, and because the im-mediate protective effect of Pam 2Cys is mediated by host re - sponses rather than by targeting a structural feature of the virus,resistance to the use of Pam 2Cys is less likely to occur. One could therefore envisage the use of a split virus formulation containingR 4Pam2Cys which would be administered intranasally as a spray to provide immediate short-term antiviral protection in the eventof an outbreak while the antigenic component of the vaccinewould extend protection well beyond this time frame via the es-tablishment of adaptive immunity. In our efforts to dene the immune mechanisms mediating cross-protection, we investigated the role of antibodies that wereinduced by vaccination using R 4Pam2Cys. Although antibodies that were capable of inhibiting the HA and NA activity showed nocross-reactivity with heterologous virus, it was possible that anti-bodies against other conserved regions of the virus, e.g., the highlyconserved stalk domain of HA (40-42) and the fusion active sub-unit of HA2 (43, 44), may have been involved. Antibodies againstNP (45) and the ectodomain of the virus M2 protein (46), whichexert their activity by binding to infected host cell surface-associated viral antigens and engage antibody-dependent cellularcytotoxicity (47), have also been implicated in facilitating cross-protective immunity. Nonetheless, results from our in vitro neu- tralization assay and the fact that cross-protection was antibody-decient animals but not in CD8 /H11001T cell- depleted animals indicated that the cross-protective immunityafforded by the presence of R 4Pam2Cys is CD8/H11001T cell mediated. The induction of NP-specic primary CD8/H11001T cell responses following vaccination using split virus in the presence ofR 4Pam2Cys is associated with a strong recall response elicited fol - lowing challenge, suggesting that T cells are recalled from a pool ofmemory cells established following vaccination and recruitedfrom extrapulmonary sites such as the mediastinal lymph nodes tohelp facilitate viral clearance. Moreover, it is also possible thatCD4 /H11001T cell responses to HA and NA are primed by vaccination to help support both antibody- and cell-mediated responses. Sup-port for this hypothesis is based on our unpublished observationswhich showed that vaccination of OVA formulated withR 4Pam2Cys also results in the proliferation of CD4/H11001T cells and promotes their differentiation into T follicular helper cells to helpdrive germinal B cell formation. Moreover, both vaccine-inducedOVA-specic antibody responses and CD8 /H11001T cell responses are absent in CD4/H11001T cell-decient animals (GK1.5 mice). The use intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays to examine CD8/H11001T cell recall responses allows presentation of an array of virus-derived CTL cell epitopespotentially induced by the multiple antigens contained in the vac-cine formulation. Although it appears that the CTL responses de-tected are directed largely against an epitope derived from NP thathas been shown to be immunodominant in the response to viralinfection, it remains to be seen what other T cell specicities areinvolved in this response; the presence of multiple and differentviral proteins in the split virus vaccine suggests that an array ofother subdominant responses (48) could also be elicited. The po-tential to boost cross-reactive CD8 /H11001T cell responses in humans byvaccination was exemplied in recent phase I and 2a clinical trialsdemonstrating the use of an NP and M1 proteins delivered by avaccinia virus vector to increase antigen-specic T cell responses(49) and reduce disease symptoms and viral shedding followingexposure to an influenza virus strain to which subjects had notpreviously been exposed (50). Virus vector-based vaccines thattarget conserved antigens have also been shown to reduce trans-mission in animals (51). The use of Pam 2Cys described here there - fore not only provides similar benets but also has advantagesover such delivery systems due to its nonbiological nature and easeof manufacture and use. The adaptive responses induced using R 4Pam2Cys were achieved using a considerably smaller dose of split virus vaccinethan is usually required to induce biologically active antibody re-sponses in mice. This dose-sparing effect of R 4Pam2Cys is an im - portant point to be considered in the economy of vaccine manu-facture, distribution, and administration in the event of influenzapandemics and epidemics. Alterations to current seasonal vaccineformulations to include R 4Pam2Cys might also be attractive to manufacturers because such alterations would not require devel-opment of a new vaccine per se and could have the potential to signicantly reduce the time periods that are usually associatedwith new vaccine development, expediting introduction. These ndings highlight the benets of using a TLR agonist to improve the utility and also to extend the spectrum of immunityinduced by influenza split virus vaccines against homologous andheterologous subtypes. A cost-effective method for dose sparingand at the same time extending efcacy could be of great benet inscenarios in which there is an imperative for mass vaccinationwith a virus strain to which the population is immunologicallynaive. The innate- and adaptive-immune-system-mediated pro-tective effects achieved through use of R 4Pam2Cys could be espe - cially benecial for improving community protection, particu-larly during the period between the time of an outbreak and thetime when a vaccine becomes available. MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis of the cationic lipopeptide R4Pam2Cys. The synthesis of the cationic lipopeptide carried out manually using conven - tional solid-phase methodologies as described previously (34). Synthetic lipopeptide preparations contained no detectable lipopolysaccharide(LPS) (/H110210.05 endotoxin assay (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). Vaccination and infection of mice. All animal experimentation was performed with approval from the University of Melbourne's AnimalEthics Committee. C57BL/6, BALB/c, TLR2 /H11002//H11002, and B mice (52) were bred and maintained under specic-pathogen-free conditions and used when the mice were 6 to 10 weeks of age. /H9262MT mice carry a disrupted gene encoding the /H9262-chain constant region of IgM which arrests B cell development and the ability to mount antibody responses(52). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated via the intra-nasal (i.n.) route with split virus vaccine that was provided by bioCSLLimited, Australia. The vaccine contained 1 /H9262g of HA and was derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1) virus. The vaccine was adminis-tered either in saline solution or formulated with 5 nmol of R 4Pam2Cys (9.91 /H9262g) in a total volume of 40 /H9262l. For some experiments, mice were inoculated via the subcutaneous route at the base of the tail (50 /H9262l at each side) or via the intramuscular route (40 /H9262l into each quadriceps muscle). After 1, 3, 7, or 35 days, mice were challenged intranasally with 104.5PFU of A/HK/H1100331 (X31) (H3N2) influenza virus or with 50 or 500 PFU of PR8 influenza virus. X31 is a recombinant virus containing theHA and NA segments from a 1968 Hong Kong influenza virus but sharingChua et al. 8\u00aembio.asm.org November/December 2015 Volume 6 Issue 6 e01024-15 mbio.asm.org on June 26, 2017 - Published by mbio.asm.org Downloaded from the internal viral proteins of the PR8 virus. Lungs were harvested 5 days later, homogenized in 3 ml RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Australia), and cen-trifuged at 300 /H11003gfor 30 s, and supernatants were stored at /H1100280\u00b0C. Titers of virus in the supernatants of lung homogenates were then determinedusing a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) plaque assay as previously described (53). ELISAs. Levels of antibody present in serial dilutions of sera or the supernatants of lung homogenates obtained from mice 34 days followingvaccination were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) as previously described (34). used in a sep-arate assay to determine the isotypes of antibodies. Titers of antibody areexpressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum required toachieve an optical density of 0.2. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI), neuraminidase inhibition (NI), and virus neutralization assays. The presence of hemagglutination inhi- bition (HI) antibodies and of neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibodieswas determined as described elsewhere (54, 55). Virus neutralization as-says were carried out as described previously (55). In vivo depletion of CD8 /H11545T cells. Mice were inoculated via the intra - peritoneal route with 100 /H9262g (200 /H9262l) of anti-CD8 /H9251antibody (clone 2.43; National Cell Culture Center, USA) 29 days after vaccination. Antibodywas administered daily for 3 consecutive days and then once every 3 daysthereafter for the duration of the experiment. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay and tetramer staining. Lungs from mice were nely minced and treated with 2 mg collagenase A(Roche Diagnostics, Germany)-2 ml RPMI 1640 per lung for 30 min at37\u00b0C. Cell suspensions were passed through a wire sieve before centrifugalsedimentation of cells and treatment with 0.15 M NH 4Cl-17 mM Tris- HCl at pH 7.2 for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. In some experiments, cells were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids or mediastinal lymph nodes(MLNs). Lymphocyte cell suspensions (1 /H1100310 6) were cultured in the presence of the H2Kd-restricted influenza virus nucleoprotein and recombinant IL-2(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) (10 U/ml). For some experiments, lym-phocyte cell suspensions were cultured in the presence of 2 /H1100310 5virus- infected syngeneic P815 target cells. These cells (4 /H11003106/ml) had been infected previously with X31 (at a multiplicity of infection of 20) fo r1ha t 37\u00b0C in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Australia) supplemented with gentamicin, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at the concentrationsdescribed above and had been washed extensively in fetal calf serum (FCS)before use. Infection of cells was conrmed by the phenotypic expressionof surface HA as veried by flow cytometry. After 6 h, lymphocytes were washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) wash buffer (1% FCS-5 mM anti-mouseCD8 at 4\u00b0C. Fixa-tion and permeabilization were then performed for 20 min at 4\u00b0C usingCytox/Cytoperm solution (Becton, Dickinson) according to the manu-facturer's instructions. Cells were washed once and stained for intracellu-lar IFN- /H9253, IL-2, or TNF- /H9251with before flow cytometric analysis (FACSCanto II or LSR II;BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software(Treestar, USA). For in vitro restimulation of lymphocytes over 7 days, cells (2 /H1100310 6) were cultured in 200 /H9262l of supplemented and IL-2 (10 U/ml) with medium changes performed every 2 days. ICS assays were then performed as indicatedabove. Tetramer staining of lymphocytes from the MLNs and lungs was per- formed at room temperature using a 1:200 dilution in a mixture with 50 /H9262lof 10% FCS-PBS for 30 min followed by the addition of fluorochrome- conjugated anti-CD8 antibody for 30 min. Cells were extensively washedbefore analysis. Contact-dependent virus transmission. The transmissibility of virus was evaluated in a mouse model developed for the study of contact-dependent viral transmission (36). Vaccinated mice were challenged after35 days by the i.n. route with 10 4.5PFU of X31 virus. After 6 h, these index mice were introduced into a clean cage and cohoused with naive contactmice (2 index mice for 3 contact mice) for 2 days. Index mice were eutha-nized directly after the cohousing period, and contact mice were eutha-nized 4 days after their initial exposure to the index mice. Viral titers inlung homogenates of all animals were then determined in a standardplaque assay. Statistical analyses. Analysis of variance obtained using were performed usingthe Prism 5 software package (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
