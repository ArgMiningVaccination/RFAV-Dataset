[2](#b2-enm-2021-404), [3](#b3-enm-2021-404)]. Patients with malignancies, chronic lung disease, cardiac disease, and immunosuppressive conditions, as well as endocrine disorders such as diabetes and obesity, were included in these trials. Efficacy and safety were comparable in patients with endocrine disorders and healthy subjects. There have been no reports of any specific side effects or reduced efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with endocrine disorders. Thus, several clinical societies have suggested that patients with stable endocrine disorders should follow the same recommendations as the general population [ [4](#b4-enm-2021-404)- [6](#b6-enm-2021-404)]. ADRENAL DISEASE [7](#b7-enm-2021-404)]. Patients who are taking a high dose of a glucocorticoid as an immunosuppressive treatment are also at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection [ [8](#b8-enm-2021-404), [9](#b9-enm-2021-404)]. [10](#b10-enm-2021-404), [11](#b11-enm-2021-404)]. Considering the impact of adrenal diseases on the immune system and the possibility of an increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with adrenal diseases, patients with adrenal diseases should be encouraged to receive vaccinations against COVID-19. However, there is no clear evidence that patients with adrenal insufficiency are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Patients with adrenal insufficiency who were adequately trained to modify their replacement therapy as appropriate had a similar rate and severity of COVID-19 infection to matched controls with intact adrenal function [ [12](#b12-enm-2021-404)]. [5](#b5-enm-2021-404)]. A two- or three-fold increase of the daily replacement glucocorticoid dose would suffice to manage the febrile response to COVID-19 vaccination and would probably not affect the immune response to the vaccination. If fever and myalgia persist for more than several days or clinical deterioration occurs, patients should seek medical advice from their physicians immediately. Second, it is not recommended to discontinue glucocorticoid treatment before COVID-19 vaccination for patients with adrenal insufficiency. In patients who were vaccinated against influenza, prednisolone up to 20 mg/day did not suppress the immune response to the vaccination [ [13](#b13-enm-2021-404)]. A physiologic glucocorticoid dose is not associated with reduced vaccination efficacy, and abrupt cessation of glucocorticoid replacement may lead to overt adrenal insufficiency. Third, currently, there is no evidence that patients with Cushing's syndrome have increased risk of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Although, Cushing's syndrome is a prothrombotic condition, there is no clear evidence that usual risk factors of thrombosis is associated with increased risk of VITT. DIABETES MELLITUS [14](#b14-enm-2021-404)- [18](#b18-enm-2021-404)]. Numerous epidemiological findings have consistently suggested that the proportion of diabetes is higher in COVID-19 patients with a severe clinical course, and that people with diabetes are also more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection than those without diabetes [ [15](#b15-enm-2021-404), [19](#b19-enm-2021-404)- [21](#b21-enm-2021-404)]. Individuals with chronic disorders such as diabetes and obesity were included as study subjects in clinical trials for the approval of COVID-19 vaccines [ [22](#b22-enm-2021-404)]. Even though detailed evidence for this category of patients is limited, it is intuitively reasonable the benefits might outweigh the risk of rare side effects that occur after vaccination. [23](#b23-enm-2021-404)]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that diabetes and obesity at any age are medical conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19. Considering the demand-supply matches of COVID-19 vaccines, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) advised the CDC on phased vaccine allocation (phases 1a, 1b, 1c, and 2), and phase 1c included people aged 16 to 64 years with medical conditions that increase the risk of serious complications from COVID-19 [ [24](#b24-enm-2021-404)]. [25](#b25-enm-2021-404)], the United States [ [24](#b24-enm-2021-404)], the United Kingdom [ [26](#b26-enm-2021-404)], and European countries [ [27](#b27-enm-2021-404)] recommend prioritizing vaccination for people with chronic disorders, including diabetes. [28](#b28-enm-2021-404)- [31](#b31-enm-2021-404)]. These vaccinations currently have been recommended as standard care for people with diabetes due to the considerable B-cell response [ [28](#b28-enm-2021-404), [32](#b32-enm-2021-404)]. A recent study demonstrated that the antibody response against multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens in patients with diabetes is superimposable, in terms of timing and titers, to that of people without diabetes and is not influenced by glucose levels [ [33](#b33-enm-2021-404)]. These findings might justify optimistic expectations regarding the similar efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in people with diabetes regardless of glycemic control. [22](#b22-enm-2021-404)]. Little is known regarding whether vaccine-related adverse events are more prevalent in people with diabetes, although previous studies showed similar rates compared to those without diabetes [ [34](#b34-enm-2021-404)]. These side effects are known to be mild and manageable with conservative treatment such as hydration, bed rest, and antipyretics, even in people with diabetes. Local or systemic immune reactions would lead to increased glucose levels, so more frequent blood glucose monitoring than usual might be required. In cases of fever, frequent hydration would prevent dehydration and increased blood glucose levels in people with diabetes; this strategy may be especially helpful for patients with type 1 diabetes and those receiving intensive insulin therapy. Conservative treatment according to the sick-day management guideline would be applicable to cases of postvaccine adverse events. OSTEOPOROSIS [35](#b35-enm-2021-404)], consequently worsening osteoporosis and increasing fracture risk under the circumstances of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. In light of these concerns, COVID-19 vaccination could positively affect patients with osteoporosis by providing them the opportunity to engage more frequently in outdoor movement. The typical side effects of COVID-19 vaccination, such as fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches, are not affected by osteoporosis per se. The thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome related to COVID-19 vaccination also did not seem to be directly related to osteoporosis. [36](#b36-enm-2021-404)]. A 1-week interval between intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate infusion and COVID-19 vaccination is recommended to determine which intervention is responsible for acute-phase reactions such as mild fever and myalgia. It is known that flu-like symptoms appear in response to the activation of T cells after IV bisphosphonate infusion, especially in drug-na\u00efve patients. Both recombinant adenovirus vector-based and mRNA-based [ [2](#b2-enm-2021-404)] COVID-19 vaccines also have acute-phase reactions such as mild fever, headache, and myalgia. A 4- to 7-day interval is recommended between the administration of other injectable anti-osteoporotic agents (denosumab and romosozumab) and COVID-19 vaccination due to potential injection site reactions, such as localized pain, swelling, and/or erythema. If the COVID-19 vaccine needs to be administered simultaneously, anti-osteoporotic agents can be administered in the contralateral arm or an alternative site (abdomen or upper thigh). Meanwhile, oral bisphosphonates, raloxifene, and teriparatide should be continued without interruption or delay in patients receiving COVID-19 vaccination. [37](#b37-enm-2021-404)]. Delayed osteoporosis treatment can significantly increase the risk of fractures. In particular, discontinuation of denosumab, a potent antiresorptive agent, showed rapid bone loss and associated with an increased risk of fracture [ [38](#b38-enm-2021-404), [39](#b39-enm-2021-404)]. Therefore, denosumab administration should not be delayed for more than 7 months after the previous administration. THYROID DISEASE [6](#b6-enm-2021-404)]. The possible mechanisms are the direct destruction of the thyroid gland by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, sick euthyroid syndrome, and precipitation of immune-mediated mechanisms [ [6](#b6-enm-2021-404)]. However, thyroid disorders have been reported in rare cases after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. Subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease were reported following COVID-19 vaccination [ [11](#b11-enm-2021-404), [40](#b40-enm-2021-404)- [42](#b42-enm-2021-404)]. Although subacute thyroiditis is well known to be associated with upper respiratory viruses, rare cases were reported with traditional inactivated viral vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines such as influenza vaccines [ [11](#b11-enm-2021-404), [40](#b40-enm-2021-404)]. The five patients with subacute thyroiditis following the COVID-19 vaccine were managed with anti-inflammatory drugs, or beta-blockers [ [11](#b11-enm-2021-404), [40](#b40-enm-2021-404), [41](#b41-enm-2021-404)]. Vaccines have been found to trigger an immune response that may cause autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disease [ [42](#b42-enm-2021-404)]. A possible mechanism is that the viral protein concentration reaches a peak in 24 to 48 hours and an autoimmune response could be triggered [ [43](#b43-enm-2021-404)]. A study reported that two healthy women who received COVID-19 vaccines were diagnosed with Graves' disease [ [42](#b42-enm-2021-404)]. Their thyroid hormone levels increased, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were suppressed, and anti-thyroid antibody levels increased within a few days [ [42](#b42-enm-2021-404)]. The patients were treated with anti-thyroid drugs and had an adequate response [ [42](#b42-enm-2021-404)]. [4](#b4-enm-2021-404), [12](#b12-enm-2021-404)]. If a patient is medically unstable, it should be judged on a case-by-case basis by the physician. The present vaccines have been evaluated and approved for emergency use in the United States by the FDA. Clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines have enrolled thousands of participants, some of whom had thyroid disease. Moreover, more than 1 billion people have been vaccinated for COVID-19 with various vaccines. However, thyroid disease has not been found to be associated with an increased risk of vaccination-related complications. COVID-19 vaccination is advantageous for patients with thyroid disease, and although it might cause thyroid disease in some cases, those cases are also treatment-responsive. HYPOGONADISM [44](#b44-enm-2021-404)]. Data have also shown that significantly more men were hospitalized for COVID-19 than their female counterparts [ [45](#b45-enm-2021-404)]. Therefore, male sex itself could be considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19. [46](#b46-enm-2021-404)]. The sex hormones (estrogens and androgens) have been mentioned as underlying factors responsible for the differential immune response to COVID-19 [ [45](#b45-enm-2021-404)]. Estrogen has been reported to protect women against diseases including COVID-19 [ [47](#b47-enm-2021-404)]. Moreover, women tend to produce more of these defensive immune-related proteins and therefore are better protected against infection, which leads to better immune protection against COVID-19 [ [45](#b45-enm-2021-404)]. Physiological mechanisms that are likely to play a role in sex-specific differences in COVID-19 outcome include the entry of the virus into the body and immune differences [ [48](#b48-enm-2021-404)]. In addition, immune responses and the cytokine storm, which is one of the pathophysiological features of severe COVID-19, appear to differ between men and women [ [46](#b46-enm-2021-404)]. In contrast, androgens have been implicated in the over-activation of immune cells, cytokine storm, and the attendant severe inflammation, which may predispose males to severe COVID-19 [ [45](#b45-enm-2021-404)]. It has been suggested that estrogen protects females against severe COVID-19, while androgens worsen COVID-19 outcomes in males [ [49](#b49-enm-2021-404)]. It is also important to consider potential confounders such as behavioral differences and societal factors (e.g., higher rates of smoking in men) when evaluating COVID-19 case-fatality rate disparities according to sex [ [6](#b6-enm-2021-404), [50](#b50-enm-2021-404)]. [51](#b51-enm-2021-404)]. In that study, patients with prostate cancer undergoing treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) showed a significantly lower risk of severe COVID-19 than the non-ADT group. Based on those results, it can be postulated that a high androgen concentration exacerbates the severity of COVID-19 and that ADT could be suggested to protect men from severe COVID-19. However, future research is needed to examine whether hormone replacement therapy may have a therapeutic role in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19. [52](#b52-enm-2021-404)]. However, this heightened response in women seems to be correlated with the development of higher levels of antibodies against COVID-19. Considering the high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection, the benefits of vaccination in patients with hypogonadism outweigh the risk of anaphylaxis or other side effects, which are treatable. [6](#b6-enm-2021-404)], it is important to consider their potential role of finding high-risk patients or developing treatment strategies for patients with COVID-19, particularly older adults and those with hormone deficiencies. COVID-19 vaccination is advantageous for these high-risk patients. Future research is needed to examine whether hormone replacement therapy may have a therapeutic role in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19. PITUITARY DISEASE [3](#b3-enm-2021-404)]. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended in patients with stable pituitary disease as much as in the general population. However, the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with progressive or untreated pituitary disease has not been investigated. [2](#b2-enm-2021-404), [3](#b3-enm-2021-404)]. Due to these side effects, additional glucocorticoid doses may be necessary for patients with adrenal insufficiency. The Pituitary Society conducted a survey on glucocorticoid therapy in adrenal insufficiency patients who received COVID-19 vaccines, and they obtained 103 responses from 273 members [ [5](#b5-enm-2021-404)]. Most clinicians have indicated their plans to maintain the current glucocorticoid dose for patients receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. However, if fever, joint, or muscle pain occurred, they would respond by increasing the glucocorticoid dose [ [5](#b5-enm-2021-404)]. Concerns about COVID-19 outweigh the adverse effects of vaccination in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Several studies have reported that patients with adrenal insufficiency had a higher risk of infection than the general population [ [1](#b1-enm-2021-404)]. Patients with adrenal insufficiency have an impaired innate immune response. Since the immune defense against infection is blunted, they are susceptible to infection [ [53](#b53-enm-2021-404)]. Therefore, the risk of death from COVID-19 infection was reported to be high in patients with adrenal insufficiency [ [1](#b1-enm-2021-404)]. Although there is still no definitive evidence, expert opinions have recommended that patients with adrenal insufficiency should be fully informed regarding the side-effects of COVID-19 vaccination and the sick day rules in case they develop a fever. CONCISE SUMMARY 1. In patients with stable adrenal disease, COVID-19 vaccines should be administered according to the same standards as the general population. 2. In patients with adrenal insufficiency, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended similarly to the healthy general population. In addition, there is no need to discontinue or change the dose of steroid medication due to vaccination. However, if fever, severe muscle pain, and chills occur after vaccination, the steroid dose should be increased by two to three times according to the sick day rules. 3. In patients with diabetes, COVID-19 vaccination should be administered as a priority regardless of the diabetes type. 4. In patients with diabetes, blood glucose monitoring is required more often than usual for several days after vaccination. If a patient's blood glucose is not controlled adequately, appropriate management should be provided. 5. In patients with osteoporosis, COVID-19 vaccination should be administered according to the same standards as the general population. 6. To differentiate the side effects of COVID-19 vaccination and intravenous bisphosphonate, a 1-week interval is recommended. 7. Due to the potential injection site reaction, a 4- to 7-day interval for injectable anti-osteoporotic agents (denosumab and romosozumab) is recommended. Meanwhile, oral bisphosphonates, raloxifene and teriparatide should be continued without interruption or delay in patients receiving COVID-19 vaccination. 8. In patients with thyroid dysfunction, COVID-19 vaccination should be administered according to the same standards as the general population. 9. In patients with hypogonadism, COVID-19 vaccination should be administered according to the same standards as the general population. 10. In patients with stable pituitary disease, COVID-19 vaccination should be administered according to the same standards as the general population. 11. In patients taking glucocorticoids due to secondary adrenal insufficiency, the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination is the same as concise summary no. 2. "}
