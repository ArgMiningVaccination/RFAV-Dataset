Design and setting: The EPI3 survey was a nationwide, observational study of a representativesample of GPs and their patients, conducted in Francebetween March 2007 and July 2008. Participants: 1572 patients diagnosed with SADD. Primary and secondary outcomes: The patients ' attitude towards complementary and alternativemedicine; psychotropic drug utilisation. Results: Compared to patients attending GP-CM, GP-Ho patients had healthier lifestyles while GP-Mxpatients showed similar profiles. Psychotropic drugswere more likely to (55.4%) and GP-Ho shared similar SADD severity. Conclusion: Our results showed that patients with SADD, while differing principally in theirsociodemographic profiles and conventionalpsychotropic prescriptions, were actually rather similarregarding the severity of SADD in terms ofcomorbidities and quality of life. This information mayhelp to better plan resource allocation andmanagement of these common health problems inprimary care. INTRODUCTION Mental health problems such as sleep,anxiety or depressive disorders (SADD) are responsible for considerable disability worldwide 1resulting in serious quality-of-lifeimpairment2and are often associated with high use of medical services. It is estimated that up to 20% of patients attending primaryARTICLE SUMMARY Article focus Up to 20% of patients attending primary health- care in developed countries suffer from theoften-linked anxiety and depression disorders. Conventional treatments, particularly antidepres-sants and anxiolytics, are widely prescribed; often associated with adverse side effects, con- ventional treatments are a likely cause for anincreasing number of patients to choose hom-eopathy and other complementary therapies. Understanding the characteristics of physiciansand patients, prescribing or using homeopathy,respectively, in conjunction with or instead ofpsychotropic drugs is undoubtedly of clinicaland public health relevance. Key messages Our results suggest that patients experiencingsleep, anxiety and depressive disorders (SADD)who chose a GP with a clear orientation towardshomeopathy, differed in their socio-demographicprofile but not in the severity of their mentalillness from those attending regular physicians ingeneral practice (GPs) with prescribing prefer- ences towards conventional psychotropic drugs. Our survey is one the few studies highlighting that SADD show similar burdens in terms ofseverity and impact on mental impairmentregardless of GPs 'prescribing preferences. Our results showed that patients with SADD, while differing principally in their sociodemographic pro-files and conventional psychotropic prescriptions,were actually rather similar regarding the severity ofSADD in terms of comorbidities and quality of life.

Downloaded from healthcare in developed countries suffer from the often- linked disorders of anxiety and depression. A high prescription rate of conventional therapies, particularlyantidepressants, 34which are often associated with adverse side effects, are a likely cause for an increasingnumber of patients to choose homeopathy and othercomplementary therapies. 5 Evidence of effectiveness of these therapies compared to conventional psychotropic drugs is still limited.6-8 Nonetheless, their perceived safety may be an important factor motivating patients with SADD disorders to seek care from physicians in general practice (GPs) prefer-ring homeopathy and other types of complementary medicine. Among complementary alternative medicine (CAM) modalities of practice, homeopathy is widelyused in countries with large access to conventional medi- cine and represents a particularly good marker for CAM practice in France, where homeopathic drugs are partlyreimbursed by national health insurance and prescribed only by a medical practitioner, if not purchased as over-the-counter drugs. 9In a previous study,10homeo- pathic practitioners (including non-medical healthcare professionals) indicated that their patients used hom- eopathy mainly in association with conventional psycho-tropic treatments, psychotherapy and counselling in a mixed practice. Understanding the characteristics of physicians and patients, prescribing or using homeopathy, respectively, inconjunction with or instead of psychotropic drugs is undoubtedly of clinical and public health relevance. Theobjective of this study was to describe and compare patients seeking treatment for sleep, anxiety and depressive disor- ders (SADD) from GPs with three different practice prefer-ences: strictly conventional medicine (GP-CM), mixed complementary and conventional medicine (GP-Mx) and certied homeopathic physicians (GP-Ho). METHODSStudy design, settings and participants The EPI3 survey was a nationwide, observational study of a representative sample of general practitioners andtheir patients, conducted in France between March 2007 and July 2008. The methodology of the study has been described elsewhere. 2Participants (GPs and their patients) were drawn by applying a two-stage sampling process. The GPs were rst randomly selected from the French national direc- tory of physicians and invited to participate, which meant allowing a research assistant to conduct a one-day survey in the waiting room at the doctor 's practice. Blind to the study focus on conventional and CAM practice, consenting GPs were next contacted by telephone to enquire how frequently they prescribed CAM (homeop- athy, mesotherapy, acupuncture, phytotherapy, etc).Depending on their homeopathic medicines, they were classi ed as: strictly conventional GPs (GP-CM), who declared themselves never or rarely using CAM or homeopathic medicines; mixed practice (GP-Mx), who were GPs declaring using CAM regularly; and GPs certi ed in homeopathic practice (GP-Ho). In France, homeopathy can only be prescribed by physicians, mostly GPs quali ed as homeo- paths by the French National Council of Physicians (CNOM) upon completion of speci c training and certi- cation (3.3% of all French GPs in 2008). 11 The second stage of selection consisted of random one-day sampling of consultations per participating phys- ician, in order to survey all patients attending the prac- tice on that very day. All adults (18 years old and over)and accompanied minor patients were eligible for inclu- sion in the EPI3 survey, except for those whose health status or literacy level did not allow responding to a self-administered questionnaire. During the consultation, GPs asked all adult patients diagnosed or suspected of suffering SADD whetherthey would volunteer for a more in-depth study of their disease. Consenting patients were contacted again within 72 h for a telephone interview conducted by trainedinterviewers. Data collection Collection of data from patients included age, gender, nationality, educational attainment, type of health insurance, additional private insurance, smoking habit,alcohol intake, physical activity, height, weight, employ- ment status, familial status, previous number of visits and referrals to physicians. Participants were also asked toconrm whether the attending GP was their regular primary care physician or not. In France, all citizens arerequired to choose a GP as their regular physician. Thisstudy was based on patients who reported being seen exclusively by their regular family physician. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the validated 12-item Short Form (SF-12) questionnaire, 12 allowing an estimation of physical health (PCS score) and mental health (MCS score); the SF-12 questionnairewas validated in the late 90s for use in the USA, the UK, France and many other European countries. 13Patients also completed the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Beliefs Inventory (CAMBI), which assesses atti- tudes and expectations of patients towards medical care, participation in decision-making, perception of risksARTICLE SUMMARY Strengths and limitations of this study Strengths of the EPI-3 study include high representativeness of the patients involved and comparability against other nation-wide studies. The main limitation of our study relates to the classificationof GPs, which relied on self-reporting of complementary andalternative medicine prescriptions; generalisations of theresults must be therefore made cautiously since our findingsrelate to general practice in France. 2 Grimaldi-Bensouda L, Engel P, Massol J, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e001498. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001498SADD patients and GPs prescribing homeopathy and other complementary medicines on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from associated with treatment and understanding of both illness and healing process via a 17-question inventory.14 High scores on the CAMBI items indicate pro-CAMtreatment belief. GPs recorded the main reason for consultation and up-to- ve other diagnoses present that day as well as their prescriptions, which were entered by the inter-viewer in a database that automatically recorded the cor- responding ATC (anatomical therapeutic chemical) codes, revision 2009. Diagnoses relating to 100 diseases 2 were coded by a trained archivist using the ninth revi- sion of the International Classi cation of Diseases (ICD).15Patients the following the following ICD codes were as depressive: 296.3 major depressive disorder, recurrent episode; 296.5 311.9 unclassi ed depressive disorders. Patients were considered as experiencing sleep disorders if their diagnoses related to ICD codes 307.4 (speci c disorders of sleep of non-organic origin) and 780.5 (sleep disturbances). Comorbidity was de ned as the presence of at least one diagnosis other than the principal motive for consultation at the recruitment visit. Comorbidities werecategorised as co-associated sleep, anxiety or depressive disorder (other than the main reason for consultation), musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory diseases, cardiovas-cular and metabolism disorders, diabetes, thyroid and endocrine disorders and nally digestive disorders. Severity of SADD was characterised rst by the degree of quality-of-life (QoL) impairment, then by the presenceandnally by the number of associated comorbidities. Statistical analysis Characteristics of non-participants (age, gender, lengthof time attending the GP 's medical practice, type of health insurance and main reasons for consultation)were used to calibrate the nal sample as previously reported 2to ensure that it would closely represent the whole population attending French GPs practices, usinga method known in demographic studies as theCALMAR procedure. 16Overall characteristics of patients seeking access to each of the three types of GP andresults reported here were based on weighted data.Distributions were compared using 2and Fisher tests for categorical variables and Student and Wilcoxon testsfor continuous variables. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to compare patients in the GP-CM group to GP-Mx andGP-Ho groups for categorical variables and wereadjusted for all variables listed in table 1 to control for potential confounding. The GP-Mx and GP-Ho groups were compared with the GP-CM group for patients' exposure to antidepres- sants N06AA cally prescribed for SADD symptoms. Analysis of covariance analyses were performed to provide mean scores for the SF-12 mental (MCS) and physical scales (PCS) adjusted for age (<40, 40- 60, 60+ years), gender, marital status, employment status, body mass index (BMI), number of associated comorbidities (other than SADD) and nally associated SADD (other than the main diagnose, yes/no). MCS score and PCS score were categorised into 54.2 (Q3) for PCS. Associations between scores from each of the 17 ques- tions of the CAMBI questionnaire and the probability ofattending a GP-Mx or GP-Ho as compared to a GP-CM were computed after adjusting for age, gender and edu- cational level. Scores obtained per question, rangingfrom 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree), were dichotomised in order to further distinguish participants clearly in favour (scoring 5 to 7) or in disagreement(scoring 1 to 3) with the 17 CAMBI questions. Each of the three subscales scores and the total CAMBI score were then dichotomised according to the 75th percent-ile (40, 26 and 33, respectively; 96 for the total score). The possibility of a clustering effect at the practice level was tested using Generalised Estimating Equationsmultivariate models. All the analyses were performed with SAS software V.9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The study was approved by the French National Data-Protection Commission and the CNOM. Participatingphysicians received compensation fees for recruitingpatients but not patients. RESULTS A total of 825 GPs participated in the survey. There was no difference between the three groups of GPs for age(mean=50.7 years) but GP-Ho and GP-Mx were more often women than GP-CM (48.9% and 31.5% 20.3%, respectively), and and 16.9%vs 34.5%, respectively). In addition, GP-Ho were more likely to practise alone than GP-CM and GP-Mx (72.4% vs 51.8% and 55.9%, respectively) (all differences statis-tically signi cant). Among the 11 701 patients attending the doctor 'so fce on the survey day, 8652 (73.9%) agreed to participate and complete information was Grimaldi-Bensouda L, Engel P, Massol J, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e001498. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001498 3SADD patients and GPs prescribing homeopathy and other complementary medicines on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Compared to non- participants, participants were more often women (62.7% and 56.8%, respectively), younger (mean age 43.3 and 47.7, respectively) and more likely to consultfor a SADD (20.6% and 11.6%, respectively). Of the 6379 who declared the consulting physician as their regular GP , 1572 met the inclusion criteria and wereincluded in the analyses with the following diagnoses: anxiety (n=370), depression (n=583), sleep disorders (n=480) or SADD of undetermined cause (n=139). Compared to the GP-CM group, patients from the GP-Mx group showed similar characteristics but thosefrom the GP-Ho group were more frequently younger,more educated, employed women living with children or a spouse ( table 1). They also had a healthier lifestyle with lower BMI, and were more frequently non-smokers and occasional or non-consumers of alcohol. Theydeclared, however, less visits to their regular GP in theprevious year. Motives of consultation showed more anxiety and less depression in the GP-Ho group than in the two others but the distribution was unremarkableotherwise. Physicians prescribing preferences were con- rmed with the GP-Ho group using more homeopathy and less psychotropic drugs than the two other groups. The GP-Mx group, however, did not differ much from the GP-CM group. Considering the severity of mental health problem, the GP-Mx group had systematically less often an asso-ciated SADD comorbidity than in the two other groups but the distribution of comorbidities other than SADDwas unremarkable otherwise between groups ( table 2). For quality of life, the mental score summary (MCS) ofthe SF-12 was similar across the three groups with noclinically or statistically meaningful difference ( table 3).

Downloaded from The GP-Ho group, however, had a slightly better physical summary score (PCS) than the two other groups. The attitudes towards complementary medicine esti- mated by CAMBI ( table 4) showed that patients in the GP-Ho group had a probability of scoring high (favour- able to CAM) over three times that of the GP-CM groupOR=3.65, 95% CI 2.94 to 3.77). The result was consistent for each of the three CAMBI subscales with OR=2.08 (95% CI 1.78 to 2.32) for belief in natural treatment,OR=1.43 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.77) for active patient 's participation in care, and OR=2.75 (95% CI 2.55 to3.24) belief in holistic medicine. CAMBI scores frompatients of the GP-Mx group were comparable to the GP-CM group, although a slightly higher trust in natural treatment subscale was observed (OR=1.15, 95% CI1.03 to 1.26). DISCUSSION To our knowledge, the EPI3 study is the rst nationwide survey conducted in a large representative sample ofpatients to provide characteristics and attitudes, as wellas the rst to quantify quality of life and the burden of SADD in patients seeking care from their regular GPswith different preferences towards CAM and homeo-pathic practices. Our results suggest that patients experiencing SADD, and who chose a GP with a clear orientation towardshomeopathy, differed in their socio-demographic pro le but not in the severity of their mental illness from thoseattending regular GPs with prescribing preferencestowards conventional psychotropic drugs. Patients with SADD attending a GP-Ho in our study were more likely to be female, as previously reported 17-20except for onesurvey,21and younger. Association with age been sug- gested by other authors,22although no such association has been described elsewhere.17 19 21 Patients seeking care from a GP-Ho and to a lesser extent from GP-Mx had healthier lifestyles as shown by alower BMI and the higher number of patients that neversmoked in this group, a nding that has been noted pre- viously. 23Greater health awareness might not only be a driver for consulting a CAM provider but also for chan-ging from a GP-CM because of dissatisfaction with care. 24 In these circumstances, health awareness might be aproxy variable to several other motivations including adesire for shared decision-making. 25As noted by other authors, the directionality of the relation betweenhealthy lifestyle and consulting a GP-Ho could go in theopposite direction, with CAM utilisation 26and interaction with a CAM practitioner27promoting a healthier lifestyle. More longitudinal research is needed to clarify theseassociations. The higher educational attainment found among patients seeking mixed and homeopathic GPs has also been previously reported in some studies 17 19but not in others.20 21More educated people may be more knowl- edgeable about the side effects of conventional psycho-tropic drugs and hence more likely to seek alternativetreatments as suggested by Mac Lennan et al. 18 With regard to the medical conditions, the EPI3 survey is one the few studies highlighting that SADD show similarburdens in terms of severity and impact on mental impair- ment regardless of practice modalities of GPs. As for preva- lence, anxiety was con rmed as the most frequent mental health disorder encountered by alternative medicine prac- titioners, as previously reported. 51 0Higher prevalence of patients suffering from depression seeking GP-CM might be attributed to the older age structure observed in thisTable 3 Adjusted quality of life (MCS and PCS) of patients visiting their regular GP according to the type of practice (EPI3 Survey, n=1572) Quality of life (1.0) 0.64 36.4 (1.0) 0.24 PCS 42.3 (1.0) 42.9 (1.0) 0.58 45.4 (1.0) <0.001 Anxiety MCS 36.7 (1.4) 35.8 (1.2) 0.73 37.3 (1.2) 0.88 PCS 44.1 (1.4) 44.8 0.81 47.4 (1.3) 0.03 Depression MCS 34.5 (1.4) 34.6 (1.5) 0.99 34.0 (1.6) 0.92PCS 40.5 (1.5) 41.9 (1.5) 0.29 44.1 (1.6) Sleep MCS 0.06 35.7 (1.7) 0.64 PCS 44.4 (1.6) 44.3 (1.7) 0.99 47.5 (1.7) 0.03 *From analysis of covariance adjusted for age (<40, 40 -60, 60+ years), gender, marital status, employment status, body mass index, number of associated comorbidities (other than main SADD), SADD comorbidity (yes/no); a higher score indicates better health.

Downloaded from group when compared to those consulting GP-Ho: age tra- jectories observed for depression are often the opposite asthose found for anxiety. 28In spite of the fact that patients with depressive disorders in our study were less likely toseek strictly homeopaths than GP-CM, we must rememberthat depression is also one of the most commonly treated complaints as previously described for outpatient clinics of homeopathic hospitals in the UK National HealthService. 29 Studies examining representative samples of general population seeking care for SADD have consistentlyshown that a large proportion of subjects are not treated with psychotropic drugs. 30 31Conversely, psychotropic drugs use is frequently reported by subjects without identi ed psychiatric disorders.32This latter observation is probably the reason why there is an increasing trendfor patients falling into the mixed category with similarcharacteristics and SADD. It is as if they sought a com- bination of both homeopathy and conventional medi- cines to ful l individualised and holistic therapies needs and expectations, while being sure that good standards of medical and scienti c practice were met. 33This type of patients seems to be primarily concerned by associating their need for care and adequate treatment. One-third of the patients with SADD consulting a GP-Mx received con- comitantly homeopathic medicines and a psychotropicdrug: this might suggest that homeopathic medicinescould be prescribed not only as a substitute of unneces-sary conventional psychotropic drugs, but could also be viewed as an adjunct to ef cient psychotropic drugs; 10 20 34such combination has been found to poten- tially help patients to accept and improve their symp-toms 35while avoiding some possible side effects of additional conventional therapies. Although no conclu- sions can be drawn at this stage on the outcome of con- sultations to GP-Mx and GP-Ho and whether their patients were given adequate treatment, our study high-lights a genuine will from GP-Mx and GP-Ho to tailor therapies to their patients while avoiding unnecessary prescriptions. High CAMBI scores, representing greater trust and belief in CAM, were found in the GP-Ho group, particu-larly in the subscales related to belief in natural treat-ments and holistic medicine and to a lesser degree in the patient 's participation subscale. Patients of the GP-Mx group exhibited only a modest preference for natural treatments and holistic medicine with no differ- ence overall towards patients seen by physicians who practise strictly conventional medicine. The differentndings might be explained by the fact that GP-Ho operate a labelled practice in France (they must be certi-ed homeopaths) which is not the case for the GP-MxTable 4 Attitudes of patients with SADD towards complementary medicine as measured by the CAMBI (attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine beliefs inventory) questionnaire (EPI3 Survey, n=1572) Type of practice (95% CI) OR* (95% CI) 1.

Our results provide interesting evidence of criterion validity for the CAMBI scale outside the UK. As for the quality-of-life scale (SF-12), patients scored similarly on the mentalhealth subscale across all three groups of GPs, a result that was consistent with the similar number of comorbid- ities declared by treating physicians. Some studies foundthat patients seeking CAM therapies showed more QoL impairment than patients seeking conventional therap- ies. 36Other studies, including ours, suggest that, despite the modality of practice (CAM or conventional therap- ies), GPs treat patients exhibiting similar mental health problems and disease burden.37 Around 75% of patients who sought GPs exhibited additional morbidities in the EPI3 survey. The role ofcomorbidity in producing further burden from SADDhas not been studied in patients attending GPs practis- ing different modalities of treatment. 38 39Integrating research to understand the role of comorbidity in QoL is challenging due to differences across studies in QoL conceptualisation, validity of QoL measurement, recruit- ment context treatment-seeking)and consideration of sociodemographic and clinical pre- dictors. Studies generally account for a limited range of comorbidity attributes, typically the presence versus theabsence of comorbidity, which loses the richness of information inherent in psychiatric presentations. Together with a lower number of visits to GPs and a lower proportion of prescribed psychotropic drugs inthe GP-Ho group, our ndings may have relevant public health implications. For instance, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, highlighted recently that the severity of depression at which antidepressants show consistent bene ts over placebo is poorly de ned, emphasising that, in general, the more severe the symptoms, the greater the bene t. 40A patient-level meta-analysis demonstrated a lack of ef cacy for antide- pressants in the majority of patients with anxiety anddepressive disorders. 34Thus, the real impact of conven- tional antidepressants in this population is considerable, with adverse reactions outweighing potential bene ts.41 The patient 's dissatisfaction with psychotropic drugs is one of the reasons cited for seeking other treatmentoptions 42and patients with a history of depression are more likely to seek CAM than those who have neverbeen depressed before. 43 Under a primary care system designed for acute rather than chronic care, where clinicians 'routinely experience the tyranny of the urgent' ,44our results suggested that the management of SADD by GP-Ho was associated with less visits to the GP in the previous year but no more con- sultations to specialists than GP-CM. Medico-economicstudies are needed to assess the patterns of access to and management by these different practitioners, which would contribute to better plan resource allocation formental health services and target key groups for interven- tions in prevention, as far as severity of SADD is concerned.Strengths and limitations of the studyThe present study examined a relatively large number of primary care practices in order to provide a real-world picture of CAM and homeopathic practice within theFrench primary-care setting. The main strengths of the EPI3 survey have already been acknowledged elsewhere. 2 These include high representativeness of the patients involved and comparability against other nationwide studies. The weighted geographical distribution of the par- ticipating GPs in the survey was similar to the national dis-tribution of GPs in private practice across the 22 French regions surveyed, and the distribution of physicians' indi- vidual characteristics regarding age, gender, type of con- tract with national health insurance and modality of practice differed only slightly from national statistics. 45 The main limitation of our study relates to its cross- sectional design which does not allow addressing thedirectionality of the associations described between patients' characteristics and their physician 's choice of medical practice. Another limitation relates to the classi- cation of GPs, which relied on self-reporting of CAM prescriptions. The de nition of GP-Ho was more accur- ate and based on their professional certi cation. Therefore, generalisations of the results must be made cautiously, since our ndings represented general prac- tice in France. Nevertheless, this particular setting can be otherwise interpreted also as a strength, because it provided a unique opportunity to compare head-to-headprimary-care practices differing only by preferences for homeopathy and CAM, whereas all participant physi- cians shared similar medical professional status andbasic training in conventional medicine. We feel that albeit the context of the study was speci c to one country, differences between the groups of patients pro- vided reliable information on the differential utilisation of homeopathy and CAM. Finally, the fact that the participants were recruited in primary care might have excluded people with severepsychiatric disorders. This potential bias was likely to underestimate the prevalence of psychotropic drug use.However, prescriptions for psychotropic drugs were similar to those found in other French studies. 46 47 CONCLUSION The EPI3 survey is one of the largest studies to date con-ducted in general practice to describe attitudes and burden of SADD in patients seeking care from GPs with different prescribing preferences towards CAM andhomeopathic practices. Our results showed that patients with SADD, while differing principally in their socio- demographic pro les and conventional psychotropic prescriptions, were actually rather similar regarding the severity of SADD in terms of comorbidities and QOL. Further research is needed to explore potential bene ts, both in terms of health economics and in terms of care, of consulting GPs that combine CAM and CM daily in the clinical management of SADD. 8 Grimaldi-Bensouda L, Engel P, Massol J, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e001498. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001498SADD patients and GPs prescribing homeopathy and other complementary medicines on September 17, 2023 by guest.
