In addition to facilitating early and accurate diagnosis, this \"organ clock\" lets the practitioner apply therapies to the organ's meridians when they are at their peak functioning point, thereby eliciting the greatest benefit. In this book authors Michael Gienger and Wolfgang Maier have created a simple, yet highly effective self-care treatment system for addressing common health ailments using gemstones and the organ clock. They detail the healing benefits of 83 crystals, indicating the physical as well as emotional, psychic, and spiritual aspects they support in each of 12 major organ systems. For example, the stomach not only receives nourishment for the body, it also fosters the ability to engage in new things in life. Agate and calcite assist this function by giving confidence for new experiences, while aiding in digestion (and processing hard to digest thoughts). Treatments for the stomach should be done between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m., the time we typically take in new nourishment after a night of sleep, to receive maximum results. With each body system in turn, the authors explain how to select the stones best suited to address your current health concerns, the times of day they should be used, and how long treatment should last in order to restore optimum health and prevent the onset of future illness. About the Author Michael Gienger (1964-2014) was one of Europe's most respected experts on crystals and their uses, a field in which he had been active since 1988. He started collecting minerals in 1972, and in 1985 a successful self-treatment with healing crystals inspired him to pursue further training as an alternative healing practitioner. He was trained in shiatsu and completed a two-year apprentice in shamanic healing. He went on to author more than 20 publications, a number of which have become standard works in their field and have been translated into 11 languages. Wolfgang Maier began his training in traditional Chinese medicine in 1989 and in 1999 began collaborating with Michael Gienger to establish the first combination of TCM and stone healing. He lives in Germany. Praise For... \"I would recommend that you quickly skim the book overall, to get a general feeling for it, and then concentrate on the organ system/s you feel a need to work with. Do not attempt to overdo it. Take your time and the benefits will become apparent.\" \u2014 Michael Gleason, Witchgrove.com, June 2009 \". . . a healing guide recommended for any new age library.\" \u2014 California Bookwatch, The Midwest Book Review, Sept 2009 "}
