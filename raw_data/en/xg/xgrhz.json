Below, you'll discover requirements for admission. However, different requirements may apply if you are an [International Student](/admissions/international-students/), [Veteran Student](/admissions/veteran-students/), or [Transfer Student](/admissions/transfer-students/). Our knowledgeable staff will answer your questions, guide you through the admissions process, and help you chart your course for success.

These should include both lecture and laboratory components in each of the following areas: - Biology - Physics - General Chemistry - Organic Chemistry Additional coursework is recommended, but not required for admission: - Anatomy (human or comparative) - Biochemistry Transfer Guides We have assembled [transfer guides (or suggested course outlines)](/admissions/requirements/suggested-courses/) for select colleges in the U.S. that will help you choose courses at your college that will meet National University's prerequisite requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree program. All courses must be taken at an accredited institution and must be transferable at the baccalaureate level. All courses must be completed with a \"C\" grade (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) or higher. A grade of \"C-\" is not satisfactory unless it is equivalent to a 2.00 on a 4.00 scale. Overall Degree and GPA Requirements Students must have earned a baccalaureate degree and a minimum GPA of 3.00. Those between a 2.75 and 2.99 may be admitted under an Alternative Admissions Track Plan (AATP). Technical Standards In addition, students must read and understand the technical standards for their respective program. Academic Options Students who have completed their baccalaureate degree but fall short of the required science credit hours to meet National University admission requirements, may enroll in the Prerequisite Program. Students who have not completed their baccalaureate degree may enroll in the NUHS Bachelor of Biomedical Science Degree completion program. It is designed for students with a two-year/associate's degree or 60 semester hours of general education credits, who wish to earn a bachelor's degree to prepare for a career in science or health care. Students who are in the process of completing the above prerequisites at another institution are still welcome and encouraged to apply. Please contact the Office of Admissions at 1-800-826-6285 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to speak with an Admissions Counselor regarding admission. Prerequisites for DAc-C Applicants must complete a minimum of 90 semester hours of undergraduate credits with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 (on a 4.00 scale) and a masters degree in Acupuncture or Oriental Medicine. There are no specific course prerequisites required. Prerequisities for MAc and MAc-HM Credit Hours and GPA Requirements Students interested in pursuing the MAc degree program are required to have completed a minimum of 90 semester hours or 120 quarter hours with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 (on a 4.00 scale). Priority admission will be granted to students with a 3.00 cumulative GPA (on a 4.00 scale) if qualified applications exceed the number of spaces available. Suggested Preparatory Coursework Students are encouraged to take classes in biology, physiology and chemistry prior to admission into either the MAc or MAc-HM degree program. These courses will serve as an excellent foundation for a medical education at NUHS. Technical Standards In addition, Master of Acupuncture students must read and understand the technical standards for the MAc program. Prerequisities for Biomedical Science Students interested in pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree are required to have completed a minimum of 60 undergraduate semester hours (90 quarter hour credits), with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale). 1. Suggested General Education Courses The following requirements should be completed with a grade of \"C\" or higher: - 6 semester hours in English - 3 semester hours in Speech/Public Speaking - 9 semester hours in Social Sciences (courses may be taken from the following areas: anthropology, economics, history, political science, psychology, and sociology) - 9 semester hours in Arts/Humanities (courses may be taken from the following areas: language*, history, literature, philosophy, religious and cultural studies, performing arts, e.g. music/dance/theater appreciation or history, or visual arts e.g. art appreciation, film studies) - 3 semester hours in Psychology - 30 elective semester hours in any general education, liberal arts, life or physical science** * Language classes must be upper-level courses designed to increase knowledge of the culture. Courses focused on learning to speak or write a language will not fulfill this requirement. ** Students can be admitted with fewer hours. This determination is made by the dean on an individual basis. Suggested General Education Courses We have assembled [suggested general education courses](https://www.nuhs.edu/admissions/requirements/general-education) for select colleges in the U.S. that will help you choose courses at your college that will meet National University's prerequisite requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree program. 2. Science Transfer Guides Although BS applicants are not required to take science courses prior to applying to the program, students do have the option to complete comparable science coursework prior to applying. NUHS has developed [transfer guides listing comparable science courses](/admissions/requirements/science-transfer-guides/) that can transfer from your community college or 4-year institution into the BS in Biomedical Sciences program. Immunization Requirements National University of Health Sciences distributes Immunization Guidelines and Certificate of Immunity forms to all new students.
