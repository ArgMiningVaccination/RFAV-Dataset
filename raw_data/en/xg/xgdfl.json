Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) I bought two of the Healing Rituals as gifts for a dear friend and family member. Beautifully packaged with instructions on how to use them. Both recipients were delighted with their gifts and are looking forward to using them. What an excellent kit. The sage was lovely, the candle smells fabulous and lasts long. The pulse point oil is just perfect for me and the amethyst crystal is just right. The guide for the ritual is very helpful. I feel so much at peace when doing the ritual and will be doing it every day. My house smells so good, after the ritual as well! This was just what I needed having been signed off work with stress and anxiety. Such a huge calming help in my recovery. This kit is just perfect! I recently came out of hospital and needed something to help me reconnect and rebalance myself. Practicing the daily ritual has done just that with the wonderful aroma of patchouli in the candle that helps me stays grounded whilst wearing the pulse point trust oil. Beautiful Products. From what I've been told this was a lovely gift! I bought it for someone who is very ill. I wanted something that would help her with the healing process and this didn't disappoint. She loved it. Customer service was excellent too. I'll certainly be ordering from this company again. "}
