It gives me great pleasure to present you with our 13th Annual Report at a time when India has shown remarkable resilience in the face of a pandemic, emerging as the world's fastest-growing economy. As India has the world's largest young population and strong economic fundamentals, the country is poised for rapid growth in the coming years. 4 Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited After a period of stagnation, the housing nance sector in India real estate market is expected to witness healthy growth in the next ve years and HFCs will be able to capitalise on this opportunity. The growth will be driven by factors such as the signi cant under penetration of mortgage in India, increasing disposable income of a growing young population, rapid urbanisation and a good traction in primary residential housing sales with stable housing prices. Further, the lowest interest rates in decades, combined with stable property prices, a low impact of the pandemic on job losses and wage growth in the salaried segment, have resulted in improved borrower affordability. This, coupled with the need for more housing during the pandemic, bodes well for HFCs to drive overall assets under management (AUM) growth in the face of stiff competition from banks. With increasing geographical penetration and a possible increase in ticket size, affordable housing nance segment could see strong growth in the coming years. The affordable housing nance market stood at 9 Trillion in FY 2020-21 and is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 9-10% to 13 Trillion by FY 2024-25.

This has taken the affordable mix to 38% from 27% in the last year. The shift in the segment mix, supported by lower cost of borrowing, has powered the Company to achieve the highest ever margin of 4.52% in Q4. ABHFL will continue to grow the affordable book that would improve the margin further. The Net Interest Income witnessed a robust growth of 20% to 527 Crore compared to 440 Crore in the previous year.

As the situation improved globally with time, India was at the forefront in terms of opening its markets and industries. There has been a steady pick up in the real estate market since the last quarter of 2020 owing to an increase in demand for residential spaces. Government initiatives such as vaccination drives to lower the risk of infection, housing and infrastructure boosts through schemes and funding in the Union Budgets, lowering of interest rates, attractive offers by developers stable housing prices and shifts in customer sentiments, have played an important role in the positive trajectory of this industry. We have grown stronger and ended the year with 120 branches, 68% of which are in Tier III/IV markets. Our customer base stood at 45,000+, portfolio at 12,005 Crore, and net worth at 1,721 Crore.

The sharp uptick was on the back of continued ultra-accommodative monetary policy, impact of strong fiscal response to the pandemic, and gradual normalisation of economic activities from extreme Covid restrictions on the back of availability of vaccines and focus shifting to live with Covid. DM economies led by US were the clear leader in this growth revival. Emerging Market (EM) growth recovery adjusted for base was relatively modest except for commodity exporters. The divergence in policy response to the pandemic and vaccination turned out to be the key differentiator in growth outcomes between DMs and EMs. Although fiscal was expansionary across the globe, DMs underwent an extraordinarily large expansionary fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate demand including by substantial direct/indirect transfers to households. Most of the EMs saw expansionary fiscal on account of shortfall in receipts due to collapse in economic activity. The strong burst of demand, much higher than pre-Covid levels in key markets like US, was faced with disrupted supply chains, supply curtailment of crude by OPEC+ and weak supply response in many other commodities due to long period of low investment. This resulted in strong burst of inflation across the globe, making multi-decade highs in many important economies. Aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions undertaken to support the economy after the COVID-induced shock to aggregate demand on one hand, and supply chain disruptions resulting from local lockdowns and rotation from services to goods spending on the other hand, created the perfect storm for inflation. What was initially deemed 'transitory' inflation showed remarkable strength and surprised all analysts with inflation at multi-decade highs in the developed world. Adding further fuel to the fire, the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered unprecedented sanctions from the West causing energy prices to spike from already elevated levels on the back of resurgent demand and OPEC+ led supply control. High inflation has forced hawkish pivots from major Central Banks led by US Fed resulting in sharp rise in bond yields as market participants re-assess the path of interest rates. Evolution of Russia-Ukraine war and resurgence of Covid in China has emerged as other risk factors for global economy. OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ECONOMY After a 6.6 per cent contraction in FY 2020-21, the Indian economy rebounded to 8.9 per cent in FY 2021-22 as per the second advance estimates released by the NSO. The strong Delta wave in the beginning of the fiscal had a significant negative impact on growth in the first half of the fiscal. While economy has shown steady recovery from 2Q FY22 onwards, it has largely been a K shaped recovery with informal and contact intensive sectors lagging, while industry and agriculture doing much better. The Omicron wave in early 2022 also impacted growth, although much lesser than the Delta wave. Falling infections, rapid vaccination coverage and quick normalisation of mobility have facilitated the recovery in economic activity over the last year. Rural demand has remained resilient while urban demand has also recovered with pent-up demand supporting the recovery in contact-intensive sectors. We are witnessing steady economic recovery in India from the troughs of delta wave, but the recovery is far from complete, and it is a K shaped recovery with segments most impacted like trade, hotel, transport and other high contact services still running below pre-pandemic levels. Private final consumption expenditure and consumption sentiment survey have been weak. However, recovery has moved much further in industrial sector, construction and exports. Inflation also rose in India like in much of the world, but largely remained within RBI tolerance band. Higher inflation in Indian has largely been due to high commodity prices and global supply disruptions. After remaining ultra accommodative and giving preference to growth over inflation, high inflation has finally resulted in pivot by RBI which now gives more importance to inflation over growth, although remaining accommodative. The Union Budget for FY 2022-23 was focused on growth revival, budgeting for an aggressive capex spending while setting a fiscal deficit target at an elevated level of 6.4% of GDP. Consequently government borrowing remains elevated. High inflation, hawkish RBI, sharp increase in bond yields in DMs and the large borrowing programme have caused interest rates in India to rise significantly. Exports and Imports both jumped sharply in FY22 as high oil prices, demand for gold and strong global growth supported both imports and exports.

FY2023 - MACRO ECONOMIC OUTLOOK As the global economy started witnessing some green shoots of recovery post Covid-19, the crisis between Russia-Ukraine put some dampener. In a worse-case situation, the conflict may lead to financial instability and supply chain disruptions, esp in semiconductor, food and auto industries where Russia and Ukraine are the major suppliers of raw materials. Combined with this, if another Covid wave surfaces, there could be a relatively greater impact to the economy. While supply disruptions and sanctions will feed into domestic prices, the larger impact on India's inflation will be due to sharply rising oil and gas, commodity, and food and fertiliser prices. To contain inflation, policy rates are likely to rise. These will likely get passed to the end consumer, thereby delaying demand. India has endured the 33 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Management Discussion & Analysis (Contd.) pandemic for two years and has come out of it more resilient. The expected GDP growth should range between 7.5% and 8.0% in FY2022-23 and between 6.7% and 7.1% in FY2023-24. The long-term growth outlook for the Housing sector remains positive given the large untapped market, favourable demographic profile, rising income, housing shortage, improved affordability and government support in the form of tax sops and subsidies. NBFC - HFC OUTLOOK The lowest interest rates seen in decades along with stable property prices, the low impact of the pandemic on job losses and wage growth in the salaried segment, have led to improved affordability for borrowers. This accompanied with the need for a bigger housing space during the pandemic bodes well for HFCs to drive the overall assets under management (AUM) growth despite stiff competition from banks. Affordable housing financers could witness strong loan growth due to increasing geographical penetration and a possible increase in ticket size (partly due to asset inflation), thereby driving higher loan growth in FY23. According to CRISIL Research, Affordable housing finance market stood at ` 9 Tn in FY21 and the same is expected to witness healthy 9-10% CAGR and rise to ~ ` 13 Tn by FY24-25P. Amidst this, ABHFL's purpose remains to further strengthen the government's vision of Housing for All and contribute to nation building in its humble way. ABHFL OUTLOOK - OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS Opportunities Under-penetration of financial services in India offers growth opportunities With forced lockdowns and continued WFH, there is a need for larger homes leading to rise in demand for ready to move in or near completion properties Shift in investor driven RE market to an end user driven market leading to higher demand backed by new project launches by top developers Expansion in tier II and beyond with the rise in reverse migration Focus on technology to enhance end-to-end digital journeys and deliver superior borrowing experience to customersThreats Mutation of the virus has led to possible threat of a third wave of the pandemic. This can have an adverse impact on the overall industry affecting business growth and asset quality Increasing competition with some segments being dominated by Banks with lower cost of funds ABHFL will continue its focus on Affordable Housing segment and increase its contribution to 65% of portfolio. We further intend to grow our retail penetration by leveraging the Ultratech ecosystem of 30,000+ dealers and 2500+ UBS (Ultratech Business Solutions) dealers to expand reach in Tier III & IV locations with a lean branch model. With customer at the core of all designs, ABHFL's focus is on improving 'life on book' by Use of analytics to improve Customer Value proposition by offering top-ups to good customers and managing attrition.

The financial year 2021-22 due to the pandemic and consequent lockdowns caused disruption and challenges. The Company showed good resilience due to the strong Business Continuity Plan and pandemic plans. Over the years, the Company built a strong Risk Management Framework supported by well-established policies and procedures and a talented pool of Risk Professionals. The Company was able to face the unprecedented challenges during the last year and emerge stronger during these turbulent times due to some of these policies and framework. The organisational structure to address the risk consists of \"Three lines of defense\": First is : Line Management (Functional Heads) to ensure that accountability and ownership is as close as possible to the activity that creates the risks; Second is: Risk Oversight including the Risk and Compliance Function and Risk Management Committee; Third is: Independent Assurance - Internal Audit, conducted by Independent Internal Auditors, whose work is reviewed by the Audit Committee.

The continual disruptions caused by the Covid 19 pandemic and frequent lockdowns tested the Business Continuity Policy of the Company, nevertheless, it continued to operate in line with the procedures outlined in its Business Continuity Plan, which was modified to take care of the evolving situation and a pandemic plan was developed keeping in view the interest of various stakeholders like employees, customers, partners, distributors, etc. within the overall regulatory requirements and guidelines. As a result, the Company was able to continue to operate and serve customers while taking care of the health of their employees. To manage the impact of the pandemic on the Company, a Crisis Management Team (CMT) comprising of Leadership Team members and led by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company was formed. Employees' health and safety was accorded top priority. Various steps were taken well before the lockdown to reduce congestion in office, maintain social distancing and enable work from home for the employees. Critical processes were identified, reviewed for implementation in a work from home scenario and wherever required alternate controls were instituted. The work from home plan was tested well in advance and glitches ironed out. After announcement of national lockdown, work from home was fully enabled for all employees. The Company also used lessons from 'work from home' experiment and reimagined work in a vibrant environment. Building on these lessons and practices executed during the crisis, ABHFL deployed workforce strategies and ecosystems banded together to leverage its collective and complementary capabilities and effect meaningful change.

The Executive Compensation Philosophy supports the design of programmes that align executive rewards - including incentive programmes, retirement benefit programmes, promotion and advancement opportunities - with the long- term success of the stakeholders. The reward programmes recognise and reward executives who display initiative, deliver superior individual performance, and contribute to sustainable corporate and business success. The business and organisational model The Group is a conglomerate and organised in a manner such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure. This results in uniformity of business processes and systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary customer experiences. I. Objectives of the executive remuneration programme The executive remuneration programme is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who will contribute to the long-term success and thereby build value for the shareholders. The executive compensation programme is intended to: 1. Provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements to the executives on a holistic basis 2. Emphasise \"Pay for Performance\" by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed Group, business and individual goals. II. Covered executives The Executive remuneration Philosophy applies to the following: 1. Director 2. Key Managerial Personnel : CFO, CS, any others CEO equivalent ( ex: Deputy Managing Director) 3. Senior Management III. Business and talent competitors The Company benchmarks the executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of similar size. In addition to this, it looks at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and levels across the Group are broadly equitable internally and support the Group's global mobility objectives for executive talent. The additional reference points may take into account the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and industries, recognising the differences in levels and medium of pay.IV. Executive pay positioning The Company aims to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to the executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and benefits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive pay-outs at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. It recognises the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience while positioning the executives. It uses secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector. V. i. Executive pay-mix The executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits. ii. Performance goal setting The Company aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long-term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic. Threshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall reflect a base-line level of performance, reflecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement. Target performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance. Maximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, reflecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement. VI. i. Performance measurement Annual incentive plan: The Company ties annual incentive plan pay-outs of the executives to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. It annually aligns the financial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for the business.61 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Long-Term Incentive: The Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth and act as an attraction and retention tool The Company uses stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicle for the executives as it believes that they best align executive incentives with stockholder interests. The Company grants restricted stock units, as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain the executives. ii. Executive benefits and perquisites The executives are eligible to participate in the broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans. In addition to these broad- based plans, they are eligible for other benefits plans commensurate with their roles. These benefits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group. They are also eligible for certain perquisites with each perquisite serving a clear business purpose or need. Other remuneration elements Each of the executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for the executives including continuity of service across the group companies. The Company limits other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and the Company does not provide for any tax gross-ups for the executives. Risk and compliance The Company aims to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not enctheage excessive risk taking. It reviews the remuneration programs for factors such as 1. Remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives 2. Uncapped pay-outs 3. Unreasonable goals or thresholds 4. Steep pay-out cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds Claw back clause: In an incident of restatement of financial statements due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act 2013 and the rules made thereafter, it shall recover from the executives the remuneration received in excess of what would be payable to him / her as per restatement of financial statements the executives is obligated to pertaining to the relevant performance year. Implementation The Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination & Remuneration Committee in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy. The costs of these services will be established through \"arm's length\", market-based agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.Annexure V (Contd.)62 Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited Annexure VI To The Members Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited, We have conducted a Secretarial Audit of the compliance of applicable statutory provisions and the adherence to good corporate practices by Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited.

We have audited the accompanying Ind AS financial statements of Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited (\"the Company\"), which comprise the balance sheet as at 31st March 2022, and the statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (\"the Financial Statements\"). 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31st March 2022, and its profit and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (\"SAs\") specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\"ICAI\") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act, and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the Financial Statements. Emphasis of Matter 4. We draw attention to Note no. 8 of the Financial Statements, which describes the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company's operations depending on future developments, which being uncertain, the said note narrates management's proposed future actions based on its assessment of internal as well as external factors and macro level developments. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Key Audit Matters 5. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Sr. NoKey Audit Matter How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit 1Provisioning based on Expected Credit Loss model (ECL) under IND AS 109 and testing of Impairment of assets, more par - ticularly the Loan Book of the Company Refer to the accounting policies in 'Note 3.23 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements: Expected Credit Loss', 'Note 3.1 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements: Revenue Recognition' and 'Note 4.1 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements: Impairment of Financial Assets and 'Note 49 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements: Risk Management'. Subjective estimates: Under Ind AS 109, \"Financial Instruments\", allowance for loan losses are determined using expected credit loss ('ECL') estimation model. The estimation of ECL on financial instruments involves significant judgement and estimates and therefore increased levels of audit focus in the Company's estimation of ECLs are as under: Data inputs - The application of ECL model requires several data inputs. This increases the risk of completeness and accuracy of the data that has been used to create assumptions in the model.Our key audit procedures included: Review of Policy/procedures & design/controls Minutely going through the Board approved Policy and approach note concerning the assessment of credit and other risks and ascertainment/ageing of 'default' by the borrowers and procedures in relation to stages and ECL computation. Testing key controls relating to selection and implementation of material macro-economic variables and the controls over the scenario selection and application of probability weights.74 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedIndependent Auditors' Report (Contd.) Sr. NoKey Audit Matter How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit Model estimations - Inherently judgmental models are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probabilities of Default (\"PD\"), Loss Given Default (\"LGD\"), and Exposures at Default (\"EAD\"). The PD and the LGD are the key drivers of estimation complexity in the ECL and as a result are considered the most significant judgmental aspect of the Company's modelling approach. Economic scenarios - Ind AS 109 requires the Company to measure ECLs on an unbiased forward- looking basis reflecting a range of future economic indicators. Significant management judgement is applied in determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weights applied to them. The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the impairment of loans and advances to customers, involving estimations and judgements, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements as a whole. Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key internal financial controls including monitoring process of overdue loans (including those which became overdue after the reporting date), measurement of provision, stage-wise classification of loans, identification of NPA accounts, assessing the reliability of management information. Understanding management's approach, interpretation, systems and controls implemented in relation to probability of default and stage-wise bifurcation of product-wise portfolios for timely ascertainment of stress and early warning signals. Testing of review controls over measurement of provisions and disclosures in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements. Involvement of Information system resource to obtain comfort over data integrity and process of report generation through interface of various systems. Understanding of models and general economic indicator criteria used for regression testing over data of the loan book. Substantive verification Sample testing over key inputs, data and assumptions impacting ECL calculations to assess the completeness, accuracy and relevance of data and reasonableness of economic forecasts, weights, and model assumptions applied. Model calculations testing through selective re-performance, wherever possible. Assessing disclosures - Assessed whether the disclosures on key judgements, assumptions and quantitative data with respect to impairment of loans (including restructuring related disclosures) in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements are appropriate and sufficient as also aligned to regulatory requirements. 2Information Technology IT systems and controls The Company's financial reporting processes are dependent on technology considering significant number of transactions that are processed daily across multiple and discrete Information Technology ('IT') systems. The Financial accounting system of the Company is interfaced with several other IT systems including Loan Management & Originating systems and several other systemic workflows.In course of audit, our focus was on user access management, change management, segregation of duties, system reconciliation controls and system application controls over key financial accounting and reporting systems. We performed a range of audit procedures, which included: Review of the report of IS Audit carried in earlier year(s) by an independent firm of Chartered Accountants pertaining to IT systems general controls including access rights over applications, operating systems and databases relied upon for financial reporting.75 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Sr. NoKey Audit Matter How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit IT general and application controls are critical to ensure that changes to applications and underlying data are made in an appropriate manner. Adequate controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to the applications and data. These includes implementation of preventive and detective controls across critical applications and infrastructure. Due to the pervasive nature of role of information technology systems in financial reporting, in our preliminary risk assessment, we planned our audit by assessing the risk of a material misstatement arising from the technology as significant for the audit, hence the Key Audit Matter. Deployed our internal experts to carry out IT general and specific application Controls testing and identifying gaps, if any. Our other processes include: selectively recomputing interest calculations and maturity dates; Selectively re-evaluating masters updation, interface with resultant reports like LTV Report, SUD Report, Portfolio movement Report, etc.; Selective testing of the interface of SAP FA module with other IT systems like Loan Management System and other workflows. Testing of the system generated reports and accounting entries manually for core financial reporting matters (i.e. verification around the computer system) Evaluating the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the significant accounts-related IT automated controls which are relevant to the accuracy of system calculation, and the consistency of data transmission. Other areas that were independently assessed included password policies, system configurations, system interface controls, controls over changes to applications and databases Independent Auditors' Report (Contd.) Other Matters 6. The comparative financial information for the year ended 31st March 2021 included in the Financial Statements are based on the previously issued financial statements as audited by the then statutory auditors, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, Chartered Accountants, whose audit report dated 11th May 2021, expressed an unmodified opinion on the said Financial Statements of the previous financial year. Our report is not modified in respect of this matter. Other Information 7. The Company's Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's annual report but does not include the Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon. The Other Information is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.8. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 9. In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 10. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act, with respect to the preparation of these Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit and 76 Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limitedother comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian accounting standards (\"Ind AS\") specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 11. In preparing the Financial Statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 12. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 13. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements. 14. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 14.1 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 14.2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 14.3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. 14.4 Conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 14.5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 15. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 16. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.Independent Auditors' Report (Contd.)77 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Independent Auditors' Report (Contd.) 17. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Opinion 1. We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements of Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited (\"the Company\") as at 31st March 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 2.

Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 3. The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal controls over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.Auditors' Responsibility 4. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing (\"SA\"), prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements. Those SAs and the Guidance Note require that we comply with the ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 5. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system with reference to the Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. 6. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Financial Statements 7. A company's internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to the Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company has received a Certificate of Registration from the National Housing Bank ('NHB') on 9th July 2014 to commence/carry on the business of Housing Financial Institution ('HFC') without accepting public deposits. 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION 2.1 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value; and defined benefit plans where plan assets are measured at fair value, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in India, the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') and (Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015) along with other relevant provisions of the Act, the Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Company - Housing Finance Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2021, RBI/2020- 21/73 DOR.FIN.HFC.CC.No.120/03.10.136/2020-21, 17th February, 2021 ('the RBI Master Directions') and notification for Implementation of Indian Accounting Standard vide circular RBI/2019-20/170 DOR(NBFC). CC.PD. No.109/22.10.106/2019-20 dated 13th March 2020 ('RBI Notification for Implementation of Ind AS') issued by RBI. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Management is satisfied that the Company shall be able to continue its business for the foreseeable future and no material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on going concern assumption. In making this assessment, the Management has considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources. To provide more reliable and relevant information about the effect of certain items in the Balance Sheet and Statement of Profit and Loss, the Company has changed the classification of certain items. Previous period/year figures have been re-grouped or reclassified, to confirm to such current period grouping/classifications. There is no impact on Equity or Net Loss due to these regrouping/reclassifications. Amounts in the financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees in Lakh rounded off to two decimal places as permitted by Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Per share data are presented in Indian Rupee to two decimal places.2.2 Presentation of Financial Statements The Company presents its balance sheet in order of liquidity in compliance with requirements of Schedule III of the Companies Act 2013 (\"the Act\") applicable for Non Banking Finance Companies (\"NBFC\"). An analysis regarding recovery or settlement within 12 months after the reporting date (current) and more than 12 months after the reporting date (non-current) is presented in note 48. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 \"Statement of Cash Flows\". The disclosure requirements with respect to items in the Balance Sheet and Statement of Profit and Loss, as prescribed in the Schedule III to the Act, are presented by way of notes forming part of the financial statements along with the other notes required to be disclosed under the notified accounting standards. 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3.1 Recognition of Interest Income 3.1.1 The Effective Interest Rate Method For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit losses. Any fees collected or costs incurred in respect of financial instruments form an integral part of the EIR. 3.1.2 Interest Income The Company calculates interest income by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than credit-impaired assets. When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired (as set out in note 3.23) and is, therefore, regarded as 'Stage 3', the Company calculates interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost of the financial asset. If the financial assets cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Company reverts to calculating interest income on a gross basis. Interest income on all trading assets and other financial assets which are required to be measured at FVTPL is recognised using the contractual interest rate in net gain on fair value changes.91 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 3.2 Recognition of Income and Expenses 3.2.1 Fee and Commission Income Fee and commission income include fees other than those that are an integral part of EIR. The Company recognises the fee and commission income in accordance with the terms of the relevant contracts/agreement and when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration. 3.2.2 Dividend Income Dividend income (including from FVOCI investments) is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established. 3.3 Property, Plant and Equipment All items of property, plant and equipment (PPE) are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment loss if any. The cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. Depreciation Methods, Estimated Useful Lives and Residual Value Depreciation is provided on straight line basis so as to write off the cost of the assets (other than freehold land) less their residual values, using the rates arrived at based on the useful lives estimated by the Management. The Company has used the following useful life to provide depreciation on its property, plant and equipment. AssetUseful life as prescribed by Schedule II of the Co's Act, 2013Estimated useful life Office computers and electronic equipment3 years 4 Years Vehicles 8 years 5 Years Furniture, fixtures and other office equipment10 years 7 Years Buildings 60 years 60 years Leasehold improvementsOver the primary period of the leaseOver the primary period of the lease or 3 years; whichever is lowerUseful life of assets different from as prescribed in Schedule II has been estimated by management and is supported by the technical assessment. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used. Depreciation on assets whose cost individually does not exceed 5,000/- is fully provided in the year of purchase. Depreciation on assets acquired/sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the statement of profit and loss from/till the date of acquisition or sale. PPE not ready for the intended use on the date of the Balance Sheet are disclosed as \"capital work-in-progress\". 3.4 Intangible Assets Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of 3 years or it's useful life whichever is lower. Amortization on the intangible assets added/disposed off/discarded during the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the month of addition/disposal/ discarding. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year end. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. Intangible assets under development Expenditure on Research and/or development eligible for capitalisation are carried as intangible assets under development where such assets are not yet ready for their intended use. 3.5 Impairment of Non Financial Assets The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an non financial asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment 92 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount and the resulting impairment loss is charged to the statement of profit and loss. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life. 3.6 Taxes 3.6.1 Current Tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date in the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 3.6.2 Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.93 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority. 3.7 Retirement and Other Employee Benefits 3.7.1 Short term Employee Benefits Employee benefits falling due wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short term employee benefits and are expensed in the period in which the employee renders the related service. Liabilities recognised in respect of short term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service. 3.7.2 Defined Contribution Plan Retirement benefit in the form of Government managed Employee Provident Fund and Government managed Employee Pension Fund are the defined contribution schemes. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the respective schemes which are recognised as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. 3.7.3 Defined Benefit Plan The Company operates a defined benefit gratuity plan, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. The Company's liabilities under Payment of Gratuity Act and compensated absences are determined on the basis of actuarial valuation made at the end of each financial year using the projected unit credit method. Obligation is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discounted rate that is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on government bonds where the currency and terms of the government bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated terms of the defined benefit obligation. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefits arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of: The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and The date that the Company recognises related restructuring costsNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under employee benefit expenses in the statement of profit and loss. Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements, Net interest expense or income. 3.7.4 Long Term Incentive Benefit Other long term incentive benefits includes future encashment or availment, at the option of the employee subject to the rules framed by the Company which are expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of the year and long term incentive payable to employees on fulfilment of criteria prescribed by the Company. 3.7.5 Termination Benefits Termination benefits such as compensation under employee separation schemes are recognised as expense when the Company's offer of the termination benefit is accepted or when the Company recognises the related restructuring costs whichever is earlier. 3.8 Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur at amortised cost using EIR. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. 3.9 Cash and Cash Equivalent Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with banks with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 3.10 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.94 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 3.11 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the Company determines the level of provision by discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. Provisions are determined based on best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Contingent liability is disclosed in case when a present obligation arising from past events, when it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a present obligation arising from past events, when no reliable estimate is possible. Where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under such contract, the present obligation under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. Contingent assets are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date. 3.12 Commitments Commitments are future liabilities for contractual expenditure, classified and disclosed as follows: a) Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account and not provided for; b) Uncalled liability on shares and other investments partly paid; c) Funding related commitment to associate and joint venture companies; andd) Other non-cancellable commitments, if any, to the extent they are considered material and relevant in the opinion of management. 3.13 Leases 3.13.1 Company as a Lessee The Company's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land and buildings. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognises right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight- line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the under lying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value - in - use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent of those from other assets. In such 95 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment on exercise of an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows. 3.13.2 Company as a Lessor Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. For operating leases, rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 3.14 Special Reserve The Company creates special reserve every year out of its profits in terms of Section 29C of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987. For this purpose any special reserve created by the Company under Section 36(1) (viii) of the Income- tax Act, 1961 is considered to be an eligible transfer. 3.15 Securities Premium Securities premium is recognised for shares issued at premium. The issue expenses of securities which qualify as equity instruments are written off against securities. 3.16 Financial Instruments - Initial Recognition 3.16.1 Date of Recognition Financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of loans, debt securities and borrowings are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way trades: purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers' account. The Company recognises debt securities and borrowings when funds reach the Company. 3.16.2 Initial Measurement of Financial Instruments The classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and the business model for managing the instruments. Financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value, except in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at FVTPL, transaction costs are added to, or subtracted from, this amount. Trade receivables are measured at the transaction price. When the fair value of financial instruments at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, the Company accounts for the Day 1 profit or loss, as described below. 3.16.3 Day 1 Profit or Loss When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Company recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in net gain on fair value changes. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit or loss when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised. 3.16.4 Measurement Categories of Financial Assets and Liabilities The Company classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets and the asset's contractual terms, measured at either amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income(FVOCI) and Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). 3.17 Financial Assets and Liabilities 3.17.1 Bank Balances, Loans, Trade receivables and Financial Investments at Amortised Cost The Company measures Bank balances, Loans, Trade receivables and other financial investments at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and96 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. 3.17.2 Debt Securities and Other Borrowed Funds After initial measurement, debt issued and other borrowed funds are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on issue funds, and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. A compound financial instrument which contains both a liability and an equity component is separated at the issue date. 3.17.3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition or are mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under Ind AS 109. Management only designates an instrument at FVTPL upon initial recognition when one of the following criteria are met. Such designation is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis: 1. The designation eliminates, or significantly reduces, the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets or liabilities or recognising gains or losses on them on a different basis. 2. The liabilities are part of a group of financial liabilities, which are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy. 3. The liabilities containing one or more embedded derivatives, unless they do not significantly modify the cash flows that would otherwise be required by the contract, or it is clear with little or no analysis when a similar instrument is first considered that separation of the embedded derivative(s) is prohibited. Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss with the exception of movements in fair value of liabilities designated at FVTPL due to changes in the Company's own credit risk. Such changes in fair value are recorded in the Own credit reserve through OCI and do not get recycled to the profit or loss. Interest earned or incurred on instruments designated at FVTPL is accrued in interest income or finance cost, respectively, using the EIR, taking into account any discount/premium and qualifying transaction costs being an integral part of instrument. Interest earned on assets mandatorily required to be measured at FVTPL is recorded using contractual interest rate. 3.17.4 Undrawn Loan Commitments Undrawn loan commitments are commitments under which, over the duration of the commitment, the Company is required to provide a loan with pre-specified terms to the customer. Undrawn loan commitments are in the scope of the ECL requirements. The nominal contractual value of undrawn loan commitments, where the loan agreed to be provided is on market terms, are not recorded in the balance sheet. 3.18 Reclassification of Financial Assets and Liabilities The Company does not reclassify its financial assets subsequent to their initial recognition, apart from the exceptional circumstances in which the Company acquires, disposes of, or terminates a business line. Financial liabilities are never reclassified. The Company did not reclassify any of its financial assets or liabilities in FY 2021-22 and FY 2020-21. 3.19 Modification and Derecognition of Financial Asset A modification of a financial asset occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified between initial recognition and maturity of the financial asset. A modification affects the amount and/or timing of the contractual cash flows either immediately or at a future date. When a financial asset is modified the Company assesses whether this modification results in derecognition. \"In the case where the financial asset is derecognised the loss allowances for ECL is remeasured at the date of derecognition to determine the net carrying amount of the asset at that date. The difference between this revised carrying amount and the fair value of the new financial asset with the new terms may lead to a gain or loss on derecognition. The new financial asset may have a loss allowance measured based on 12-month ECL except where the new loan is considered to be originated-credit impaired. 97 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 When the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the Company determines if the financial asset's credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.\" A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when: The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or it retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 3.20 Derecognition of Financial Liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 3.21 Repossession of Collaterals To mitigate the credit risk on financial assets, the Company seeks to use collateral, as per the powers conferred on the HFC under SARFAESI act. In its normal course of business, the Company does not physically repossess properties or other assets in its portfolio, but engages external agents to recover funds, generally at auction, to settle outstanding debt. Any surplus funds are returned to the customers/obligors. As a result of this practice, the residential properties under legal repossession processes are not recorded on the balance sheet and not treated as non-current assets held for sale. 3.22 Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as a speculative investments. However, where derivatives do not meet the hedge accounting criteria, they are classified as 'held for trading' for accounting purposes and are accounted for at FVTPL. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Company designates certain derivatives as either: hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value changes) hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges). At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether the changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company documents its risk management objective before undertaking hedge transactions. 3.22.1 Cash Flow hedges that qualify for Hedge Accounting The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, within Other Income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within 'finance cost' at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset.98 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss within other gains/(losses). 3.23 Impairment of Financial Assets 3.23.1 Overview of the ECL principles The Company records allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) for all loans, other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with loan commitments, in this section all referred to as 'financial instruments'. The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months' expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined in note 3.23.2. The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments. The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument's credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. Based on the above process, the Company categorises its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 and POCI, as described below: Stage 1 When loans are first recognised, the Company recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2. Stage 2 When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3. Stage 3 Loans considered credit-impaired. The Company records an allowance for the LTECLs.POCI Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and interest income is subsequently recognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses. 3.23.2 The Calculation of ECLs The Company calculates ECLs based on a probability- weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: PD The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. EAD The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. LGD The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD. When estimating the ECLs, the Company considers four scenarios (a base case, an upside, a mild downside ('downside 1') and a more extreme downside ('downside 2')). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.99 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 Impairment losses and releases are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset's gross carrying value. The mechanics of the ECL method are summarised below: Stage 1 The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Company calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. Stage 2 When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records an allowance for the LTECLs. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, but PDs and LGDs are estimated over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. Stage 3 For loans considered credit-impaired, the Company recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these loans. The method is similar to that for Stage 2 assets, with the PD set at 100%. POCI POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. The Company only recognises the cumulative changes in lifetime ECLs since initial recognition, based on a probability-weighting of the four scenarios, discounted by the credit-adjusted EIR. Loan When estimating LTECLs for undrawn loan commi- commitments, the Company estimates the tments expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the four scenarios. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the loan.For a loan and an undrawn commitment, ECLs are calculated and presented together with the loan. For loan commitments, the ECL is recognised within provisions. 3.23.3 Significant Increase in Credit Risk The Company monitors all financial assets and financial guarantee contracts that are subject to the impairment requirements to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If there has been a significant increase in credit risk the Company will measure the loss allowance based on lifetime rather than 12-month ECL. In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date based on the remaining maturity of the instrument with the risk of a default occurring that was anticipated for the remaining maturity at the current reporting date when the financial instrument was first recognised. In making this assessment, the Company considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort, based on the Company's historical experience and expert credit assessment. Given that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition is a relative measure, a given change, in absolute terms, in the Probability of Default will be more significant for a financial instrument with a lower initial PD than compared to a financial instrument with a higher PD. As a back-stop when loan asset becomes 30 days past due, the Company considers that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred and the asset is in stage 2 of the impairment model, i.e. the loss allowance is measured as the lifetime ECL. 3.23.4 Credit-Impaired Financial Assets A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Credit-impaired financial assets are referred to as Stage 3 assets. Evidence of credit impairment includes observable data about the following events: significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; a breach of contract such as a default or past due event; restructuring of loans due to financial difficulty of the borrowers;100 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties; or the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses. It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event. Instead, the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired. The Company assesses whether debt instruments that are financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are credit-impaired at each reporting date. To assess if corporate debt instruments are credit impaired, the Company considers factors such as bond yields, credit ratings and the ability of the borrower to raise funds. A loan is considered credit-impaired when a concession is granted to the borrower due to deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. The definition of default includes unlikeliness to pay indicators and a back-stop if amounts are overdue for 90 days or more. 3.23.5 Trade Receivables and Other Assets The Company follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward- looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated for changes in the forward-looking estimates. 3.23.6 Forward Looking Information In its ECL models, the Company relies on a broad range of forward looking information as economic inputs, such as: GDP growth, unemployment rates, Central Bank base rates, house price indices, etc The inputs and models used for calculating ECLs may not always capture all characteristics of the market at the date of the financial statements. To reflect this, qualitative adjustments or overlays are occasionally made as temporary adjustments when such differences are significantly material. 3.23.7 Write-Offs Financial assets are written off either partially or in their entirety only when the Company had concluded that it had no reasonable expectations of recovering the asset and has stopped pursuing the recovery. If the amount to be written off is greater than the accumulated loss allowance, the difference is first treated as an addition to the allowance that is then applied against the gross carrying amount. Any subsequent recoveries are credited to impairment on financial instrument on statement of profit and loss. 3.23.8 Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Balance Sheet For financial assets measured at amortised cost, loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets. 3.24 Determination of Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as below: Level 1 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities101 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. 3.25 Security Deposits At initial recognition the carrying value of the refundable deposits is taken at present value of all expected future principal repayments discounted using market rates prevailing at the time of inception. For Interest expenses, the difference between present market value and deposit made is recognised as prepayment and amortised in the Statement of Profit and loss over the benefit period on systematic basis. Interest income is recognised at the prevailing market rates. 3.26 Statement of Cash Flows Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit/(loss) before extraordinary items and tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. 3.27 Foreign Currencies Functional currency of the Company and foreign operations has been determined based on the primary economic environment in which the Company and its foreign operations operate considering the currency in which funds are generated, spent and retained. Transactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency are recorded on initial recognition using the exchange rate at the transaction date. At each Balance Sheet date, foreign currency monetary items are reported at the rates prevailing at the year-end. Non- monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary items at each Balance Sheet date at the closing spot rate are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise. 3.28 Share-Based Payment Arrangements The stock options granted to employees by the holding company's (i.e. Aditya Birla Capital Limited) Stock Options Schemes, are measured at the fair value of the options at the grant date. The fair value of the options is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation cost over the vesting period on a straight line basis. The amount recognised as expense in each year is arrived at based on the number of grants expected to vest. The cost incurred by the holding company, in respect of options granted to employees of the Company, is being recovered by holding company and it is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of the Company over the period of vesting. 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Estimates and Assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. 4.1 Impairment of Financial Asset The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant 102 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. The Company's ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: The Company's internal credit grading model, which assigns PDs to the individual grades The Company's criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk and so allowances for financial assets should be measured on a LTECL basis and the qualitative assessment The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs Determination of associations between macroeconomic scenarios and, economic inputs, such as unemployment levels and collateral values, and the effect on PDs, EADs and LGDs Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings, to derive the economic inputs into the ECL models It has been the Company's policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when necessary.103 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 NOTE: 5 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (` in Lakh) ParticularsAs at 31 Mar 22As at 31 Mar 21 Balances with banks 55,695.10 37,737.34 55,695.10 37,737.34 Foot note: (31st March 2021: 34,819.50 Lakh) are earmarked for disbursement of loan in affordable segment.

The Risk Management provides stability and balance ensuring that growth is backed by a robust portfolio. ABHFL is exposed to various types of risks such as credit risk, market risk (which includes liquidity risk and pricing risk), operational risk, legal risk, regulatory risk and competition risk. ABHFL's risk management strategy is based on a clear understanding of various risks, disciplined risk assessment and measurement procedures and continuous monitoring. The policies and procedures established for this purpose are continuously benchmarked with best practices. The Board of Directors have an oversight over the risk management framework applicable to the Company. The risk management oversight structure includes various Committees such as Risk Management Committee which consist of Board members and Senior Management. The Risk Management Committee (\"RMC\") which is chaired by an Independent Director conducts review at regular intervals to monitor compliance with risk policies, risk tolerance limits, review and analysis of risk exposure and provides oversight of risk across the organisation.136 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022Market Risk The Company does not have any investments in securities other than short term investments of excess funds in liquid schemes of mutual funds and hence, there is no material market risk. On liabilities front, the Company borrows through CPs (fixed rate, short duration), Term Loans (from Banks - at rates lined to their MCLR) and NCDs (fixed rate, long term). The Company has a robust mechanism to take care of liquidity risks in form of free Bank lines (CC and TL). From time to time depending on markets, the Company also invests in liquid schemes of mutual funds which ensures availability of funds to meet its immediate liabilities. Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) meets around 6 times a year to discuss market conditions and Asset Liability Management (ALM). There is a Risk Committee meeting every quarter and also a Board meeting every quarter where the risks are discussed and ALM is presented. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is monitored through the IRS statement prepared every quarter. The Company has issued NCDs which are fixed rate instruments. The major portion of the borrowings are through term loans, which are a variable rate with annual reset, linked to the Bank's MCLR. ALCO has set a limit for the interest rate gap that is acceptable and the same is monitored by ALCO and Risk Committee. Most of the loans given by the Company are floating rate loans and hence, any change in interest rate can be passed on to the customers, thereby minimising the risk. Credit Risk Credit Risk is managed and controlled through a Credit Risk Management Framework comprising detailed risk evaluation of borrower and security. ABHFL has developed expertise to underwrite all kinds of customer segments (salaried, self-employed professionals, self-employed non-professionals) and our underwriting guidelines are benchmarked to the market and adequate internal controls have been put in place to maintain the quality of loans being approved. Distinct policies and processes are in place which are followed rigorously while selecting the borrowers and people who occupy key positions are professionally qualified (such as CA/MBA/ICWA). For each product, programs defining customer segments, underwriting standards, security structures, etc. are specified to ensure consistency of credit patterns. All the cases are approved by Credit Committees formulated at different levels with various approval limits. Collateral Risk refers to the risk of loss arising from errors in the nature, quantity, pricing, or characteristics of collateral securing a transaction with credit risk. ABHFL has dual external valuation process and the same is also evaluated internally to mitigate such risk. After sanctioning the loan, regular monitoring of the accounts is also done to sight irregularities if any and where required prompt action is initiated and a well defined collection process helps in ensuring minimum credit loss. As credit risk is one of the major risks faced by the Company, the policies and processes are reviewed periodically and, if need be, revised in order to keep them up-to-date. Analysis of maximum exposure to credit risk and collateral and other credit enhancements The following table shows the maximum exposure to credit risk, the total fair value of collateral and the net exposure to credit risk. The collateral value as at the time of on-boarding of the customer has been considered except for stage 3 (Latest Valuation) and loss cases (Nil value) for below disclosure.

Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Company might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. Company manages its liquidity requirement by analysing the maturity pattern of Company's cash flows of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Asset Liability Management of the Company is periodically reviewed by its Risk Management Committee. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the undiscounted cash flows of the Company's financial assets and liabilities as at respective balance sheet dates.

Operational and Business Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.138 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. The total foreign currency exposure as at 31st March 2022 is USD 500 Lakh (31st March 2021: $500 Lakh) of which unhedged foreign currency exposure as at 31st March 2022 is Nil (31st March 2021: Nil) Impact of COVID-19 (Global pandemic) The Company basis their assessment believes that the probability of the occurrence of their forecasted transactions is not impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has also considered the effect of changes, if any, in both counterparty credit risk and own credit risk while assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge ineffectiveness. The Company continues to believe that there is no impact on effectiveness of its hedges. NOTE: 50 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT For the purpose of the Company's capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company's capital management is to maximise the shareholder value. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. The Company maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risks inherent in the business and is meeting the capital adequacy requirements of its Regulator, NHB. The Company monitors capital using, among other measures, a capital adequacy ratio which is a ratio of weighted assets to total owned capital derived as per the NHB requirements. As per the NHB guidelines Company being a Housing Finance Company is required to maintain minimum of 15% of capital adequacy ratio (31st March 2021 - 14%). Company has complied in full with all its externally imposed capital requirements over the reported period The Company also manages its leverage position on periodic basis by monitoring debt equity ratio to aligning itself with market and peers.

Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31st March 2022 and 31st March 2021. $ Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement effective from FY 2021-2022 vide RBI/2020-21/60 DOR.NBFC 2020-2021.139 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 NOTE: 51 FAIR VALUES Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Company's financial instruments, other than those with carrying amounts that are reasonable approximations of fair values, that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements.

The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Interest accrued up to reporting period are included in both \"Carrying value\" and \"Fair value\". The Company has availed granted under para 29(a) Ind AS 107-Financial Instruments: Disclosures, with regard to disclosure of financial instruments where the carrying amount approximates the fair value and accordingly, have not provided the disclosure of financial instruments falling under this category, except in case of loans to customers and borrowings other than debt securities. Valuation Methodologies of Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value Below are the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for the above financial instruments which are not recorded and measured at fair value in the Company's financial statements. These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Short-term financial assets and liabilities For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such instruments include: cash and bank balances, Trade receivables, trade payables, other financial assets and financial liabilities. Disclosures of financial assets and financial liabilities where the carrying amount approximates fair value is not required and hence not given.140 Aditya Birla Housing Finance LimitedNotes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022Loans and advances to customers Since the mortgage lending by the Company is primarily bearing variable rate of interest, the carrying amount net of ECL is considered as the most comparable price and approximates fair value. Debt securities, security deposits and other borrowings The fair values of the Company's interest-bearing debt securities and security deposits are determined by using discounted cash flow (DCF) method using discount rate that reflects the issuer's market borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. Since entity's other borrowings are primarily bearing variable rate of interest, the carrying amount of such borrowings is considered as the most comparable price and approximates fair value.

The Company uses derivate contracts such as cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. The use of these derivative contracts reduce the risk or cost to the Company and the Company does not use those for trading or speculation purposes. The Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the Company which are approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company. The Board constituted Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Company manages risk on the Company's derivative portfolio. All derivative transactions that are entered into by the Company are reported to the board, and the mark-to-market on its portfolio is monitored regularly by the senior management. To hedge its risks on the principal and/or interest amount for foreign currency borrowings on its balance sheet, the Company has currently used cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The same is also used to hedge its LIBOR risk for foreign currency borrowings. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is positive (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities when the fair value is negative (negative marked to market value). Derivative assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value of derivatives is ascertained from the mark to market and accrual values received from the counter-party banks. Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedges are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.145 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022 ii) Quantitative Disclosure (` in Lakh) ParticularsCross Currency interest rate (i) Derivatives (Notional Principal Amount) Derivatives (ii) Marked to Market Positions [1] 35,445.00 (a) Assets (+) 1,420.03 (b) Liability (-) - (iii) Credit Exposure [2] Nil (iv) Unhedged Exposures Nil Company has entered into a cross currency interest rates swaps hence the name of the column has been amended to that extent and the existing columns (currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives) as per NHB circulars requirements have not been given as they are not applicable. 1.5 Securitisation : 1.5.1 Since the Company has not sponsored any securitisation transactions during the current as well as previous financial year, the disclosure under this clause is not applicable. 1.5.2 Details of Financial Assets sold to Securitisation/Reconstruction Company for Asset Reconstruction Since the Company has not sold any financial assets to securitisation or reconstruction company for asset reconstruction during the current as well as previous financial year, the disclosure under this clause is not applicable. 1.5.3 Details of Assignment Transactions undertaken by HFCs (portfolio acquired) (` in Lakh) ParticularsYear Ended 31 Mar 22Year Ended 31 Mar 21 i) No. of accounts - - ii) Aggregate value (net of provisions) of accounts assigned - - iii) Aggregate consideration paid - - iv) Additional consideration realised in respect of accounts transferred in earlier years - - v) Aggregate gain/loss over net book value - - 1.5.4 Details of Non-Performing Financial Assets Purchased/Sold A.
