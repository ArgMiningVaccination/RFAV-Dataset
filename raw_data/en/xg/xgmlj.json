On this page What is menopause? [Menopause](/health/conditionsandtreatments/menopause) is when you have your final period. In Australia, the average age for women to reach menopause is 51 to 52. As you approach menopause, your reproductive hormones drop, which can cause a range of physical and emotional symptoms. There are different ways to manage menopausal symptoms, depending on their severity. Menopausal symptoms Menopause is different for everyone. Some women have no symptoms at all, while others have symptoms that interfere with their daily life. Symptoms of menopause may include: - hot flushes - night sweats - aches and [pains](/conditionsandtreatments/pain) - low mood [sleep problems](/health/conditionsandtreatments/sleep) [headaches](/health/conditionsandtreatments/headache)or [migraines](/health/conditionsandtreatments/headache-migraine) - difficulty concentrating. You may also - vaginal dryness [urinary problems](/health/conditionsandtreatments/incontinence-and-continence-problems) [reduced sex drive (libido)](/health/healthyliving/libido) - painful sex. Managing menopausal symptoms There are many ways to manage menopausal symptoms. It may take time to find the right approach. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) Menopausal symptoms are caused by a drop in hormone levels, mainly oestrogen. [MHT](/health/conditionsandtreatments/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt-and-menopause) replaces these hormones. It's an effective and safe way to reduce symptoms and may also reduce the risk of developing conditions such as osteoporosis and heart disease. If you're thinking about taking MHT, talk to your [doctor](/health/serviceprofiles/general-practitioner-services). Note that MHT is not suitable for everyone, for example, if you are older than 60 or have hormone-dependent cancer. Non-hormonal medicines Some women cannot use MHT. Others don't want to use MHT and prefer to try non-hormonal prescription medicines instead. While these are usually recommended for other health conditions, they may be prescribed for hot flushes and sweating. Non-hormonal medicines include: - certain antidepressants - oxybutynin (used to treat overactive [bladder](/health/conditionsandtreatments/bladder)symptoms). Your doctor can give you more information. Menopause and natural therapies Natural therapies are part of a broad range of [complementary medicine and therapies (CMT)](/health/conditionsandtreatments/complementary-medicines-tell-your-healthcare-professionals). Sometimes herbs are used to manage symptoms of menopause. There is some research supporting the use of black cohosh and red clover extract. Other herbs commonly used for [insomnia](/health/conditionsandtreatments/sleep-insomnia), [anxiety](/conditionsandtreatments/anxiety) and [fatigue](/health/conditionsandtreatments/fatigue) include lemon balm, valerian and passionflower. While these herbs may be commonly used, more research is needed to understand how effective and safe they are for managing menopausal symptoms. Make sure you seek advice from a qualified and experienced women's health practitioner, such as an herbalist, [naturopath](/health/serviceprofiles/naturopath-service) or [Chinese medicine practitioner](/health/serviceprofiles/traditional-chinese-medicine-practitioner-service), before using complementary therapies. And always tell your doctor if you are taking complementary medicines. Other therapies that have been shown to reduce hot flushes and sweating include hypnotherapy and [cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)](/health/conditionsandtreatments/cognitive-behaviour-therapy). You can also try mindfulness and [acupuncture](/health/conditionsandtreatments/acupuncture) to help with symptoms. Healthy lifestyle It's important to look after yourself at this stage of your life, as reduced hormone levels during menopause can have long-term effects on your body. Healthy lifestyle choices can help you manage symptoms of menopause and reduce the risk of developing health conditions. You can look after your physical health, for example: - eat a [healthy diet](/health/healthyliving/healthy-eating) - achieve and maintain a [healthy weight](/healthyliving/weight-management) - do regular [physical activity](/health/healthyliving/physical-activity-its-important) - develop good sleep habits - reduce or stop drinking [alcohol](/health/servicesandsupport/assessing-your-alcohol-and-drug-use) [quit smoking](/health/healthyliving/smoking-quitting-tips)and other [drugs](/health/healthyliving/How-drugs-affect-your-body). It's also important to look after your emotional health. For example: - take time to do things you enjoy - be kind to yourself - talk to your partner, close friends or family about how you feel - practise relaxation techniques - work with a therapist. When to see your doctor See your doctor if your menopausal symptoms are affecting your quality of life. It's important to seek accurate and reliable information before you start any treatment.
