In the Jewish liturgy we speak of both Re fuat Ha-Guf (cure) and Refuat Ha-Nefesh (healing). The former is linked to the body, while the latter relates to the human being as spirit. As a person is unified, body and sp irit, the two are inextricably linked. Similarly, illness presents itself on two levels; on a physical leve l it is manifested through pain, and on spiritual level it is experienced by suffering. A cure is a clinical term, which addresses a specific diagnosis. One may receive a cure to one's diagnosis and still not be healed. In Judaism, it is a holy obligatio n to alleviate pain, an d the illness which has brought this about; medical professionals sp end most of their days in this work. However, it is also an obligation to combat suffering, refuat Ha-Nefesh Jewish healing has to do with the existent ial human quest for sheleimut, or wholeness within ones self, ones community, and ultimately one's God. While the brokenness of illness often brings all of these needs to co nsciousness, each creature yearns for this wholeness and integration every day. Teshuv a- erroneously called repentance- is really the attempt of the human beings to return to his or their original sense of equilibrium within themselves, their famili es, their environment, and God Full healing undoubtedly includes a physical cure, but heal ing is never limited to this. Jewish healing on a practical level is a projec t to raise up our personal stories into a larger integrated framework of reality. Our own perso nal narrative -even of loss- is placed on a larger canvas than ourselves. We do this through the creative use of ritual, text, liturgy to create a 'reframing' of one' s life and experiences. In th is process, a person hopefully gains new perspective on their own life. In doing so, they gain resilience to face the challenges in front of them with dignity, fortitude, and acceptance. - Rabbi Frederick L Klein "}
