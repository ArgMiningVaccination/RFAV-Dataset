When I stepped in to lead this nascent Center for Healthy Aging in August 2019 full of fresh ideas, excitement, and the goal to elevate our national prominence, I never would have anticipated that a global pandemic would prompt us to completely pivot our efforts just a mere eight months later. Our core team \u2014 including myself and my two extraordinary Associate Directors, Deana Davalos and Karyn Hamilton \u2014 set out with a plan, a strategic vision to grow this Center into a nationally recognized catalyst for interdisciplinary research on aging. Though our vision and mission have never changed, our journey certainly took an unexpected detour as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded. As you know, detours can sometimes lead to unexpected opportunities. This was certainly true for us. As the world began to grapple with lockdowns and uncertainty, the Center forged new relationships, strengthened existing ones, followed pathways we never expected, pivoted to serve our campus and community in a time of crisis, and the result has been \u2014 unexpectedly \u2014 growth . Our core team of three is now a team of seven full-time staff. Our recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies in skilled nursing facilities and institutes of higher education have been heeded by public health officials in our state capitol and all the way in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, our aging research and programming flourished and evolved through new cross-disciplinary collaborations and event offerings that have positioned the Center as a trusted resource on healthy aging both locally and nationally. The talent, innovation, and passion of our campus, faculty, community collaborators, and supporters is the fuel that has ignited our progress and success. I invite you to review this annual report to learn more about our Center and its accomplishments, goals, and future directions. Most importantly, I wish to gratefully acknowledge our faculty, institution, and community for their support, contributions, creativity, and resilience that have resulted in a thriving Center for Healthy Aging.

Included in the brand-new building \u2014 which houses a walk-in urgent care, pharmacy, radiological imaging services, occupational health services, infusion therapy, and the entirety of the CSU Health Network for general and specialty medical services \u2014 is 7,000 square feet of space dedicated to the Columbine Health Systems Center for Healthy Aging, the Kendall Reagan Nutrition Center, and the Aging Clinic of the Rockies. Suite 1400 at 151 W. Lake St. is bustling with research, education, and community engagement opportunities. The physical space at the Center for Healthy Aging includes two small conference rooms and two large multiuse classrooms and meeting spaces. Counseling rooms are used by KRNC and ACoR to provide nutrition and mental health therapy to CSU faculty, staff, and students and to Larimer County residents. For faculty who are engaged in aging research, the Center also boasts a wet lab space, procedures room, three exam/intake rooms, a phlebotomy room, and several multiuse cubicles for graduate students or visiting faculty. This integrated suite is designed for collaborative research, fostering an environment in which cross- disciplinary research can take place and innovative ideas for healthy and successful aging can more easily flourish.Since opening its doors, the Center has supported several research studies and clinical trials conducted by Center- affiliated faculty: The Adult Development and Aging Project research team uses the Center's classrooms to host the AgingPLUS clinical trial, which is designed to educate people about how to grow older in healthy ways. Each cohort of AgingPLUS attends four educational classes to explore strategies for successful aging and completes three sets of psychosocial and physical assessments over a 10-month period. AgingPLUS is supervised by principal investigator and professor, Manfred Diehl, of the Department of Human Development and Family Studies. Researchers in the MY-Skills Intervention for Chronic Pain enroll participants in an eight-week study to examine how gentle movement and education impact pairs of people - such as spouses, a parent and child, or friends - who both experience chronic pain and help each other manage their pain. Principal investigator and professor, Christine Fruhauf of the Department of Human Development and Family Studies, used the Center's classrooms to host the study until COVID-19 moved the intervention to an online setting. Assistant Professor Aga Burzynska of the Department of Human Development and Family Studies utilized space within the Center for her BrainFit study, in which participants engage in a variety of exercises to assess how physical activity relates to physical fitness, brain health, and cognitive aging.

In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when other researchers were in the throes of developing diagnostic tests for COVID-19 or assessing the virus' infectivity in the population, the Center for Healthy Aging was thinking long- term: How does COVID-19 spread in nursing facilities, and how will the virus behave in the same nursing facility several months from now? These initial research questions prompted the Longitudinal COVID-19 Screening Study in Senior Care Facilities. Researchers working on the study have now completed more than 350,000 COVID-19 tests in senior residential care communities throughout Colorado, poising the Center as a national leader in research on how COVID-19 affects older adults and rehab patients in senior nursing facilities. Asymptomatic spread The study is fueled by a $4.3 million grant from the state of Colorado, awarded after a Spring 2020 pilot study in six senior care facilities showed that the number of new COVID-19 cases within facilities can be decreased by identifying asymptomatic staff or residents who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. In December 2020, researchers received additional funding to extend the study as the pandemic continues, bringing the total of the grant to $7.5 million. The research team, led by Drs. Nicole Ehrhart, Greg Ebel, and Kristy Pabilonia, found that new infections were diminished by asking COVID-19-positive workers to self-isolate. By identifying these silent infections early, the researchers were able to minimize new infections over time, meaning that early detection of asymptomatic infections is an effective mitigation strategy in the fight against COVID-19. The Center responds to the coronavirus pandemic Genomic sequencing of the virus detected in the pilot research revealed that outbreaks were more often happening because the virus was spreading from person to person within the facility, rather than being repeatedly introduced to the facility via separate events. With the funding from the state, the pilot study was expanded to 32 facilities where testing is ongoing. Genomic sequencing in the expanded cohort is examining how the virus spreads under the state's safer-at-home social guidelines, as compared to the restrictions imposed by the March 2020 stay-at- home order. In the expanded study, researchers are administering weekly COVID-19 tests to workers and residents, as less-frequent testing has not provided adequate warning of an impending outbreak. The repeated testing of the same workers and residents is where the study gets its longitudinal component, allowing researchers to study questions such as: Why do some people recover more quickly from COVID-19 than others? Why are some people asymptomatic, whereas others become seriously ill from the virus? Tracking the virus over time also helps researchers to map the epidemiology and pathology of the virus to know exactly when a person was infected and how far into their infection they might be, which is important in deciding how to treat the virus. Nationwide impact Results from the longitudinal screening study are being continually shared with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and have been solicited by the Centers for Disease Control to be shared with investigators in Washington, D.C. Ehrhart says the team often receives requests from researchers to study their dataset, due to its longitudinal design. The study continues to inform public health authorities and guide policy to minimize viral transmission within vulnerable populations. Additionally, the testing model developed at the Center was used as the standard of testing throughout the state of Colorado, and later the national model for COVID-19 surveillance in nursing home populations. Vivage Senior Living and Columbine Health Systems have also been instrumental partners in this ongoing work by actively assisting the research team in collecting data for these studies. The testing model developed at the Center was used as the standard of testing through- out the state of Colorado, and later the national model for COVID-19 surveillance in nursing home populations.Longitudinal COVID-19 screening study tracks virus in skilled nursing facilities The research team includes, from left, Drs.

This was much lower than the Larimer County positivity rate in August 2020, which speaks to the very high rule compliance in CSU staff regarding the University's COVID-19 Health and Safety Policy. Importantly, this analysis provides a national example of the ability of a complex workforce and institute of higher education to conduct business safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in contrast to the CSU employee population, serologic (blood) analysis of asymptomatic SNF workers indicates a high level of prior exposure to COVID-19. In other words, a high percentage of workers in senior care facilities that have had a prior outbreak have antibodies to COVID-19, suggesting that workers have been exposed to the virus in the workplace. Future studies will determine levels of exposure that correlate with \"herd immunity\" in SNF and the relationship between active infection, seropositivity, and viral neutralization titers. Another takeaway from the study finds that several laboratory-based serologic assays perform with equivalent sensitivity to FDA emergency use authorization studies, placing CSU's COVID-19 screening tools on par with the more widely available and regularly used COVID-19 screens outside the University. \"CSU has been a leader in many aspects of COVID-19 research, and my colleagues, Drs. Greg Ebel, Kristy Pabilonia, and Sue VandeWoude, who have been working on these projects with me, have been essential partners in making this effort successful,\" Ehrhart said. \"With the huge amount of data we have collected, I believe we will continue to answer some of the most pressing questions surrounding vulnerable populations and how to best protect these communities.\" In partnership with the One Health Institute at Colorado State University, the Center has been co-leading the RESTARtT Study to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads in senior care communities compared to a college campus - in this case, CSU - because it's likely that \"one size does not fit all\" when it comes to infection control recommendations and mitigation strategies, says Nicole Ehrhart, director of the Center for Healthy Aging. The RESTARtT Study intends to guide return-to-work models for these two vital Colorado workforce populations with different risk profiles to COVID-19: Colorado State University employees deemed \"essential\" staff during Colorado stay-at- home and safer-at-home orders and skilled nursing facility workers. Staff at the Human Performance Clinical Research Lab are conducting sample collections for the RESTARtT Study. Credit: Sarah Ross, Health and Exercise ScienceThe Colorado Longitudinal Study The Colorado Longitudinal Study is a biobank and health data collection effort designed to follow 1 million Coloradans over 10 years. Biological specimens (blood, urine, and stool) are collected once yearly over a 10-year timeline. Once collected, COLS is matching specimens with data on social determinants of health, lifestyle factors, and health history, investigating the link between genetics, metabolism, environment, and behavior to health outcomes and aging trajectories. This unique longitudinal biobank will be used to determine associations between environment and health and identify specific interventions to support healthy aging throughout the human life span. The Center for Healthy Aging is a \"first engagement center\" for the collection of participant specimens. Director of the Center, Dr. Nicole Ehrhart, and director of the Robert H. and Mary G. Flint Animal Cancer Center, Dr. Rodney Page, are collaborators on COLS, providing expert guidance to the COLS team. The Center, in partnership with COLS, is working to create a paired human-dog biobank as an extension to this longitudinal human specimen biobank. For this cohort, humans and dogs living in the same households will have specimens collected on the same day over a five-year period. The overarching goal is to identify common biomarkers between humans and dogs that influence aging and to determine if dogs are sentinels of human aging trajectories. The long horizon goal is to develop interventions to slow cellular aging and improve healthspan in both humans and companion dogs. The Center responds to the coronavirus pandemic The Center has been awarded a $200,000 grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research for its proposal, \"A Translational and Comparative Approach to Identifying Risk for Cognitive Impairment with Advancing Age.\" This study will develop a cells-to-dogs-to-humans research pipeline, investigating the novel hypothesis that extracellular vesicles are drivers of cellular aging and biomarkers of risk for cognitive impairment with age. Specifically, the study will investigate age-related cognitive decline in dogs as a model to inform cognitive decline in humans. The transdisciplinary project is being led by professors in the departments of Psychology, Mathematics, Health and Exercise Science, and Clinical Sciences at CSU.Credit: CSU Photography Credit: CSU Photography 14 15 Columbine Health Systems Center for Healthy Aging 2019-2020 Annual Report RESEARCH 'Innovative Research in Aging' Pilot Grant Program In partnership with the Office of the Vice President for Research, the Center has funded five pilot grants for a total of $200,000 to unite investigators interested in aging research and to provide seed monies for high-risk, early-stage aging research: Tissue Engineering Strategies for Promoting Rapid Fracture Healing in Osteoporotic Bone Nicole Ehrhart, Christian Puttlitz, David Prawel, Gerrit Bouma, Jeremiah Easley; departments of Clinical Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical Sciences As the population ages, osteoporosis is emerging as a major public health problem, affecting both women and men and incurring $13.8 billion in direct medical costs per year. This unmet clinical need has garnered significant interest in the application of tissue engineering strategies to stimulate bone repair. In this project, the investigators sought to improve osteoporotic fracture healing using orthobiologic and osteoconductive technologies, which are biological and bioengineered substances that help musculoskeletal injuries heal quicker by improving the ability of cells to form new bone over time. The team designed 3D scaffolds made of mesenchymal stromal cells and studied the exosomes derived by the cells to see whether the cells secreted pro-regenerative signals that promoted fracture healing in a sheep model of osteoporosis. Results found some indication of bone-forming biologic activity across the 3D scaffolds, but no significant increase in mechanical stiffness, bone density, or bone area with the addition of stem cells or stem-cell-derived exosomes. The investigators are submitting a manuscript of their findings in early 2021 and are targeting a National Institutes of Health R01 grant submission to optimize their 3D scaffold in future studies.Enriching Experiences for Healthy Aging: Measuring Enhanced Well-Being for People With Cognitive Impairments and Their Informal Caregivers Through the Analysis of Telomere Length Meara Faw, Deana Davalos, Jennifer Cross, Laura Malinin, Susan Bailey, Wendy Wood, Agnieszka Burzynska, Lindsey Wilhelm; departments of Communication Studies, Psychology, Sociology, Design and Merchandising, Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Occupational Therapy, Human Development and Family Studies, Music In this project, researchers examined the effects of enriching experiences, such as attending symphony concerts, live theater events, and dance performances, on cognition and telomere length in adults with dementia and their caregivers. Telomeres, the caps at the ends of chromosomes, are known to shorten with age, contributing to the onset of disease and increased mortality. Preliminary data from the study suggests that adults who attended more social events showed promising changes in their telomere lengths when compared with those who attended fewer events. The team also found associations within caregiver-care recipient dyads, with their changes in telomere length mirroring one another over time. Faw says the team hopes to further unpack these findings in a larger project that examines cognitive test results and social well-being measures in conjunction with changes in telomere length among participants.Contribution of Intra-Abdominal Immune Dysfunction to Musculoskeletal Inflammaging Kelly Foster, Karyn Hamilton, Christian Puttlitz, Katie Trella Sikes; departments of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Food Science and Human Nutrition, Health and Exercise Science, Mechanical Engineering, Clinical Sciences Evidence suggests that age-associated increases in reactive oxygen species and inflammation, collectively referred to as \"inflammaging,\" are associated with the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, sarcopenia (decline in muscle mass/function), and bone/skeletal fragility. The goal of this interdisciplinary study was to determine whether the gastrointestinal tract plays a fundamental role in the progression of musculoskeletal inflammaging. To date, researchers have found that ablation of the mesenteric lymph nodes, which are considered the \"sentinels\" of the intestine, decreased the progression of OA and sarcopenia in a rodent model of inflammaging, particularly in female animals. Work continues to determine the influence of this treatment on bone and tendon. Brain and Lifestyle Mechanisms of Healthy Cognitive Aging Michael Thomas, Agnieszka Burzynska, Kaigang Li; departments of Psychology, Human Development and Family Studies, Health and Exercise Science This project studies neural biomarkers of healthy and dementia-free aging using innovative magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The researchers have implemented state-of-the-art structural imaging protocols and developed a cognitive \"mental stress test\" that can be used to better understand brain changes with age. Future directions will explore how biomarkers of brain and cognitive health are affected by lifestyle (e.g., exercise) and occupational exposures (e.g., handling pesticides). The ultimate goal of the project is to provide clinicians and researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to promote successful aging.Identifying Cognitive Stimulation in Everyday Activity via Wearable EEG Allison Bielak, Don Rojas, and Christopher Brydges; departments of Human Development and Family Studies, Psychology This study evaluated the cognitive stimulation offered by different cognitive tasks by having older adults use wearable electroencephalography. The three cognitive tasks evaluated were a reaction-time task, a word-search task, and a piano-learning task. Of the 20 cognitively healthy older adults who participated in the study, researchers found significant differences in cognitive engagement via EEG across the three tasks, where the piano task elicited the highest level of engagement. The team's study demonstrates the first objective evidence of the differences between lifestyle activities and the cognitive stimulation they provide.16 17 Columbine Health Systems Center for Healthy Aging 2019-2020 Annual Report Assistant Professor Aga Burzynska works with a participant in her BRAiN Laboratory. Credit: Joe MendozaRESEARCH Colorado State University in pursuit of 'Age-Friendly University' status The Center for Healthy Aging is spearheading CSU's efforts toward becoming an \"Age-Friendly University,\" a designation that recognizes a culture of lifelong learning and age-inclusivity across programs and practices in institutions of higher education. The AFU Global Network, created by Dublin City University and endorsed by the Gerontological Society of America and the Academy for Gerontology in Higher Education, consists of a growing list of more than 65 universities and colleges worldwide that have endorsed the 10 Age-Friendly University Principles. Age-friendly universities have committed to developing edu - cational and research opportu - nities that respond to the needs and desires of an increasingly older population. According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging, it is estimated that the number of older adults aged 65+ in the United States will double by the year 2060, from 48 million people in 2015 to 98 million people. Studies of this \"population aging\" predict a future where jobs in the aging industry are in demand; that older adults will have not one but two or more careers across their lifetimes; and globally, the status quo of education, work, urbanization, food and water security, and more will shift. \"Population aging means that more older adult learners are looking to higher education to meet Adding the designation of Age-Friendly University to CSU's list of accolades is a natural extension of programs and practices already in place locally and regionally.On the education front, the Department of Human Development and Family Studies offers bachelor's and master's degrees that introduce students to life span development from birth to adulthood, as well as an undergraduate interdisciplinary minor in gerontology that develops students' understanding of the aging process. Aging-related courses can also be found in a number of other departments and degree programs, such as Nutrition and Aging in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, or Physical Activity Throughout the Life span in the Department of Health and Exercise Science. In addition, CSU's Northern Colorado location is highly regarded for its commitment to healthy aging. Both Larimer County and the state of Colorado are enrolled in the AARP Network of Age-Friendly States and Communities, with elected officials and community leaders having pledged to make this region a healthy, accessible, inclusive place to live for both younger and older people.their professional needs as they experience longer work lives, a return to work, or opportunities in encore careers,\" said Nicole Ehrhart, director of the Columbine Health Systems Center for Healthy Aging at CSU. \"CSU's road map to achieve a designation as an Age-Friendly University will benefit all members of the academic community by expanding intergenerational learning opportunities and programs that support an age-diverse student body.\" Guided by age-friendly principles As an institution whose land- grant mission prioritizes research and innovation, inclusion and equity, service and engagement, education, and excellence, CSU has long been guided by principles that align with those of an Age-Friendly University. And, the University already has a compelling case for applying for AFU status. The Center for Healthy Aging unites 60 faculty members across four colleges who are researching critical aging issues through lenses such as psychology, engineering, health and exercise science, veterinary medicine, behavioral science, and beyond. Clinical trials and research studies are regularly spearheaded by Center-affiliated faculty, making aging a core research focus at the University alongside areas of sustainability, energy, public health, infectious diseases, and more.Gap analysis underway Adding the designation of Age-Friendly University to CSU's list of accolades is a natural extension of programs and practices already in place locally and regionally. It would also position CSU as the first Age- Friendly University in the state \u2014 another perk to the endeavor. To aid in the pursuit of AFU status, the Center for Healthy Aging partnered with the University of Massachusetts System and Lasell University in 2020 to take part in the Retirement Research Foundation for Aging grant-funded study, Taking the Pulse of Age-Friendliness in Higher Education in the U.S. Today. Using survey and inventory tools created for the study, the Center is planning to conduct a gap analysis in Spring 2021 that will identify CSU's current strengths, gaps, and opportunities for growth regarding age-friendliness and age-inclusivity in the campus community. The results of the gap analysis will be shared with University leaders to develop an action plan and working group for addressing age- friendliness on campus and will also bolster CSU as we apply for AFU status in late 2021. 18 19 Columbine Health Systems Center for Healthy Aging 2019-2020 Annual Report Events COVID-19 Expert Panel Series The Center for Healthy Aging, in partnership with CSU Extension and Senior Access Points of Larimer County, created the COVID-19 Expert Panel Series to provide clarity to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic by giving CSU faculty experts a platform to answer community questions about public health safety, vaccines, virus transmissibility, mental health strategies, travel, caregiving, and more. Panelists include faculty members in gerontology, infectious disease, biosafety, psychology, food safety, and geriatric medicine. These webinars began in May 2020 and are ongoing. An average of 31 community members attend these panels each month.ENGAGEMENT Many of the Center's programs and services launched in 2020 after the Center came under new leadership and staffing, which coincided with the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Marta Castelhano, Director, Cornell Veterinary Biobank, Cornell University Organizers and panelists of the COVID-19 Expert Panel Q&A. Healthy Aging Fitness In line with the Center's mission to provide evidence-based outreach and education about healthy aging, Healthy Aging Fitness was established in November 2020 with the goal of offering a free, all-levels exercise class to older adults in Northern Colorado. The class also provides educational opportunities for student trainers from the CSU Rec Center and practicum students from the Department of Health and Exercise Science who create the workouts, lead the classes, and develop lessons about healthspan and healthy aging that are taught alongside the workout. In November and December 2020, these workouts attracted an average of 17 participants each. \"Aging in Your 20s and 30s \" Panel Discussion Research shows that people in their second and third decades rarely engage with the topic of healthy aging, even though aging is something that affects us all. This panel discussion aimed to provide evidence-based tips for young people on how to develop healthy living practices that support longevity and long-term health. Panelists included Assistant Professors Gloria Luong and Allyson Brothers from the Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Associate Professor Michelle Foster from the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, and Teaching Faculty Member Rick Perry from the Department of Health and Exercise Science. This event was held on Oct. 16, 2020, and had 68 attendees. The Center hopes to make this the first in a broader series of \"Aging Across the Life Span\" webinars that support CSU's Age-Friendly University initiative.

The clinic is part of a network of mental health services in the Department of Psychology at Colorado State University and is physically located within the Center for Healthy Aging in the CSU Health and Medical Center. From August 2019 to December 2020, the staff at ACoR provided: 180 hours of service for 25 clients in the Senior Peer Counseling program 94 hours of sessions for 11 clients in the Caregiver Counseling program six neuropsychological assessments Each of these programs has seen a 25%-50% increase in services from August 2019 to December 2020 as compared to the same timeframe ending in 2018. In July 2020, ACoR received a $61,700 grant from National Community Care Corps to establish the Caregiver Mentorship Program, designed to support novice caregivers by pairing them with experienced caregivers who are trained as peer counselors. By December 2020, ACoR staff had recruited seven mentees for the Caregiver Mentorship Program and provided approximately 75 hours of service. Moving Through Parkinson's Led by CSU dance instructor, Lisa Morgan, these classes are designed for people living with Parkinson's disease and their caregivers who want to improve balance, combat stiffness and rigidity, and improve coordination and spatial awareness. Using dance as therapy, Morgan and students from CSU's Department of Occupational Therapy lead the group in small-motor tasks and full-body movements, all timed to music played by CSU music therapy students. Participants have come from Larimer and Weld counties and as far away as Denver, Steamboat Springs, Leadville, and Laramie to take part in Moving Through Parkinson's, which is supported by the Parkinson's Association of the Rockies and the Parkinson's Support Group of Larimer County. In 2020, MTP served four-12 participants per class through in-person and virtual programming. THRIVE Project This project, funded by CARES Act dollars from the Larimer County Office on Aging, provides student-facilitated virtual and telehealth services to address the needs of older adults who have been marginalized or isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants work with a care coordinator to select a customized \"menu\" of services that best suits their immediate needs, such as technology assistance, guided social support groups, music connection, animal- related activities, care coordination, exercise and wellness activities, caregiver respite care, and nutrition counseling. Several CSU departments and programs have collaborated with the Center to provide services for the THRIVE Project, including faculty and students from the Aging Clinic of the Rockies, music therapy, Human-Animal Bond in Colorado, social work, gerontology, health and exercise science, human development and family studies, and the Kendall Reagan Nutrition Center. The THRIVE Project launched in November 2020 and is ongoing as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. As of December 2020, THRIVE had enrolled 10 participants in Larimer County.Social Media Growth from July to December 2020 | @CSU Healthy Aging SEPTDEC NOV OCT SEPT AUG JUL 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200MONTHLY FACEBOOK REACH280 325 followers DEC NOV OCT AUG JUL 0 500 10000 15000 20000 25000MONTHLY TWEET IMPRESSIONS14 97 followers +45 +83 from July to December 2020 \"Announcing Dr. LaRocca's supplemental grant from the NIA\" MOST REACH: 556 PEOPLE \"Sharing Dr. Ehrhart's radio interview with KFFR 88.3\" MOST REACTIONS: 115 LIKES\"Announcing the creation of Healthy Aging Fitness\" 1,108 IMPRESSIONS | 16 ENGAGEMENTS \"Reporting on the results of the RESTARtT study\" 1,039 IMPRESSIONS | 21 ENGAGEMENTS Website Traffic from Jan. 1, 2020, to Jan. 1, 2021 20,189 UNIQUE PAGE VIEWS includes all pages on our website 4.30% OF VIEWS within all OVPR websites VIEWERS FROM 5 COUNTRIES includes U.S., Canada, Kenya, Singapore, AustraliaAging Basics: \"Body Temperature\" 2,000 VIEWS Aging Blogs: Long Life\" 721 VIEWS Top Webpages CSU dance instructor Lisa Morgan leads a group of older adults during a Moving Through Parkinson's session on campus in Spring 2018.
