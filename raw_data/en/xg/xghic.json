They also decided to suspend the sale of this product in September 2016, according to a press release from the FDA. Individuals with high levels of lead in the blood could potentially show no symptoms, but it can cause damage to both the nervous system and organs, the FDA said. Acute poisoning can cause abdominal pain, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, or decreased urine production. Particularly in children, exposure to lead can cause permanent nervous system damage, which could result in learning and developmental disorders as well as other health problems. Thus far, there have been no reports of adverse events associated with the \"Side Head Regulator TT\" tablets. The FDA reports that this recall is precautionary, but it is important for individuals to return or destroy this product before there is a chance for consumption by children. The product was typically sold in the Chicago area, but was also distributed through the mail. \"Side Head Regulator TT\" tablets are packaged in a white plastic bottle with the UPC 616042101010 printed on it. The FDA recommends that individuals who purchased the tablets return them to the place of purchase for a refund.

Individuals who have taken the tablets should also discuss blood testing with their healthcare provider to determine any potential lead poisonings to prevent any long-term health effects. "}
