Stacey then retired from anesthesiology in order to heal from a long bout of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She recovered her health using dietary principles, lifestyle changes, and the wisdom of functional medicine, including nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. She switched her career to dedicate herself to helping others realize their dream of full vitality and health. Dr. Cantor-Adkins then studied acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine and homeopathy and received a master's degree in Nutrition from the University of Bridgeport. She completed her education in Functional Medicine with the Institute for Functional Medicine, receiving her Certified Practitioner standing (IFMCP). Dr. Cantor-Adkins also graduated as a health coach from the Functional Medicine Coaching Academy (FMCA) and is trained as an Inner Space Techniques practitioner through the Clairvision School of Meditation. \"My passion is being a detective of sorts, to find out why people are chronically ill and not getting better, and then using diet, nutritional supplements, and lifestyle changes to move them back towards health, vitality and joy. It's the most rewarding thing for me. I love seeing the big picture, making correlations between traditional healing wisdom and the genetic, biochemical, and metabolic knowledge we have now, and personalizing patient care. I am insistent on trying to find the root cause of disease and not simply suppressing symptoms, which inevitably leads to more problems. My goal is for people to feel healthy enough to live the big life they were meant to live, a life full of passion, meaning and purpose. Probably my greatest qualification for doing this work is that I myself had severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for many years and was able to reclaim my health using food and nutritional supplementation. I literally \"cooked\" my way back to health. I know how hopeless one can feel and how difficult the quest towards healing is, and I would like to give this gift of helping others recover their health and their lives, as others have helped me.\" - B.A. in Biology from Brandeis University - Diplomate of the American Board of Integrative Medicine (ABOIM) - MD. degree from Stanford University School of Medicine - Internship in Internal Medicine at Pennsylvania Hospital - Residency program in Anesthesiology at the University of Pennsylvania - Fellowship in Cardiac Anesthesia at New York University (NYU) - Board Certified in Anesthesiology - Research Fellowship in Neuroscience at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) - Formerly held Anesthesia faculty positions (Instructor and Assistant Professor) at NYU, UCSD, and Medical College of Pennsylvania - Functional Medicine Coaching Academy (FMCA) Certified Health Coach - M.S. in Human Nutrition, University of Bridgeport - Certified to use Dr. Peter D'Adamo's Opus 23 genetic software program - Trained in Bredesen Protocol for Reversing Cognitive Decline - Institute of Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner (IFMCP) - Licensed in Connecticut and New York "}
