Creighton Jacki A. Johnson-Musgrave Terry J. Klopfenstein Richard T. Clark Don C. Adams1 Summary A three-year study (2001-2003) was conducted to determine the effectof on reproductiveperformance of (MBW) before a45-day breeding season or 50% ofMBW before a 60-day breeding season.Extending the breeding season 15 daysfor heifers developed to 50% of MBWprior to the first breeding seasonresulted in equal pregnancy, calvingand rates to heifers developedto of in development costs in the50% of MBW system more than offsetthe reduced income from lower wean-ing weights caused by later calvingdates, resulting in decreased cost toproduce one pregnant yearling heiferor 2-year old cow. Introduction Pregnancy rates in heifers are dependent upon the number exhib-iting estrus early in the breedingseason. The study of sexual matu-rity in a number of species providesevidence for the importance of dietduring development or growth andsuggests factors other than chrono-logical age can control physiologi-cal changes necessary for puberty.Numerous studies indicate post-weaning growth rate is inverselycorrelated with age at puberty;however, previous work at the Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory(2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 4-7) reported first- and second-calf con-ception rates were similar in heifersdeveloped to reach either 55% or60% of mature weight prior tobreeding as yearlings. Initial selection and manage- ment decisions are made at wean-ing under conditions of risk anduncertainty. Common practice is toselect the oldest and heaviestheifers and feed at relatively highplanes of nutrition. Although thispractice increases the likelihood ofheifers reaching puberty before orearly in the breeding season, itresults in higher feeding and devel-opment costs. Feeding lower levelsof nutrition should result in lowerdevelopment costs, but maydecrease subsequent reproductiveperformance. The objectives of thisstudy were: 1) to determine theeffects of developing heifers to apre-breeding target weight of 50%or 55% of MBW, and 2) to determineif extending the breeding season inheifers developed to a lower pre-breeding weight can offset possiblereductions in reproductive perfor-mance expected in these heifers. Procedure Biological Data Two hundred sixty-one MARC II (1/4 each of Angus, lb; n = 88, 90and 83 head in 2001, 2002 and2003, respectively) were assignedrandomly to one of two heifer 55% of weight (MBW) before breeding season (Intensive, INT;n=119) or 50% of MBW before a 60-day breeding season (Relaxed, RLX;n=142). The INT pre-breedingweight was established from previ-ous research ( 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. an ade- quate number of the more heifers were developedin the RLX system each yearbecause it was expected therewould be a higher cull rate in thatsystem due to a lower first calf con-ception rate. At the initiation of the trial each year, heifers were weighed on twoconsecutive days and stratified totreatments by first day weight andbirthdate. Treatments were initiatedJanuary 1, 2001, and December 1,2002 and 2003. Heifers were placedin hay-feeding grounds, by treat-ment, for the winter feeding periodand fed a diet consisting of meadowhay and protein supplement (INTalso received whole corn in 2002and 2003; Table 1). Heifers wereweighed monthly and feed amountsadjusted to obtain desired gains. At the end of the winter feeding period (May 15), all heifers wereweighed and body condition score(BCS) was determined. A bloodsample was collected from allheifers 10 days apart prior to startof the breeding season to determinecycling status before breeding. Toeliminate the possibility of bulleffects, all heifers were combined forbreeding. Heifers were maintainedon native Sandhills upland breeding, beginning May 20 ofeach year. INT heifers wereremoved from the breeding pasture2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 4after a 45-day exposure, while RLX heifers remained with the bulls foran additional 15 days. Sixty daysafter the end of the RLX breedingseason (approximately September10), all heifers were examined andthe number of days pregnant wasestimated. All pregnant heiferswere combined and maintained onsub-irrigated meadow regrowthduring the fall grazing period (Sep-tember-October). Non-pregnantheifers were sorted at time of palpa-tion and sold. During the second winter period, all pregnant heifers received 1.5 lb/head/day of supplement and wereallowed ad libitum access tomeadow hay. Heifer weights andBCS were recorded approximatelyFebruary 15 of each year, prior tothe start of calving. Heifers begancalving approximately March 1.Calving date and calf birth weightwere recorded within 24 hours ofparturition. After calving, heiferswere maintained on meadow hayand supplement until May 10, thenplaced on sub-irrigated meadow.Heifers remained on meadow untilJune 5 when they were placed onnative Sandhills upland range.Two-year-old cows were exposed tobulls for 60 days beginning on June5 for rebreeding. Calves from the2-year-old cows were weaned inearly September, and cows wereexamined for pregnancy (secondcalf) at that time. Calf weaningweights and cow body weights andBCS were also recorded at this time.Calf weaning rates, based on thenumber of heifers exposed to bullsduring breeding and the number ofheifers determined pregnant, andcows remaining in the herd as preg-nant 2-year olds were then calcu-lated. Data were analyzed using the mixed model procedures of SAS.Year was treated as a random vari-able and differences between treat-ments were determined using LeastSignificant Differences (LSD), witha protected F-test. All pregnancyand cyclicity data were transformedTable 1.

Esti-mated breeding date was calculatedfrom the number of days pregnantat pregnancy diagnosis to deter-mine heifers that were pregnantwithin 30 and 45 days (only RLXmeans adjusted in the 45-dayanalysis) from the initiation of thebreeding season. Data were thenre-analyzed using only heiferspregnant within 30 or 45 days ofthe initiation of the breeding seasonto determine the effects of extendingthe breeding season in the RLX sys-tem. Economic Analysis Each heifer development system was analyzed for economic feasibil-ity to determine which strategy maybe optimal for production ofreplacement heifers. For the analy-ses, 10-year average prices for feedand 5-year average prices for cattlewere used. Pasture costs were deter-mined from year 2003 values. Sup-plement costs were an average ofthe actual costs paid over the three-year period. A labor charge of $10per ton of feed delivered wascharged. Interest (10%) wascharged on the entire animal costsand half the feed costs. Cost toproduce a pregnant yearling and2-year old cow were determined using overall, 30- and 45-daymeans for each system. Results Biological Data Performance results from treat- ment initiation through second-calfpregnancy diagnosis are reportedin Table 2. There was no differencein beginning weight between thetwo systems and averaged 505 lbfor both systems. At pre-breeding,heifers in the INT system were 69 lbheavier ( P < 0.001) and had a 0.5 unit greater ( P < 0.001) BCS, due to the difference (0.46 lb/day;P < 0.001) in winter ADG. Target pre-breeding weight for both sys-tems was based on an expectedMBW of 1200 lb. Therefore, targetedpre-breeding weight was 600 and660 lb for INT of MBW the initialbreeding season. The percentage of heifers deter- mined to be pubertal before thebreeding season (as indicated byserum progesterone level greaterthan 1ng/ml on at least one of twosample dates) did not differbetween the two systems. Fifty-twopercent of INT heifers were pubertalprior to initiation of the breedingseason, while 33% of RLX heifersPage 5 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportwere determined to have com- menced estrous cycles by this samepoint. Weight at the time of preg-nancy determination was greater(P < 0.001) for INT heifers; however, the difference was less than half ofthat seen at the initiation of thebreeding season (69 vs. 35 lb differ-ence between systems at the begin-ning of breeding and at pregnancydetermination, respectively). Thisindicates that the heifers in the RLXsystem were able to partially com-pensate for weight differences cre-ated by the development system. Asimilar pattern was observed inBCS, with RLX heifers gaining morecondition throughout the summerthan INT heifers but the compensa-tion was not sufficient to overcomeexisting differences. Therefore, RLXstill maintained a lower averageBCS ( P < 0.001) than INT heifers at time of pregnancy diagnosis. Preg-nancy rate following the initialbreeding season was not differentbetween the two systems and aver-aged 88.5% for both. Weight change during the sec- ond wintering period (October-February) did not differ betweensystems, with heifers from bothgaining an average of 152 lb. There-fore, weight differences created bythe previous winter developmentprotocol still existed before calving.The body weight difference at pre-calving (29 lb) was similar to that atthe time of pregnancy determina-tion. Body condition score changeduring the second winter did differ(P = 0.002) between systems, with INT heifers losing 0.5 units whilethe RLX lost only 0.2 units of condi-tion score. This resulted in BCS at pre-calving to be similar ( P = 0.78) between systems. Average calving date did differ (P < 0.001) between systems, with INT calving approximately six daysearlier than RLX heifers. Thisresulted primarily from the 15-dayextended breeding season used inthe RLX system. Calf birth weightswere not different between systems.In conjunction, incidence of dysto-cia also did not differ between sys-tems, with 32.0% and 26.9% of RLXand of heifers that not differ between systemswhen based on the number ofheifers exposed to bulls during theinitial breeding season; however, itdid tend to differ ( P = 0.15) when based on the number of heifersdetermined to be pregnant after theinitial breeding season. Calf weaning weights were dif- ferent ( P = 0.04) between systems with INT being heavier at weaning;however, when expressed asweight per day of age, no differencebetween systems exist. Weaningrates were also not different whenexpressed either on a per heiferexposed or per pregnant heiferbasis. Cow body weights stilltended ( P = 0.11) to differ at calf weaning and second-calf preg-nancy determination, with a 23 lbdifference still evident at that time.Cow BCS, however, was similarbetween systems at weaning andpregnancy determination. Second-calf pregnancy rates were not differ-ent between systems and averaged90.5% and 92.2% for RLX and INTsystems, respectively. Additionally,the percentage of cows remainingin the herd as 3-year olds (bred2-year olds) was similar, betweensystems averaging 74.8% and72.5% for the RLX and INT systems,respectively.

By 45 days, the differ-ence is reduced to 9.3%, which is nolonger statistically significant. Dur-ing the extended 15-day breedingperiod (from 45 to 60 days) for theRLX heifers, an additional 6.7% ofheifers became pregnant. Thiscaused the overall pregnancy ratesbetween the two systems not to dif-fer, with the RLX INT systemsaveraging 87.2% and 89.8%, respec-tively. Second-calf conception ratesdid not differ at 30 or 45 days, nordid the overall means differ. Average calving date remained different in the 30- ( P < 0.001) and 45-day ( P < 0.001) analyses, although the difference in the 30-day (4 days) and 45-day (3 days)analyses are numerically less thanthe difference in the overall means(6 days). Calf birth weight meansand differences do not changeacross analyses. Weaning weightdifferences did vary across analy-ses, however. Weaning weights arenot different in the 30-day analysis(P = 0.42) but tend to differ in the 45-day analysis ( P = 0.18), while differences between the overallmeans is significant ( P = 0.04). Calving rates, when expressed on aper heifer exposed basis, tend to dif-fer (14.2% difference between sys-tems; P = 0.19) in the 30-day analysis, a result of the lower first-calf pregnancy rate between the two systems at 30 days. By 45 days, thetrend diminishes and calving rateat 45 days and overall are not dif-ferent. Calving rate, expressed on aper pregnant heifer basis, tends tobe different at 30 ( P = 0.15) and 45 days ( P = 0.17). Weaning rate does not differ between systems acrossall analyses, and is not affected bycalculation method. Lastly, percentof heifers remaining in the herd aspregnant two-year old cows doesnot differ in any of the analyses;however, the RLX system doesimprove from a 8.3% deficit in the30-day analysis to a 2.3% increaseover the INT system in the overallanalysis. Economic Analysis Results from the economic analy- sis using 30-day, 45-day, and over-all means for each system aresummarized in Table 3. Net cost toproduce one bred yearling heiferdecreased $6.00 in the RLX byextending the breeding season from30 to 45 days, with an additional $8.00 savings by extending the sea-son to 60 days. These savings arestill evident after the second breed-ing season, with a reduction in$7.00 for the first 15-day extension;however, due to differences inweaning weights between the 45-and 60-day analysis in the RLXsystem, the cost to produce one bred2-year-old remained the same whenextending the breeding season from45 to 60 days. Similar trendsoccurred in the INT system, with a$7.00 per bred yearling heifer andan $11.00 per bred 2-year-old by extending 45 days. 1Kelly Creighton, former graduate student; Jacki Johnson-Musgrave,research technician, West Central Researchand Extension Center, North Platte; TerryKlopfenstein, professor, Animal Science,Lincoln; Richard Clark, professor,Agricultural Economics, Lincoln; professor, Animal Science, WestCentral Research and Extension Center,North Platte.Table 3.

Aaron Stalker Don C. Adams Terry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary A two year experiment evaluated the influence of supplemental proteinduring the last trimester of gestationand grazing sub-irrigated meadowduring the postpartum interval onpregnancy rates and calf growth in aMarch calving production system.Supplemental protein during the lasttrimester did not improve subsequentpregnancy rate but resulted inincreased carcass weight. Allowingcows to graze sub-irrigated meadowduring the postpartum intervalimproved pregnancy rates but did notchange steer performance in the feedlot.Feeding supplemental protein duringthe last trimester of gestation andallowing cows to graze sub-irrigatedmeadow were both economical methodsof improving production. Introduction One goal of cow/calf production systems is to optimize economicefficiency. A commonly recom-mended method of improving eco-nomic efficiency is to reduce cost ofproduction. Integrated resourcemanagement data shows that themost profitable cow/calf producersare those with the lowest variablecosts; however, incurring variablecosts is justified if the increasedcost yields returns of greater value. Two key times in extended graz- ing cow/calf production systemsare the last trimester of gestationand the postpartum interval. Dur-ing the last trimester of gestation,nutrient requirements increase dueto fetal growth and forage qualitymay not adequately meet require-ments in spring calving systems.Additionally, postpartum concep-tion is influenced by nutritional sta-tus at the start of the breedingseason. Producers may choose tointervene by supplementing the dietwith protein (the most limitingnutrient in dormant range) or allo-cating high quality forage resourcesto the cow/calf enterprise. Our objectives were to determine if the additional costs of supple-mental protein during the winterand high quality forage during thepostpartum interval were justifiedby increased pregnancy rates andcalf growth performance thoughout its life. Procedure This study was conducted at the Gudmundsen Sandhills Labora-tory, near Whitman, Nebraska overtwo years. One-hundred-thirteencows per year were divided intoeight native upland pastures (80 + 15 acre) during the winter in equalstocking rates. Half the cows werefed the equivalent of 1 lb/head/dayof supplemental protein (32% CP)three times per week from December1 through February 28. Cows were managed in a com- mon group during the calving sea-son (March 1 to April 30) and fed28 lb cool season grass hay. Aver-age calving date was March 23.During the interval between calvingand start of breeding (May 1 to May31), half the cows were fed cool sea-son grass hay and half grazed sub-irrigated meadow. At the start ofbreeding (June 1), treatment groupswere combined and cows weremanaged as a single group for theremainder of the production cycle. Calves were weaned the first week of October and two weekslater all steers were shipped 104miles to a feedlot. Steers were fed ineight pens that corresponded to thewinter pasture until the average12 th rib back fat of all steers was 0.5 inches. Data were analyzed as a 2X2 factorial. No winter by spring treat-ment interactions were observed,therefore only main effects arereported. Partial budgets were employed to examine the economic efficiencyof both production practices andincluded only costs that differedbetween treatments. For both pro-duction practices, two budgets werecreated. One used value at weaningand one used carcass value so thatdifferences in returns between treat-ments could be assessed at bothendpoints. Ten year average priceswere used to value calves, hay2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 8(Crop and Livestock Prices for Nebraska Producers, 2003 ) and graz- ing fee ( Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market Developments, 2002-2003 ). Actual delivered price was used tovalue supplemental protein. Results Effects of supplemental protein during the last trimester of gesta-tion and plane of nutrition duringthe postpartum interval on cowbody condition score throughoutthe year are presented in Figures 1and 2, respectively. Feeding supple-mental protein during the last tri-mester of gestation increased bodycondition pre-calving ( P = 0.02) and pre-breeding ( P = 0.005) but did not change pregnancy rates ( P = 0.87; Table 1). Cows grazing sub-irrigated meadow during the post-partum interval had greater bodycondition pre-breeding ( P < 0.01) which resulted in a tendency forincreased pregnancy rates ( P = 0.13; Table 1). Calves born to cows fed sup- plemental protein during the lasttrimester of gestation were heavierat weaning ( P = 0.08), and had heavier carcass weights ( P = 0.07; Table 1). No differences wereobserved in ADG ( P = 0.41), DMI (P = 0.24), efficiency of gain (P = 0.20) or carcass quality (data not shown). It is possible that theincreased weaning and carcassweights resulted from permanentlychanging the endocrine system of Table 1.

The fetus is sensitive to the nutritional statusof the mother and adjusts its devel-opment accordingly. Furtherresearch is addressing this issue.Weaning weight was increased(P = 0.08) but carcass weight was not different ( P = 0.72) in calves that nursed cows grazing sub-irrigatedmeadow compared to calves nurs-ing cows fed hay during the sametime period. No differences wereobserved in ADG ( P = 0.74), DMI (P = 0.87), efficiency of gain(P = 0.63) or carcass merit (data not shown). Partial budget analysis showed that incurring both additional costsof feeding supplemental proteinand grazing sub-irrigated meadowwas profitable, regardless of end-point. In the case of supplementalprotein, returns were $4.66/headand $22.83/head greater at wean-ing and carcass endpoints, respec-tively. A dramatic increase in profitwhen calves were taken throughthe feedlot is a result of greatly in-creased carcass weight in steersborn to cows fed supplement. Theprofit difference between endpointsshows that the majority of return onthe investment in supplementalprotein occurs in the feedlot.

Heat stress also can delaypuberty in heifers, cause anestrousin cows, depress estrus activity,induce abortions, and increase peri-natal mortality. However, manystudies evaluating environmentaleffects on conception rate are con-ducted using dairy cattle as theexperimental unit. The reproductiveresponse of dairy cows to heatstress may differ from that of beefcows due to differences in feedintake and genetics (Sprott et al.,2001 Prof. Anim. Scientist). Many Nebraska cow herds are bred to calve in the spring. Conse-quently, breeding occurs in latespring through mid-summer whentemperatures, combined with rela-tive humidity, may reach levels thatpotentially affect reproductive per-formance. The objective of thisstudy was to determine the effect ofambient temperature and humidityon reproductive performance of beefcows in a pasture setting. Procedure Ten years of calving records (1991-2000) from a spring-calvingbeef cow herd at the University ofNebraska Dalbey-Hallack ResearchFarm in Virginia, Nebraska wereused to study the effects of tempera-ture and humidity on reproductiveperformance. This research unit islocated in southeast Nebraska. Theherd consisted of about 150 com-mercial crossbred (1/2 Angus, 1/2Continental) cows. All cows weremanaged similarly during theexperimental period. Cows werebred using natural service while grazing mixed warm- and cool-season grasses. Length of the breed-ing season averaged 63 days for theten years, beginning in late Mayand continuing through July. Thebull to female ratio was maintainedat 1:25. Breeding date was estimated by subtracting 283 days from therecorded calving date. Pregnancyrate was determined by the numberof cows bred during the breedingseason divided by the total cowsavailable to be bred. Pregnancyrates were totaled for the first 30days, 60 days, and the entire breed-ing season and then regressed withaverage temperature and Tempera-ture-Humidity Index (THI) for thecorresponding time periods. Weather data were compiled using the Great Plains WeatherArchives for a station about 15miles from the Dalbey-HallackFarm. The weather history wasdownloaded in a daily format andincluded minimum and maximumtemperature as well as average rela-tive humidity. The average tempera-ture and average relative humiditywere used to calculate the THI foreach day, using the following equa-tion: THI = Temperature - (.55 - (.55x (RH/100))) x (Temperature - 58).Average temperature and THIvalues were calculated for the first30 days, 60 days, and entire breed-ing season and then correlated withpregnancy rate for each period. The data were divided into four sets to evaluate temperature andTHI effects on reproductive perfor-mance. The first data set consistedof all years and the general effectsJamee L. Amundson Terry L.

Steven Hu 1 Summary Ten years of records from a 150- head beef cow herd were used to deter-mine the relationship of temperatureand temperature-humidity index (THI)on pregnancy rate in beef cows. Preg-nancy rate of the herd for the durationof the experiment averaged 92%.There was a linear relationshipbetween average 30-day temperatureand pregnancy rate during the first 30days of the breeding season. AverageTHI greater than 65 for the first 30days of the breeding season tended todecrease pregnancy rate in the first 30days, but there was no effect on herdpregnancy rate. If the 60-day averageTHI was greater than 70, pregnancyrate for 60 days tended to decrease.Breeding season THI had no effect onpregnancy rate. High temperaturesand high temperature-humidity indexdecrease the pregnancy rate during thefirst 30 days of the breeding season.Cows acclimate to environmental con-ditions and if the length of the breed-ing season is 60 days or more,pregnancy rate is not compromised. Introduction During the breeding season, con- ception, as well as embryo and fetalsurvival, are of concern in manycattle operations. Elevated ambienttemperatures during the breedingseason can decrease male andfemale fertility, reduce the durationPage 11 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportof temperature and THI on preg- nancy rate for the first 30 days, 60days, and entire breeding seasonwere examined. The second data setexamined effects in the first 30 daysof the breeding season when the av-erage THI for the 30 days wasabove a threshold of 65 and usedsix of the ten years of data. Thethird data set examined effects of a60-day THI that averaged greaterthan 70 and used four of the tenyears of data. The fourth data setevaluated effects of THI greaterthan 70 on pregnancy rate for theentire breeding season and usedfive of the ten years of data. Results Table 1 reports the average tem- perature, relative humidity, andTHI for 30 days, 60 days, and theentire breeding season. The tem-perature and THI values increasedas the breeding season progressedfrom May through July. This is a typical spring/summer climatetrend for southeast Nebraska. Table 2 shows the effect of tem- perature on pregnancy rate usingall 10 years in the data set. Average30-day temperature was correlated(R 2 = 0.382, P = 0.057) to pregnancy rate during the first 30 days of thebreeding season and pregnancyrate decreased by 1.08% for everydegree increase in temperature.Average temperature did not sig-nificantly affect pregnancy rate dur-ing the 60-day period or the entirebreeding season. Table 3 illustrates the effect of THI on pregnancy rate, using all 10years in the data set. Pregnancy ratefor the first 30 days was affected (R 2 = 0.437, P =0.037) by 30-day THI. The 30-day THI decreased preg-nancy rate by 1.38% per unit in-crease in THI. The 60-day and theentire breeding season THI modelexplained less than 20% of thevariation in pregnancy rate. Even though the subsequent estrusoccurred when THI values weregreater than the previous values,the cows apparently acclimatedand were able to become pregnant. The effects of a 30-day preg- nancy rate for those years in whichthe average 30-day THI exceeded 65are illustrated in Table 4. Duringthe four years in which the 30-dayTHI was less than 65, pregnancyrate was not affected by THI; how-ever, during the six years in whichthe 30-day THI average was greaterthan 65, pregnancy rate tended tobe reduced ( P =0.078). Cows appeared to be susceptible to heatstress during the first 30 days of thebreeding season, when the THIaverage was greater than 65 for thatperiod and resulted in a 1.60%decrease in pregnancy rate per unitincrease in THI (R 2 = 0.581). How- ever, when the first 30 days of thebreeding season had a THI greaterthan 65, beef cows appeared toacclimatize to the environmentalconditions and became pregnant insubsequent breeding opportunitiesthat occur later in the breedingseason. This became evident whenthe 60-day and entire breeding sea-son THI model only explained 15%(60-day) and less than 1% (breedingseason) of the variation in preg-nancy rate. These results suggest cows have the ability to physiologically adjustto the environmental changesthroughout the breeding season. Ifthe environmental changes areextreme and rapid, the cows maynot be able to adapt to theconditions and reproductive perfor-mance is impaired. Producers con-sidering shortening the breedingseason in late spring to early sum-mer may compromise pregnancyrates during hot, humid years.Allowing cows more estrous cyclesand a chance to acclimate togradual changes in weather condi-tions will not likely compromisereproductive performance.

A breedingseason THI greater than 70 had noeffect ( P = 0.230) on overall preg- nancy rate. The breeding seasonwas about 3 days longer than the60-day period; therefore, the breed-ing season results resemble that ofthe 60-day data. These data suggestthat even if the THI is high duringthe breeding season and the breed-ing season is at least 63 days inlength, cows will acclimate andpregnancy rates will not bereduced. It is important to note that no other treatments were induced onthe cows included in this study,and all cows were managed in asimilar manner throughout 10years, so the correlations betweenpregnancy rate and weatherparameters were not confounded byother treatments. Implications Date of breeding season Producers may consider moving the breeding season earlier in thespring so the middle of the breedingseason does not occur during themonths that are hot and/or humid,such as July and August. By initiat-ing an earlier breeding season, pro-ducers may avoid the negativeeffects of high THI conditions dur-ing the early part of the breedingseason on reproductive perfor-mance. However, when moving thebreeding season, producers must consider the additional costs ofincreased feed requirements whenstarting the breeding season beforespring pastures are available. Length of breeding season The cows in this study had a reduced pregnancy rate for the first30 days of the breeding seasonwhen the weather was hot andhumid, but pregnancy rates for 60days or greater were not affected byTHI. These results indicate beefcows can acclimate to high tem-peratures and humidity if givenenough time with the bull. In an effort to reduce the length of thecalving season, some producerswill shorten the breeding season to45 days. These data suggest a 45-day breeding season may be tooshort and will reduce pregnancyrates, especially where the breedingseason overlaps with hot, humidweather conditions. 1Jamee Amundson, graduate student; Terry Mader, professor, Ag Lab, Concord, NortheastResearch and Extension Center; RickRasby, professor, Animal Science, Lincoln;Steve Hu, associate professor, NaturalResources, Lincoln.Page 13 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef ReportEffects of Dried Distillers Grains Supplementation Frequency on Heifer Growth L. Aaron Stalker Terry J. Klopfenstein Don C. Adams1 Summary Dried distillers grains were fed as an energy source to growing heifers asa supplement to grass hay. Heiferswere fed the equivalent of 3 lb/headdaily, either three or six times per weekof the same supplement. Heifers feddried distillers grains six times perweek gained more weight than heifersfed three times per week but those fedthree times per week had greaterallantoin to creatinine ratios. Betteranimal performance may result frommore frequent supplementation ofdried distillers grains. Introduction As the corn milling industries continue to expand, an increasedavailability of distillers grains isexpected. Dried distillers grains(DDG) are appropriate for foragebased production systems whenforage quality is poor (winter) orquantity is limiting (drought). Drieddistillers grains are considered aprotein supplement when fed atless than about 15% of the diet DMand as an energy source when fedat levels greater than 15% of thediet. Energy supplied by DDG is inthe form of digestible fiber and fat(1996 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 65-66) making its energy valuesuperior to corn in forage baseddiets ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 8-10). Dried distillers grains con-tain approximately 65% unde-graded intake protein (% of CP),consequently forage based dietsthat include dried distillers grainsfed as an energy source are com-monly deficient in degradable intake protein (DIP) but containexcess metabolizable protein (MP).However, recent studies indicateadding urea to meet the degradableintake protein requirement is notnecessary when dried distillersgrains are fed as an energy sourcein forage based diets ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 20-21). The objective of this experiment was to determinethe influence of supplementationfrequency of dried distillers grainsfed as an energy source withoutadded urea on weight gain inheifers. Procedure Forty-eight crossbred heifers (425 + 44 lb) were stratified by weight then assigned randomly toone of eight pens. Pens were thenassigned randomly to one of twosupplement treatments. Heiferswere fed for ad libitum consump-tion (53% 6.6%CP) thedaily equivalent of 3 lb (DM) DDG/head either three or six times perweek. Supplement composition islisted in Table 1. Heifers were fedDDG Monday through Saturday oron Monday, Wednesday and Fri-day. Heifers were weighed on twoconsecutive days at the beginningand end of the 84-day trial withoutlimiting intake prior to weighing.Beginning on day 55 of the experi-ment, approximately 50 mL of urinewas spot collected from each heiferfor three consecutive mornings.Urine samples were composited byanimal and analyzed for allantoinand creatinine byhigh performance liquid chroma-tography. The ratio of is indicative of theamount of microbial 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 20-21). Feedstuffs used in the trial were analyzed for DM, OM, CP andIVDMD (Table 2). Data were analyzed using pen as the experimental unit. Results Heifers fed distillers grains six times per week gained more weightthan heifers fed three times perweek (Table 3). One explanation forreduced gain in less frequentlysupplemented heifers is ruminal fatconcentration. Distillers grains areapproximately 10% fat and feedingthree times per week at the levelsused in this experiment wouldresult in dietary fat concentration of5.4% on the day of supplementa-tion. High levels of fat in the dietdepress fiber digestion via negativeeffects on ruminal microorganisms.Theoretically allantoin to creatinineratios are indicative of microbialgrowth in the rumen and if fat con-tent of the diet is the reason for de-creased gains in the infrequentlysupplemented treatment a de-creased allantoin to in the infrequently supple-mented group. This apparentinconsistency may be a result of theshort (three day) urine collectionperiod in relation to the supplemen-tation schedule. Supplement wasfed on Monday and Wednesdayand urine was collected Tuesdaythrough Thursday. Increased con-centrations in the infrequentlysupplemented treatments would beexpected if allantoin and creatinineconcentrations in the urine werereflective of the previous day 's diet. (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 14It is also possible that additional refinements to the technique ofusing allantoin to creatinine ratiosneed to be made before it can beused as an effective research tool.Other explanations for decreasedgains in the infrequently supple-mented treatment includedecreased forage intake and ineffi-cient nitrogen recycling. Decreasedforage intake has been observedwhen high levels of distillers grainsare fed in high forage diets ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 8-10). Also, efficiency of nitrogen recycling isinversely related to nitrogen intake.It is possible that inefficiency ofnitrogen recycling in infrequentlysupplemented heifers created adegradable protein deficiency. In conclusion, heifer gain was greater when dried distillers grainswere fed six times compared tothree times per week. 1Aaron Stalker, graduate student; Terry Klopfenstein, AnimalScience, Lincoln; Don professor,Animal Science, West Central Researchand Extension Center, North Platte.Table 1.

There-fore, the objectives of this study are1) to determine the effects of supple-mental fat (soybeans) on reproduc-tive characteristics in developingheifers, and 2) to determine theeffect of reproductive status (pre-pubertal vs. postpubertal) onresponse to fat supplementation.

In Experiment1, heifers received whole soybeans orcontrol diet with wet corn gluten feedfor 110 days. Heifers receiving soy-beans had decreased synchronizationrate and delayed estrous response.

Introduction Fat supplementation has been shown to have positive reproduc-tive effects independent from theenergy contribution. In previousresearch conducted with pregnantand postpartum beef females, fatsupplementation improved firstservice conception rates when fedprepartum, decreased the durationof the anestrous period, andincreased circulating levels ofreproductive hormones.

Both supplements were 31%CP and were approximately isoca-loric. On day 84, heifers in bothgroups were put on native Sand-hills pasture and supplementationcontinued for 78 days.

Follicular aspi-rations were performed by the sameprocedure as in Experiment 2. Results Experiment 1 Heifers weighed 825 lb at the time of PGF 2 injection and ADG did not differ between groupsthroughout the experimental period(1.25 lb/day). Treatment did notaffect cycling status at any timepoint measured. At the initiation ofthe feeding period, 82% of theheifers were cycling. Ninety-eightpercent had reached puberty by day55-62 of treatment, and all heifershad cycled at least once by the endof the experimental period. More(P < 0.05) heifers on the control diet (96%) exhibited estrus during thefour-day breeding period comparedto soybeansand exhibiting estrus during thesynchronization period, there wasa delay in the average time of estruscompared to the control group (3.2days vs. 2.9 days for SB and control,respectively; P = 0.05). Diet did not affect the percentage of synchro-nized heifers becoming pregnant toAI (AI conception rate), the per-centage of heifers in each groupbecoming pregnant to AI (AI preg- nancy rate), or the percentage ofheifers in each group becomingpregnant to AI or natural service(final pregnancy rate; P > 0.10; Figure 1). The reason for the reduced syn- chronization rate and delay inestrus is not known; however, uponanalysis of soybeans by of these phytoestrogens mayhave altered reproductive responsein heifers fed soybeans. Experiment 2 Thirty-eight percent of the heifers were cycling at the beginning of thefeeding period and 90% hadbecome pubertal by day 80-87 oftreatment. Diet did not puber-tal status at this time. Heifersreceiving DDG supplement wereheavier than SB supplementedheifers at feedingperiod (775 lb vs. 738 lb, respec-tively; P < 0.05) had SB, respectively;P < 0.01). Final pregnancy rates were not affected by treatment (80%and 88% for DDG and SB, respec-tively).Follicle Diameter, Experiments 2 and 3 There was no treatment \u00d7 experi- ment interaction for folliculardiameter; therefore, data fromExperiments 2 3 were 11.52 mm, respectively;P = 0.01). It is not known whether the increase in follicular diameter isa response to greater levels of fat inthe soybean supplement or due tophytoestrogens in the soybeans.The ovulation of larger follicles mayresult in formation of larger corporalutea and greater progesterone pro-duction, which has been associatedwith higher conception rates. In conclusion, soybeans may be a viable protein and energy sourcein heifer development diets,depending on availability andprice. There also may be direct posi-tive effects on reproduction due toovulation of a follicle with greaterdiameter. 1Heidi Harris, unit; Funston, assistantprofessor, West Central Research andExtension Center, North Platte.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 18The Effects of Dried Distillers Grains on Heifers Consuming Low or High Quality Forage zation is due to competitionbetween amolytic microbes andcellulolytic microbes. The produc-tion of ethanol, through fermenta-tion of the starch in grain, results ina by-product known as distillersgrains. This by-product is a viablealternative to cereal grains becausethe starch has been removed, elimi-nating the starch and forage digest-ibility issues. Dried distillers grains(DDG) and/or DDG plus solubles(DDGS) are a feasible supplementfor cattle producers not near etha-nol plants because the dried by-product is easily transported andcan be stored for an extended time.With increasing supplies of DDGSand increasing cost of forage ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report , p. 25) we hypothesize that DDGS can substi-tute for forage. The objectives of thistrial were to determine effects ofincreasing levels of DDGS on forageintake, predict forage intakes ofgrazing supplementedwith DDGS, and evaluate the eco-nomical worth of supplementingDDGS. Procedure Experimental design, animal performance and forage intake Ninety head of heifer calves (631 lb) were stratified by weight andthen assigned randomly to one often treatments in a 2 \u00d7 5 factorial design. The diets consisted of eithersmooth brome grass hay (BROME),a low quality forage source (53%TDN), or alfalfa hay and sorghumsilage mix (ALSS The BROMEwas used to simulate winter rangeor hay feeding. The ALSS was usedto simulate grazed summer forage.These two forage sources simulatedthe differences in nutritive valuesbetween growing and dormantrange. Diets were supplementedwith one of five levels of DDGS: 0,1.5, 3, 4.5, or 6 lb DM DDGS. Heiferswere individually fed forage inCalan electronic gates ad libitumwith their respective amounts ofDDGS.

Vander Pol 1 Summary Two forage sources, high and low quality, were used to evaluate effects offive levels of dried distillers grains onforage intake. Ninety heifer calveswere fed high or low quality forage,supplemented with 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, or 6lb DM dried distillers grains. Forageintakes linearly decreased as dried dis-tillers grains increased. Average dailygain increased linearly with increaseddried distillers grains indicating thatdried distillers grains can be a proteinand energy supplement source and asubstitute for forage. Dried distillersgrains are an economical supplementto cattle on either high or low qualityforage diets. Introduction Traditionally, cereal grains have been used to supplement cattle onforage based diets; however, dueto the amount of starch in thesegrains, a negative associative effecthas been seen between starch andforage digestibility, leading to over-all depressed forage utilization.This depressed level of forage utili-Page 19 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportincreased (Figure 1). The rate of increase in gain was greater for theBROME diet (0.265 lb per lb DDGS)than were heifers on ALSS diets 12.6 lb/day DM in contrast to controls onBROME diets consuming 9.5 lb/day DM. Forage intake linearlydecreased as level of DDGSincreased (Figure 2). The rate ofdecline was greater for the calvesfed ALSS than those fed v 0.33 lb forage per lb ofDDGS). Both ADG and forage intake were significantly different(P < 0.001) for the two types of for- age. The two qualities of foragewere selected to simulate range-likeconditions, so that intakes could beprojected for cattle grazing range atdifferent times of the year, for thespring/summer with the high qual-ity forage and fall/winter with thelow quality forage. The higher ADGand forage intake, seen with thecontrols on the ALSS, are similar towhat would be observed onspring/summer range. Cattle canconsume more of the higher qualityforage and digest it more rapidly,resulting in increased animal per-formance. In contrast to the ALSSgroup, ADG and forage intake werelower ( P < 0.001) for animals on the control for BROME. Decreased for-age intake resulting in decreasedanimal performance is typical ofanimals grazing dormant or winterrange. Cattle on winter range mayperform poorly because they cannotconsume enough of the highly lig-nified forage to meet their require-ments.

The additional gainwas valued by determining theincome from selling the additionalweight at the end of the grazingperiod.

These values depend on thevalues placed on the forage. Grazedforages would be somewhat lessexpensive and would lower thevalue of the DDGS; however, most of the value was from increasedcattle gains.

Brandle Jeremy T. HillerCasey B. Wilson Terry J. Klopfenstein 1 Summary Integrated timber and livestock sys- tems (silvopastoral) are common inseveral regions of the United States.Grazing of three timber stands in east-ern Nebraska showed no signs of treedamage due to rubbing or soil compac-tion. Steer gains were lower under thesilvopastoral system compared to atypical pasture system (1.05 lb/dayversus 1.70 lb/day). Growth of timberin silvopastoral stands was reduced(35.0 cubic feet per year versus 37.8cubic feet per year); however, total pro-ductivity of the silvopastoral system(timber plus livestock) was greater($20.98/acre) than with traditionaltimber systems. Introduction Silvopastoral systems are de- fined as the intentional integrationof timber and livestock production.They are common in the pine for-ests of the southeastern UnitedStates, the conifer forests of thePacific northwestern United Statesand are used in a number of situa-tions in the Pine Ridge area ofnorthwestern Nebraska. Severalbenefits are associated with thepractice, foremost of which is thecash flow advantage of annual saleof cattle while the timber cropdevelops. In addition, there aredirect benefits to tree growth due tothe reduction in competition between the trees and understoryvegetation for soil nutrients, water,and sunlight. Grazing is also acost-effective method of control ofthe understory vegetation withoutthe use of herbicides. From the for-age perspective, shade and lowerair temperatures tend to produce ahigher quality forage. Cattle havethe advantage of shade, reducinganimal stress due to high tempera-tures. There are, however, severalpotential disadvantages of silvo-pastoral systems. Foremost is theconcern of soil compaction and rootdamage due to grazing when thesoils are wet. Cattle can damagetrees by rubbing them, reducing thepotential timber value, especiallyon fine hardwoods such as blackwalnut. If a forest system is over-grazed, forest reproduction may bedamaged leading to a loss in forestdiversity over the long term. How-ever, with good management, cattleand timber production can be aprofitable enterprise providing bothshort-term cash flow from livestockproduction and long-term capitalgains from timber sales. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the interaction of cattleand trees in silvopastoral systemslocated in eastern Nebraska. Estab-lished initially as a demonstrationsite, our goal was to assess damageto two tree plantations \u2014 a scotchpine stand ( Pinus sylvestris L. ) stand ( Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh .) \u2014 by grazing livestock. As the study progressed,little damage was seen in eitherplantation. In 1999 the decisionwas made to conduct a preliminary study on a ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson ) stand to determine the effect of grazing ontree performance. The study objec-tives were redefined and data ontree growth and cattle performancewere obtained and analyzed todetermine the impact of grazing ontree and livestock performance.Only tree performance data fromthe ponderosa pine plantation arereported here. Cattle performancewas based on the entire silvo-pastoral grazing period. Procedure Site Description The study was conducted at the University of Nebraska Agricul-tural Research and DevelopmentCenter (ARDC) Forestry Unit atMead, Nebraska. The soil is aSharpsburg silty clay loam with a1% to 2% slope. The site is approxi-mately nine acres and was plantedto ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson ) in 1986 as part of a regional provenance test. The trees(one-year-old container grownseedlings) were planted in six repli-cations on a 12-by-12-foot spacingin plots of 400 plants per replica-tion (approximately 1.5 acres perreplication). The site was sown totall fescue in 1988. Since then,smooth brome grass has invadedthe site and dominates most areaswithin the plantation. Replications1 to 4 were thinned in the winter of1997-98 following 10-year data2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 22collection for tree performance. Limited labor at the time restrictedthe ability to thin the remaining tworeplications, which were thinned inJanuary 2001. The trees removedwere selected based on tree perfor-mance and insect and disease resis-tance. The resulting stand is asavannah dominated by ponderosapine and a mix of cool seasongrasses. Beginning in late April2001, plots 1 to 4 were grazed by 6head of steers for 52, 32, and 42days in 2001, 2002, and 2003respectively (Table 1). Cattle con-tinued to be grazed on othersilvopastoral sites, when not onponderosa pine, from late Apriluntil early September of each year.Plots 5 and 6 were left ungrazed asa control. Data Collection Height and diameter at breast height (DBH; 4.5 feet above theground) of the trees in all plots weremeasured following grazing in2001, 2002 and 2003. If multiplestems occurred below 4.5 ft, thediameters of all stems were mea-sured. Silvopastoral grazing (SPG) steers were managed in the samesystem as control cattle in everyyear of this study. The only differ-ences would be access to the SPGlocation during corn residue graz-ing and summer grazing. Controlsteers were a contemporary grouputilized for grazing systemsresearch in 2001 ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 65-68), 2002 and 2003 (2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 68- 72). Control steers grazed smoothbrome grass from late April untilmid May and warm season nativerange from mid May until Septem-ber. Briefly, steers on the SPG studywere received in November,weaned and placed on corn residueand allowed access to the SPG loca-tion from December until late Febru-ary each year. Following cornresidue grazing steers were placedin a drylot until SPG grazing wasavailable. Following grazing, steersTable 1.

The stem volume gainswere compared within years andamong treatments using 2001 treemeasurements for each treatment asthe starting value for comparisons.Additional revenue generated withthe SPG steers was determined byevaluating the difference in eco-nomic value compared to the con-trol cattle each year, usingbreakeven calculations as describedin the 2001 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 29-34. Briefly, SPG final slaughterweights were multiplied by controlcattle This resulted in asteer value for SPG steers. Follow-ing this calculation, all costs associ-ated with the SPG system exceptthose associated with grazing weresubtracted from steer value. Theamount remaining after costs wasthen divided by total SPG days.This allocated a dollar value to theSPG area on a per steer basis. Results The analysis of tree response showed only small differences instem volume increase betweengrazed and ungrazed plots (Table2). While it is difficult to generalizethese data to the long-term case, asTable 4.

Pine (Ponderosa Pine) value is the grazing value divided by total day on the ponderosa pine area. most tree growth response studies typically run for a minimum of 10years and usually 20 to 50 years,some observations are appropriate. The initial differences (2001) in tree dimensions between grazedand ungrazed plots is likely notrelated to grazing. The differencesin tree growth (DBH, heightand basal area) between grazedand ungrazed plots (Table 3) maybe due to differences in thinningdates of ponderosa pine and mayreflect a delayed response todrought conditions during thestudy period. However, the changesin stem volume in 2002 and 2003are a valid evaluation of the impacton tree growth of cattle grazing insilvopastoral systems. The changesin stem volume per acre per yearwould suggest that grazing cattle inponderosa pine has limited impacton total tree growth. While there appears to be little difference in tree growth among thegrazed and ungrazed plots, theeffects upon the cattle were greater.Daily gains were lower during thesummer grazing period when com-pared to control steers. The lowerdaily gains with the SPG systemmay be partially due to SPG pasturebeing dominantly cool seasongrasses. Cool season grass quality would decline during the warmsummer months. The increasedcompetition by the trees and grassfor moisture during the summermonths also may depress foragequantity and (or) quality. Controlsteers grazed warm season nativerange from late May until Septem-ber. The improved forage qualityduring warm summer months withwarm season grass may be respon-sible for the improved gain by con-trol steers; however, the SPG steergains were higher during the win-ter and feedlot periods when com-pared to control steers (Table 4).The SPG area may provide addedprotection that may benefit steerperformance during the corn resi-due grazing portion of winter.Additionally, feedlot daily gainshave been consistently higher fol-lowing SPG. This increased gainmay be compensation for thereduced summer gains. Breakevenaveraged $64.11/cwt, giving values to silvopastoral area.The ponderosa pinearea ranged from $20 to $26/acre. The lower daily gains during summer grazing are offset by timber (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 24growth on the SPG area. When comparing SPG to grazingunfertilized smooth brome pas-tures, there is a 50% reduction instocking rate. This reduction recog-nizes that unfertilized smoothbrome pasture would supply 80days grazing per steer per acre andthat SPG supplies 43 days grazingper steer per acre on average. Fluc-tuating the stocking density uti-lized under SPG systems may benecessary depending on the stageof tree development. It may be ben-eficial to alter stocking rates as thetree stand density changes. As treesmature, the stocking rates may needto be reduced as tree canopy den-sity increases, shading out thegrass. However, as stands arethinned, grass production increasesand stalking rate may be increasedaccordingly. Conducting grazing asit was in this study would not berecommended on trees less thanfive years old. Rapid grass removalmay be conducted on tree stands asyoung as three years of age withminimal tree damage; however, treespecies should be carefully evalu-ated prior to grazing. Based on the average yearly vol- ume increase of 37.8 cubic feet peracre with the ungrazed locationand a value of $19.50 per cord ofpulp wood (a cord is 128 cubic feet),we could expect an increase in gross return of $5.75 per acre peryear (average increase in grossreturn over two years). However,combining the annual income fromtree growth in the grazed areas andthe additional return from livestock,the silvopastoral grazing systemwould provide $20.98 per acre peryear additional over timberstands alone (Table 3). 1Jim R.

Haugen Sarah K. Ivan Terry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary Digestibility of undegradable intake protein of smooth bromegrass,birdsfoot trefoil, and heat-treatedalfalfa was determined using themobile nylon bag technique. Unde-gradable intake protein (UIP) wasdetermined using neutral detergentinsoluble protein at 75% of the totalmean retention time; 1.82 and 1.71 inJune and July for brome and 1.30 and1.94 in June and July for birdsfoot tre-foil. Digestibility (%) of the UIP inbrome was 38.6 and 27.1 in June andJuly and in birdsfoot trefoil 21.1 and25.1. The UIP (% DM) of alfalfa driedto simulate dehydrated, sun-cured, andfresh alfalfa, was 3.13, 2.10, and 1.84.Digestibility (%) of UIP was highestfor dehydrated (46.4) followed by sun-cured (25.6) and fresh alfalfa (14.7).The undegradable intake protein con-tent and digestibility of the UIP of for-ages is low. Introduction Protein evaluation systems such as the NRC model for beef (1996)and dairy (2001) cattle recognizeintestinal digestibilities of proteinsmay differ by source. Prior to the2001 revision of the dairy NRC, aconstant digestibility of 80% for the undegradable intakeprotein (UIP) all feedstuffs. The1996 beef NRC still uses a constantdigestibility of 80% because of alack of information available onUIP digestibility; however, the dairy NRC (2001) now uses variabledigestibilities from 50% to 100%. The length of incubation of for- ages in the rumen can significantlyinfluence the measured intestinaldigestibility of UIP because proteinflowing from the rumen is greater atshorter incubation times and indi-gestible protein is the same. Manyvalues reported in the literature forUIP and the digestibility of UIP inforages are based on ruminal incu-bations of 16 hours or less, whichmay not reflect true residence timeof forage particles in the rumen.Digestibilities of UIP in foragesmight be overestimated whenrumen incubations are too short.The objectives to deter-mine of heat treatment onthe UIP content and digestibility inalfalfa. Procedure In the first experiment, birdsfoot trefoil and smooth bromegrass clipsamples were collected from twofields on two dates (June and July,2003) from a smooth bromegrasspasture interseeded with BFT at theUniversity of Nebraska Agricul-tural Research DevelopmentCenter near Mead, Nebraska.Samples were frozen at -4 oC, freeze dried (-50oC) for 72 hours, and ground through a 2 mm screen forin situ incubation and a 1 mmscreen for laboratory analysis. In vitro dry matter disappear- ance (IVDMD) was determined onsamples and used to estimate the rate of passage (kp) of each of theforages using the following equa-tion: kp = 0.07 * IVDMD (%) - 0.20 . The kp was then used to determinethe mean retention time (MRT =1/kp). A 10-hour passage lag wasadded to the MRT to yield the retention time (TMRT). Two ruminally cm dacron bags with 50 \u00b5m pore size. Bags containing 1.25 g of air-dry forage groundthrough a 2 mm screen were heat-sealed. A mixed ration of 70%bromegrass hay and 30% concen-trate was fed twice daily for a totalintake of 1.5% BW. Duplicate bagswere incubated at each time days. Four75% TMRT bags per heifer alsowere incubated on these two occa-sions for the intestinal incubation.

Smoothbromegrass was incubated for (59.9% IVDMD) TMRT.The 75% TMRT bags were washedin a washing machine for 0.25hours using five rinse cycles con-sisting of a 1 minute agitation and a2 minute spin following incubationin the rumen. Bags were subse-quently refluxed in neutral deter-gent fiber solution to removemicrobial contamination and deter-mine the NDIN in the residue.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 26Intestinal 75% TMRT bags were not washed but frozen into the duodenum. Ruminallyincubated bags pepsin and HClsolution at 37 oC for 3 hours to simulate abomasal digestion. In Ex-periment 1, two duodenally cannu-lated steers (1305 lb) were used toincubate these bags over eight days.Steers were fed a mixed diet of 70%bromegrass hay and 30% concen-trate twice daily at 1.5% of BW.Bags were inserted into the duode-num 2 hours post-feeding at a rateof 1 bag every 0.1 hour for a total ofeight bags per steer per day. Bagswere collected in the feces begin-ning 12 hours after insertion andfrozen until all bags were collected.Bags were machine washed andrefluxed in neutral detergent fibersolution to correct for microbialcontamination of the forage resi-dues. Residues were analyzed for Nusing a combustion method. In a second experiment, alfalfa samples from plots fertilized withan average of 59 lb N/acre and 178lb N/acre were used to evaluate ef-fects of heat treatment and N fertili-zation on protein degradability inthe rumen and the resulting digest-ibility of the UIP of alfalfa in thesmall intestine. Alfalfa was frozenat -4 oC until drying methods were applied. Drying methods weresimulated in the laboratory andincluded sun-cured, dehydrated,and freeze-dried (fresh) alfalfa. Suncuring was simulated by drying thesample in a forced-air oven at 50 oC for 15 hours. The process of dehy-dration was simulated by dryingthe sample in a forced-air oven at100 oC for 10 hours. Dry samples were ground through a 2 mmscreen for in situ analysis and a 1mm screen for lab analysis. Two ruminally cannulated steers (1451 lb) fed a mixed ration of 65%alfalfa and 35% dry rolled corntwice daily for a total intake of 2%of BW to incubate TMRT bags were Protein characteristics of smooth bromegrass and birdsfoot trefoil in June and July.

Results Protein characteristics of smooth bromegrass and BFT are shown inTable 1. There was a significant for-age x date interaction ( P < 0.01) for the UIP, IDP, digestibility of UIP,and DUIP in Experiment 1. Unde-gradable intake protein (% DM) ofsmooth bromegrass was similarPage 27 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Report(P = 0.11) in June (1.82) and July (1.71); however, the UIP (% DM) ofBFT increased 49% from 1.30 inJune to 1.94 in July ( P < 0.01). Total tract IDP (% DM) of smooth brome-grass increased 12% from 1.11 inJune to 1.24 in July ( P < 0.01); how- ever, the increase in IDP BFT wasgreater (42%) as the IDP (% DM) inJune and July were 1.02 and 1.45,respectively. The tannin concentration of BFT in July may have protected a largerfraction of the CP later in the sum-mer as the DUIP (% DM) was 0.47percentage units in July but only0.28 percentage units in June(P < 0.01). Tannins offer some pro- tection from protein degradation inthe rumen as a result of the tanningof proteins and inactivatingenzymes. These tannin-proteincomplexes can potentially bedigested in the lower tract. Theincrease in IDP in July for smoothbromegrass resulted in a reductionin DUIP (% DM) from 0.70 in Juneto 0.46 in July ( P < 0.01). Digestibil- ity (%) of the UIP in smooth brome-grass decreased from 38.6% in Juneto 27.1% in July, due to the increasein IDP. Even though the increase inIDP was larger in BFT in July, moreUIP was flowing from the rumen,resulting in a tendency for the digestibility (%) of UIP to increasefrom 21.1 in June to 25.1 in July(P = 0.07). Experiment 2 Adding heat during the drying process increased the flow of UIPfrom the rumen as the UIP of alfalfaincreased with exposure to heat(Table 2). The UIP (% DM) of freeze-dried, sun-cured, and dehydratedalfalfa was 1.84, 2.10, and 3.13,respectively ( P < 0.01). Indigestible protein (% DM) was not different infreeze-dried (1.57) and sun-curedalfalfa (1.56); however, the IDP ofdehydrated wasincreased slightly above the othertwo drying methods ( P < 0.01). There was a tendency ( P = 0.06) for greater total tract IDP in alfalfa fer-tilized with high N (1.62) than withthe low N level (1.57); however, thissmall increase in IDP did notadversely affect the digestibility ofthe UIP (data not shown). The net effect of heat treatment on the digestibility of UIP was quitelarge as a result of the differences inUIP flowing to the small intestine.The digestibility (%) of the UIP infreeze-dried, sun-cured, and dehy-drated alfalfa were 14.7, 25.6, and 46.4 ( P < 0.01). The small increase in the IDP for dehydrated alfalfawas offset by the larger increase inthe UIP flowing from the rumenand resulted in the higher digest-ibility of UIP. Compared to freeze-dried alfalfa, dehydrated alfalfasupplied 444% more protein in thesmall intestine. Accurate UIP values of forages determined using appropriate incu-bation times of feeds in the rumen isa critical component in the determi-nation of the digestibility of the UIPin forages. The heat-treated alfalfaused in the present study shows theeffect of decreased ruminaldegradability on lower intestinaltract digestibility values of the UIPfraction. The constant digestibilitiesused in current protein evaluationsystems may be appropriate forconcentrate feeds; however, thesevalues appear to be too high for for-ages. The digestibility of the UIP inthe forages in the current study waslow, varying from 14.7% to 46.4%. 1Heather L. Haugen, graduate Sarah former graduatestudent; Terry J. Klopfenstein, professor,Animal Science, Lincoln.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 28Effects of Corn Moisture and Degradable Intake Protein Concentration on Finishing Cattle Performance shown that including byproducts,such as wet corn gluten feed,increases the DIP requirement byincreasing ruminal pH. Highercorn moisture and increasedensiling periods also may lead toincreased digestion and DIPrequirements by increasing the drymatter digestibility. Degradableintake protein is the fraction ofcrude protein available to themicrobial population. A DIP defi-ciency can lead to limited microbialgrowth and reduced starch diges-tion. Therefore, a deficiency in DIPmay result in reduced finishingcattle performance. Greater ruminaldry matter and starch digestionincreases the DIP requirement.When the increased DIP require-ments are met, cattle performance isimproved. The objectives of our research were to evaluate: 1) the feedingvalue of ensiled, high-moisture andensiled, reconstituted corn at twomoisture levels compared to DRC ina finishing diet, and 2) the effects ofDIP concentration and DIP balancewith the different corn treatmentson cattle performance. Procedure Corn Harvest, Processing, and Storage High-moisture corn was har- vested at two times in September at30% or 24% moisture (30HMC or24HMC), coarsely rolled and storedin silo bags until feeding. Field-dried corn was harvested in mid-October. In late November, some ofthe dry corn was coarsely then stored in silobags until feeding. The remainingdry corn was stored dry andcoarsely rolled at time of feeding(DRC). The same hybrid was grownunder irrigation in two similarfields at the Agriculture Researchand Development Center nearMead, Nebraska. The moisture at which HMC was harvested was lower than expectedand that is why there is a differencein moisture between the HMC andRECON treatments. It is hard tomeet the selected target for HMCwith moisture equipment in theharvest machinery which is notwell designed for higher moisturecorns. Feedlot Experiment Four-hundred-and-eighty cross- bred yearling steers (743 lb) wereused to compare the feeding valueof HMC and RECON at two mois-ture levels and DRC. At the begin-ning of the feeding trial, HMC andRECON had been ensiled for atleast 168 days. Cattle performanceand DIP balance were evaluated.Steers were stratified by weight andassigned randomly to one of 60pens (8 steers/pen) and the 60 penswere assigned randomly to one of15 finishing diets (4 pens/diet). Thetreatment design was a 5 x 3 facto-rial with factors being corn type(24HMC, 30HMC, 28RECON,35RECON or DRC) and DIP bal-ance (NEG, ZERO or POS). The three DIP balances were achieved by adding 0% (NEG),0.45% (ZERO) or 0.90% (POS) ureaJosh R. Benton Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein Casey N. Macken Kyle J.

Diets consisted either dry-rolled,high-moisture at Increasing themoisture of ensiled corn furtherenhanced the feeding value of corn byimproving cattle performance. Introduction Feeding high-moisture corn (HMC) has been shown to be bene-ficial by improving cattle perfor-mance when compared to DRC infeedlot diets when byproducts areincluded. Previous beef finishingresearch ( 2001 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-57) showed that intensivecorn processing methods, such ashigh-moisture corn, increaseddegradable intake protein (DIP)requirements compared to DRC.Other Nebraska research hasPage 29 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportto the base diet (DM basis). The three DIP balances were calculatedusing the NRC (1996) model withthe assumptions of a 743 lb steerwith a DMI of 24 lb/day Tylan\u00ae were included at 27 g/ton and 8 g/ton of diet DM, respec-tively. A commodity DRC was usedin all diets at 4% (DM basis) be-cause of limited supply of high-moisture and reconstituted corn. Steers were weighed initially on two consecutive days after beinglimit-fed at 2.0% of body weight forfive days in order to minimize dif-ferences in gut fill. Steers wereimplanted with Ralgro (Schering-Plough \u00ae-S (Intervet, Millsboro,Delaware) on day 45, and fed for 138 days. Final weights were calcu-lated using hot carcass weightsadjusted to a common dress (63%).Steers were harvested at a commer-cial packing plant where carcassdata were collected. Hot carcassweight was collected the day of har-vest while fat depth, marblingscore, and yield grade data werecollected after a 24-hour chill. Data were analyzed as a 5 x 3 factorial design using the Mixedprocedure of SAS. The corn typeswere analyzed using the LeastSignificant Difference to separatemeans. The DIP balances wereanalyzed using linear or quadraticcontrasts. Results There were no significant corn type x DIP level interactions for anyof the variables observed, therefore,only main effects are presented. Within corn type (Table 1), no dif-ferences were detected betweenearly harvested corn at 24% mois-ture and reconstituted dry corn at28% moisture. There also nodifferences between 30HMC and35RECON. For both early harvestedand reconstituted dry corn, thehigher moisture treatment hadimproved ( P < 0.05) feed conversion compared to the lower moisturetreatment. There was no difference in DMI (P = 0.06) between any of the corn types. There was a tendency forDMI to decrease as corn moistureincreased. Steers fed diets contain-ing DRC, 24HMC, and containing30HMC and 35RECON had a 9.4%improvement ( P < 0.01) in feed conversion, gained 6.3% faster(P = 0.02), and had heavierTable 1.

Clearly thediets containing no urea were defi-cient in DIP. The diets containing0.45% urea were close to a DIP bal-ance of zero and cattle performancewas improved compared to dietscontaining no urea. The diets thatcontained 0.90% urea had excessDIP and no improvement was observedcompared to the diets with 0.45%urea supplementation. In increasing themoisture of high-moisture and reconstituted dry corn enhancedthe feeding themoisture of ensiled corn improvedcattle performance; however, highermoistures should only be fed withthe inclusion of by-products orother mechanisms to control acido-sis. The negative DIP diet with nourea supplementation reducedcattle performance. The zero DIPdiet met the DIP requirements of thecattle and the positive DIP diet didnot improve cattle performance.Therefore, current predictionmodels appear to be appropriateand protein (urea supplementation)above cattle requirements is notbeneficial. 1Joshua R.

Benton Terry J. Klopfenstein Galen E. Erickson1 Summary An in situ trial was conducted to evaluate effects of corn moisture andlength of ensiling on dry matterdigestibility (ISDMD) dry Cornsamples were incubated in situ for 22hours and ISDMD (%) and DIP (% ofCP) values were calculated. Both high-moisture and reconstituted corn hadhigher ISDMD and DIP values thandry-rolled Dry digestibil-ity and degradable intake proteinincreased for high-moisture and recon-stituted corn when either moisture orlength of ensiling was increased. Introduction Research has shown that storing and feeding high-moisture corn(HMC) improves feed conversion8% compared to feeding dry-rolledcorn in feedlot diets containing by-products. It is not clear if the bene-fits are from increased moisture, theeffects of early harvesting on thematurity of the corn kernel, or fer-mentation that occurs during theensiling period. Previous Nebraskaresearch has shown that a longerensiling period, along with inten-sive processing and higher cornmoisture, leads to an increase indry matter and starch digestibility.The increase in ruminal digestionhas been shown to increase thedegradable intake protein (DIP)requirement. Degradable intakeprotein is the fraction of crude pro-tein available to the microbial population. When the increasedDIP requirements are met, cattleperformance is improved. In feedlots, acidosis causes physiological and biochemicalstresses in cattle when they con-sume fermentable carbohydrates ata rapid rate. Ruminal pH dropsbelow 5.6 and feed intake isreduced. Previous research showsthat high-moisture corn is digestedrapidly in the rumen and this to acidosis ( 1986 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 13-14). Therefore, when measuring dry matter or starchdigestibility and protein degrad-ability with in situ methods, animaldiets must be considered. The ani-mals should be on a finishing dietso that any effect of rumen pH onmicrobial digestion will beaccounted for during in situ incu-bation. Particle size of in situsamples also may affect estimates ofdry matter or starch digestibilityand protein degradability. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of corn mois-ture and length of ensiling on insitu estimations of dry matter diges-tibility and degradable intake pro-tein in cattle fed a finishing diet. Procedure Corn Samples High-moisture corn was har- vested at two times in September at30% or 24% (30HMC corn mid-October. In the rolled, reconstituted to28% 35% moisture (28RECON or35RECON), and then stored in silobags. The remaining dry corn was stored dry and coarsely rolled attime of feeding (DRC). These fivecorn treatments were fed in a finish-ing trial from May to September thefollowing year. All corn was of thesame hybrid and grown in two Uni-versity of Nebraska fields. All corn(except DRC) was sampled every 28days throughout the ensilingperiod. The 30HMC and 24HMCtreatments were ensiled 372 and358 respectively. tworeconstituted (RECON) treat-ments were both ensiled for 298days. These corns were used in afeeding trial ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 28-30). In Situ Procedure Three ruminally cannulated steers were housed in individualpens and offered a diet that con-sisted of 68.5% DRC, 20% wet corngluten feed, 7.5% and4% dry supplement (DM basis).Rumensin \u00ae and Tylan\u00ae were included at 29 and 10 g/ton of dietDM, respectively. Dry matter digest-ibility and rumen degradability ofprotein were estimated for the fivecorn treatments by incubatingduplicate 10 x 20 cm dacron bagsfilled with 5.0 g of corn in therumen of each steer. The cornsamples were ground through aThomas-Wiley mill to produce asimulated masticate grind to have aparticle size similar to masticateddry rolled corn ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-57). Samples were incubated for 75% of the meanretention time. Mean retention timeis equal to the inverse of rate of pas-sage using a passage rate of 3.44%/hour for all samples, therefore2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 32Table 1.

After incubation, sampleswere rinsed in a washing machinewith 0.395 L of 39 oC water per in situ bag. There were five rinses con-sisting of one minute agitation andtwo minute spin each. Bags werethen dried in a 60 oC forced-air oven for 18-24 hours, removed, weighed,and residues were analyzed fornitrogen. Calculations The residue weight of each sample was calculated by subtracting theoriginal bag weight from the residueand bag weight obtained after drying.The ISDMD was calculated by divid-ing the residue weight by the originalsample weight before incubation. TheDIP was calculated by using the fol-lowing equation: DIP (% of CP) = {1 - [(Residue weight x Residue %CP) /(Sample weight x Sample %CP)]}x 100 . The ISDMD and DIP values were regressed over ensiling days. Fromthe regression equations (y = mx + b) given, the predicted ISDMD or DIP can be calculated. The intercept(b) represents the ISDMD or DIPafter the first 28 days of ensilingand the slope (m) representschanges in ISDMD of DIP over timeof ensiling after 28 days where x isequal to length of ensiling period in10-day increments. Results Figures 1 and 2 show how the values for ISDMD and DIP for eachcorn changed over the ensilingFigure 1.

When moisture was in- creased for HMC 35%),total ISDMD and DIP increased(P < 0.10). The greatest changes in ISDMD and DIP occurred in thefirst 28 days of ensiling, with thegreatest increase for 35RECON fol-lowed by 30HMC and then 28RE-CON ( P < 0.10). Compared to DRC, both HMC and RECON had greatertotal ISDMD and DIP. Withincreased moisture, ISDMD andDIP both increased and both con-tinued to increase with more daysof ensiling. The values presentedare relative values which may beinfluenced by laboratory proce-dures. The values will give relativedifferences between the treatmentsand cannot be assumed to be theabsolute values or differences. Figures 1 and 2 show that after large changes in the first 28 days,further changes appeared to belinear. Therefore, the values after28 days were regressed over time(Table 1). The slopes of RECON were greater ( P < 0.10) than HMC. The slope of 24HMC was not differ-ent ( P > 0.10) from 30HMC for ISDMD, while the slope of 24HMCwas greater ( P < 0.10) than 30HMC for DIP. The slope of 28RECON wasgreater ( P < 0.10) than 35RECON for ISDMD and DIP. As mentioned earlier, it has been shown that cattle performance isimproved when increased require-ments for degradable intakeprotein, due to increased ruminaldigestion, are met. This study sug-gests that cattle performance maybe improved by ensiling highermoisture corn resulting in increas-ing ISDMD and DIP of that corn.Reconstituted dry corn resulted insimilar increases in ISDMD andDIP compared to HMC and theseresults would suggest that thechanges in ISDMD and DIP are dueto the effects of moisture andensiling. There may be some initialimprovement in the feeding valuefor HMC due to the effects of early harvesting, but it appears that after28 to 56 days of ensiling,RECON and HMC are equivalent. Based on this research, there appear to be two distinct phases tothe changes that occur over time ofensiling. The first change occurs inthe first 28 days of ensiling wherethere are significant increases in theISDMD and DIP values of the corn.The second change occurs gradu-ally after 28 days throughout theensiling period where there areslight increases in the ISDMD andDIP values. In conclusion, as mois-ture and length of ensiling increase,the estimated values for dry matterdigestibility and protein degrad-ability will be increased. 1Joshua R.

Luebbe Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein Wayne A. Fithian1 Summary A metabolism trial was conducted to determine the influence of corn kerneltraits on digestibility. The sevenhybrids used in this study were thesame as those fed in a feedlot perfor-mance trial where kernel traits werecorrelated to feed efficiency. Thesehybrids were selected to represent arange within and among kernel traits.There were no differences in total tractdigestibility for hybrids that havesofter endosperm. Ruminal pH param-eters and intake behavior were notfound to be different for animals in themetabolism trial. However, differencesdid exist among hybrids for volatilefatty acid production. VFA productionover time was similar for all treat-ments with a peak in total VFA concen-trations five to seven hours afterfeeding. Introduction Corn is the primary ingredient in feedlot diets due to its high energyvalue and subsequent animal per-formance. Cattle consuming starchfrom corn hybrids which are morerapidly degraded in the rumen aremore efficient than those fed cornwhich is more slowly degraded(Nebraska Beef Report, 2004 pp. 54). The interaction of many physicaland chemical properties in the ker-nel can contribute to how starch isutilized. A softer endosperm kernelis generally thought to have moreenzyme accessible space betweenthe starch molecules. This increasesthe ability of bacteria to attach and degrade kernels to a greater extent. Seven corn hybrids varying in chemical and physical propertieswere fed in a performance study todetermine the impact of those prop-erties on finishing cattle perfor-mance (Nebraska Beef Report, 2004pp. 54). Larger, softer kernels werefound to be significantly correlatedto improved feed efficiencies whenfed as dry-rolled corn. The resultsfrom the performance study suggestthat kernel traits have an impact onstarch utilization by feedlot cattle.Stenvert hardness tests from theprevious study showed that hybrid6 has the softest kernel traits fol-lowed by 1, 7, 2, 4, 5, and 3. Usingthese data, our hypothesis was thatsofter kernels are more digestibleand total volatile fatty acid produc-tion would be greater for those ker-nels. The objective of this researchwas to examine total-tract nutrientdigestibility, volatile fatty acid pro-duction, and monitor ruminal fer-mentation patterns of the fed todetermine the digestibility of sevenhybrids varying in chemical andphysical properties. The sevenhybrids consisted of Golden Har-vest H-9235Bt/RR(2), Pioneer Golden (6), and H-9533Bt (7). Alldiets among treatment groups wereidentical except for the hybrid fedas dry-rolled corn. The final dietconsisted of 68.5% corn gluten and 4.0% supplement.Heifers were fed for ad libitumintake once daily at 0700. Periodswere 14 days in length with a 9-dayadaptation to the diet and a 5-daycollection period. Heifers were indi-vidually fed in pens on days 1-8during the adaption and movedinto stanchions for the collectionperiod on day 9. Individual feed bunks suspend- ed from load cells were used tomonitor feed intake patterns. Feedintake measurements (day 10 to 14)included DMI, number of meals perday, average meal size, total timespent eating, and average meallength. Continuous pH measure-ments were collected using sub-mersible pH electrodes placed intothe rumen during the collectionperiod. Probes were suspended in astationary position 4-6 inchesabove the ventral floor of the rumenprior to the collection period. Intakeand pH measurements wererecorded every six seconds andaveraged for each minute. Chromic oxide was used as an indigestible marker for estimatingfecal output. Boluses were given viarumen cannula twice daily at 0700and 1900 with each dose contain-ing 7.5 grams chromic oxide. Fecalgrab samples were collected threetimes daily on days 10 though 14 at0, 6, and 12 hours post-feeding.Feed ingredients, feed refusals, andfecal were freeze-dried andanalyzed to calculate nutrientdigestibility. Ruminal fluid sampleswere collected on day 14 of eachperiod prior to feeding, and everytwo hours post-feeding for a twelve-hour period to determine volatilefatty acid production.Page 35 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef ReportResults There were no differences in measured intake patterns amongtreatments. Heifers consumed anaverage of 3.4 lb of dry matter with7.2 meals consumed per day. Totaltime spent eating was 600 minuteswith each meal averaging 92 min-utes (data not shown). Differenceswere found in starch intake amongtreatments with animals consum-ing the least amount of starch withhybrid 7 and the most with hybrid1. These differences are due to thepercent starch of the hybrid (63.8%and 80.3%, respectively). Average pH, maximum pH, minimum pH, and pH changealong with time and area below 5.6are shown in Table 1. Ruminal pHmeasurements were not influencedby grain hybrid; however, somenumerical differences in averagepH were evident. Lower ruminal pH results would support a greaterrate and extent of starch digestion,but could have been mediated inthis study due to the inclusion ofWCGF in the diet. Total tract DM, OM and starch digestibilities were similar amongtreatments (Table 2). Dry matter,organic matter, and starch diges-tibilities averaged 77.1%, 77.9% and95.1%, respectively. These resultscould be due to the intakesobserved in the metabolism heifers.Intakes were lower as a percentageof body weight for the metabolismheifers (1.9%) compared to the fin-ishing steers (2.3%). The lowerintakes could have slowed the rateof passage of feed particles from therumen and therefore increased theextent of degradation of starch fromhybrids that have harder kernelcharacteristics.Table 1.

Loza Kyle J. Vander Pol Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein Rick A. Stock1 Summary Sixty steers were individually fed for a 101-day period to evaluate twocorn processing methods, dry rolled(DRC) or 29% moisture reconstitutedcorn (HMC), in combination with 25% wetcorn gluten (WCGF). Final bodyweight was greater for the steers fedDRC compared to steers fed HMCdiets. Steers receiving DRC treatmentshad a 16% higher DMI than HMCtreatments. DMI was greater in theDRC 7% alfalfa treatment than DRC0% alfalfa treatment, while there wasno difference between the HMC treat-ments. There was a trend for a betterfeed conversion for DRC 0% alfalfahay compared to HMC 0% alfalfa hay.The results indicate to over-come the subacute acidosis associatedwith diets based on high moisture this study. Introduction Different rates of ruminal diges- tion have been observed due to cornprocessing. Higher rates of diges-tion can lead to subacute acidosis. Thus, different responses relative tothe inclusion levels of milling by-product and forage in finishingrations would be expected. The useof corn milling by-products asenergy sources in finishing dietscould reduce subacute acidosisproblem associated with high-energy finishing diets and reducethe need for including forage. Theobjective of this trial was to com-pare cattle performance when twocorn processing methods, reconsti-tuted high moisture and dry rolled,and two levels of alfalfa are fed tofinishing cattle. All diets included25% wet corn gluten feed (WCGF). Procedure Sixty steer calves (initial BW 877 + 4.8 lb) were stratified by weight and assigned randomly to one offour treatments in a 2 x 2 factorialdesign. Treatments consisted ofeither dry rolled corn or high mois-ture corn in combination with 25%WCGF (Sweet Bran 60, Cargill cornmilling) with two levels of forageinclusion (0% or 7% alfalfa hay, Table 1). Steers were individuallyweighed on three consecutive daysunder restricted feeding (DMI was2% of BW) at the start of the experi-ment and two consecutive days atthe end of the experiment. Startingon June 25, 2003, steers were indi-vidually fed for 101 days usingCalan electronic headgates. Ortswere collected when necessary todetermine individual intake. At theend of the trial, steers were har-vested at a commercial abattoir.Final weight was calculated fromcarcass weights using a commondressing percentage (63%). Hot car-cass weight (HCW) was obtainedthe day of slaughter; fat thicknessand rib eye areas (REA) wereobtained after a 24-hour chill. Yieldgrades were calculated using REA,HCW and back fat, assuming a 2%kidney, pelvic and heart (KPH) fat.Statistical analysis was performedusing mixed procedures of SAS.Data from two steers were removedfrom the analysis due to morbiditynot related to treatments.

Alfalfadecreased feed efficiency (6.58 vs6.10 F:G) when fed in the DRC dietswhile alfalfa increased feed effi-ciency (6.45 vs 6.67) in the HMCdiets. The ADG advantage of feed-ing DRC treatments compared tofeeding HMC treatments contra-dicts previous research ( 2001 Nebraska Beef Report pp. 59-63). The difference with previous researchmight be due to the lower WCGFlevel used in the present trial (25%), compared with previous trials, butalso may be related to the type ofexperiment. In this experiment,cattle were individually fedwhereas previous research ( 2001 Nebraska Beef Report pp. 59-63; 2003 Nebraska Beef Report pp 25-27) was conducted in research pens(8 steers/pen). The WCGF inclu-sion level in this trial may not havebeen sufficient to overcome thehigher acidotic challenge with theHMC diet. These data suggest thatthe value of forage in feedlot dietsmay depend on the corn processingmethod when diets contain WCGF. 1Pablo L. Loza, graduate student; J. Pol, research technician;Galen E.

Sayer Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein Tim W. Loy1 Summary Eight ruminally cannulated heifers were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latinsquare to determine the effects ofreplacing dry rolled corn with cornbran or a combination of corn bran andcorn steep, on diet digestibility reducing acidosis and hadlower dry matter and organic matterdigestibilities than the control diet,regardless of steep inclusion. Fiberdigestion and microbial efficiency mayhave been promoted with the inclusionof corn bran and steep in the diet. Feed-ing a diet containing corn bran andsteep may be valuable for improvingnutrient utilization in the rumen. Introduction Providing options to decrease ammonia emissions is essential forfuture progress of the feedlot indus-try. Feeding corn bran, which is asource of highly digestible fiber, isan effective means of reducing Nlosses from the feedlot pen surface.When 30% bran replaced dry rolledcorn (DRC), N losses were reducedby 38% in the winter months ( 2003Nebraska Beef Report, pp 54-58). The reduction in N lost was achieved byreducing diet digestibility, increas-ing fecal N output, and increasingOM on the pen surface. Fecal N is more stable than uri- nary N. Increasing the amount offermentable carbohydrates to thehind gut, via feeding a lower digest-ible diet, is an effective means toincrease fecal N ( 1996 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp 74-77). The conse- quence of reducing diet digestibilityis reduced feed efficiency in cattle(2002 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp 54-57; 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 54-58). Corn steep is a by-product of the wet corn milling industry that is acombination of both distillers solu-bles and steep liquor. It has a high-er energy value than DRC ( 1998 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp 69- 71). The objective of the followingmetabolism study was to evaluatethe effect of corn bran and steepinclusion in finishing diets All diets included 5% molasses (Table 1). Thesediets were similar in composition tothose fed in two finishing trialsused to evaluate cattle performanceand N mass balance ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp 54-56). Periods included 16-day adaptation and5-day collection. Chromic a marker to determinetotal digestibility, 7.5 g,twice daily through the rumen can-nula. The chromic oxide was dosed72 hours before the first collectionday, to ensure it was equally con-centrated throughout the digesta.Fecal samples were taken threetimes during each collection day,dried in a 60 oC oven for 48 hours, and composited. Intake was con-tinuously measured similar to thesystem described by Cooper et al.,(1997 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 49). Ruminal fluid was collected priorto feeding and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and12 hours after feeding on each ofthe 5 days during a collectionperiod. An in-situ trial also was con- ducted during the final collectionperiod. Corn bran and DRC wereincubated as-is at time points of 0,12, 24, 48, and 96 hours, with cornbran extent of 96 hours and DRC ata 48-hour extent. Each time pointused two steers per diet and tworeplications per sample, with anempty dacron bag incubated for acontrol. Both bran and DRC wereevaluated for DM disappearance2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 40rate; corn bran also was evaluated for NDF disappearance rate withineach of the four diets. Potentialdigestible fractions were calculatedby subtracting the extent hour valuefrom the 0 hour value. A log trans-formation calculation was used tocalculate DM and NDF disappear-ance rates (%/hour). Results Dry matter intake was similar among all treatments, averaging 25lb/day ( P > 0.10; Table 1). By- product diets had higher ruminalpH (5.96) than CON (5.75), aver-aged across all time points(P < 0.01; Table 2). The lower rumi- nal pH supports the concept thatfeeding by-products helps mini-mize the effects of acidosis. Acetate:propionate ratios were 2:09, 2:25,2:30, (P<0.05). When diets had content (i.e. branincluded in the diet), acetate con-centrations were higher and propi-onate concentrations were lower. Total tract DM digestibility (Table 2) was higher in CON thanby-product diets (79% vs 73.0%,P < 0.01), as was OM digestibility (80.2% vs. 74.6%, P < 0.01). Steep provided no improvement in DM orOM digestibility of the 30/15 diet.This is somewhat different fromprevious that evaluated15% corn bran and 15% corn branplus 15% steep (15/15). Scott et al.(1998 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 69- 71) reported the DM digestibility ofa 15% bran diet to be 80%, while the15/15 diet was 83% digestible.Although there was no statisticaldifference in the data from Scott etal., (1998) steep did tend to improvetotal tract digestibility. In-Situ Results DM disappearance (%/hour) of DRC was lower in CON diet thanby-product diets ( P < 0.01; Table 3), suggesting that because the rumenpH was higher in the byproductTable 1.

NDF disappearance rates(%/hour) were highest for the45/15, similar for 30/0 and 30/15,and lowest for CON ( P < 0.01; Table 3). This suggests that when cornbran is increased in the diet, themicrobial population has morecellulolytic bacteria. A higher cellu- lolytic bacteria population wouldpromote an increase in the acetate:propionate ratio, as well as anincrease in ruminal fluid pH. The percentage of NDF dis- appearance was not differentamong diets at 0, 12 and 24 hours;however, at 48 and 96 hours (Figure1), the NDF disappearance for branwas lower for CON than by- product diets ( P < 0.01). Digestion of corn bran occurred to a furtherextent when bran was incubated in30/0, CONdiet. These data support the theorythat because of a higher ruminalpH and an altered microbial popu-lation, digestion of both dry rolledcorn and bran occurs to a greaterextent. While adding steep to the diet did not improve total tract digest-ibility, it did improve cattle perfor-mance ( 2005 Nebraska digestibilities than typicalcorn-based diets, regardless of steepinclusion. Rate brandigestion and extent is greater inby-product-based diets. Feedingcorn bran and steep in combinationis an effective means of promotingfiber digestion, and maintaining ahealthier rumen environment. 1Kristi M. Sayer, graduate student, Galen E.

Vander Pol Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary An experiment evaluated the effects of finishing diets containing dried dis-tillers grains supplemented withdegradable intake protein Diets contained 10%or grams/day.No response in performance or carcasscharacteristics were observed amongtreatments. The results indicate suffi-cient amounts of urea were recycled tothe rumen to meet the degradableintake protein requirement. Therefore,supplemental degradable intake pro-tein is not necessary in finishing dietscontaining dried distillers grains at10% or 20% of diet DM. Introduction A recent USDA report indicated U.S. ethanol production grew froma few million gallons in the mid-1970s to over 3.3 billion gallonsprojected in 2004. Corn dry millingis the primary mechanism for pro-ducing fuel ethanol, however, etha-nol can be produced from the drymilling of other cereal grains (sor-ghum, wheat, etc.) or from wetmilling corn. Approximately two- thirds of the grain being milled isrecovered as ethanol or carbondioxide, the other one-third isreferred to as distillers by-products.Therefore, nutrients within distill-ers by-products are concentratedthree-fold compared to the cerealgrain from which it was produced. Distillers grains are well utilized in feedlot diets, however, dietsbeing formulated to contain a fixedamount of dried distillers grains(DDG) often indicate a deficiency indegradable intake protein (DIP).Past research with growing heifersconcluded supplemental DIP inhigh forage diets containing fixedamounts of DDG was not necessary(2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 20- 21). The objective of this research trial was to determine if supple-mental DIP is necessary for perfor-mance optimization of individuallyfed one of four diets in a 2 x 2 fac-torial arrangement of treatments.Factors consisted of two levels ofDDG (10% and 20% of DM) andpresence or absence of in all diets at 5% ofdiet DM, while dry supplement was included in all diets at 4% of DM.Dry-rolled corn made up the bal-ance of the diets. Rumensin \u00ae and Tylan\u00ae were fed at a rate of 320 and 90 mg/head/day, respectively.Dietary treatments (Table to bothDIP and metabolizable protein (MP)balances. All diets were sufficientin MP 1), while the 10DGand 20DG diets were deficient inDIP (Table 1). Initial weights werebased on a five-day limit fedweight, where heifers were fed a50% alfalfa hay:50% wet corn glu-ten feed diet (DM basis) at 2% ofbody weight, with weights taken forthree consecutive days. Dietaryadaptation consisted of limit feed-ing, whereby DM offered increased0.50 implanted on day 26 withRevalor-H \u00ae, and were weighed on days 26-28, 70-72, and 100 (finallive weight). An aliquot (20 ml) ofblood was collected on days 28, 72,and 100, via jugular venipunctureinto vacutainers, for subsequentblood urea nitrogen analysis, usingthe automated procedure outlinedby Marsh et. al (1965). Heifers wereslaughtered on day 100 at a com-mercial packing plant (Tyson FreshMeats, West Point, Nebraska)Page 43 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef ReportCorn distillers dried grains were procured from a commercial etha-nol plant (Abengoa Bioenergy,York, Nebraska) as one lot, deliv-ered all at one time, and utilized asneeded. Results Performance variables are pre- sented in Table 2. Dry matter intakeincreased numerically with theaddition of urea, however, no sig-nificant differences ( P > 0.10) were detected for the interaction or maineffects. Similarly, carcass adjustedfinal live weight was numericallyhigher for heifers receiving supple-mental urea. Further, as with DMIand carcass adjusted BW, averagedaily gain (ADG) improved numeri-cally when urea was incorporatedinto the diet, however, the responsewas not significant ( P > 0.35). Feed:gain ratio were slightly differ-ent. The ratio was numericallyimproved by adding urea to the10% DDG diet and was not im-pacted by adding urea to the 20%DDG diet. The urea x level inter-action, however, was not signifi-cant ( P = 0.37). These data suggest sufficient recycling of nitrogen to the rumento meet the DIP requirement oc-curred. Further, there was sufficientMP available to supply the neededurea for recycling. The numericaldata for feed efficiency clearly showthat recycling occurred on the 20%DDG treatment, however, the defi-ciency of DIP was less and the MPexcess was greater than that for the10% DDG treatment. The conserva-tive application of these results maybe to incorporate a small amount ofurea into a 10% DDG diet; however,no added benefit of supplementalurea will occur when greater than10% DDG is fed. In this experiment,DDG was used instead of wet dis-tillers grains, primarily due to therelatively small amount of distillersgrains needed in an individualfeeding experiment. However, totalprotein and DIP are similar (Continued on next page)Table 1.

Therefore, we could predictsimilar responses in diets contain-ing wet distillers grains. Carcass characteristics were similar between treatments (Table2). The mean fat thickness was 0.43inches, indicating heifers on alltreatments were equally finished;however, heifers not supplementedwith urea had numerically highermarbling scores than heiferssupplemented with urea.

Therefore, these dataindicate excess metabolizable pro-tein in the diets deficient in DIPwas adequate enough to providethe additional DIP needed in therumen and maintain performance. Heifers on all treatments had sig- nificantly higher BUN values astime on feed increased. The highercirculating urea amounts later inthe feeding period (Table 3) reflect the decreasing protein requirementof the finishing animal with time onfeed.

Becausecorn milling by-products also helpwith acidosis control, an opportu-nity may exist to lower roughagelevels in diets with higher levels ofthe by-products. The objectives ofthis trial were 1) to evaluate theeffects of inclusion levels of a by-product mixture of wet corn glutenfeed (WCGF) and wet corn distillersgrains plus solubles (WDGS), and2) evaluate forage inclusion levelin feedlot diets on animal perfor-mance and carcass characteristics. Procedure Two-hundred-and-eighty year- ling steers (initial BW = 815 + 1 lb) were blocked by weight, stratifiedwithin block, and assigned to 35pens (8 steers/pen). Pens wereassigned randomly to one of seventreatments (five pens/treatment).Treatments consisted of beef finish-ing diets containing different inclu-sion levels of a 50:50 blend (DMbasis) of wet distillers grains plussolubles (WDGS) and wet corngluten feed (WCGF) and alfalfa haylevels (Table 1). The 50:50 by- products blend (Blend) was includ-ed at 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% (DMbasis). Alfalfa was included usingtwo scenarios. In the first scenario,all diets (levels of Blend) included7.5% alfalfa hay. In the second sce-nario, the level of alfalfa decreasedas Blend level increased to supplyalfalfa hay at levels of 5%, 2.5% and0% for were truckload was hay, corn and WCGF (SweetBran, Cargill, Blair, Nebraska) weresampled weekly.

Stock 1 Summary Two-hundred-and-eighty yearling steers were used to evaluate effects ofincreasing levels of a corn milling by-product combination (Blend) (50% wetcorn gluten feed, 50% wet distillersgrains; DM basis) and different alfalfahay levels on feedlot performance andcarcass characteristics. Levels of Blendwere 0%, 25%, 50% or 75% diet DM.Alfalfa level was either kept constantat 7.5% of or the forage leveldecreased, and0% alfalfa Steer DMI,ADG, and F:G quadrati-cally (P<0.05), with the greatest ADGand improved at 25% and 50% blend.These results suggest that feeding a50:50 combination of wet corn glutenfeed and wet distillers grains for up to50% of a diet will enhance cattle per-formance. Introduction Current corn milling by-product utilization in commercial feedlotdiets is usually up to 30% of dietDM. The expected growth of thecorn milling industry will increasethe by-product supply in the future,providing opportunity to increasethe amount used. The levels usedalso may interact with roughagelevels in the diet. Traditionallyroughage level is fed to manage Table 1.

Due to little effect across differentroughage levels, Blend level wastested as a main effect. Quadraticresponses ( P<0.05) to Blend level were observed for ADG, DMI andfeed conversion (Table 3). Feedlotperformance was not significantlydifferent between the steers fed the25% and 50% Blend diets. Steers fedthe diets with inclu-sion of 50% had higherDMI, ADG, and better feed conver-sion than steers fed the 75% Blendand the control (0% Blend) diets.When the Blend was included at75%, ADG, DMI, and feed conver-sion were not different from thecontrol, corn-based diet (0% Blend). Hot carcass weights were 5% heavier for the 25% and 50% Blendinclusion levels compared with the0% (control) and the 75% Blend.Calculated yield grade, back fat andrib eye area showed a quadraticresponse to Blend levels in thediets, while marbling scoresshowed a trend ( P=0.08) for a quadratic response. Feeding Blend up to 50% of diet DM improved animal performance.Above the 50% Blend inclusion level, feedlot performance did notdiffer from the control corn-baseddiet. Alfalfa level in the diets couldbe reduced when Blend levels areincreased without affecting feedlotperformance. Wet distillers grainsand wet corn gluten feed may becomplementary based on theirnutrient compositions. Distillersgrains are higher in fat andundegradable intake protein whileWCGF is higher in effective fiber.The combination was very effectivein this experiment; at the 25% Blendlevel the energy value was 50%greater than the corn replaced bythe Blend. A summary of pastresearch has shown that wet distill-ers grain has 52% more energyvalue than corn at 17.4% of the diet.Wet corn gluten feed had 5.1% moreenergy than corn fed at an averageof 35% of the diet. Based on thesepast studies, we predicted 29%higher values for the blend in thisexperiment at the 25% and 50%levels. In this experiment, cattle fed25% Blend performed 44.8% bettercompared to corn in the control andcattle fed 50% Blend performed22.4% better than corn in the con-trol. The increased apparent energyvalue, especially for cattle fed the25% Blend, is likely due to acidosiscontrol and the complementaryeffect of the WDGS and WCGF. 1Pablo Loza, graduate student; Kyle J.

This range of P concentrationprovides an opportunity to reduce P inthe distiller's by-products. Based on90% starch conversion efficiency, theestimated P concentrations of ethanolby-product were 0.52% and 1.04%when using grain with P concentra-tions of 0.19% and 0.39%, respec-tively. This is a reduction of 50%when using low P instead of high Pcorn hybrids. Introduction Ethanol production plants are using a significant amount of cornproduced in the United States eachyear. In 2002, about 800 millionbushels of corn were used to pro-duce ethanol (Agricultural Statis-tics, 2002). In the ethanolproduction system, the starch isconverted to ethanol and CO 2 and the remaining grain material iscalled distiller by-product (wet dis-tiller grain plus soluble or dry dis-tiller grain plus soluble). Thisby-product is high in energy, pro-tein and P content and is usuallyfed to feedlot cattle in Nebraska.Removing starch from grain con-centrates P in the by-product. Whenthis high P material is added to aration, it increases P concentrationof the ration and subsequently in- creases manure P concentration. Corn hybrids have different con- centrations of P in grain. Results ofa two-year field study conducted bythe author in 1999 and 2000 indi-cated grain P concentration rangedfrom 0.21% to 0.33% among 12 com-mercial corn hybrids. Analysis ofother commercial hybrids in 2003indicated that high P hybrids haveP concentrations that can be morethan double those for low Phybrids. These low P grain hybridscan be used in rations to reduce Pcontent or used in ethanol produc-tion to reduce P content of the by-product and hence make it a moreenvironmentally friendly feedstuff.The starch conversion efficiency isusually greater than 90% with ei-ther dry or wet milling. Some of thestarch is associated with phytate (Pcompound in the grain) and thatwould prevent the associatedstarch from being converted to etha-nol (H. Noureddini, personal com-munication). The low P corn wouldhave the advantage of containingless starch associated with P ingrain and hence may increasestarch conversion efficiency. Theobjective of this study was to deter-mine the effects of corn hybridswith different grain P concentra-tions on the P content of ethanolby-products. By reducing P concen-tration of the by-product, the P con-centration of manure also will bereduced, addressing concernsabout soil P accumulation in thesoil.Procedure Commercial corn hybrids (Pioneer Hi-Bred and NC+ brands)grown in Nebraska and Iowa in2003 and the B73 X Mo17 hybridwere tested for grain P concentra-tion differences. The grain samples(at least two replications except theNC + samples) were tested for total P using the X-ray method at the Uni-versity of Nebraska Soil TestingLaboratory. The grain P concentra-tion of each hybrid was used to esti-mate the P concentrations of theethanol production by-products. Ethanol distiller by-product P concentrations were estimatedbased on grain starch content andstarch conversion efficiency. Starchrecovery for the low temperaturedried, elevator, and export cornduring five years of milling rangedfrom 89 to 94% (average 92% + 0.5) (U.S. Grain Council, 2001). Whencalculating the expected P concen-trations of the ethanol by-product,an assumption of 90% starch con-version efficiency was used. Corngrain total starch concentrationwas determined using the chemicalsolubilization method. Results There was a wide range of grain P concentrations among the cornhybrids (Table 1). Grain P concen-tration ranged from 0.19% to 0.39%,indicating that P concentrationsvaried more than 100% across the2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 48range of hybrids included in the study. The average grain P concen-tration for the hybrids was 0.27%and that was 42% higher than Pio-neer 33B50, which had the lowestgrain P concentration. When grain from these hybrids is used for ethanol production, theP concentrations of the byproductwould be expected to range from0.52% to 1.04%. Using Pioneer33B50 instead of NC + 3709 (the hybrids with the least and greatestP concentrations in the study; Table1) for ethanol production wouldreduce the by-product P concentra-tion by 50%. The low P content by-product should reduce the amountof P excreted in manure when it isfed to cattle. In ethanol production facilities, corn from a number of farms andlikely a mixture of hybrids with dif-ferent P concentrations are used.The average P concentration of thehybrids reported in Table 1 was0.27%, which may be similar to themix used by ethanol plants. UsingPioneer 33B50 hybrid as comparedwith the average concentration canresult in 27% reduction in the by-product P concentration. Phospho-rus concentrations of by-products in eight new ethanolplants in Minnesota and SouthDakota (118 samples) ranged from0.70% to 0.99% (average 0.89% et al., 2002,Journal Animal Science 80:2639- 2645). The P concentration of theby-product from the low P cornhybrid (0.19% P) was expected to beTable 1. Grain phosphorus and starch concentrations (dry weight basis) of selected commercial corn hybrids and the estimated ethanol by-product P concentrations assuming 90% starch conversion efficiency. Grain P Grain Starch Estimated Ethanol Hybrid Concentration Concentration By-product P Content ------------------------------------- aGrain P concentrations taken from Eghball et al. (2003) and starch concentrations are the average of the other 13 hybrids reported in the table (the mean starch concentration of 69.6% had a standard error of 0.2). 42% less than the average of those from these eight plants. Corn hybrids have a wide range of grain P concentrations. Usingthose with low P concentrationsprovides a great opportunity toreduce the P content in ethanol dis-tiller byproducts. Using the low Phybrid can result in as much as a50% reduction in the P concentra-tion of the by-product. Additionalresearch is needed to confirm theeffects of P concentration in corngrain on ethanol quality and quan-tity and distiller by-product. Inaddition, other commercial cornhybrids need to be tested for grain Pconcentration differences and whether the P concentration trait isstable under various soil P levels orenvironmental conditions. Lowgrain P concentration corn removesless P from soil at the same grainyield level as high grain P corn,resulting in longer period whencorn production is used to lowersoil P level. 1Dr. Bahman Eghball passed away July 26, 2004.

Procedure One-hundred-and-twenty-nine crossbred yearling steers weighing799 lb were stratified by weight andrandomly assigned to 16 pens withfour pens randomly assigned tofour treatments. Two consecutiveday weights were taken for an ini-tial weight. Single day weightswere taken at 28-day intervals.Final weights were calculated fromhot carcass weight by dividing car-cass weight by 63%. Periodic feedand bunk samples were collected.The steers were on feed 143 days(5/24/03 to 10/13/03). Field peasreplaced corn in the diet at 0%,20%, 40%, and 59% (Table 1). Thefield peas were fed unprocessed.Two supplements were used withdifferent levels of protein as thelevel of peas increased. One of thesupplements contained 58% pro-tein (38% from non protein nitro-gen) (NPN) the other was 10% protein with no NPN. Thepeas provided all the required pro-tein in the diet of 40% and 20% peadiet a combination of two supple-ments was used to meet therequired protein and monensinlevels. Levels of monensin, vita-mins, and trace minerals were con-stant in all experimental diets. Thecattle were started on a 50 NEg dietand three steps were made to thefinal ration. The full level of peas(40% and 59%) was not achieveduntil the cattle were on the finalfinishing diet. All cattle wereimplanted with Synovex Plus \u00ae at the initiation of the trial plustreated for internal and externalparasites. The data were analyzedin SAS using the Proc Mixed proce-dure with linear and quadratic con-trasts. Mean with P < 0.05 were considered significantly different. (Continued on next page)Erin M. Fendrick Ivan G. Rush Dennis R.Brink Galen E. Erickson David D. Baltensperger1 Summary Feeding field peas was compared to using corn in beef finishing diets.Diets containing field peas at 0%,20%, 40%, and 59% replacement ofcorn in ration DM were fed to 129steers. Dry matter intake increasedfrom the 0% to ADG and G:F wereobserved. Field peas can replace 59%of the corn DM in beef finishing dietwith no significant differences in ani-mal gain or feed efficiency. Introduction Acreages of field peas ( Pisum savitum ) have increased markedly in recent years as field peas havebecome a valuable part of drylandcrop rotations. Most field peas aregrown for human consumption,however, the peas must meet strictquality grade standards for thehuman market. The rejected peasare much lower in dollar value andconsequently are available for live-stock consumption. Field peas con-tain 20-28% CP and one-third lessstarch than corn, which wouldindicate possibly a lower feedingvalue when protein needs are met.The objectives for our study were to Table 1. Experimental dry matter composition of rations containing four levels of peasa. 0.68 0.68 aTreatments are the percent of peas replacing corn on a DM basis. bSupp A contained 58% crude protein. cSupp B contained 10% crude protein.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 50Results Cattle performance data is shown in Table 2. Dry matterintakes were significantly different(quadratic effect P < .0001). Intakes 0% It is why were higher atthe low level pea diets yet droppedoff at the higher levels. There didnot appear to be any separation inthe bunk so it is doubtful that palat-ability was greatly differentbetween peas and corn. Because thelevel of starch is lower in peas thanin corn, the higher intake of the peadiets may be explained by a pos-sible increase in rumen pH as peasincreased in the diet. This of coursedoes not explain the peak intake at40% peas rather than 59%, how-ever, the intake at the high level ofpea diet was still 1.5 lb higher thanthe corn control diet. The high levelpea diets contained very high levelsof protein which could have possi-bly moderated intake at the highestlevel. Bunk analysis of the dietsfound 12.7%, 14.3%, 59% in all rations were relativelow, if rumen pH was higher in thepea rations, NDF digestion couldhave been higher in the higher pearations which would allow forgreater intake. There were no significant treat- ment differences among ADG andG:F ratios (Table 2). Numericallythe control cattle were the most effi-cient because they had the lowestintake and the highest daily gain.In this experiment the control rationhad 13.8% greater efficiency andalthough not statistically signifi-cant, it does suggest that furtherstudies are needed to see if peainclusions do lower efficiency and,if so, at what level. Another factor suggesting that peas are of lower feeding valuethan corn, from an energy stand-point, was when the net energyvalue was estimated (Fred OwensPioneer Brand Excel spreadsheet) in the overall diet and for peas. Itwas found that the value for peaswas considerably lower than thatfor corn (Table 3). This was espe-cially true with the lower level ofinclusion. The estimated NEg levelof the peas increased as the level inthe diet increased. It is unclear whythe estimates are greatly different atthe different levels, but perhapspeas are influencing the overall dietdigestion. Because the numericaldifferences in efficiency of the peadiets were nearly equal but greatlydiffered when compared to the corndiet, it is logical that the net energyvalue will be lowest at the lowestinclusion level. Reasons for theapparent negative associated effectare unclear, however, due to the factthat the feed efficiency means werenot significantly different, it is prob-able the pea net energy values areestimated lower than actual values.It appears that when all factors areconsidered, the energy value of Table 2.

Previous researchsuggests as dietary P increases,amount of fecal P excretionincreases from cattle fed roughage-based diets (Valk et. al. 2002). Theeffects of dietary P levels on P excre-tion have not been well docu-mented in feedlot diets, thereforethe objective of this study was toevaluate the effects of dietary P con-centrations on amount and route Pexcretion when cattle are fed finish-ing diets. Procedure Five ruminally fistulated steers (initial BW = 850 lb + 87 lb) were utilized in a 5 x 5 Latin squareexperiment. Diets (Table 1) con-sisted of three 0.12% P(LOWP) with phos- to0.27 (MEDP) supple-ment and were similar to those in aP requirement study previouslyreported ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 49-51). The remaining two dietswere a DRC-based diet (CORN) anda dry distillers grain diet (DDGS).The CORN diet consisted of 85%DRC, 5% grass hay, Gene Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein Matt K. Luebbe 1 Summary Five ruminally fistulated steers were fed five finishing diets contain-ing varying levels and sources of phos-phorus (P). Diets consisted of 3brewer's grits-based diets consisting ofone no P (0.12) with mineral P(0.27%, and 0.42% P), one corn-baseddiet (0.30% P), and one diet contain-ing dry distillers grains (0.36% P).As P intake increased, P excretionincreased and was positively correlated(r = 0.67; P < 0.01) to P intake. Most of the P excretion was fecal P averag-ing 88.7% of total excretion. With theexception of steers fed the 0.12% Pdiet with very little (0.50 g/day) uri-nary P, steers fed the other treatmentdiets excreted an average 2.1 g/day viathe urine. These data suggest that Pintake is positively correlated to Pexcretion and diet P concentration mayimpact route of excretion.

In the diets the P source wasinorganic phosphate which wassupplied with the substitution ofmonosodium phosphate for fineground corn as part of the supple-ment. The source of P in the LOWP,CORN, and DDGS diets was or-ganic in the form of phytate. Steerswere fed ad libitum once daily at0700 and were allowed to adapt todiets for 16 days followed by a 5-day collection period. Chromic ox-ide was daily (0600 and 1700) for thefinal eight days of every collectionperiod. A funnel system was used to col- lect total urine for the final five daysof the collection period. Urine col-lection containers were drainedthree times daily (0600, 1200, and1700 hours), urine volume wasrecorded and a 45 ml sub-samplewas taken. Urine samples werefrozen and later analyzed for urineP concentration using a commercialkit (Diagnostic Chemicals Limited). Fecal samples were collected three times daily (0600, 1200, and1700 hours) and dried in a 60\u00b0Cforced air oven. They were com-posited by collection period andground through a 1 mm screenusing a Wiley mill. They werestored and later analyzed for chro-mium, nitrogen, and P concentra-tion. Diet and ingredient sampleswere taken daily during the lasteight days of the collection periodand composited by collectionperiod for analysis. Compositesamples were dried using a 60\u00b0Cforced air oven and ground, thenanalyzed for P concentration. Results Dry matter intake and phospho- rus excretion data are shown inTable 2. There were no significanttreatment differences in DMI (P > 0.10). Average intake for all treatments was 21.5 lb/day. The Pintakes were 10.5, 26.7, Route of excretion did appear to be related to P intake. Steers fed theLOWP excreted very little urinary Pand less ( P < 0.01) than all other treatments. However, urinary Pexcretion was variable, but similaron the other treatments. Based onprevious research, only smallamounts of P are excreted in theurine; however, an average of 2.1g/day was excreted by steers on allother treatments except LOWP.Fecal excretion of P was signifi-cantly different ( P = 0.07) among treatments. Therefore, total P excre-tion (fecal and urinary P combined)was different ( P = 0.04) across treat- ments. Figure 1 depicts the relationship between P intake and P excretion.As expected, when more P is fed,more is excreted. P intake and Pexcretion were significantly andpositively correlated (r = 0.67). FromFigure 1, the intercept (3.1 g/day)depicts the predicted maintenancerequirement or the P excreted whenno P is consumed by cattle. Com-paring this calculated maintenancerequirement to 1996 NRC equationsfor 850 lb steers, the estimatedmaintenance requirement is greater(6.2 g/day) than calculated valuesin this study. One point, however,is quite high with an animal con-suming 50 g/day of P and excreting42 g/day. If that data point isremoved, the calculated mainte-nance requirement is 7.5 g/day;however, the relationship is not asstrong with this animal removed. Digestibility data are shown in Table 3. There were no differences(P > 0.10) in either organic matter digestibility (OMD) or dry matterdigestibility (DMD). Phosphorusdigestibility was influenced by with the lowest digestibility withsteers fed LOWP. The remainingtreatments P digestibility was notdepressed at higher P intakes. As the P concentration of the diet increased, so did the amount of Pthat was excreted. Most of the Pexcreted is in the feces whereaslittle P is excreted in the urine.Reducing the dietary P in feedlotrations by eliminating supplemen-tal P can reduce the amount of Pexcreted. This will increase the N:Pratio and reduce the amount of Pentering fields. Eliminating Psupplementation is supported byprevious research ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 49-51; 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 45-48) which has shown that feeding levels as low as0.17% P (DM basis) to calf-fedheifers and steers has no adverseeffects on cattle performance. Feed-ing P levels as low as 0.14% P toyearling steers ( 1996 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 78-80) did not affect per- formance. Eliminating supplemen-tal P from corn or corn/by-productdiets will reduce the amount of Pexcreted while maintaining cattleperformance. It is still unclear howamount or route of excretion mayinfluence solubility of P. Recentresearch in dairy cattle suggeststhat soluble P may be increased asdietary P (and P excretion) isincreased. Presumably, the greaterthe solubility of P, the greater thepotential for manure P challengesin runoff. This experiment will beanalyzed in the future to assesssolubility of P with these differentdiets. 1Bobbi Gene Geisert, graduate student, Galen E. Erickson, Klopfenstein, professor,and Matt K.

Corn steep is a by-product of the wet corn milling industry and hasbeen shown to have a higher energyvalue than dry rolled corn (DRC). Itis a combination of both distillerssolubles and steep liquor. The opti-mal inclusion level of steep in fin-ishing diets was determined to be15% of diet DM, when bran wasalso included in the diet at 15% or30% ( 1998 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 69-71). Feed efficiency was im-proved 9.3% when steers were fed acombination of bran and steep.Steep and bran are normally com-bined in the production of wet corngluten feed, which is becoming acommon feed in feedlot diets. Theobjectives of this study were toevaluate the effect on cattle perfor-mance and N mass balance ofreplacing DRC with corn bran andcorn steep in finishing diets.Procedure Cattle Performance In the first experiment (WINTER), 128 steer calves (693 + 29 lb) were fed 167 days, fromNovember 2002 to April 2003, andin the second experiment (SUM-MER), 256 yearling steers (806 + 31 lb) were fed for 126 days, from Mayto September 2003. Steers werestratified by weight and assignedrandomly to one of four dietarytreatments. The control (CON) diet was for- mulated to provide a typical dryrolled corn-based diet (Table 1).Corn bran then replaced DRC at30% diet DM (30/0), similar to pre-vious studies ( 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 54-57, 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 54-58). Bran and steep replaced DRC and molasses at 30%and 15% (DM basis), respectivelyKristi M. Sayer J. Klopfenstein Kyle J. Vander PolCasey N. Macken 1 Summary Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of decreasing diges-tibility of a finishing diet by replacingdry rolled corn (DRC) with corn bran,or a combination of corn bran andsteep, on cattle performance and nitro-gen mass balance in open feedlots.Replacement of DRC with bran had noimpact on performance when steep wasincluded in the finishing diets at 15%DM. Feeding bran and steep, in com-bination, was an effective means ofreducing N losses in winter, as well asmaintaining cattle performancethroughout the year. Introduction Less than 15% of dietary nitro- gen (N) is retained by feedlot cattle(1996 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp 74-77). The other 85% is excretedand can be lost by volatilization. Byincreasing the amount of carbon inthe manure, it is possible to trapmore N in manure and thus volatil-ize less N. One way to increase the amount of organic matter (OM) in themanure is to increase the amount ofhind gut fermentation by loweringdiet digestibility ( 1996 Nebraska Beef Report , pp 74-77). Corn bran is a highly digestible fiber source that iseffective in increasing the amountof OM and trapping more N inmanure. N losses were reduced by20.4% in winter, when bran wasincluded at 30% diet DM; however,feed efficiency was reduced by Table 1.

For both trials, feed refusals were collected and sampled. Pens werecleaned approximately every 28days during the WINTER and every42 days during the SUMMER.Manure was piled on the cementapron, sampled, weighed and thenpiled in windrows in the compostyard. Feed sources were sampled monthly and analyzed for ash, CP,and DM content. N intake was cal-culated based on analyzed dietaryN sources, multiplied by DMI andcorrected for feed refusals. Retainedsteer N was calculated using theenergy and protein equation foundin the NRC (1996). N excretion wasdetermined by subtracting N reten-tion from N intake. The DM digest-ibility of the CON was Nebraska Beef Cattle Report,pp 39-41. Total N loss was calculated on a lb/steer basis. Excreted N minusrunoff N and manure N equals totalN lost. The percentage of N lost wascalculated as N lost divided by Nexcreted. All data were analyzedusing the PROC MIXED proceduresin SAS.

DM intake,ADG, and feed/gain were calcu-lated.Nutrient Balance The WINTER experiment was conducted using 16 open feedlotpens with a stocking density of 344ft 2 per steer and 8 steers per pen. When rainfall occurred, runoff wascollected in retention ponds belowthe pens. Precipitation amount wasmeasured using a rain gauge, andthe effluent was drained and quan-tified using an air bubble flowmeter (ISCO, Lincoln, Nebraska).Samples of the effluent were col-lected and analyzed for DM, OM,and total N content. The SUMMER experiment was conducted using 24 open feedlotpens. Sixteen of the pens were thesame pens used in the WINTERexperiment. The other 8 pens had16 steers per pen, with a stockingdensity of 328 ft 2 per steer. Runoff collection was similar to the (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 56Table 4.

Cattle on the CON diet had lower DMI then those on had lower ( P < 0.05) feed conversions than other treatments(Table 3); however, when corn steepwas added to the diet, feed conver-sions were similar to the CON.These data support the theory thatsteep helps cattle maintain perfor-mance when bran is included in thediet, possibly because of the addi-tional energy provided by steep. Nutrient Balance Manure N content was higher from cattle on the 30/0, 30/15, and45/15 diets ( P < 0.05) than manure N from the CON fed cattle (Table 4).The 45/15 treatments had the low-est (P < 0.05) percentage of N lost and had the highest amount of OMremoved from the pen floor. This issimilar to what has been observedin previous research ( 1996 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp 74-77). The 45/15 treatments reduced N lossesby 43.9%, when compared to theCON diet ( P < 0.05). During the SUMMER trial (Table 5), no differences were detected inthe percentage of N lost amongtreatments (averaging 60.1%).Manure N content and the amountof OM removed from the pen werehigher for the by-product diets thanthe CON diet ( P < 0.05). Temperature and moisture both affect the amount of N volatilized.During the WINTER trial, thetemperature averaged 33.9 oF, with only 3.74 inches of rainfall; how-ever, the SUMMER trial averaged69.4 oF, with 12.20 inches of rainfall. The higher N losses during theSUMMER can be attributed to thesehigher temperatures and possiblyto the higher rainfall. As with otherstudies ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 54-58, 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 54-57), reducing N lossesthrough feeding corn bran andincreasing OM on the pen floorsurface was only effective in theWINTER. Feeding bran and steep, in com- bination, was an effective means ofreducing N losses in winter, as well as maintaining cattle performancethroughout the year. 1Kristi M.

Subsequently,compost as a waste managementsystem has been evaluated by deter-mining costs of composting andspreading, nutrient recoveries dur-ing composting and yield impactsfrom compost amendment soil.Research progress reports havebeen provided in previous beefreports ( 1996 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 77-79; 1997 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 88-91; 2001 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 92-95). Composting occurred in wind- rows during the summer months(May to October) and was depen-dent on manure supply and timing.After windrows were formed,samples were from ran-dom locations. Compost was con-sidered finished when windrowsno longer produced heat two toseven days after turning. After com-plete composting, windrows wereagain sampled. Samples werecomposited by time and by wind-row and analyzed for DM, OM, N(nitrogen), P (phosphorus), K(potassium) and most mineral ele-ments. Nitrogen recoveries werecalculated using total ash as aninternal marker and the followingequation: Nitrogen recovery = 100 x [ (% ash before \u00f7 % ash after) x (% N after \u00f7 % N before)] . The reductions in manure weight with compostingalso were evaluated in a similarmanner using total ash as a markerfor DM. Weight reduction percent-age was the reduction in as-isweight over the entire compostingperiod divided by the as-is weightbefore. Weights before compostingwere calculated as follows: As-isweight before = [((DM weight after (lb) x % after) \u00f7 % ash before)) \u00f7 %DM before] . Ash and N concentra- tions on a DM basis were used inboth calculations. Since 1993, approximately 1600 acres received compost. Fields werechosen based on a Bray P-1 soilphosphorus test result less than 15ppm as the critical soil test valueand the availability of compost. In1999 compost application wasincreased to 20 tons/acre (as is).Check strips were maintained inlarge scale production fields byGPS/GIS technology to ensure stripidentity and integrity. No-tillagecropping systems were utilized inall research and compost was notincorporated. Yield data have been collected and summarized for compost pro-duced from 1999 to 2003. Totalweight from check strips was col-lected in a 550-bu Brent (model 672)grain cart equipped with J-star loadcells or measured by truck scale. (Continued on next page)Casey B. Wilson Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein Walker Luedtke Mark A. Schroeder1 Summary Crop yields were measured using no-compost check strips in large-scaleproduction fields to determine theimpact one-time significantly increased yields.Altering the application rate from 0 to20 to 40 ton per acre did not signifi-cantly increase grain yield. However,all yields made biological improve-ments under irrigated conditions whencompost was added. Introduction Managing manure and its nutri- ent content is increasingly impor-tant for agricultural producers.Numerous projects have been initi-ated at the University of Nebraskato help producers handle the chal-lenges of managing manure, andalso the costs associated with nutri-ent management. The primary focusof this article is to summarize com-post characteristics and averageyield responses from a one-timecompost application to irrigatedcorn and soybeans or dryland cornand soybeans.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 58When weighing capability was unavailable, yields were deter-mined by calibrated yield monitorsfrom grain combines. Fields weremanaged similarly in terms of crop,variety or hybrid, irrigation , N fer-tilization and planting/harvestingdates. No commercial P wasapplied. Compost was applied inwinter after soybean harvest andbefore corn planting. To account for variation from field to field, field and composttreatments were included in theyield model for all compost treat-ments. All fields were maintainedon an or a non-irrigated,no-till corn-soybean rotation. Yielddifferences were analyzed withineach crop by year from applicationtime, whether one, two or threeyears from compost amendment,using the MIXED procedure in SAS. An additional study was initi- ated in 1999 (Study 2) to evaluateapplying compost at different ratesto evaluate yield response in an irri-gated corn-soybean rotation. Com-post was applied at one of threerates: 0, 20 or 40 ton/acre (as is).Treatments in the rate study wereapplied to 16-row strips in largeproduction fields with five replica-tions per application rate. Compostapplication and grain yield wereconducted in the same manner asdescribed above. Data were ana-lyzed within each crop by year fromapplication time and predeter-mined contrasts were made to com-pare application rates using theMIXED procedure of SAS. Results Compost Characteristics Nitrogen concentration is usu- ally an indicator of compost qualityand soil contamination. Nitrogencontent of feedlot compost is gener-ally lower in years accompanied bymuddy and wet conditions ( 1996 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp 77- 79); however, the four yearsreported here were accompanied by minimal soil contamination. Compost analyses are reported in Table 1. Averaged across fouryears, finished feedlot compost con-tained 18.4 lb of N, 11.4 lb of P and26.5 lb of K per ton of DM. Dry mat-ter concentration averaged 77.1%.Therefore, 14.2 lb of N, 8.8 lb of Pand 20.4 lb of K were produced perton of as-is compost. Converting Pto P 2O5 basis leads to 20.2 lb of P2O5 per ton of as-is compost from the feedlot. Converting K to K2O ba- sis leads to 31.9 lb of K2O per ton of as-is compost from the feedlot. Us-ing the average N concentration of14.2 lb of N, the value of N is $3.02per ton (as-is) assuming N is pricedat $0.212 per lb (NH 3 = $350 per ton equivalent, based on 2004 prices).Similar calculations for P suggestthe value of P is $5.92 per ton (as-is)assuming $0.293 lb P 2O5 (18-46-0 = $270 per ton equivalent).During composting, energy is required in the form of carbon(organic matter) to maximize Nrecovery. Therefore, a critical mea-sure in manure is the (C:N) 25:1 orgreater. The consequences of lowC:N ratios are greater N losses.Table 1 contains N recovery rangesfor feedlot compost in these studies.N recovery was variable but rangedfrom 60% to 90%, which suggeststhat the majority of N is trans-formed from inorganic N to organicN. Once applied, organic N shouldbe more stable than that in manureand eventually will be used by thegrowing crops. Calculated weight reduction per- centages show an average reduc-tion of 15.5% of initial manureweight. This is a sizeable reductionin weight to be handled andTable 1.

In subsequent years, the impact ofadding compost was not statisti-cally significant. Based on theresults in Table 3, compost treat-ment numerically increased dry-land corn yields in the first andthird years; however, variation fromyear to year was probably due toprecipitation differences. With vari-able yields due to weather effectsduring different years, benefits dueto compost application were notdistinguishable. Biologically, average yield increase (Table3) with dryland corn over threeyears would be important. If yield isincreased 6.6 bushels due to com-post treatment, then gross income isincreased by $45.50 (6.6 bushels x 3 yrs x 2.30 per bushel) . With non-irrigated soybeans, compost treatment did not result instatistical differences in yield(Table 3) when compared with theno-compost treatment. Overall,compost application to drylandsoybeans showed reduced yields of1% (0.51 bushels). Only five fieldswere used to measure dryland soy-bean yields in the three years fol-lowing application. Yield variationwith dryland soybeans was greaterthan with irrigated soybean. Theincreased variation in dryland situ-ations is presumably related to pre-cipitation differences and thesubsequent impact of weather onyields. This variation is similarwhen corn is grown on drylandacres. Level of Application Applying compost at 20 or 40 ton/acre showed no significantyield response with irrigated cornor soybeans (Table 4). However,both corn and soybeans show anumerical increase in yield in allfour years following compost addi-tion. Average yield increase overno-added-compost for years oneand three for irrigated corn was2.8% and 4.0% for 20 and 40 ton/acre respectively. Similar increasesTable 3.

Crop Yields and BenefitsIrrigated Adding compost to irrigated acres improved ( P < 0.10) yields in the first, second and third years fol-lowing application (Table 2). Yieldswere increased by 8.4 bushels,which was 3.7% the first year withirrigated corn, 1.1 bushels or 1.8%for soybeans in year 2 and 14.7bushels or 6.3% with irrigated cornin year 3. The improvements inyield in the first two years follow-ing application are in agreementwith previous Nebraska research(2001 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 92- 95) 10 ton/acre (as-is) com-post was applied. The responsewith irrigated corn third yearis unexpected. Further researchincluding more replications isnecessary to validate the increase in year 3. Assuming a 11.6 bushel increase in corn yield in year 1 and 3 (basedon overall average response) and a1.1 bushel increase in soybeanyields in year 2, the compost treat-ment increased gross returns by$59.74. This assumes an average(10-year) corn price of $2.30 perbushel and a soybean price of $5.80per bushel. If application costsaverage $2.50 per ton (based on pre-vious calculations; 1997 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 88-91), then total spreading costs are $50 per acre if20 ton per acre is applied. In thissituation the increased return overthree years covered the applicationcosts. Non-Irrigated Adding compost to non-irrigated corn acres increased ( P > 0.001) yields by 17.6 bushels or 12.5% in2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 60were measured for soybeans in years two and four with 2.7% and3.0% for 20 and 40 ton/acre respec-tively. The potential benefit fromcompost addition with increasedrates from 20 and 40 ton/acre maybe the yield increase in subsequentyears. The increase in gross incomefrom the first four years with theirrigated corn and soybean rotationin this study is $42.62 with anapplication rate of 20 ton/acre. In summary, yields were signifi- cantly increased when compostwas applied to irrigated corn, irri-gated soybeans and dryland cornin Study 1. Because N fertilizationwas not reduced in the composttreated strips, the increases inyields and income were over andabove the yields from crops receiv-ing the recommended N fertilizerrates based on soil tests. Theeconomic returns were greatest for corn, however, in our calculationsapplication costs were only recov-ered at the 20 ton/acre rate withirrigated crops in Study 1. Further-more, costs associated with com-posting or the value of nutrients incompost were not included in thesestudies nor were the costs associ-ated with manure disposal. first, second, third after application ( 2001 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 89-92). This slow release of N may be one of thepotential benefits of compost appli-cation and aid in long-term eco-nomic returns. Because N fertilization was held constant, we conclude that theyield response is probably dueto P, but other nutrients may haveinfluenced yield. Whether yield improvements resulted from addedP, OM, K, or other nutrients is notknown, only that there is a benefitfrom one or a combination of these. The continued yield response with compost addition in Study 2demonstrates the need to evaluatecompost addition over a longertime. The continued nutrient pay-out of compost and increased appli-cation rates may improve long-termyields, however, further research isneeded to document the benefit. 1Casey B.

Mostrecently, research has focused onidentifying and scientifically test-ing easily implemented on-farmintervention strategies to control thecarriage and shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in feces of feedlot cattle.Previous research at Nebraska(Potter et al., Vaccine 2004) foundthat cattleagainst Type III secretory proteinsof Escherichia coli O157:H7 reduced the probability of fecal shedding ofthe organism by 59%. In that studycattle were vaccinated three timesat three-week intervals. Currentfeedlot practices make a three-vaccination treatment protocolchallenging to implement. How-ever, vaccinating cattle once atreimplant, or twice, once at initialprocessing and again at reimplant,would be much easier to implementinto current feedlot practices. There-fore, an experiment was conductedto evaluate the effects of varying thenumber of doses of a commerciallyprepared vaccine on the probabilitythat cattle shed E. coli O157:H7 in feces. Procedure The clinical trial was conducted during summer (May - September)of 2003 at the University ofNebraska Beef Research Feedlot atIthaca, Nebraska. Four-hundred-eighty medium-weight steers were stratified by weight and assignedrandomly to 60 pens (8 head/pen)and to one of four vaccinationtreatments (2 head/treatment)within a pen. Steers were blockedinto four groups based on replica-tion of dietary treatment. Dietarytreatments are summarized in aseparate report ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 28-30). Vaccine (2 ml/dose) was administered sub-cutaneously in the neck using an18 ga x 5/8-inch needle. Vaccina-tion treatments included: 1) no vac-cination; 2) vaccinated once atre-implant (day 42); 3) vaccinatedupon arrival (day 0) and again atre-implant (day 42); and 4) vacci-nated on arrival (day 0), at day 21,and again at re-implant (day 42).An additional 128 steers wereassigned to 12 pens and two studyblocks within the same feedlot toserve as unvaccinated external con-trols. Blocking criteria for externalcontrols was steers per pen (8 headin 8 pens; 16 head in 4 pens). Steerswere fed for an average of 138 daysand each steer was sampled by rec-tal fecal grab every three weeks ofthe feeding period, resulting in onepre-treatment period (day 0), twointerim periods (day 21, day 42),and four test-period samplings(days 63, 84, 105, and 126).

Vaccination effectively reducedthe proportion of feedlot cattle shed-ding O157 in the feces, the effect wasdose-responsive, and vaccinationwithin a pen conferred protection tounvaccinated pen-mates (herd-immunity). Introduction Escherichia coli O157:H7 has been a pathogen of concern to the beefindustry for two decades. Becausecattle represent a significant reser-voir of E. coli O157:H7, a great deal of research has been conducted atthe University of Nebraska to deter-2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 62the same test period on consecutive days for vaccinated and externalcontrol pens. All fecal samples were taken immediately to the UNL E. coli lab and analyzed for presence of E. coli O157:H7 using procedures previ-ously described ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 67-68) with modifica- tions. The odds of a treated animal shedding E. coli O157:H7 was com- pared to that of unvaccinated con-trol cattle within the pen andcontrol cattle in the external pens,accounting for repeated measures,block, and pen using the GENMODprocedure of SAS. Adjusted oddsratios (OR) were converted to rela-tive risk (RR) using marginal prob-abilities for prevalence andvaccination. Vaccine efficacy wascalculated as (1-RR). Feedlot perfor-mance was evaluated using theMIXED procedure of SAS account-ing for block and pen. Becausetreatments were assigned to ani-mals within a pen, only weightsand average daily gain (ADG) canbe reported for the direct effect ofvaccination treatment. Results E. coli Results In total, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered from 845 of 4253 cultureobservations (20%) from cattle intreated and external control pens.During pre-treatment samplingperiod, the proportion of cattleshedding E. coli O157:H7 within the 60 treated pens was 45% andwas not different ( P > 0.10) for ani- mals allocated to different vaccinetreatments. The proportion of cattleshedding E. coli O157:H7 among the external control pens was 30.5%during the same test period andwas significantly lower ( P < 0.05) than treated pens; however, the pro-portion of cattle shedding E. coli O157:H7 among the external con-trol pens was higher ( P < 0.05) than treated pens throughout theremainder of the study (Figure 1).Table 1.

There was no interaction betweenvaccination and test periods four toseven. During test periods four toseven cattle in pens receiving one,two, or three doses of vaccine wereless likely to shed E. coli O157:H7 than cattle in pens not receivingvaccine (OR=0.33; P=0.0008) \u2014 a vaccine efficacy of 59%. Vaccineefficacy of receiving one, two, orthree doses of vaccine was 52%,58%, and 68%, respectively(P < 0.01 for each, Figure 2), com- pared with cattle in pens not receiv-ing vaccine. Unvaccinated cattle inpens receiving vaccine treatmentswere also less likely to shed E. coli O157:H7 than cattle in pens notreceiving vaccine (OR=0.42,P=0.02). Compared to unvaccinatedcattle within the pens receiving vaccine treatments, the odds ofshedding E. coli O157:H7 decreased as cattle received one, two, or threedoses of vaccine (OR=0.94, 0.82,and 0.59 respectively). Cattle receiv-ing three doses of vaccine were 35%less likely to shed E. coli O157:H7 than unvaccinated cattle in thesame pen ( P=0.06) during the post- treatment period. Finishing Performance Least squares means for finish- ing performance measures are pre-sented in Table 1. There were nodifferences ( P > 0.10) in finishing performance for steers receivingone, two, or three doses of vaccinecompared with unvaccinated steerswithin the same pen. These cattleagainst Type III secretory proteinsof enterohemorrhagic Escherichiacoli will have no measurable impact on finishing performance. In conclusion vaccine efficacy improved with the number of dosesadministered, and vaccinating amajority of cattle within a penoffered a significant protective effect(herd immunity) to non-vaccinatedcattle within the same pen. cattleagainst Type III secretory proteinsof enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli had no detrimental effects on finishing performance. Vaccinationappears to be a promising pre-harvest intervention strategy for thecontrol of E. coli O157:H7. 1Robert E. Peterson, research technician; Dave R.

Folmer et al. ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 67-68) reported that over five test periods theprobability for control steers to shedE. coli O157:H7 averaged 21.3%; whereas, the probability for steerstreated with the DFM (NPC 747;Nutrition Physiology Corp.) to shedE. coli O157:H7 was only 13.3%. How- ever, this response, though seeminglymeaningful, was not statistically sig-nificant ( P = 0.21). The purpose of this study was to continue evaluating theeffects of feeding a DFM by extendingthe trial another year to increase thepower of the study by doubling thetotal number of observations. Procedure Four-hundred-forty-eight medium-framed steer calves wereused in a feedlot finishing experi-ment during the summers (May-September) of 2002 and 2003. In2002, steers were blocked into threeweight groups and stratified byweight within block and assignedrandomly into 24 pens (8 steers/pen). Pens within each block wereassigned randomly to one of twotreatments. Treatments includedDFM supplementation (NPC 747;Nutrition Physiology Corp.) The diet dry matter compositionwas direct-fed microbial). In 2003,steers were blocked into twogroups, stratified by weight and assigned randomly to 24 pens andone of four dietary treatments ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-56). The two DFM DFM prod-uct was mixed with water andapplied to the feed truck mixing boxand fed at a rate of 1x10 9 colony forming units (CFUs)/steer/day.Steers were fed once daily. The con-trol steers were fed with a controlfeed truck; DFM-treated steers werefed with a separate feed truck toprevent cross contamination. Steerswere weighed on two consecutivedays at the start of the experimentafter a three-day period of limit-feeding to equalize gut fill. In 2002and 2003, steers were fed for an av-erage of 121 and 127 days, respec-tively. In 2002, steers were sampledone block per week in three-weekexperimental periods, resulting inone pre-treatment sampling andfive experimental periods. In 2003,steers were sampled in one blockper day on two consecutive daysevery three weeks, resulting in onepre-treatment sampling and sixexperimental periods. Rectal fecalgrab samples were obtained fromeach steer in each period. All fecal samples were taken immediately to the UNL E. coli lab and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O157:H7 using procedures previ- ously described ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 67-68) with modifications.

Klopfenstein David R. Smith Jeffrey D. Folmer Galen E. Erickson Susan Hinkley Rodney A. Moxley 1 Summary A clinical trial was conducted during the summers of 2002 and 2003 to evalu-ate the effect of a direct-fed microbialproduct (DFM) on the prevalence of E.coli O157:H7 in feces of feedlot steers.The DFM consisted of Lactobacillus aci-dophilus (NPC 747) fed at the rate of1x10 9 colony forming units (CFUs) per head per day. Treatments included supple-mental DFM or no supplemental DFM.Feedlot steers supplemented with DFMwere 35% less likely to shed E. coliO157:H7 in the feces compared withsteers that were not supplemented withthe DFM. Finishing performance wasnot affected by adding a intothe ration. Introduction Bacteria used as direct-fed micro- bial products (DFM) have been definedas single or mixed cultures of liveorganisms, which, when fed to ani-mals, beneficially affect the host(Krehbiel et al., 2003). Additionally,preliminary research from Nebraska,as well as other institutions, hasshown that feeding a Lactobacillus - based DFM will decrease fecal shed-ding of E. coli O157:H7 without detrimental effects on performance(2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 67-68, Brashers et al., 2003 J. Food Prot., Younts-Dahl et al., 2004 J. Food Prot. ). Because E. coli O157:H7 has emerged as an important food borne pathogen,Page 65 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportinterest. For proportion of culture positive animals per pen, the oddsfor a DFM-supplemented pen ofcattle was compared with pens ofcattle that were not supplementedwith the DFM, accounting forrepeated measures, year, and block.Odds ratios (OR) were converted torelative risk (RR) using marginalprobabilities for prevalence andDFM treatment. Treatment efficacywas calculated as (1-RR). Feedlotperformance was evaluated statisti-cally using the MIXED procedure ofSAS accounting for year and block.Average daily gain (ADG), dry mat-ter intake (DMI), and ADG:DMI isreported by DFM treatment. Results E. coli Results The probability of recovering E. coli O157:H7 from the feces of steers, by treatment and year issummarized in Figure 1. In 2002,the probability of recovering E. coli O157:H7 from the feces of steerssupplemented with DFM was 13%. The probability of recovering E. coli O157:H7 from feces of steers notsupplemented with DFM was 21%.In 2003, the probability of recover-ing E. coli O157:H7 from feces of steers supplemented with DFM was21%. The prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces of steers notsupplemented with the DFM prod-uct was 28%. The probability ofrecovering E. coli O157:H7 from the feces differed ( P < 0.05) between 2002 and 2003, however there wasno interaction ( P > 0.10) between DFM treatment and year. The DFMtreated steers were 35% less likely(P = 0.002) to shed E. coli O157:H7 in the feces than steers in untreatedpens over the course of the feedingperiods of the two years. Theseresults confirm the benefits of usingthis DFM product as a pre-harvestfood safety intervention tool. Finishing Performance There was no interaction between DFM treatment and yearfor any of the finishing performance outcomes; therefore, only effects ofDFM treatment on performance arepresented (Table 1). Supplementa-tion of the DFM product had noeffect ( P > 0.10) on ADG, DMI, or ADG:DMI. We observed a 2%improvement in ADG:DMI(P = 0.13) when cattle were supple- mented with the DFM product.Although not significant, a might beexpected, and meaningful, whensupplementing a DFM product inthe ration. The true effect of DFM oncattle performance is unclear. In areview of six research trials(n=1,249 cattle), Krehbiel et al.,(2003, Journal of Animal Science that combinationsof acid- and might improvegrowth by 2.6%. However, in alarge scale commercial finishingstudy (n=3,539 steers and heifers),Greenquist et al. (K-state Cattle-men's reported supple-mentation of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii had no measurable impact ongrowth performance. In our clinicaltrial only the Lactobacillus acidophi- lus was fed. In conclusion, supplementing feedlot cattle with 1x10 9 CFUs/ steer/day of Lactobacillus acidophilus significantly reduced fecal shed-ding of E. coli O157:H7. Addition- ally, we observed a non-significantimprovement (2%) in ADG:DMI.These data suggest feeding a Lacto- bacillus acidophilus product is an effective pre-harvest interventioncontrol for reducing E. coli O157:H7 and further research should beconducted to determine theproduct's effects on growth perfor-mance. 1Robert E.

Inaddition, Cooper et al.

In terms of carcass finish, Brethour ( 2000 Journal of Animal Sci- ence, 78:2005) utilized serial ultra- sound measurements to estimatedevelopment of 12 th rib back-fat thickness. Results indicated 25% ofcattle were fed too long and another25% were not fed long enough. Objectives of this research were to compare the performance andfeedlot economics of sorting steersby feedlot initial BW to an unsortedcontrol in a long yearling produc-tion system. Procedures Yearling Steer Development Two experiments were con- ducted over a two-year period. Inthe fall of each year 200 steer calveswere purchased. One hundredsteers each were placed into one oftwo different long yearling steerproduction systems. The systemsare described in another article(Folmer et al., 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 68-72). Sorting In both systems, after their re- spective summer grazing periods,steers were weighed and stratifiedinto two BW groups of 50 steers,with equal average initial BW,variation, and standard deviation.Then steers in the sorting treatment were assigned to a group by divid-ing the steers into one of two repli-cations. Steers were then put intoone of three sort groups: heavy sorttreatment contained 12 steers or 6steers per replication, middle sorttreatment contained 26 steers or 13steers per replication, light sorttreatment contained 12 steers or 6steers per replication, and the un-sorted control contained 50 steersor 25 steers per replication. Steers inthe unsorted control were fed for anaverage of 91 days. Steers in theheavy sort group were fed for an av-erage of 77 days and were marketedtwo weeks prior to the unsortedcontrol steers. Because the heavieststeers were removed, the middlesort group were fed an average of98 days and marketed one week af-ter unsorted controls. Steers in thelight sort group were fed for an av-erage 112 days and were marketedthree weeks later than the unsortedcontrols. Economic Analysis Feedlot finishing economics were based on a finishing diet costof $115.38/ton (DM; using 10-yearaverage prices for ingredients) anddays Feedlot in price was$76.21/cwt for 900-1000 lb steersand was calculated from 7-yearaverage July to September(Feuz and Burgener, 2004 Univer- sity of Nebraska ($70.08/cwt) was calculatedfrom monthsof September through 04-21). Feedlot break-even was calculated by divid-ing total cost by the final live BW.Live profit or loss was calculated bysubtracting the live break-even fromJeffrey D. Folmer Casey N. Macken Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein 1 Summary Four groups of long yearling steers were used to evaluate the effect of sortingby feedlot initial body weight on perfor-mance and feedlot economic variablesduring the feeding period. Steers weresorted into the lightest 25%, middle 50%,and heaviest 25%, along with a non-sorted control. Steers were marketed bysort treatment: heavy two weeks prior,middle one week after, and light threeweeks after the unsorted control steers.Sorting did not affect dry matter intake,average daily gain, marbling, 12 th rib fat thickness, USDA yield and qualitygrades, or economic analysis; however,sorting did increase days on feed, feedlotfinal BW, and hot carcass weight. Introduction Yearling production systems can be plagued with overweight car-casses because cattle are larger atarrival and perform well during fin-ishing. MacDonald et al. ( 2003 Ne- braska Beef Report, pp.65-68) utilized a two-way sorting system to sortyearling steers to decrease over-weight carcasses and increase car-cass uniformity. While in theirstudy, overweight carcasses werenot reduced, sorting did result inincreased carcass uniformity. How-ever, there was no increase in over-all carcass weight or profitability.In addition, MacDonald et al. ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 61-65) found the best correlation (r = .83)to predict the final BW of long year-ling feedlot fed steers was feedlotinitial BW compared to winter ini-tial BW and grass initial BW. Cooper et al. ( 1999 Nebraska BeefPage 67 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportthe 7-year average price. In addition to live sale econom- ics, a marketing grid profitabilityanalysis was performed. Based onthree different carcass grid-pricingscenarios, profit or loss for eachtreatment on each grid was calcu-lated. The analysis used three dif-ferent grids, consisting of aquality-rewarding grid, a yield-rewarding grid, and a commoditygrid, as proposed by Feuz ( 2002 Nebraska Beef Report pp.39-41). Pre- miums and discounts for each gridare reported in another article(Folmer et al., 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 68-72). Profitability was calculated from a 7-year average(Feuz Univer- sity ($112.27 /cwt) with indi-vidual grid premiums and dis-counts applied. Grid profit or losswas calculated from a carcass break- even calculated as with live break-even, with hot carcass weight insteadof final BW as the multiplier. Results Performance Steer performance results are presented in Table 1. Initial BW forthe feedlot phase was not different(P = 0.39), however feedlot final BW was significantly greater ( P < 0.01) for sorted steers (1378 lb) comparedto unsorted control steers (1352 = 0.18), feed conversion ( P = 0.49), and daily gain ( P = 0.86) did not differ between sorting treatments. Due tothe nature of the marketing strategy,days on feed increased from 92days for the unsorted control com-pared to 98 days for sorted steers.Steer carcass characteristics are pre- sented in Table 2. Carcasses ofsteers in the unsorted control andsorted treatments did not differ inUSDA yield grade ( P = 0.50), 12 th rib fat thickness ( P = 0.78), marbling score ( P = 0.60), or ribeye area (P = 0.45). However, due to the increases in ADG and final BW, hotcarcass weight was significantly(P < 0.01) increased by 16 lb for the sorting treatment. Sorting steersalso had no effect on the percentageof USDA choice, select, or yieldgrade 4 and 5 carcasses. However,sorting steers by feedlot initial BWand marketing them accordingly,significantly ( P < 0.01) reduced heavy weight carcasses from 9.1%for the unsorted control steers to1.5% for the sorting treatment. Economics Feedlot economics are summa- rized in Table 3. Due to increaseddays on feed, feedlot yardage andfeed costs increased for the sortedtreatment. Increased costs for thesorting treatment resulted in nodifferences in live breakeven(P = 0.70) or live feedlot profitability (P = 0.62). In addition, the increased costs of the sorting treatment, alongwith no differences in carcasscharacteristics, resulted in no dif-ferences in carcass breakeven(P = 0.70) and no differences in profitability when marketed on thequality rewarding ( P = 0.78), yield rewarding ( P = 0.80), or the com- modity ( P = 0.80) marketing grids. Results of this experiment indicate sorting long yearling steers by initialfeedlot BW may allow for increasedaverage days on feed, and increasedsale weights, while avoiding dis-counts. However, due to an increasein days on feed, and costs incurredwith increased days on feed, sortingdid not translate into an economicadvantage in this study. 1Jeffrey D.

Jordan etal. (2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 25-29) found steers wintered at 1.5lb daily gain had lower slaughterbreakevens than steers wintered at0.5 lb daily gain. The lower break-even was produced by providingsteers daily supplements of 5 lb(DM) of wet corn gluten feed duringthe corn residue grazing and drylotperiod in the winter/spring. Inaddition, Jordan et al. ( 2001 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 41-49) fed seven levels of wet corn gluten feedto steers grazing corn residue.Using breakpoint analysis, steersbegan replacing grazed corn resi-due with wet corn gluten feed whenfed more than 6 lb (DM) daily. Increasing both weight gain and weight at sale should increase theprofitability of the beef productionsystem. In order to accomplish this,intensive management of steersmay be needed. Increased levels ofsupplementation, growth promot-ing implants, short season grazing,and ionophores increase weightgain and ultimately final saleweight. The objectives of this research were 1) to compare animal perfor-mance with our normal yearlingsteer production system to a moreintensive shorter season productionsystem, and 2) to compare the eco-nomic effects of our normal yearlingsteer production system to the moreintensive, shorter season produc-tion system.Procedure Yearling Steer Development Two experiments were con- ducted over a two-year period. Inthe fall of each year, 200 steers werepurchased at weaning and receivedaccording to normal protocols.They were then stratified by weightand assigned to one of two yearlingsteer production systems, each con-taining one hundred steers. Systemone was the normal University ofNebraska yearling production sys-tem. System two was the experi-mental system of intensive wintermanagement and partial seasonsummer grazing. Wintering Period Steers were weaned and man- aged in two groups. Both groupswere allowed to graze corn residuefor about 89 days, from approxi-mately December 1 until March 1.Groups were then placed in drylotfor hay feeding for 49 days untilapproximately April 20. Steers inthe normal system were supple-mented daily with 5 lb (DM) of wetcorn gluten feed during the entirewinter production cycle, whethergrazing corn residue or being fedhay. In order to achieve increased rates of gain, steers in the intensivesystem were supplemented dailywith 6 lb (DM) of wet corn glutenJeffrey D. Folmer Casey N. Macken Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein 1 Summary Two experiments were conducted over two years to evaluate effects oftwo developmental systems on perfor-mance and economics of long yearlingsteer production. Steers were winteredin the normal system with corn residuegrazing and dry lot hay feeding, with5 lb per day wet corn gluten feed as asupplement. Intensively managedsteers were given 6 lb per day wet corngluten feed and implanted withRalgro \u00ae at the beginning of the winter- ing period and Synovex S\u00ae at the be- ginning of the dry lot phase. Inaddition, intensively managed steerswere removed from summer pastureearly. Intensive system steers weremarketed in October and normal sys-tem steers were marketed in Novemberfollowing a finishing period. Economicanalysis indicated a performance andeconomic advantage to the intensivesystem, when marketing the steers afterthe wintering period or after the sum-mer grazing period; however, if steerswere marketed after feedlot finishing,profitability estimates were not differ-ent. Introduction Nebraska research has devel- oped a wintering system thatPage 69 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportfeed. Included in this supplemental wet corn gluten feed was an iono-phore, (Bovatec) fed at 170 mg/head/day. In addition, intensivesteers were implanted at the begin-ning of the winter phase withRalgro \u00ae and at the beginning of the hay-feeding phase with SynovexS \u00ae, while normal steers were not implanted. Summer Period After the wintering period, steers in both groups were weighed,implanted with Revalor \u00ae-G, and allowed to graze brome grass pas-ture from approximately April 20 toMay 15, and then moved to nativeNebraska Sandhills range to grazeuntil their appropriate time ofremoval from pasture. Normal system steers were allowed to graze the entire summerseason until approximately Septem-ber 1 when they were placed onfeed for finishing. To increase sum-mer grazing rates of gain and takeadvantage of higher summer feedercattle markets, intensively managedsteers were removed from summerpasture approximately July 1 whenthey were placed on feed for finish-ing. Feedlot In both years, steers were adapted to the final finishing dietin 17 days days. Thefinal diet (7% roughage; Table 2)was formulated basis). fi-nal finishing diet contained, on adry matter basis, 40% wet corn glu-ten feed, 48% high moisture corn,7% alfalfa hay, and 5% supplement.Our goal in these experiments wasto feed steers in either managementsystem to the same degree of finish. Initial and final weight for all periods of the system were based ontwo-day consecutive weights following five days of limit feeding50% alfalfa and 50% wet corn glu-ten feed fed at 2% of body weight(DM basis). Slaughter weight wascalculated assuming a constantdressing percent (63%). Steers wereharvested at the same commercialabattoir where hot carcass weight,12 th rib fat thickness, rib eye area, USDA yield and quality grade, andmarbling score, were collected fol-lowing a 48-hour carcass chill. Economic Analysis Due to interest charges increas- ing over time, a separate analysisfor each period was necessary. Dif-ferences between systems in inputcosts will be noted; otherwise itshould be assumed that inputswere similar. For all sale pricesincluding initial steer cost, winterending price, grass ending price,and feedlot live marketing price,average weight of a pen was multi-plied by the USDA westernNebraska-eastern Wyoming 10-yearaverage price (Feuz and Burgener,2004 University of Nebraska Coopera-tive Extension Bulletin, PHREC 04- 21). Initial steer cost for lbsteers was $87.04/cwt for themonth of October (Feuz University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension Bulle-tin, PHREC 04-21). Health and pro- cessing for the winter period werecharged at $25 for each system plus$2 for implants, and $1 for the iono-phore feed additive in the intensivesystem. Simple interest wascharged on initial animal cost andhealth for the entire ownershipperiod. All interest charges dis-cussed herein were based on asimple 8.9% rate. The two systems were charged a corn residue-grazing fee of $0.24/head/day during the corn residue-grazing period. Interest wascharged for half of the residue graz-ing period plus the remainder ofownership. Wet corn gluten feedwas charged to each system at acost of $103.00/ton (DM basis;equal to a corn price of $2.44/bu [as-is]) and a mineral supplement($406.00/ton; DM basis) at the rateof 0.11 lb/head/day (DM basis).Interest was charged on wet corngluten feed and mineral supple-ment for half of the corn residuegrazing period and the remainderof the ownership. Grass hay was priced at $40.00/ ton (as-is) and interest was chargedon hay for half of the feeding periodplus the remainder of ownership.Steer sale price for the end of thewintering period was based onwinter end weight for the respectivesystems in the month of April.Intensive system steers were pricedat $72.38/cwt for 800 to 900 lbsteers, and normal steers werepriced at $77.38/cwt for 700 to 800lb steers (Feuz and Burgener, 2004 University of Nebraska CooperativeExtension Bulletin, PHREC 04-21). Winter profit or loss was calculatedby multiplying price by the respec-tive winter final weight minus totalwinter costs for the appropriatetreatment. Grazing period economics were calculated on a grazing day basis.Each group of steers was charged$0.50 per head per day grazing feewhich would include all supple-mental grazing and water costs.Steer sale price for the end of thesummer grazing period was basedon grazing end weight for therespective system and the monththe steers would have been mar-keted. Intensive steers would havebeen marketed in July and wereassigned a sale price of $75.32/cwtfor 900-1000 lb steers, and normaltreatment steers were assigned asale of $76.98/cwt for 900-1000 lb steers for September. Sincethere are only seven years of pricingdata for 900-1000 lb steers, thesefigures were used (Feuz University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension Bulle-tin, PHREC 04-21). Grazing profit or loss was calculated by multiply-ing price by the respective grazingfinal weight minus total costs (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 70including the wintering costs and summer grazing costs. Feedlot finishing economics were based on a finishing diet costof $115.38/ton (DM; using 10-yearaverage prices for ingredients) andindividual system days on feed.Final selling price was adjusted forthe appropriate time of marketing.Feedlot breakeven was calculatedby dividing total cost by the livefinal weight. Live profit or loss wascalculated by subtracting the livebreakeven from the appropriate saleprice for the month of marketing forthe particular system. Intensivesystem steers were marketed inOctober with a 10-year averageprice of $70.09/cwt, and normalsteers average and Burgener,2004 University of NebraskaCooperative Extension Bulletin,PHREC 04-21). In addition to live sale econom- ics, a marketing grid profitabilityanalysis was performed. Based onthree carcass grid-pricing scenarios(Table 1), profitability for each sys-tem on each grid was calculated.The three grids used in this analy-sis, as proposed by Feuz ( 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 39-41), were a quality-rewarding grid, ayield-rewarding grid, and a com-modity grid. Premiums anddiscounts for each grid are summa-rized in Table 1 and profitabilitywas calculated with a base price of$110.40/cwt of hot carcass weightfor steers marketed in Septemberand $112.29/cwt of hot carcassweight for steers marketed inDecember. Premiums and discountswere applied to these base prices.Grid profit or loss was calculatedfrom a carcass breakeven calculatedsimilar to live breakeven with hotcarcass weight instead of finalweight as the multiplier.Table 1.

Fall fed, nor- mally managed steers had anumerically ( P = 0.17) lower feed conversion ratio of 6.78 versus a7.08 ratio for the summer fed inten-sively managed steers. No differ-ences were present in feedlot finalweight, which averaged 1372 lb forthe intensively managed steers ver-sus 1371 lb for the normally man-aged steers. Carcass Characteristics Carcass characteristics for the two groups of steers are summa-rized in Table 4. Equal feedlot finalweight between treatments resultedin equal average hot carcassweights for the two treatmentgroups of 864 lb. Steers in the twosystems had an average of 0.45inches of 12 th rib fat thickness. In addition USDA yield grade did notdiffer between treatments withintensively managed steers havingan average yield grade of 2.43, withnormally managed steers averaging2.41. Summer fed intensively man-aged steers had an average mar-bling score of 482 and fall fednormally managed steers had anaverage of 510 (400 = Select 0; 500 = Choice0; P = 0.19). Steer Development Economics Economics of winter and sum- mer periods are summarized inTables 5 and 6. Winter feed andhealth costs were significantlygreater for the intensive systemsteers ( P =0.01). This resulted in a significant ( P = 0.03) increase in the total costs. Differences in costs andweights at winter's end resultedin a tendency for a difference(P = 0.08) in the winter breakeven for the two systems. Normal systemsteers had a winter breakeven of$77.69 versus $74.49 for the inten-sive system. This led to signifi-cantly ( P = 0.04) greater profitabilityTable 5.

Results Wintering and Summer Performance Winter and summer performance are summarized in Table 2. Steersmanaged in the intensive systemhad significantly greater dailygains ( P = 0.05) and grass weights (P = 0.058). Intensively managed steers gained 1.96 lb per day, pro-ducing a grass weight of 813 lb.Normally managed steers gained1.66 lb per day which produced agrass of 769 lb. Over the two-year period inten- sively managed steers grazed for anaverage of 78 days and gained 1.98lb per day during the summer.Daily gain was not significantlydifferent for the normally managedsteers, but was numerically lower(1.72 lb per day) while the steersgrazed for an average of 128 days.In addition, normally managedsteers had a numerically greater, but not significantly ( P = 0.15) greater feedlot in weight of 986 lbversus 968 lb for the intensivelymanaged steers. Feedlot Performance Feedlot performance for the two systems is summarized in Table 3.Summer-fed, intensively managedsteers had significantly ( P = 0.04) reduced daily dry matter intakes,consuming 27.8 lb/day (DM), com-pared to normally managed steerswho consumed lb per day.This may be a result of decreasedfeedlot in weight, but more likely isa result of increased summer tem-peratures reducing feed intake.Summer-fed, intensively managedsteers were fed for an average of 103days, while fall fed normally man-aged steers were fed for an averageof 91 days. (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 72for the intensive system. Intensive system steers showed a profit of$8.20 per head while normal sys-tem steers showed a loss of $17.29per head. Due to the effect of time on inter- est costs, significant increases werepresent for normal system steer cost(P = 0.05) and winter yardage cost (P = 0.02). In addition, normal sys- tem grazing costs were greater(P = 0.08) at $64.14 per head versus $38.86 for the intensive system.This resulted in a decreased(P = 0.10) breakeven at the end of the grazing period for the intensivesystem despite the increased weightat the end of the grazing period forthe normal system. Normal systemgrazing breakeven was $69.25 ver-sus $67.81 per head for the inten-sive system. This decreasedbreakeven for the intensive systemresulted in a significant ( P = .05) increase in intensive system profit-ability ($53.88 versus $26.32) for thenormal system. Feedlot Economics Feedlot finishing economics are summarized in Table 7. Feedlot feed(P = 0.09), yardage ( P = 0.20), and total health costs ( P < 0.01), increased in the intensive systemdue to the increased days on feedand winter implants. However, dueto decreased summer grazing days,days of ownership were less in theintensive system. Increased owner-ship days caused increased steerscosts ( P = 0.06) and increased win- ter yardage cost ( P = 0.01) for the normal system. However, total costswere not different between the twosystems. Intensive steers had a totalcost of $897.02 versus $902.79 forthe normal system ( P = 0.40). Similar total steer costs coupled with similar live final weightsTable 7. Feedlot economics for intensive and normally developed steers.

As beexpected, similar breakevens andsimilar live final weight producedsimilar ( P = 0.56) live feedlot profit- ability. As could be expected with simi- lar hot carcass weight and costs,carcass breakeven price was similar(P = 0.55) between treatments. Ana- lyzing the carcass data and market-ing the steers on a grid basis,normal system steers showednumerically greater profitability. Ifsteers were marketed on a quality-rewarding grid, normal steersreturned a profit of $78.76 versus$49.55 per head for the intensivelymanaged steers ( P = 0.27). In addi- tion, if steers were sold on a yield-rewarding grid, normal systemsteers showed a profit of $87.32 ver-sus $62.54 per head for the inten-sive system ( P = 0.27). If steers were sold on a commodity grid, the resultwas the same. Normal system steersresulted in a profit of $77.89 versus$51.16 for the intensive system (P = 0.27). These numerical differ- ences in grid profitability are mostlikely a direct result of the tendency(P = 0.12) for an increase in the per- centage choice in the normal sys-tem. Results of this study indicate intensive management of long year-ling steers can produce greater prof-itability if a producer is going tomarket the steers after the winteringor grazing periods. However, if theproducer is going to finish thesteers in the feedlot, differences inprofitability disappear when sell-ing on a live or carcass basis.Increases in profitability may beachieved with the normal system ifmarketed on a grid due to slight dif-ferences in carcass quality. 1Jeffrey D.

A healthy, unstressedanimal will have a core body tem-perature in the range of 100.4 to103.1 oF, that generally follows a diurnal pattern. Acceptable mea-sures of core body temperature canbe taken in the rectum, vagina, orear canal near the tympanic mem-brane. Technologies are beingdeveloped for continuously moni-toring body temperatures via radio-telemetry, which would allowearlier detection of sick cattle fortreatment and could even be used toidentify time of ovulation in cowsand heifers. The objectives of this trial were to determine the effect of feeding highroughage and high energy diets onbody temperature, and to comparebody temperature measurementtaken in the rumen with the tradi-tionally used vaginal, rectal, andtympanic temperature measures. Procedure Trial 1 Tympanic, vaginal, and ruminal temperatures were obtained weight= 911 the high energy orhigh roughage diet (Table 1). Theheifers were initially fed the highenergy diet, then switched to thehigh roughage diet and allowed a 10-day acclimation period beforetemperatures were monitored. Tympanic temperatures (TT) were recorded using a StowawayXTI \u00ae data logger (Onset Corpora- tion, Pocasset, thermistor was insertedapproximately four to five inchesinto the ear canal until the tip wasnear the tympanic membrane. Theloggers recorded temperatures at15-minute intervals. Vaginal (VT) and ruminal (RT) temperatures were recorded usingthe ETD Bolus TM (CowTek, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). The ruminalboluses were inserted using a ball-ing gun and remained in placeuntil removal at slaughter. Vaginaltemperatures were recorded usingthe same type of bolus. The boluswas hand-placed inside the vagina,immediately behind the cervix, dur-ing periods when temperatures (Continued on next page)Sheryl L. Colgan Terry L. Mader1 Summary Four heifers were used in two trials comparing the effect of high energyand high roughage diets on three bodytemperature measurements. Body tem-peratures were measured in the vagina,in the ear canal near the tympanicmembrane, and in the rumen. The highroughage diet lowered all three mea-sures of body temperatures as com-pared with the high energy diet.Vaginal, tympanic, and ruminal tem-perature all appeared to effectivelymeasure as they fol-lowed the same diurnal cycle; however,ruminal temperatures were, on aver-age, 0.5 to 1.4 oF higher than other body temperature measures. Introduction Contradictory opinions have evolved on temporarily increasingroughage levels in the diet to helpmanage short periods of cold stress.Roughages are assumed to have ahigher heat increment than concen-trates, and often are recommendedto improve cold stress tolerance ofcattle. However, this practice maynot be beneficial, as higher rough-age levels reduce metabolizableenergy (ME) intake and increase therate of passage through the rumen,thus potentially reducing fermenta-tive heat production in the rumen.Table 1.

All boluses were activated via wireless signal torecord temperatures at one-hourincrements. Due to problems receiving data from the boluses, primarily causedby bolus orientation and distance ofthe bolus to the signal receiver,approximately two-thirds of the VTand RT observations were missingfrom the first set of data during thehigh energy feeding period. There-fore, the receiver was moved andthe heifers were observed for a sec-ond four-day period while beingfed the high energy diet. (Approxi-mately 60% of VT and RT observa-tions were missing from the secondperiod.) Data from both four-dayhigh energy diet collections werepooled. The heifers were switchedto the high roughage diet and thereceiver was moved again toimprove reception, resulting in only8% of VT and RT observationsmissing from the high roughagefeeding period. Before analyzing the data, VT and RT observations were matchedwith TT occurring at the nearesthour. The remaining TT measure-ments were not used in the analy-sis. Because there was not acomplete set with all three tempera-ture observations for every hour,time of day was divided into six-hour (h) quarters as follows:Quarter 1 = 0000h to 0559 h;Quarter 2 = 0600 h to 3 = 1200 h to 1759 h; andQuarter 4 = 1800 h to 2359 h, withresults reported accordingly. Also,any time that more than one obser-vation occurred on the same date inthe same quarter on the same heifer,a mean was taken for that quarterand heifer. This aided in balancingthe data set for quarter and diet. Forthe entire study, 178 and 167 datapoints were obtained for heifers onhigh energy and high roughagediets, respectively, with approxi-mately one-third of the pointsoccurring for each temperaturelocation.

Themodel included diet, temperaturelocation, quarter, and all interac-tions as fixed effects with animalnested in the quarter by tempera-ture location interaction (since vagi-nal and ruminal temperatures wereonly recorded at times when theanimal was within receiver range)as random effects. Trial 2 On a separate date, the same four heifers were moved into the work-ing facilities. Tympanic, rectal,vaginal, and ruminal temperatureswere taken in that order within atwo-minute time frame while eachanimal was in the chute. The rumi-nal temperature was recordedusing the ETD Bolus TM that was already in place, while the otherthree were recorded with a digitalthermometer (Deltatrak, Pleasanton,CA). All heifers were on the highenergy diet (Table 1) during thistrial. These observations were ana- lyzed using the Proc Mixed analy-sis of variance procedures (SAS;SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Themodel included temperature loca-tion as fixed effect with animal as arandom effect.Results Overall, feeding the high rough- age diet reduced body temperaturewhen compared with feeding thehigh energy diet. Figure 1 showsthe effect of diet and quarter on tem-perature, as pooled across tempera-ture location. Diet by quarterinteraction is significant ( P = 0.082), which indicates that diet may havea tendency to alter the diurnal tem-perature rhythm. For all quartersexcept the first one, temperaturemeans were significantly higher(P<0.05) for high energy than highroughage diets, even thoughweather conditions were slightlywarmer during the roughage feed-ing period. Average weather condi-tions during both trials are shownin Table 2. Cattle were near orwithin the thermoneutral zone forthe duration of the trial. Temperatures recorded at each location are presented in Table 3. InTrial 1, ruminal temperature wassignificantly higher than both tym-panic and vaginal temperatures(P<0.05); however, in Trial 2, tym-panic temperature was the onlytemperature significantly differentfrom ruminal temperature (P<0.10)with rectal and vaginal temperatureintermediate. Temperature locationby diet interaction is not significant(P = 0.1824).There are several rea- sons that Trial 2 temperatures mayhave had a tendency to run higherthan Trial 1. All of the Trial 1 datawas used (both diet treatments) while Trial 2 observations onlyoccurred while heifers were on thehigh energy diet. Additionally,Trial 2 involved moving the ani-mals into working facilities, uti-lized different devices, andoccurred two months after Trial 1. There was no quarter interaction between temperature recording andlocation ( P = 0.998). This indicates that all three temperature locationsfollowed the same trends and maybe effective measurements of bodytemperature. Further research needsto be done to enhance and maintainconstant receiver/signal communi-cation, so that temperatures can bestatistically analyzed as measuredon an hourly basis to ascertain thesimilarity of RT to VT and TT. Feeding a high roughage diet lowered all measures of core bodytemperature when compared tofeeding a high energy diet. Ruminaltemperature may be an effectiveway to measure body temperature,as it follows a similar diurnalrhythm as vaginal and tympanictemperature measurements,although water and feed intakeeffects need to be evaluated. Inaddition the nature of the ruminaldiurnal pattern should be evalu-ated hourly. 1Sheryl L. Colgan, research technician, Terry L. Mader, professor, AnimalScience, Haskell Ag Lab, NortheastResearch and Extension Center, Concord.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 76Effect of Clinoptilolite Zeolite on Cattle Performance and Nitrogen Volatilization Loss hypothesis for this research is thatadding zeolite clay to cattle feedlotdiets will bind the ammonia (NH 3), reducing the amount of N lost intothe air. The second hypothesis isthat steer ADG, feed efficiency andintake will not be negativelyimpacted by adding zeolite clay tothe diet. Procedure Ninety-six crossbred steer calves (741 + 26 lb) were fed for 168 days from November to April. Steerswere stratified by weight andassigned randomly to twelve pensand one of two treatments (eighthead per pen, six pens per treat-ment). Treatments were 1) controldiet with 0% zeolite zeolite clay.Clinoptilolite zeolite clay was usedin this experiment. Steers were weighed initially on two consecutive days following afive-day limit-feeding period. Steerswere weighed again on days 28, 84and 168. The cattle were implantedon day 1 and day 84 with Synovex-Choice \u00ae. Diets were formulated to meet the steers' metabolizable pro-tein requirement according to the1996 Beef NRC. Steers were fed on afour-week step-up program to thefinishing diet shown in Table 1.The supplement used a groundcorn carrier and for the treatmentdiet, 1.2% of the ground corn carrierwas replaced with zeolite clay. At slaughter, hot carcass weights and liver scores were recorded. Fol-lowing a 24-hour chill, fat thicknessat the 12 th rib, quality grades, yield grades and rib-eye areas wererecorded. Final weights were calcu-lated as hot carcass weight divided by the dressing percentage of 63. The N balance experiments were conducted in 12 open feedlot penswith retention ponds to collect run-off. Run-off amounts were mea-sured using an ISCO 4230 flowmeter (Lincoln, Nebraska). Sampleswere collected during draining ofthe retention ponds and analyzedfor dry matter, organic matter andtotal N. Prior to the steers entering the pens, 16 core samples (top 6 inches)were taken at equally spaced inter-vals throughout the pen. Followingremoval of the steers at slaughter,pens were cleaned and 16 coreswere taken once again at similarlocations. Six cores per pond weretaken at the same time as the pencores. All cores were analyzed fordry matter, organic matter and N. On day 168, following the removal of the steers, pens werecleaned. Total pounds of manureremoved were recorded. As manurewas loaded, samples were obtainedfor analysis of dry matter and N.Dawn M. Sherwood Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein 1 Summary A winter feeding experiment evalu- ated effects of adding clinoptilolite zeo-lite clay at 1.2% of the diet on steerperformance and nitrogen (N) volatil-ization loss. No differences were foundin steer performance, removed manurecomposition or N balance; however,small numeric improvements wereobserved in ADG F:G for steers fedzeolite. Adding zeolite clay to feedlotdiets did not affect N loss in open feed-lots using mass balance techniques. Introduction With increasing environmental regulations, producers will need toincorporate efficient, cost effectivemethods to reduce N losses fromfeedlots without negatively affect-ing cattle performance. Numerousoptions have been researchedwhich include decreasing dietdigestibility by adding corn bran(2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 69- 71, 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-58, 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-57), feeding less total protein(1999 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 60- 63) and cleaning pens more fre-quently ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 72-73). Zeolite clay, a proposed new treatment to reduce N volatiliza-tion, is capable of ion exchange andmay be effective in adsorbingammonia. Most zeolite clays aremined from volcanic ash depositswhich form alkaline lakes. OneTable 1. Composition of finishing diets (% DM basis).

Individual steer N retentionwas calculated using the NRC(1996) net protein and net energyequations. Nitrogen excretion wasdetermined by the differencebetween N intake and N retention.Manure N was calculated fromweight of manure hauled and Ncomposition. Manure N was cor-rected for inherent cleaning differ-ences by adjusting for soil core Nbefore and after the feeding period. Total N lost was calculated by sub-tracting soil corrected manure Nfrom excreted N. All N values arereported on a per steer basis fed for168 days. All data were analyzedby variance using the Mixed Proce-dure of SAS. Results There were no statistical differ- ences in steer performance betweencontrol and zeolite treatments(Table 2). Numerically, the zeolite steers had a 3.4% increase in ADGover the control group. The zeolitegroup had a 2.9% decrease infeed:gain. Nitrogen mass balance was not affected by adding zeolite clay. Nostatistical differences were found inmanure composition removed or Nbalance (Tables 3 and 4). Previous research suggests zeo- lite clay is able to adsorb N, thushaving the ability to reduce N vola-tilization loss. In this trial, however,no differences in volatilization wereseen. The percent of N lost duringthis trial (Table 3) was consistentand within the 38-74% N lost dur-ing winter months as reported inprevious studies. Over the 168-dayfeeding period, 73.2 lb of N wasexcreted and about 45 lb of zeoliteclay was consumed per steer. Thesteers were excreting 162% more Nthan zeolite consumed. About 30 lbof N was lost, so the amount poten-tially retained by the zeolite claydid not have a significant impact.The amount of N supplied by feed-lot diets may be greater than thepotential for zeolite clay to adsorband therefore N balance and lossesmay not be impacted. Based on previous estimates of NH 3 binding in soils by Kithome et al. (1998 Soil Science Society of America Journal ), zeolite clay retained 1 g per lb of zeolite. Usingthat estimate, only 0.1 lb of trapped in manure fromthe 45 lb of zeolite fed to each steerover the 168 days. In this experiment, mass balance techniques were used in open out-door pens which is different thanprevious research. Manure is beingcomposted to determine if any dif-ferences be observedbetween treatments. 1Dawn M. Sherwood, Terry J. Klopfenstein, professor,Animal Science, Lincoln.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 78Evaluation of Initial Implants for Finishing Steers implanted cattle, the increase ingrowth rate and lean depositionmay occur at the expense of meatquality (reduction in marblingscore), suggesting implanted cattleshould be fed to higher bodyweights in order to achieve compa-rable quality grades. New reduced-dose initial implant combinations of estradioland trenbolone acetate are availablefor steers and may have differenteffects on animal performance andcarcass quality when compared tothe more traditional estrogen-basedimplants. Recently, Hutcheson et al.(2003, Journal of Animal Science Vol. 81 Suppl. 1, p112) reported estra-diol and trenbolone acetateimplants, used in either the full orreduced dosage form, improvedgain, feed efficiency, and hot car-cass weight while maintaining car-cass quality in short-fed yearlingsteers when compared to a tradi-tional estrogen implant. Also,Farran et al. ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 58-60) observed improvements in gain, feed effi-ciency, marbling score, and the per-centage of carcasses grading uppertwo-thirds when reduceddosage estradiol and implants and trenboloneacetate is effective in maintaininganimal performance, and 2) to mea-sure the impact of reduced dosageof estrogen in an estradiol andtrenbolone acetate initial implant on carcass quality, yield grade andfeeding economics of feedlot steers. Procedure Crossbred steers (593 lb. initial BW) were received at a commercialfeedlot in Western, Nebraska andwere allotted randomly to one oftwo implant regimens at initial pro-cessing (within 72 hours afterarrival). Each group of incomingcattle represented a treatment repli-cation for a total of six replicationsper treatment (12 pens total; 1,077steers). Steers were kept separate byarrival date and assigned randomlyto pens by sorting every other ani-mal as they exited the processingchute during initial processing.Within a replication, all steers werefrom the same source and arrived tothe feedlot at the same time. At ini-tial processing, steers were indi-vidually weighed, vaccinated,treated for internal and externalparasites, and given a lot-tag forindividual and pen identification.The initial implant treatment waseither Revalor-IS (16 mg estradiol,80 mg trenbolone acetate) orSynovex S (20 mg estradiol ben-zoate, 200 mg progesterone). Afterprocessing, animals were weighedby pens for a starting pen weightjust prior to being moved into theirhome pen. Number of animals in apen ranged from 70 to 120 headand was equal across treatmentsand replications. Steers were fed (twice daily) a common finishing diet containingJeffrey D. Folmer Travis B. Farran Galen E. Erickson Terry J. Klopfenstein Chris D. Reinhardt Bill D. Dicke Jim S. Drouillard 1 Summary A commercial feedlot experiment utilizing 12 pens and 1038 steersevaluated initial implant strategies forfeedlot steers. Steers were administeredeither \u00ae or Revalor-S \u00ae as a termi- nal implant. Revalor-IS\u00ae as an initial implant improved hot carcass weightand carcass adjusted final weight;however, there was no effect on anyother measure of performance or car-cass characteristics. Selling steers on acarcass merit basis resulted in a similarreturn per head for both implant strat-egies. Reduced-dose combinationimplants may improve hot carcassweight and carcass adjusted finalweight with no impact on carcassmerit. Introduction Growth-promoting implants increase growth rate (i.e. dailygain), improve feed conversion, andincrease final weight of cattle by asmuch as 40 to 90 lb (Guiroy et al.,2002; Journal of Animal Science ) com- pared to non-implanted cattle. Ifimplanted cattle are marketed atweights comparable to non-Page 79 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef corn, 5.0% liquid supplement,3.5% corn steep liquor, and 2.6%tallow. The finishing diet was for-mulated to contain 14.7% CP, and 0.4% P, 28 and 9 Tylan.Cattle were adapted to the finishingdiet an 18- 21-day step-upperiod starting with 45% roughageand progressively replacing rough-age with concentrate. Replications of steers were reim- planted with Revalor-S (24 mgestradiol 17beta, 120 mg trenboloneacetate) as the common terminalimplant an average of 78 days(range 71 to 84) prior to slaughter.At re-implant time, steers wereremoved from their pens andimmediately weighed to obtain apen weight. Steers were thenre-vaccinated, poured, individuallyweighed, and re-implanted prior tobeing sent back to their home penfor the remainder of the feedingperiod. Initial implants also wereevaluated at this time to identifydefects, including abscessed,bunched, missing, crushed, partial,or cartilage-placed implants. Steerswere fed an average of 180 days(range 170 to 191). All pens withina replication were marketed underidentical conditions at the samecommercial abattoir (National BeefPacking; Dodge City, Kansas). Hotcarcass weights were recorded onthe day of harvest. Carcass fatthickness, longissimus muscle area,and USDA called marbling scoreand yield grades were recorded fol-lowing a > 24-hour chill. Empty body fat was calculated from theequations of Guiroy et al. (2002,Journal of Animal Science ), where empty body fat = 17.76207 +(4.68142 \u00d7 fat thickness in cm) + (0.01945 \u00d7 hot carcass weight in kg) + (0.81855 \u00d7 quality grade) - (0.06754 \u00d7 longissimus muscle area in cm 2). Calculated yield grade was estimated with the formula from theAmerican Meat Science Associa-tion, 2001 Meat Evaluation Handbookwhere Yield Grade = 2.5 + ( 2.5 \u00d7 fat thickness in inches) + 0.2 \u00d7 (% kid- ney, pelvic, and heart fat; estimatedat 2%) + (0.0038 hot carcass weight in lb) - (0.32 \u00d7 longissimus muscle area in in. 2). Marbling score was recorded on a scale of 450 =Slight 50; 500 = Small 0; 550 = Small 50; 600 = Modest 0. The economic influence of the initial implant treatment on profit/loss of steers sold on a value-basedpricing grid was determined basedupon the commodity grid proposedby Feuz ( 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 39-41). Carcass value was cal-culated based on USDA quality andyield grade, carcass weight, andnonconformance (i.e., dark cuttersand heavy carcasses). A carcassbase price of $109.84/cwt (10-yearaverage dressed weight price) wasused for low Choice, Yield Grade 3carcasses weighing 550 to 950 lb.Discounts were calculated on ahundred weight of Ration cost calculatedusing 10-year average corn al-falfa hay price. Non-feed costs were$0.28/head daily yardage, $30/head miscellaneous (medicine, pro-cessing, shipping, etc.), and ani-mal interest. Initialimplant cost was $1.95/implant forRevalor-IS and $0.80/implant forSynovex S. to 700-lb Nebraska, CooperativeExtension Bulletin, PHREC 02-21, p.16). Animal performance, carcass data and economics were analyzedusing the Mixed procedure of SASfor a randomized complete blockdesign where pen served as theexperimental unit. Model effectswere initial implant treatment,while arrival date was termed a blocking factor, thus placed into therandom statement. Least squaresmeans were separated using thePDIFF statement of SAS. Results Data are presented with deads and railers removed from the analy-sis. Fifteen and thirteen head wereremoved from the Revalor-IS andSynovex S treatments, respectively.Feed intake and head days were ad-justed accordingly for the time ofremoval from the pen. Feed intakewas calculated from feedlot close-out information on each pen ofcattle. Because all steers received acommon terminal implant, initialimplant treatment will be referred towhen comparing treatment differ-ences. There were no differences in ini- tial implant defects for either treat-ment. One animal in the Revalor-ISand three animals in the Synovex Streatments possessed abscessedimplants. Additionally, thirteenanimals in the Revalor-IS and fif-teen in the Synovex S treatment hadidentifiable defects the initialimplant. Therefore, steersadministered Revalor-IS and 2.8%of steers administered Synovex Swere found to have implants thatfell within the defective criteria.This indicates that initial implantswere properly administered. There were also no differences in morbidity and mortality of steers.Deads and railers were combinedas they were all removed from theirpens and the data analysis. Deadsand railers averaged 3.6% Synovex S treat-ments, respectively. Of those pulls,steers treated for respiratory diseaseon one occurrence were 38.1% and38.8%, and steers treated for respi-ratory disease two or more timeswere 15.0% and 11.9% for theRevalor-IS and Synovex S treat-ments, respectively. Pulls for other2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 80reasons were 3.7% and 2.0% for the Revalor-IS and Synovex S treat-ments, respectively. Steer performance is presented in Table 1 and is expressed on a liveand carcass adjusted basis using acommon dressing percentage (63%).Dry matter intake was similarbetween treatments. Steers implant-ed initially with Revalor-IS had 8lb. greater ( P = 0.07) carcass adjusted final weight than steersinitially implanted with Synovex S.Implanting steers initially withRevalor-IS improved feed efficiencyby 2% in the live category (5.41 vs.5.53) and 3% in the carcass ad-justed calculation (5.31 vs. 5.48);however, neither difference wassignificantly different from theSynovex S treatment with P-valuesof 0.30 and 0.23, respectively. Liveaverage daily gain (P = 0.31) andcarcass adjusted average daily gain(P = 0.22) were not significantly dif-ferent and only slightly increasedwith the initial Revalor-IS treat-ment. Carcass merit is shown in Table 2. Revalor-IS implanted steers had 5lb heavier ( P = 0.07) hot carcass weights, with similar dressing per-centages, 12 th rib fat thickness, cal- culated empty body fat, andlongissimus muscle area whencompared to Synovex S implantedsteers. USDA called yield grade andcalculated yield grade were similarbetween treatments indicating thatsteers were fed a similar compo-sitional Marbling score,carcasses grading upper two-thirdsChoice, and total were not different betweeninitial implant treatments.

Additionally,implant treatment did not affect thedegree of finish of the steers. The simulated economic analy- sis of marketing cattle on a value-based carcass merit basis ispresented in Table 3. Using 10-yearaverage prices, ration cost was cal-culated to be $126/ton (DM basis).The added cost of Revalor-IS overthat of Synovex S implants also wasincluded in the analysis. Initial ani-mal cost and total miscellaneous costs were similar between treat-ments. Steers implanted initiallywith Revalor-IS returned $4.95/head more ( P = 0.57) than those steers initially implanted withSynovex S. The 5 lb heavier hot car-cass weights translate into greaterreturns for steers implanted withRevalor-IS. This study provides evidence that Revalor-IS as an initial implantfor feedlot steers appears to provideequal performance and slightly bet-ter carcass weight than traditionalsteer initial implants (Synovex S),without affecting carcass character- istics or feeding economics whensteers are sold on a value-basedgrid marketing system. Farran et al.(2004 Nebraska Beef Report ) found significant increases in gain, feedefficiency, and marbling scorewhen Revalor-IH was used as aninitial heifer implant compared toSynovex-H. They observed a 2.5%increase in carcass adjusted feedefficiency. In our study with steers,we observed no differences in gainor marbling score. However, we didfind slight increases in hot carcassweight and carcass adjusted finalweight. In addition, we observed a2% decrease in live, and 3%decrease in carcass adjusted feedconversion; however, due to alarger amount of variation or differ-ences in physiology between heifersand steers, the improvements weobserved were not statisticallysignificant. 1Jeffrey Drouillard, professor, Animal Science,Kansas State University.2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 82Effect of Injecting Modified Connective Tissue Solutions on Quality of Beef Roasts tion and use of connective tissue inmeat systems like ground beef, pat-ties, sausages, frankfurters, bolognaand restructured products, where itwas successfully included for costreduction, texture modification andfat substitution. However, applica-tions in whole muscle productshave not been reported. Injectionand marination of beef cuts haveproved to enhance overall eatingquality and reduce palatabilityvariations of the finished product.This enhancement technology isnow common practice in the meatindustry. Our objective was toimprove connective tissue function-ality so that it could be used as aningredient for injection, marinationand enhancement of beef wholemuscle products. Procedure Beef Tendon Solutions Beef chuck tendons were either cooked to 167 oF in a solution con- taining salt (5% just salt and phosphate as a con-trol. The resulting product was fil-tered through cheesecloth to obtaintwo types of solutions: heat solubi-lized collagen (C-collagen) andenzyme-degraded collagen (B-collagen), which were used asingredients for injection. Injection of Beef Roasts Six USDA select grade semiten- dinosus (ST) muscles were cut inhalf to obtain 12 ST roasts. Threeroasts were randomly assigned toeach of the following injection treat-ments: 1) C-collagen, 2) B-collagen,3) salt and phosphate (SP) and 4)no injection (NI). All the solutions to be injected were adjusted to have the samelevel of salt (5% w/w) and phos-phate (2% of injected to 15% weightincrease, bagged and tumbled for30 minutes. After tumbling thepieces were cut into six 0.75-inchsteaks which were randomlyassigned in groups of two steaksper three time periods: day 1, day 8and day 15 post injection. Thesteaks were weighed, vacuum pack-aged and stored in the darkness at41 oF.

Similar samplesinjected only with water, salt andphosphates and non-injected ST roastswere used as controls. No treatmentdifferences were found for packagepurge loss and shear force. Color ofcollagen injected samples was eithersimilar to non-injected or salt/phosphate injected tenderer, more flavor-ful. Tendons can be modified and suc-cessfully used for injection of wholemuscle products in model systems. Introduction Important amounts of connective tissue such as tendons, membranes,cartilages and ligaments are gener-ated from beef fabrication andgrinding operations. This materialis usually of low value and ren-dered for protein and fat.

The samples wereallowed to bloom for 30 (L*), redness (b*) and steaks were thenvacuum packed again and storedunder refrigeration. Cooking Losses, WBS and Sensory Analysis Steaks were cooked to 130 oF internal temperature for Warner-Bratzler shear force determination(WBS) and sensory evaluation.Forty-five panelists scored thesamples for tenderness, juiciness,flavor and overall acceptability.Cooking losses were calculated byweight difference. Statistical Analysis A regression and an analysis of variance using Proc Mixed from theStatistical Analysis System (SAS)were performed. Least significantdifferences were calculated formean separation and Bonferroniconfidence bands were constructedfor the regression parameter esti-mates. Results The NI steaks were lighter and redder while b* value trends werenot significantly different amongtreatments. C-collagen sampleswere as light as NI product and asred as SP-injected steaks. B-collageninjected samples were similar incolor characteristics to SP-injectedproduct. Over time, all samplesbecame lighter and both a* and b*decreased in a quadratic fashion(Table 1, Figures 1 and 2).

Buford1,2 Summary Beef strip loins and top sirloins were enhanced and steaks were storedin one of three packaging systems:high-oxygen barrier trays, low-oxygenpeelable trays, or vacuum packages.After dark storage for 8 or 15 days,simulating distribution time, steakswere displayed up to 3 days in a retailcase. Steak discoloration and sensorytraits were rated. Extended dark stor-age and retail display were detrimentalto flavor and color. In this study, thebest packaging systems were those thatminimized opportunities for oxidation\u2014 vacuum packaging and, as long asdark storage was limited to eight days,high oxygen packaging. Introduction Recent innovations with packag- ing films and equipment technol-ogy require careful consideration ofpackaging options for a given beefproduct. High-oxygen packagingallows for a bright red color of beef,but accelerates conversion of freshbeef from bright red to a morebrownish color. Low-oxygen pack-aging systems do not impart abright red color of beef, but main-tain the color in retail display if thepackage remains intact. There is astrong interest in the marketplacefor beef products enhanced withingredients designed to improvetexture, flavor, and consistency. Theobjectives of this study were todetermine the effects of commercialcase-ready packaging systems onsensory, shelf-life, color, and colorstability characteristics of enhanced beef. Procedure USDA select grade beef strip loins and top sirloin butts wereselected at a commercial meat pro-cessing facility. At the plant, eachprimal was weighed, pumped witha commercial enhancement solu-tion (water, salt and phosphate),and sliced into 1-inch thick steaksusing a commercial slicer. Steakswere packaged using systems: 1) 3320 and a tray with approximately 20%carbon dioxide and 78% oxygen,2) a Ross Junior model S3180 and apeelable tray with approximately22% carbon dioxide, 78% nitrogenand 223 ppm of oxygen, or3) vacuum packaged into oxygen-impermeable bags. The sirloinsteaks were lightly misted with arosemary extract to minimize oxida-tion. Packaged steaks were allocated to one of two periods of dark stor-age (8 or 15 days), to be followed byup to 3 days of retail display.During display a team of trainedevaluators rated the steaks' discolorationand so on. or three days ofretail display, steaks were frozenand held for evaluation by atrained, 10-member sensory panel. A trained sensory panel flavorintensity, intensity of trained on flavor desirability, sothe extent to which preferenceresult can be applied to the general population is limited. These datawere obtained as an indicator ofpanelist reaction to the products.All sensory traits were evaluated on8-point rating scales, where1=extremely dry, extremely tough,extremely mild flavor, no detectableoff-flavor, extremely undesirableflavor, and 8=extremely juicy,extremely tender, extremely intenseflavor, extremely intense off-flavor,and extremely desirable flavor.Panelists also identified off-flavors.Steaks were cooked to 158\u00b0F onFarberware Open Hearth broilers. Results Steak Discoloration There were no differences among packaging and storage treatmentsfor strip steaks at the start of theretail display period (Figure 1).Beginning one day of retail display,greater discoloration was detectedfor the low oxygen, peelable pack-ages, regardless of storage time, andfor the high oxygen packages storedin the dark for 15 days. For theduration of retail display, these dif-ferences continued to diverge fromthe vacuum packaged steaks andthe high oxygen steaks stored in thedark for just eight days. These datasuggest the low oxygen, peelablepackages retained sufficientresidual oxygen to catalyze myoglo-bin oxidation to the brownappearance. a lowoxygen, peelable package withoutresidual oxygen would have lowerlevels of discoloration.

In this antioxidant treatment wasnot successful in preventing thediscoloration during retaildisplay. Sensory Properties Tenderness was not affected by storage or retail display periods(Table 1). A difference in tendernesswas perceived by the panelists forthe different packaging systems.The steaks from the high-oxygenpackages were perceived to be lesstender than the steaks from thevacuum packages in the top sirloinsteaks and less tender than the stripsteaks packaged in vacuum pack-ages and low-oxygen packages. Themean scores for all treatments werestill considered to be at least\"slightly tender\". Recent data in theliterature suggests the enzymesresponsible for arediminished in activity under oxi-dizing conditions. oxidation created by highoxygen levels contributed toreduced enzyme activity. Extended dark storage was detri- mental to off-flavor intensity andflavor preference for both steaktypes (Table 1). The same was truefor extended retail display. Thispattern was consistent across allpackaging systems for strip steaks.In top sirloin steaks, the high oxy-gen packages were judged leastdesirable in off-flavor intensity andflavor preference. A trained panelwas used to evaluate the samples,which might explain the uncom-monly low flavor preference scores.It is clear, however, that modifiedatmosphere packaging of enhancedbeef steaks creates the potential forundesirable flavors to develop. Similarly, a greater number of panelists detected oxidized flavorsin both steak types followingextended dark storage (Tables 2and 3). The same was true for theTable 1.

Implications Conditions that promote oxida- tion, like extended dark storage orretail display, result in the develop-ment of off-flavors in enhancedbeef. Accordingly, retailers whoseek to merchandise enhanced beefwould be advised to minimize timein the marketing chain for the product. 1Chris R. Calkins, professor, Animal Science, Lincoln; Mike L.

The objective of this studywas to document similarities anddifferences in the physical andchemical characteristics of the ninemuscles from the five populationsof cattle studied. Procedure Sample collection took place at Packerland Packing Co. in GreenBay, Wisconsin. Based on visualevaluation, live cattle were sepa-rated into four populations of cows(fed beef, non-fed beef, fed dairy,non-fed dairy) and A-maturity,USDA Select grade beef by experi-enced plant personnel. Seventy-fivecarcasses, fifteen from each of thefive populations of cattle, wereselected. Selected carcasses had atleast 0.1 inch of 12 th rib fat and medium or greater muscling. Hotcarcass weight, ribeye area, leanand bone wereremoved from each carcass forfurther analysis. Objective color[L* (measure of lightness), a* (mea-sure of red), and b* (measure ofyellow)] was measured with Illumi-nant A using a Hunter Lab MiniScan XE Plus colorimeter with a1-inch port. Water holding capacitywas determined as expressiblemoisture and was measured as thepercentage of moisture loss due tocentrifugation. A pH meter with aspear tip combination electrodewas used to determine muscle pH.Total heme iron is a measurementof pigment (myoglobin and hemo-globin) in a muscle sample. Pig-ments were extracted using acetoneand hydrochloric acid. The totalheme iron content was quantifiedusing a spectrophotometer andreported in parts per million.Muscle total collagen content wasmeasured by assaying for hydroxy-proline content using a spectropho-tometer.

Stelzleni Bucky L. Gwartney 1,2 Summary Some muscles from the different populations of cows evaluated havesimilar chemical and physical proper-ties to muscles from A-maturity,USDA Select grade cattle. Perhapsthose muscles from cows could be uti-lized in a manner that would increasetheir value. Fifteen carcasses wereselected from five populations (fed beefcows, non-fed beef cows, fed dairycows, non-fed dairy cows, and Selectgrade beef) and nine muscles per car-cass were characterized. Most musclesfrom cows were darker in color, hadhigher pH values, and had greaterheme iron content than muscles fromyounger cattle, which may be undesir-able to consumers. Supplemental tech-nology may be needed to upgrademuscles from cow carcasses. Introduction In recent years, utilization of under-valued muscles has beeninfluenced by beef muscle profilingand cow muscle profiling projects.These studies, however, did notmake direct comparisons betweenpopulations of young and oldcattle. Such information would helpthe industry determine if there aremuscles from different populationsof cows that are comparable toA-maturity, Select grade beef andcould be used in a way that wouldupgrade their value.Page 89 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef ReportTable 1.

As expected, the overall maturity ofSelect was younger than the otherpopulations. A-maturity, USDASelect grade cattle had whiter fatcolor and higher lean color scoresthan the other populations. Thesecattle may have been fed a highconcentrate diet for a longer time,resulting in whiter fat color.Younger animals display lighterand brighter lean color. With theexception of the fed beef cow popu- lation, Select had less external fatmeasured at the 12 th rib and Select had less kidney, pelvic, and heartfat than fed and non-fed dairy.Carcasses from fed beef, non-feddairy, and fed dairy cows had moremarbling than Select. However,Select carcasses were heaviermuscled (1 = light and 8 = heavy)and had larger ribeye areas thanthe other populations. Musclingscores can be influenced by thenutritional status of the animal. Ifcattle are on a low plane of nutri-tion, they may be forced to metabo-lize muscle tissue to maintainenergy, thereby reducing musclescores. Yield grades were lower(P < 0.05) for Select than fed beef, non-fed dairy and fed dairy cows. Although a feeding trial was not conducted as part of this experi-ment, it is obvious that differentpopulations of cows exist. Carcassdata indicate beef cows were morelike A-maturity, USDA Select gradecattle than dairy cows for many car-cass characteristics. In many cases,there were apparent differencesbetween the populations of cowsselected for additional feeding andthose not selected for additionalfeeding. For example, non-fed beefcattle were older, leaner, and lighterin weight than fed beef cows. Per-haps those cows were not selectedfor additional feeding out of con-cern they would not benefit enoughto make it worth the additionalcosts. Objective Color Seven of nine muscles from Select cattle were significantly(P < 0.05) lighter (higher L*) than the same muscles from each of thecow populations (Table 2). Theinfraspinatus and teres major fromfed beef cows did not differ fromSelect. In general, as animalsadvance in age the muscle tissuebecomes a darker red.

Least square means of heme iron (ppm) for nine musclesa from five groupsb a,b,c,d,eSee footnotes in Table 2. Muscle pH Muscle pH differed ( P < 0.05) from Select for eight of nine muscles(Table 3). The most noticeable dif-ferences were from the populationsof fed and non-fed dairy cows. Forthirteen of eighteen observations,pH values of muscles from thedairy cow populations were higherthan Select. The infraspinatus,rectus beef cows also hadsignificantly ( P < 0.05) higher pH values than Select. Muscle pH isdependent on the amount ofglycogen present in the muscles at the time of slaughter. Muscle glyco-gen content may be influenced bythe animal's diet and stress prior toslaughter. If glycogen stores aredepleted prior to slaughter, pHdecline is slowed and a higher thannormal ultimate pH will occur. Therole of pH is very broad and affectsmany characteristics of meat.Muscles with a high ultimate pHwill be very dark in color and verydry in appearance on the exposedsurface because water is tightlybound to the proteins.Heme Iron Concentration All muscles from Select had sig- nificantly ( P < 0.05) lower heme iron concentrations (Table 4) thanthe cow muscles tested. Studieshave shown that heme iron contentof muscles from A-maturity cattleare lower than the same musclesfrom market cows. Others havereported an increase in myoglobincontent as animals increased inmaturity and the pigment content ofsteers and cows were double andtriple the concentrations of pigmentfound in veal calves, respectively. Seven of thirty-six observations from the four cow populations hadheme iron concentrations that didnot differ from Select. Most of theseobservations were of beef cows,indicating muscle color from beefcows more closely matches musclecolor from Select than do musclesfrom dairy cows. Most muscles from cows were darker in color, had higher pHvalues, and had greater heme ironcontent than muscle from youngercattle, which may be undesirable tosome consumers. Supplementaltechnology may be needed toupgrade muscles from cow car-casses. 1Laura B. Mink, graduate R. Calkins, D.

The current study wasconducted to determine the effect ofpre-rigor water injection and post-rigor sodium citrate treatment onchuck muscle tenderness. Procedure Animals Left and right thoracic limbs of 20 steers were randomly assignedafter evisceration to one of fivetreatments: 1) left on the rigor hours, when theywere injected to 15% of muscleweight with a solution of 4%sodium citrate (0/citrate),4) removed pre-rigor, injected to10% of muscle weight tapwater, then injected post-rigor with5% more tap water (water/water)and pre-rigor andinjected 10% of muscle weightwith tepid tap water, then injectedpost-rigor to 5% of muscle weight with a solution of 12% sodium cit-rate (water/citrate). Injection ofwater and solution was Pre-rigor at 2 hours and 24hours postmortem, respectively.After 48 hours of chilling at infraspinatus, supraspinatus andtriceps brachii were excised fromthe limbs and sampled sarcom-ere length (muscle contraction)determination. At 5 and 12 dayspost mortem, a one-inch thick steakfrom each muscle was fro-zen for Warner-Bratzler shear forcedetermination. Sarcomere Length Sarcomere length was measured at 48 hours postmortem on freshmuscle samples (total of 20 fibersper observation) using the neonlaser diffraction method. Warner-Bratzler Shear Force A one-inch thick steak from each muscle was broiled on a tabletopbroiler to a final internal tempera-ture of 158 oF. Temperature was monitored at the geometric center ofeach steak using a thermocouplethermometer. Cooked steaks werechilled 2 hours at 4 oF, and then eight cores (1/2-inch in diameter)were removed parallel to the musclefiber orientation. Cores weresheared once each on an InstronBethany M. Pennapa D. Perversi Chris R. Calkins 1,2 Summary Thoracic limbs from 20 beef steers were used as post-rigor controls, pre-rigor controls (removed pre-rigor), ortreated with combinations of sodiumcitrate and/or water to evaluate theeffect of citrate on meat tenderness.Shear force values on steaks from theinfraspinatus, supraspinatus and tri-ceps brachii muscles revealed citrate-treated muscles were more tender thanwater and post-rigor control treat-ments. It appears sodium citrate cantenderize meat independent of waterinjection. Introduction Tenderness is the most impor- tant factor for consumers in deter-mining acceptability of meat,especially beef. Consumers are will-ing to pay a premium for meat thatis more tender. Brooks et al. (2000)concluded from the 1998 NationalBeef Tenderness Survey that musclefrom the round and chuck are inparticular need of improvement intenderness. Treatments to improvetenderness of chuck and roundmuscles would add value to thewhole carcass. Previous research in our labora- tory indicated beef chucks injectedpre-rigor with water were less ten-der than control samples whilethose injected pre-rigor with 200 (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 92increased solubilization of myo- fibrillar proteins occurs. Thiswould be similar to the effect ofpotassium chloride. The mecha-nism by which sodium citrateincreased meat tenderness notinvolve calpain enzymes becausesodium citrate is a calcium chelatorand calcium is required for calpainactivty. Additionally, the concentra-tion of citrate inactivate ionic of suggest that citrate can over-come some limits to tenderizationcaused by pre-rigor injection ofwater. There were no differences in sar- comere length ( P > 0.05) among treatments within muscles (Table2). Pre-rigor removal of the thoraciclimb increased tenderness in theinfraspinatus and supraspinatuswhen compared to the post-rigorcontrol ( P < 0.05), which likely occurred as a result of alteredmuscle position. Thus, sodium cit-rate can tenderize meat indepen-dent of water injection.

The focus ofthis research was to study howcooking dwell time affected thechemical and physical properties ofbeef semitendinosus during thermal processing. The objectives were todetermine if length of dwell timeduring thermal processing affectedchemical properties of cooked meatand cook-out purge, and to deter-mine if altering the length of cook-ing dwell time affected cooked meattenderness. Procedure Beef semitendinosus (ST) muscles (n=48) were delivered to the LoeffelMeat Laboratory at the Universityof Nebraska-Lincoln. The ST mus-cles were trimmed of external fatand connective tissue. Each STmuscle was randomly assigned acooking dwell time (0, 60, 90, or 120minutes) within a level of addedenhancement solution (0% or 12%)and internal endpoint temperature(140 oF or 150oF) combination. Cook- ing dwell time was defined as thetime (in minutes) each sample washeld at a designated endpoint tem-perature. Each sample was injectedwith either 0% or anenhancement solution containing2% salt and 0.3% sodium phos-phate. Each roast was then sealedin a plastic bag and tumbled for onehour in a vacuum tumbler. Toensure separation and isolation ofthe muscle from the cook-out purgeduring thermal processing, cook-inbags were modified to contain a onequart plastic bottle at the bottom ofthe bag to collect the cook-outpurge. A stainless steel ham hookwas inserted in the distal end of the muscle. A long string loop wassecured to the ham hook. The meat,hook, and loop were placed into amodified cook-in bag. Each cook-inbag was sealed by clipping twicewith a pneumatic clipper and hungon a cooking cart by the hook. Thecook-in bags were placed in anAlkar hot water cooker that con-tinuously showered the productswith hot water. The water tempera-ture was raised to 100 oF initially and allowed to shower samples for30 minutes. After each 30-minuteincrement, the water temperaturewas increased 43 oF until water tem- perature was 160oF. The water tem- perature was held at 160oF until the first sample reached its designatedinternal endpoint temperature. Thewater temperature was thendecreased to 140 oF or 150oF, depending on designated endpointtemperature to prevent over-cooking. As each sample reachedits designated endpoint tempera-ture, the cooking dwell time wasinitiated and monitored. Samplesreaching the designated endpointtemperature and cooking dwelltime were removed from the cookerand the modified cook-in bags con-taining the roast were placed into astainless steel sausage truck. Thebags were packed in ice andallowed to cool for a minimum of 12hours. Following cooling, the roastswere prepared for tendernessanalysis utilizing Warner-Bratzlershear force. Chemical analyses todetermine moisture, ash, fat, pro-tein, and total collagen contentwere conducted on the roasts andcook-out purge. Total collagen con-tent was determined by analyzingthe hydroxyproline content (mg ofcollagen/g). Cooking yield wasBetsy L. Booren Joe L. Baumert Roger W. Mandigo 1 Summary The effects of cooking dwell time on chemical and physical properties ofcooked meat and cook-out purge wereexamined. Cooked meat yields were notaffected among cooking dwell times forsamples with 12% added enhancementsolution. Increasing cooking dwell timeresulted in increased cooked meat ten-derness. No differences were demon-strated among cook-out purge samplesfor moisture, ash, fat, and total col-lagen values regardless of cookingdwell time, pump level, and endpointtemperature of the sample. This may bebeneficial to meat processors in creat-ing an ready-to-eat product that uti-lizes cook-out purge. Introduction Cook-out purge is an everyday occurrence for a meat processor, yetlittle is understood about the pro-duction of cook-out purge and howto utilize it. The term \"cook-outpurge\" describes an aqueous solu-tion, which includes water andwater-soluble proteins, found aftera meat product has been thermallyprocessed in a cook-in bag. Theready-to-eat (RTE) market is anideal opportunity for meat proces-sors to find a method of utilizingcook-out purge. Many factors mustbe considered during the develop-ment of a meat RTE product such asmeat tenderness, product flavorprofile, ability to be re-heated orfully cooked within consumers'homes, and how other non-meatingredients interact within the meatsystem. Since raw muscle, cooked (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 94Product tenderness was evalu- ated utilizing Warner-Bratzlershear force. Roasts cooked to aninternal endpoint temperature of150 oF, regardless of added enhancement solution, did not dif-fer among cooking dwell times(Table 2). Among enhancedsamples with an endpoint tempera-ture of 140 oF, extending the dwell time to 60 minutes or more resultedin lower WBS values than sampleswith 0 minutes of dwell time. Asimilar trend was noted for 0%added enhancement at 140 oF, with dwell times beyond 60 minutes. Moisture values for cooked meat samples with 0% added enhance-ment solution decreased as cookingdwell time increased (Table 3). Forsamples with an endpoint tempera-ture of 140 oF, a significant decrease (P <0.05) in moisture levels was seen between samples with cookingdwell times 60 minutes and lowercompared to those 90 minutes orgreater. Moisture levels for sampleswith 12% added enhancement solu-tion were not affected by cookingdwell time ( P >0.05) regardless of internal endpoint temperature(Table 3). As seen in Table 1, cookedmeat samples with 12% addedenhancement solution had higheroverall cooking yields than the 0%added enhancement solutionsamples, which indicates less mois-ture loss. Altering the ionic strengthof the meat protein by adding saltand sodium phosphate likelyallowed better water binding. Ash levels for samples cooked to an endpoint temperature of 140 oF, regardless of level of addedenhancement solution, wereunaffected ( P >0.05) by cooking dwell time (Table 3). Samples with0% added enhancement solutionheld for 0 minutes at 150 oF had the lowest ( P <0.05) ash level. As expected, ash levels were approxi-mately twice as great for sampleswith 12% enhancement solutioncompared to those with 0%. Theenhancement solution containedsodium phosphate and salt, whichwould increase ash levels. The ashTable 1.

Results Cooked meat yields decreased for samples with an internal end-point temperature of 150 oF and 0%enhancement pump level ( P <0.05) as cooking dwell times increased(Table 1). There were no differencesin cooked meat yields amongsamples treated with the enhance-ment solution. The similar yieldsindicate that adding an enhance-ment solution maintains the cook-ing yield of meat samples over atwo-hour dwell time.Page 95 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportlevel may appear to be increased or concentrated, when in actuality theloss of moisture during thermalprocessing may have changed thepercentage of ash within eachcooked meat sample. The effect of moisture loss on percentage of other chemical com-ponents of cooked muscle also maybe true for cooked meat fat levels.Samples containing 12% addedenhancement solution and cookedto 140 oF had a range of 1.4% fat among cooking dwell times withsamples held for 60 minutes havingthe lowest fat value (Table 3). Levelsof fat did not consistently decreaseas cooking dwell time increased. Itwas expected fat levels woulddecrease as cooking dwell timeincreased, but the varying levels offat among dwell times can not beexplained. Protein composition of cooked meat with 0% enhancement solu-tion increased as dwell timeincreased (Table 3). Samples con-taining 12% enhancement solutiondid not have a consistent increasein protein content as dwell timeincreased. The increased proteinlevel among cooking dwell timemay have been affected, similar tothe change in ash and fat values, bythe loss of moisture within thecooked meat sample. The levels of total collagen were not affected ( P >0.05) by cooking dwell time for any treatment combi-nation (Table 3). Reports in the lit-erature indicate that collagensolubility may occur with increasedtemperature and cooking dwelltime, however, this was not seen inour study. Previous research hassuggested that other factors besidestemperature contribute to meat ten-derness. Endogenous proteolyticand collagenolytic enzymes alsomight affect collagen solubility. The chemical composition of cook-out purge is shown in Table 4.No differences ( P >0.05) were dem- onstrated for moisture, ash, fat, andtotal collagen values regardless ofcooking dwell time and treatmentTable 4.

A difference ( P <0.05) of cook-out purge protein level wasseen among purge samples fromroasts containing 0% addedenhancement solution, cooked to anendpoint temperature of 140 oF, and a dwell time of 60 minutes. The sig-nificant decrease in protein levelscannot be explained within thisstudy. Purge samples from roastswith an endpoint temperature of150 oF, 12% added enhancement solution, and held for 0 minuteshad the lowest cook-out purge pro-tein values among cooking dwelltimes within that treatment combi-nation. The overall range of abso-lute protein levels was loweramong purge samples from roastscontaining 12% added enhance-ment level compared to 0%. Addingsalt and sodium phosphate tocooked meat may have affected thelevel of protein expressed duringthermal processing. Altering ionicstrength within the meat and thecombination of cooking dwell timeand endpoint temperature mayaffect levels of cook-out proteinlevels within purge.As the moisture levels of cooked meat samples decreased amongcooking dwell times, the levels ofother chemical components wereaffected. Although the differencesin total collagen were not signifi-cant in this study, collagen contentmay be important to consumer meatquality and deserve further evalua-tion. No differences were demon-strated among cook-out purgesamples for moisture, ash, fat, andtotal collagen values regardless ofcooking dwell time, pump level,and endpoint temperature of thesample. This may be beneficial tomeat processors in creating an RTEproduct that utilizes cook-out purgeas the only component affected bycooking dwell time is the level ofprotein. The amount of proteinfound in cook-out purge may beaffected by altering the componentsand levels within the enhancementsolution. 1Betsy L. Booren and Joe L.

Sodium phosphate decreasedthe amount of package purge and cookloss and gave the beef product a darker,redder appearance. Potassium lactategave the product a darker, redderappearance, while increasing levels oflactate decreased total psychrotrophic(bacterial) plate counts, and decreasedpackage purge and cook loss. Sodiumphosphate and potassium lactate aid inextending shelf-life and improvingquality attributes of enhanced beefsteaks. Introduction Changes in consumer buying trends and lifestyles have requiredthe meat industry to look for newtechnologies that allow meat prod-ucts to be prepared quickly andeasily by the consumer whileimproving overall product qualityand consistency. The use of sodiumphosphate in meat has been shownto increase moisture retention andreduce oxidative rancidity. Sodiumlactate has long been used as ashelf-life in meat products.Research has shown that increas-ing sodium lactate levels decreasesbacterial counts in cooked beefPage 97 \u2014 2005 Nebraska Beef Reportamount of moisture lost from the steak while in the package) andcooking loss were measured.Warner-Bratzler shear force wasmeasured on each steak followingcooking. Results Adding sodium phosphate and potassium lactate in enhanced beefsteaks increased the pH of thesteaks (Table 1). The use of alkalinephosphates in meat products toincrease the pH has been welldocumented. By increasing the pH,the product can bind more water,resulting in decreased purge andcooking loss. The decrease in cook-ing loss produces a juicier, moredesirable product. In our study,adding sodium phosphateincreased ( P < 0.05) steak pH. Use of STP should increase the pH ofmeat more than BK85 because it ismore alkaline, however, there wasno difference between the two phos-phate types ( P > 0.05). Increasing levels of lactate significantlyincreased steak pH ( P < 0.05). The ability of potassium lactate toincrease product pH also shouldincrease moisture retention in theTable 1.

Research indicates lactate has the ability to delay microbialgrowth, which will have an effecton the product pH. The ability ofpotassium lactate to increase pHand delay microbial growth overthe 15-day storage period may haveallowed the product pH to remainhigher than steaks containing 0%potassium lactate. Increasing levels of potassium lactate delayed bacterial growthand held the total bacterial platecounts lower over the 15-day refrig-erated storage period as comparedto bacterial counts from steaks con-taining 0% lactate (Figure 1). Steaks containing 0% KL had highermicrobial counts by day 15 as com-pared to steaks containing 2% and4% KL ( P < 0.05). Increasing the level of lactate from 2% to 4%reduced the bacterial count over the15-day storage period ( P < 0.05). The addition of potassium lactatein meat products has been shownto increase the shelf-life of the prod-uct by delaying bacteria growth. Adecrease in bacterial load also mayhave an effect on other quality char-acteristics. As bacteria grow, they (Continued on next page)2005 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 98produce acidic, metabolic by- products that will lower productpH. Lower product pH reducesmoisture retention and the stabilityof myoglobin resulting in decreasedshelf-life due to the development ofa brown surface appearance.Sodium phosphate did not signifi-cantly reduce ( P > 0.05) microbial growth (data not shown). Steak color utilizing HunterLab and lactate adarker, redder steak appearance(Table 2). Steaks enhanced withsodium phosphate had signifi-cantly lower L* values (darkerappearance) and higher a* values(redder appearance) as comparedto steaks containing no phosphate(P < 0.05). No differences in b* values (yellowness to blueness)were seen between the steaks(P > 0.05). Adding potassium lac- tate significantly decreased thelightness of the product (lower L*values) while giving the product aredder appearance (higher a*values). The ability of sodium phos-phate and potassium lactate toincrease the product pH may beaiding color stability. Research hasshown that myoglobin is morestable at higher pH values. Theresults in this study indicate thatadding phosphate and lactate canhelp increase product shelf-lifebecause the product maintains amore desirable appearance for alonger time. Both sodium phosphate and potassium lactate decreased theamount of package purge loss(Table 3). Adding sodium phos-phate decreased the amount ofpackage purge ( P < 0.05), however, no differences were seen betweenthe two phosphate types. Increas-ing levels of potassium lactate de-creased the amount of packagepurge loss ( P < 0.05). Adding phosphate and lactate also decreased the amount of cook-ing loss (Table 4).

Increasinglevels of potassium lactatedecreased the amount of cookingloss ( P < 0.05). The ability of sodium phosphate and potassiumlactate to decrease package purgeand cooking loss may be due totheir ability to increase product pH,allowing muscle proteins to bindand hold more water. The decreasein moisture loss should result in ajuicier product. Adding BK85 decreased (P < 0.05) the Warner-Bratzler shear force values (increased the tender-ness) of the enhanced beef steaks(Table 5). Research indicates theuse of phosphate in meat productswill increase product tenderness. Itwas expected that STP would alsoincrease product tenderness, how-ever, this was not the case in ourstudy. Potassium lactate did not aidin increasing product tenderness. Results of this study indicate that the use of sodium phosphateand potassium lactate can enhanceproduct quality. Sodium phosphatedecreased the amount of package purge and cook loss and gave thebeef product a darker, redderappearance. Potassium lactate gavethe product a darker, redderappearance, while increasing levelsof lactate decreased total psychro-trophic (bacteria) plate counts anddecreased package purge and cookloss. Sodium phosphate andpotassium lactate aid in extending product shelf-life from a bacterialand color standpoint while improv-ing moisture retention of enhancedbeef steaks. 1Joe L.
