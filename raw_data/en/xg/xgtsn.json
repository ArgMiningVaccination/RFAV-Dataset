These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not deline ate an exclusive course of tr eatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient. Denitions Used in This Protocol /C15Exclusive breastfeeding: Feeding only breast milk (at the breast or own mothers' expressed breast milk), no food or water except vitamins, minerals, and medications. /C15Supplementary feedings: Additional fluids provided to a breastfed infant before 6 months (recommended du- ration of exclusive breastfeeding). These fluids may include donor human milk, infant formula, or otherbreast milk substitutes (e.g., glucose water). /C15Complementary feedings: Solid or semisolid foods provided to an infant in addition to breastfeeding whenbreast milk alone is no longer sufcient to meet nutri- tional needs. /C15Term infant : In this protocol ''term infant'' also includes early-term infants (gestational age 37-38 6/7 Background Given early opportunities to breastfeed, breastfeeding as- sistance, and instruction the vast majority of mothers andinfants will successfully establish breastfeeding. Although some infants may not successfully latch and feed well during the rst day (24 hours), most will successfully breastfeedwith time, appropriate evaluation and support, with minimal intervention. Exclusive breastfeeding for the rst 6 months is associated with the greatest protection against major healthproblems for both mothers and infants. 1-3Unfortunately, infant formula supplementation of healthy neonates in tions to the contrary.6-8Early supplementation with infant formula is associated with decreased exclusive breastfeedingrates in the rst 6 months and an overall shorter duration of breastfeeding.9,10Therefore, hospitals, healthcare facilities, and community organizations that promote breastfeeding areintegral in improving the exclusivity and duration of breast-feeding. 10One way of achieving this is by following The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (the basis for the Baby- Friendly Hospital Initiative), both in the hospital andcommunity. Newborn physiology Small quantities of colostrum are appropriate for the size of a newborn's stomach,11-13prevent hypoglycemia in a healthy, term, appropriate for gestational age infant,14,15and are easy for an infant to manage as he/she learns to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Healthy term infants also have sufcient body water to meet their metabolic needs,even in hot climates.16-18Fluid necessary to replace insen- sible fluid loss is adequately provided by breast milk alone.7,18Newborns lose weight because of physiologic di- uresis of extracellular fluid following transition from intra-uterine to extrauterine life and the passage of meconium. In a prospective cohort of mothers in a U.S. Baby-Friendly des- ignated hospital with optimal support of infant feeding, themean weight loss of exclusively breastfed infants was 5.5%; notably, greater than 20% of healthy breastfed infants lost more than 7% of their birthweight. 19A study of over 160,000 healthy breastfed infants resulted in the creation of hour- specic nomograms for infant weight loss for exclusively breastfed newborns that showed differentially increasedweight loss in those born by cesarean section than by vaginalbirth. In this study, almost 5% of vaginally born infants and 1Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. 2Department of Family & Community Medicine, University of Arizona College of Medicine and Family Medicine Residency, Tucson, Arizona. 3Discipline of General Practice, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

DOI: 10.1089/bfm.2017.29038.ajk 1 >10% of those born by cesarean section had lost 10% of their birth weight by 48 hours after birth. By 72 hours, >25% of infants born by cesarean section had lost 10% of their birth weight.20Breastfed infants regain birth weight at an average of 8.3 days (95% condence interval: 7.7-8.9 days) with 97.5% having regained their birth weight by 21 days.21 Infants should be followed closely to identify those who lie outside the predicted pattern, but the majority of those breastfed infants will not require supplementation. It should also be noted that excess newborn weight loss is correlatedwith positive maternal intrapartum fluid balance (received through intravenous fluids) and may not be directly indicative of breastfeeding success or failure.22,23 Early management of the new breastfeeding mother Some breastfeeding mothers question the adequacy of colostrum feedings and perceive that they have an insuf- cient milk supply.24,25These women may receive conflicting advice about the need for supplementation and would benetfrom reassurance, assistance with breastfeeding technique, and education about the normal physiology of breastfeeding and infant behavior. Inappropriate supplementation mayundermine a mother's condence in her ability to meet herinfant's nutritional needs 26and give inappropriate messages that may result in supplementation of breastfed infants at home.27Introduction of infant formula or other supplements may decrease the feeding frequency of the infant, thereby decreasing the amount of breast stimulation a mother re- ceives, which results in a reduction of milk supply.28 Postpartum mothers with low condence levels are very vulnerable to external influences, such as advice to offer breastfeeding infants supplementation of glucose water orinfant formula. Well-meaning healthcare professionals may recommend supplementation as a means of protecting mothers from fatigue or distress, although this can conflictwith their role in promoting breastfeeding. 29-31Several so- ciodemographic factors are associated with formula supple- mentation in the hospital, and vary geographically. It is important to recognize and address these factors in a cultur-ally sensitive manner. Inappropriate reasons for supplemen- tation and associated risks are multiple (Appendix Table A1). There are common clinical situations where evaluation and breastfeeding management may be necessary, but SUPPLE- MENTATION IS NOT INDICATED, including: 1. The healthy, term, appropriate for gestational age infant when the infant is feeding well, urinating and stooling adequately, weight loss is in the expected range, andbilirubin levels are not of concern (depending on ges- tational age, time since birth, and any risk factors). 32 /C15Newborns are normally sleepy after an initial alert period after birth ( *2 hours). They then have vari- able sleep-wake cycles, with an additional one or two wakeful periods in the next 10 hours whether fed or not.33 /C15Careful attention to an infant's early feeding cues, keeping the infant safely skin-to-skin with mother when she is awake, gently rousing the infant toattempt frequent breastfeeds, and teaching the mother hand expression of drops of colostrum,34 may be more appropriate than automatic supple- mentation after 6, 8, 12, or even 24 hours./C15Increased skin-on-skin time can encourage more frequent feeding. /C15Ten percent weight loss is not an automatic mar- ker for the need for supplementation, but is anindicator for infant evaluation. 2. The infant who is fussy at night or constantly feeding for several hours /C15Cluster feeding (several short feeds close together) is normal newborn behavior, but should warrant a feeding evaluation to observe the infant's behaviorat the breast35and the comfort of the mother to en- sure that the infant is latched deeply and effectively. /C15Some fussy infants are in pain that should be ad- dressed. 3. The tired or sleeping mother /C15Some fatigue is normal for new mothers. However,rooming out for maternal fatigue does not improvemothers' sleep time 36and has been shown to reduce breastfeeding exclusivity.37Extreme fatigue should be evaluated for the safety of mother and baby toavoid falls and suffocation.38 /C15Breastfeeding management that optimizes the infantfeeding at the breast may make for a more satisedinfant AND allow the mother to get more rest. The following guidelines address strategies to prevent the need for supplementation (also see Appendix 2) as well as indi- cations for and methods of supplementation for the healthy, term (37- to 42-week), breastfed infant. Indications for supplementa-tion in term, healthy infants are few. 7,39Table 1 lists possible indications for the administratio n of supplemental feeds. In each case, the medical provider must decide if the clinical benets outweigh the potential negative consequences of such feedings. Recommendations Step 1. Prevent the need for supplementation 1. There is mixed, but mainly positive, evidence about the role of antenatal education and in-hospital support on therates of exclusive breastfeeding. 40-42( I )( Q u a l i t yo fe v i - dence [levels of evidence I, II-1, II-2, II-3, and III] is based on the U.S. Preventive Services43Task Force Appendix A Task Force Ratings and is noted in parentheses.) 2. All staff who care for postpartum women should be able to assist and assess breastfeeding infants, especiallywhen other staff with expertise are not available. 3. Both mothers and healthcare professionals should be aware of the risks of unnecessary supplementation. 4. Healthy infants should be placed skin-to-skin with the mother, if she is awake and alert, immediately after birth to facilitate breastfeeding.7,44(I) The delay in time between birth and initiation of the rst breastfeedis a strong predictor of infant formula use and may affect future milk supply.10,45,46(II-3, II-2, II-3) 5. It is ideal to have the mother and infant room-in 24 hours per day to respond to infant feeding cues, enhance opportunities for breastfeeding, and hence secretory activation (lactogenesis II).7,39,47,48(III) 6. If mother-infant separation is unavoidable, milk supply is not well established, or milk transfer is inadequate, the mother needs instruction and encouragement toexpress her milk by hand or pump to stimulate milk2 ABM PROTOCOL production and provide expressed milk for the in- fant.7,39,48,49(I, III) This process should begin within 1h o u ro fb i r t h .45(II-2) Step 2. Address early indicators of the possible need for supplementation 1. The infant's medical providers should be notied if the infant or mother meets any criteria for supplementa- tion, as listed in Table 1. 2. All infants must be formally evaluated for position, latch, and milk transfer before the provision of sup- plemental feedings. This evaluation should be under-taken by a healthcare provider with expertise inbreastfeeding management, when available. 7,48 Step 3. Determine whether supplementation is required and supplement with care 1. The status of the infant requiring supplementation should be determined and any decisions made on a case-by-case basis (guidelines in Table 1). 2. Hospitals should strongly consider formulating and instituting policies to require a medical provider'sorder when supplements are medically indicated and informed consent of the mother when supplements are not medically indicated. It is the responsibility of the healthcare provider to fully inform parents of thebenets and risks of supplementation, document pa- rental decisions, and support the parents after they have made a decision. 50,51(III) 3. All supplemental feedings should be documented, in- cluding the content, volume, method, and medical indication or reason. 4. When supplementary feeding is medically necessary, the primary goals are to feed the infant and to optimize the maternal milk supply while determining the causeof low milk supply, poor feeding, or inadequate milktransfer. Supplementation should be performed in ways that help preserve breastfeeding such as limiting the volume to what is necessary for the normal new-born physiology, avoiding teats/articial nipples, 52(I) stimulating the mother's breasts with hand expression or pumping, and for the infant to continue to practiceat the breast. 5. Optimally, mothers need to express milk frequently, usually once for each time the infant receives aTable 1.Possible Indications for Supplementation in Healthy, Term Infants ( 37-41 6/7Weeks Gestational Age) 1. Infant indications a. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia, documented by laboratory blood glucose measurement (not bedside screening methods) that is unresponsive to appropriate frequent breastfeeding. Note that 40% dextrose gel applied to the side of the infant's cheek is effective in increasing blood glucose levels in this scenario and improves the rate of exclusive breastfeeding after discharge with no evidence of adverse effects.78Symptomatic infants or infants with glucose <1.4 mmol/L (<25 mg/dL) mmol/L ( <35 mg/dL) after 4 hours should be treated with intravenous glucose.15Breastfeeding should continue during intravenous glucose therapy. b. Signs or symptoms that may indicate inadequate milk intake: i. Clinical or laboratory evidence of signicant dehydration (e.g., high sodium, poor feeding, lethargy, etc.) that is not improved after skilled assessment and proper management of breastfeeding.79 ii. Weight loss of 8-10% (day 5 [120 hours] or later), or weight loss greater than 75th percentile for age. 1. Although weight loss in the range of 8-10% may be within normal limits if all else is going well and the physical examination is normal, it is an indication for careful assessment and possible breastfeeding assistance. Weight lossin excess of this may be an indication of inadequate milk transfer or low milk production, but a thorough evaluation is required before automatically ordering supplementation.19,20,80 2. Weight loss nomograms for healthy newborns by hour of age can be found at: www.newbornweight.org20,80 iii. Delayed bowel movements, fewer than four stools on day 4 of life, or continued meconium stools on day 5 (120 hours).48,80 1. Elimination patterns for newborns for urine and stool should be tracked at least through to the onset of secretory activation. Even though there is a wide variation between infants, the patterns may be useful in determiningadequacy of breastfeeding.81,82II-2. Newborns with more bowel movements during the rst 5 days following birth have less initial weight loss, earlier the transition to yellow stools, and earlier return to birth weight.83 c. Hyperbilirubinemia (see ABM Clinical Protocol #22: Guidelines for Management of Jaundice) i. Suboptimal intake jaundice of the newborn associated with poor breast milk intake despite appropriate intervention. This characteristically begins at 2-5 days and is marked by ongoing weight loss, limited stooling and voiding with uric acid crystals. ii. Breast milk jaundice when levels reach 340-425 lmol/L (20-25 mg/dL) in an otherwise thriving infant and where a diagnostic and/or therapeutic interruption of breastfeeding may be under consideration. First line diagnosticmanagement should include laboratory evaluation, instead of interruption of breastfeeding. d. Macronutrient supplementation is indicated, such as for the rare infant with inborn errors of metabolism. 2. Maternal indications a. Delayed secretory activation (day 3-5 or later [72-120 hours] and inadequate intake by the infant).80 b. Primary glandular insufciency (less than 5% of women\u2014primary lactation failure), as evidenced by abnormal breast shape, poor breast growth during pregnancy, or minimal indications of secretory activation.84,85 c. Breast pathology or prior breast surgery resulting in poor milk production.84 d. Temporary cessation of breastfeeding due to certain medications (e.g., chemotherapy) or temporary separation of mother and baby without expressed breast milk available. e. Intolerable pain during feedings unrelieved by interventions.ABM PROTOCOL 3 supplement, or at least 8 times in 24 hours if the infant is not feeding at the breast. Breasts should be fully drained each time.53(II-2) Maternal breast engorgement should be avoided as it will further compromise themilk supply and may lead to other complications.54(III) 6. Criteria for stopping supplementation should be con- sidered from the time of the decision to supplementand should be discussed with the parents. Stopping supplementation can be a source of anxiety for parents and providers. Underlying factors should be addressedand mothers should be assisted with their milk supply, latch, and comfort with assessing the signs that their infant is adequately fed. It is important to closelyfollow up mother and infant. 7. When the decision to supplement is not medically indicated (Table 1), discussions with the mother should be documented by the nursing and/or medicalstaff followed by full support of her informed decision. Choice of Supplement 1. Expressed breast milk from the infant's mother is the rst choice for extra feeding for the breastfed in- fant.7,55(III) Hand expression may elicit larger vol- umes than a breast pump in the rst few daysfollowing birth and may increase overall milk sup-ply. 56Breast massage and/or compression along with expressing with a mechanical pump may also increase available milk.57(II-3) 2. If the volume of the mother's own colostrum/milk does not meet her infant's feeding requirements and supplementation is required, donor human milk ispreferable to other supplements.55 3. When donor human milk is not available or appropriate, protein hydrolysate formulas may be preferable tostandard infant formula as they avoid exposure to intact cow's milk proteins and reduce bilirubin levels more rapidly,58(II-2) although recent data are less supportive of its role in preventing allergic disease.59(I) The use of this type of formula may also convey the psychological message that the supplement is a temporary therapy, not a permanent inclusion of articial feedings. 4. Supplementation with glucose water is not appropriate because it does not provide sufcient nutrition, does not reduce serum bilirubin,60,61and might cause hypona- tremia. 5. The potential risks and benets of other supplemental fluids, such as cow's milk formulas, soy formulas, orprotein hydrolysate formulas, must be considered along with the available resources of the family, the infant's age, the amounts needed, and the potentialimpact on the establishment of breastfeeding. Volume of Supplemental Feeding 1. Several studies give us an idea of intakes at the breast over time. In most studies, the range of intake is wide,while formula-fed infants usually take in larger vol- umes than breastfed infants.62-66(II-3) 2. Infants fed infant formula ad libitum commonly have much higher intakes than breastfed infants.65,66(II-3)Acknowledging that ad libitum breastfeeding emulates evolutionary feeding and considering recent data on obesity in formula-fed infants, it appears that formula-fed infants may be overfed. 3. As there is no denitive research available, the amount of supplement given should reflect the normal amounts of colostrum available, the size of the infant's stomach(which changes over time), and the age and size of the infant. Intake on day 2 postbirth is generally higher than day 1 in relation to infant's demand. 65 4. Based on the limited research available, suggested intakes for healthy, term infants are given in Table 2, although feedings should be based on infant cues. Methods of Providing Supplementary Feedings 1. When supplementary feedings are needed, there are a number of delivery methods from which to choose: asupplemental nursing device at the breast, cup feeding, spoon or dropper feeding, nger-feeding, syringe feed- ing, or bottle feeding.67(III) 2. An optimal supplemental feeding device has not yet been identied, and may vary from one infant to an- other. No method is without potential risk or benet.68 3. When selecting an alternative feeding method, clini- cians should consider several criteria: a. cost and availability b. ease of use and cleaningc. stress to the infant d. whether adequate milk volume can be fed in 20- 30 minutes e. whether anticipated use is short- or long-term f. maternal preference g. expertise of healthcare staffh. whether the method enhances development of breastfeeding skills. 4. There is no evidence that any of these methods are unsafe or that one is necessarily better than the other.There is some evidence that avoiding teats/articial nipples for supplementation may help the infant return to exclusive breastfeeding 20,52,69(I); however, when hygiene is suboptimal, cup feeding is the recommended choice.55Cup feeding also allows infants to control feeding pace68(II-2). Cup feeding has been shown safe for both term and preterm infants and may help preservebreastfeeding duration among those who require mul- tiple supplemental feedings.52,70-72(II-2, I, I, I, II-2) 5. If bottles are being used, pacing the feed may be benecial, especially for preterm infants.73(III) 6. Supplemental nursing systems have the advantages of supplying a supplement while simultaneously stimu- Table 2.Average Reported Intakes of Colostrum by Healthy, Term Breastfed Infants (mL/feed) 24 2-10 24-48 5-1548-72 15-3072-96 30-604 ABM PROTOCOL lating the breast to produce more milk, reinforcing the infant's feeding at the breast, enabling the mother to have a breastfeeding experience, and encouragingskin-to-skin. However, mothers may nd the systemsawkward to use, difcult to clean, relatively expen- sive, requiring moderately complex learning, and the infant must be able to latch effectively. 67A simpler version, supplementing with a dropper, syringe, or feeding tube attached to the breast while the infant is feeding at breast, may be effective. 7. Bottle feeding is the most commonly used method of supplementation in more affluent regions of the world, but concerns have been raised because of distinctdifferences in tongue and jaw movements, and fasterflow may result in higher (and unnecessary) volumes of feeds. 67Some experts have recommended a teat/ nipple with a wide base and slow flow to try to mimicbreastfeeding and to avoid nipple confusion or pref- erence,68,74(II-2), but little research has been done evaluating outcomes with different teats/nipples. Research Needs Research is necessary to establish evidence-based guide- lines on appropriate supplementation volumes for specic conditions and whether this varies for colostrum versus infant formula. Specic questions include the following: 1. Should the volume be independent of infant weight or a per kilogram volume? Should supplementation make up for cumulative losses? 2. Should feeding intervals or quantities be different for different types of delivery of supplementation (e.g., bottles, cup feeding)? 3. Are some methods (type and delivery mechanism) best for infants with certain conditions, ages, and availableresources? Which methods interfere least with estab- lishing direct breastfeeding?

Small amounts of colostrum are normal, physiologic, and appropriate for the term,healthy newborn.Can alter infant bowel flora and microbiome. 86,87 Potentially sensitizes the infant to foreign proteins.88,89 Increases the risk of diarrhea and other infections, especially where hygiene is poor.3 Potentially disrupts the ''supply-demand'' cycle, leading to inadequate milk sup-ply and long-term supplementation. Supplementation is needed to prevent weight loss anddehydration in the postnatal period 5A certain amount of weight loss is normal in the rst week of life and is due to diuresisof extracellular fluid and passage of meconium.Supplementation in the rst few days may interfere with the normal frequency ofbreastfeeding. Supplementation with water or glucose water, increases the risk of jaundice, 90 excessive weight loss,91and longer hospital stays.92 Infant could become hypoglycemicHealthy, full-term infants do not develop symptomatic hypoglycemia as a result of suboptimal breastfeeding.15Same risks as for weight loss/dehydration. Breastfeeding is related to jaundice in the postnatal periodThe more frequent the breastfeeding, the lower the bilirubin level.93,94Same risks as for weight loss/dehydration. Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant95and jaundice is normal in the newborn. Colostrum acts as a natural laxative helping to eliminate meconium that contains bilirubin.94 (continued )Appendix8 ABM PROTOCOL Table A1. ( Continued ) Concerns/inappropriate reasons Responses Risks of supplementation Lack of time for counseling mother about exclusivebreastfeeding when mothers request a supplementTrain all staff in how to assist mothers with breastfeeding. Mothers may benet from education about articial feeds and/or how supplements may adversely affect subsequentbreastfeeding. 29 Time spent by healthcare professionals lis- tening to and talking with mothers is atleast as important as other more activeinterventions (which may be viewed more as ''real work'' to them). 29If the supplement is infant formula, which is slow to empty from the stomach96 and often fed in larger amounts,66the infant will breastfeed less frequently. Depending on the method of supplementation,52,74or the number of supplements97an infant may have difculty returning to the breast. Feeds given before secretory activation and copious breast milk production (as opposed to supplementation) may be associated with delayed initiation ofbreastfeeding and negatively associatedwith exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding. 98 Medications may be contraindi- cated with breastfeedingAccurate references are available to provid- ers (e.g., Medications and Mothers' Milk 2017,99LactMed on Toxnet website15)Risk of decreasing breastfeeding duration or exclusivity.9,10 For most medical conditions, medication safe for breastfeeding mothers and babies isavailable Mother is too malnourished or sick to breastfeed or eats aninappropriate diet.Even malnourished mothers can breastfeed. Breast milk quality and quantity is onlyaffected in extreme circumstances. Supplements are better given to the mother (with continued breastfeeding) than theinfant.Risk of decreasing breastfeeding duration or exclusivity. Supplementation will quiet a fussy or unsettled infant 5Infants can be unsettled for many reasons. They may wish to cluster feed or simplyneed additional skin-to-skin time or holding.67 Filling (and often overlling) the stomach with a supplement may make the infantsleep longer,96missing important oppor- tunities to breastfeed, and demonstrating to the mother a short-term solution whichmay generate long-term health risks. Teaching other soothing techniques to new mothers such as breastfeeding, swaddling (but not if prone or side lying),100 swaying, singing, encouraging father or other relatives to assist. Caution should be taken to not ignore early feed-ing cues.101 Ensure comfortable, effective latch to max- imize signal to mother's body and intake for the infantRisk of decreasing breastfeeding duration or exclusivity. Maternal engorgement due to decreased frequency of breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period.54 Concern about the cause of frequent feeding and cluster feeding and other changes ininfant behaviorPeriods when infants demand to breastfeed more are sometimes interpreted by moth- ers as insufcient milk. This may happenin later weeks but also in the second or third night (48-72 hours) postbirth. Changes in stooling patterns that often occur after 6-8 weeks of age can also bemisinterpreted as insufcient milk. Anticipatory guidance for normal infant development and behavior is helpful.Risk of decreasing breastfeeding duration or exclusivity. Mothers need to rest or sleep Postpartum mothers are restless when separated from their infants and actually get less rest. 29Risk of decreasing breastfeeding duration or exclusivity. (continued )ABM PROTOCOL 9 Table A1. ( Continued ) Concerns/inappropriate reasons Responses Risks of supplementation Mothers lose the opportunity to learn their infants' normal behavior and early feedingcues.48 Infants are at highest risk for receiving a supplement between 7 p.m. and 9 a.m.102 Sore nipples will improve if mother takes a break from breastfeeding5Sore nipples are not a function of length of time breastfeeding. Position, latch, and sometimes individual anatomic variation(e.g., ankyloglossia) are moreimportant. 103 There is no evidence that limiting time at the breast will prevent sore nipples. The nipple should not be rubbed or com- pressed during breastfeeding even if the feedings are frequent or ''clustered.''104Problem with latch not addressed. Risk of decreasing breastfeeding duration or cessation of breastfeeding. Risk of breast engorgement.10 ABM PROTOCOL Appendix A2: "}
