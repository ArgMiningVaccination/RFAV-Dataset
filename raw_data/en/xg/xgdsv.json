Often refer - enced by researchers across the globe, Dr. Chen's research has had a great influence on the field. Dr. Chen joined Upstate in 2007. Since 2011, he has been the director of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology graduate program, which has grown to have the largest number of graduate students at Upstate. Dr. Chen was promoted to full professor in 2015 and became a joint faculty member of the Neuroscience and Physiology Department in 2017. His initial work in mitochondrial biology provided insight into important biological features of mitochon-dria, or the \"powerhouses of the cell.\" Classic mitochondrial diseases typically affect children and young adults. While impaired bioenergetics is question- ably the sole cause of late-onset diseases, mitochondrial degeneration is, in fact, a common hallmark of many late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease and aging-associated muscle atrophy. A highly collaborative and valued member of the faculty, Dr. Chen has worked with Dr. Frank Middleton in Neuroscience and Physiology, Dr. Paul Massa in Neurology, Dr. Stephan Wilkens and Dr. Michael Cosgrove in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Dr. Sharon Brangman in Geriatrics to promote research in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Chen's contributions as an outstanding teacher and beloved mentor have impacted hundreds of students. Dedicated to the pursuit of scientific inquiry and to his students, he gently guides them to achieve great things through his example, his mentoring, and his uncompromising personal and scientific integrity. \"He is considered a skilled, innovative, insightful and productive scientist as well as a kind, constructive and brilliant person,\" said a nominator. It is especially apparent how much his students admire and adore Dr. Chen. In turn, Dr. Chen is equally interested in their education and development into high-level scientists. He puts his students first and incorporates their many talents into his laboratories' cutting-edge scien- tific pursuits. He has supervised eight student theses, served on 40 graduate student qualifying committees and on 28 graduate student dissertation advisory committees; he has also served as an external examiner for multiple PhD theses. \"He is a thoughtful and generous scholar who brings out the best in thinking, learning and discovery in others,\" said a nominator. Dr. Chen's research has been consistently funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies, including the American Heart Association. At present, he is the principal investigator on two NIH R01 grants and is the sponsor for an NIH F30 grant for one of his students. These grants have total costs of well over $4 million. His cumulative extramural grant funding is $7,923,458. He has served on the editorial board of Mitochondrion and is an ad hoc reviewer for more than 30 scientific journals, including Science, Nature, Molecular Biology of the Cell, and EMBO journal. He serves regularly on NIH study sections and has also been an invited speaker nationally and internationally. In addition, Dr. Chen has applied for two patents. The recipient of many awards and honors, Dr. Chen has received the American Heart Association National Scientist Development Grant Award and the Rich Cross Departmental Excellence Award at Upstate. Dr. Chen received a BSc degree in Animal and Veterinary Science from Zhejiang University, China, in 1982. He obtained a DEA degree in Human Nutrition from University Nancy I, France, in 1984. He was awarded a PhD degree in Molecular and Cellular Genetics from University Paris-Sud, France, in 1987. 6Chancellor's Award for Excellence in professional Service Lorraine L. Manzella Administrative Director, Upstate University Medical Associates of Syracuse (UUMAS) For the past 27 years, Ms. Lorraine L. Manzella has served with distinction for UUMAS, the faculty prac - tice plan at Upstate. A valued asset to the Upstate community, she leads and coordinates efforts on behalf of 18 clinical departmental practices within the College of Medicine, working closely and collabora- tively with Upstate University Hospital and the Dean's Office. \"She has been instrumental in the growth of the large clinical entity that is Upstate today,\" said one. Ms. Manzella has a track record of continuous, sustained support to our many physicians on innumer - able initiative over the years; from the collaboration between the hospital and the faculty practice plan in the acquisition and implement of our Epic electronic health record and practice management systems, compliance with CMS rules and regulations, develop- ment of the support for successful achievement in quality programs resulting in millions of dollars for the MSGs, etc. Her work on multiple successful efforts such as centralized third-party payor contract negotia- tions and initiation of the Medicaid Supplemental Payment program in New York state further increased MSG revenue, enabling the recruitment, retention and growth of clinical faculty. She has been instrumental in overseeing the opening of a new multi-specialty practice in Camillus Township 5, where physicians from various Upstate departments came together to provide services in an area that did not have access to Upstate doctors and their subspecialists. In addition, she has been involved with the creation of a new Upstate Cancer Center in Verona, NY. \"A quiet but relentless leader,\" Ms. Manzella is not always recognized but is a key partner in patient care, strategic planning, finances, communications and other essential functions.\" Despite highly charged discussions involving prac- tice plans, strategy, resource allocation and finance, she brings a calm and dedicated demeanor, showing respect to everyone she meets. She has the courage not to shy away difficult issues but rather deal directly with the problem at hand. \"Lorraine seems to be involved in everything.\" \"She does what is right; she is honest, conscientious and discreet in dealing with confidential informa- tion.\" \"She has an exemplary record, routinely going above and beyond,\" noted her nominators. Throughout her remarkable service Ms. Manzella has brought people together to work toward a common goal and overcome challenges. She shows intelligence, tenacity, patience and skill in recruiting, building and retaining a talented team of individuals. \"Lorraine is tireless in her advocacy for the physicians of Upstate and their teams,\" said a nominator. She has worked across specialties and within a complicated system to put the institution's best inter - ests at the center of her efforts. She has managed-up and mentored-up innumerable department chairs, deans and their related business managers with steady, persistent, innovative, supportive and flexible solutions. She has worked at Upstate and across SUNY in collaboration with many partners to achieve these efforts. Ms. Manzella received a BS in Physiological Psychology from Simmons College in Boston and an MS in Healthcare Management from the School of Health Technology and Management from SUNY Stony Brook in 1990. 7Chancellor's Award for Excellence in faculty Service Frank Middleton, PhD Associate Professor, Neuroscience and Physiology, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Biochemistry and Microbiology and Pediatrics Director, Neuroscience and Physiology Graduate Program, Microarray and Next Generation Sequencing Core and Center for Neuropsychiatric Genetics An accomplished researcher and educator, Dr. Frank A. Middleton consistently demonstrates humility and generosity in service to others. His focus on RNA sequencing has helped advance the human condition by diagnosing and managing clin- ical disorders such as autism, head injury, COVID-19, and others. Dr. Middleton's contributions as an educator predate his appointment to Upstate in 2002. He began teaching undergrad-uates while pursuing his master's degree at SUNY Plattsburg, and graduate students as a PhD student and then as a postdoc at the University of Pittsburgh. He currently teaches graduate, medical and health professions students, and residents in graduate medical education. He has taught at SUNY Oswego for several years and at Syracuse University, where he still teaches regularly. A much sought after research adviser by graduate and medical students, he follows the academic and research training of 61 MS, PhD and MD/ PhD students. While this may seem normal, it is far from it. Annually, \"Frank has sat on an average of 25 meetings of advisory, qualifying exams or thesis committees \u2014 that is far more than any other faculty in Neuroscience and possibly throughout the institution,\" said a nominator. As director of the Neuroscience Graduate Program, he follows 25- 30 students through their degree, ensuring their continuous progress, counseling them in class selection, and serving their registration needs, semester after semester. \"Frank and his colleagues worked around the clock during the Fall 2020 semester to perform COVID- 19 surveillance tests for SUNY campuses. His extraordinary efforts produced a highly sensitive, specific saliva test to detect COVID-19 which has helped frontline health care workers, students, faculty, teachers and many others. He and a team of doctors and researchers worked tirelessly through the PELICAN project in Cabral, Dominican Republic, where they provided support to a community profoundly affected by Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN). There, \"he participated in door-to-door screening of patients unable to make it to the clinic, doing evaluations in dirt floored shacks, in 105-degree heat, in less than sanitary conditions.\" Perhaps most impressive has been his tenure as the founder and director of the SUNY Microarray Core since 2002. Dr. Middleton has devoted countless hours to troubleshooting, training and analyzing experiments and data of his colleagues, with no expectation or request for a formal acknowledgment such as authorship on a paper or grant support. \"For nearly two decades, I have watched Frank seek neither fame nor fortune, but rather, scientific truth and service to others. I personally can attest to the fact that Frank is working tirelessly, 14- 15 hours per day, and what seems like seven days a week.\" Dr. Middleton's research has contributed enormously to the study of mental and neurological disorders, resulting in a total of 16,903 citations. His intramural and extramural service is exten - sive, including administrative, educational and research related committees, teams and task forces. He serves on NIH study sections and as a grant reviewer for several groups and multiple journals. Dr. Middleton received a BS in Biology and Psychology and an MA in Biology from SUNY Plattsburgh in 1991 and 1993, respectively. He earned a PhD with distinction from Upstate Medical University in 1998. He did his postdoctoral work in molecular neurobiology, psychiatric genetics and bioinformatics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \"This story is a perfect illustration of Dr. Middleton's dedica- tion, humility, generosity of time, work effort and service,\" aptly summed a nominator. 8Chancellor's Award for Excellence in faculty Service Stephen J. Thomas, MD Director, Institute for Global Health and Translational Sciences Chair (interim), Department of Microbiology and Immunology Dr. Stephen Thomas is a dedicated physician, an exemplary researcher, a natural leader, and a true humanitarian who has committed himself to advancing medicine, science and public health. His extraordinary service extends well beyond our campus, to the world. Throughout his career, Dr. Thomas has strived to understand how infectious diseases impact people, communities and the world, and he has worked tirelessly to devise ways to combat them. During his 20 years in the U.S. Army, Dr. Thomas supported and led research initiatives all over the world from Brazil, to Cambodia, Jordan, Nepal, Thailand, Nigeria, and the Philippines. He played lead and supporting roles in the development of numerous candidate vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tests against dengue, malaria, Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis E infections, to name a few. COVID-19 was not Dr. Thomas' first experience with an infectious disease epidemic. Between 2014 and 2016 he was a key figure in the U.S. government's response to the Ebola, MERS-CoV, and Zika epidemics. He was instrumental in the early development of Merck's Ebola vaccine and advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff on safety proce- dures for President Obama's Operation United Assistance. Dr. Thomas also helped develop vaccines against MERS and Zika, and in June of this year, the U.S. Patent Office awarded a patent to the Zika vaccine which he conceived and helped develop. In January 2020, as the COVID pandemic made its way through Asia, and was about to make landfall in the United States, Dr. Thomas supported and led teams developing plans for SUNY Upstate's prepa- rations and response. From March to May he was Upstate's COVID-19 Incident Command Commander. He worked with university leader - ship, elected officials, clinicians, scientists, logistics professionals and public health and infection prevention experts to begin buying PPE, preparing clinical areas to care for COVID-19 patients, and track and report infections. \"I witnessed firsthand Dr. Thomas' calm, charismatic, positive, pragmatic approach as command leader during first wave of COVID- 19 in Central New York; despite the already-full plate of leading his own division, managing his own faculty responsibilities, and being a father and husband.\" \"His leadership, characterized by good listening, collaboration and good decisions sets the bar.\" \"His style is unparalleled.\" \"He is disci- plined, fair, exacting and detail-oriented. Those around him give their very best and strive to emulate him.\" Dr. Thomas and his teammates distinguished themselves, Upstate, SUNY, and New York through their involvement in the Pfizer and BioNTech global COVID vaccine trial. The Upstate Global Health team enrolled hundreds of volunteers and were one of the first sites in the world to begin enrollment and one of the top enrollers in the U.S. Pfizer has applauded the SUNY team for their outstanding work and selected Dr. Thomas as their global coordi- nating principal investigator. In this role, he is tasked with conducting the final review of vaccine data prior to submission to the FDA. As Dr. Thomas is the first to remind us, COVID did not make all of the other problems go away. In this spirit, his Global Health and Microbiology teams have continued their work on developing improved treatments for HIV, exploring better ways to diagnosis TB, developing anti-heroin and fentanyl vaccines, working towards treat - ments for dengue, confronting the tick borne disease epidemic in NY, improving how we treat patients with sepsis, and many others. In the past four years alone, his teams have been awarded over $15 million in research funding from the NIH, DOD, industry and philanthropic organizations. Dr. Thomas has authored nine book chapters and has published 134 peer-reviewed articles in prestigious journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, Science, Nature, and the Lancet. During the epidemic, he has also been a frequent contributor to Forbes maga - zine and has been a steady presence on local, national and international news outlets such as CNN, WGN, CBS, and TRT World. Dr. Thomas is a 1992 graduate of Brown University, earning a BA with honors in Biomedical Ethics. He obtained an MD degree from Albany Medical College in 1996 and went on to complete his internal medicine residency and infectious diseases fellowship at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He retired from the U.S. Army in the rank of Colonel and was awarded the prestigious Legion of Merit. His nominators said it all: \"Dr. Thomas' devotion to Upstate is superlative.\" \"He is a SUNY superstar.\" 9Chancellor's Award for Excellence in classified Service Myron Martin Environmental Services Mr. Myron Martin works in the first COVID-19 unit at Upstate, where he has been the daily cleaner from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Since that time, he has taken only one sick day and five days of vacation. He is known for his commitment and dedica- tion. During COVID-19, the personal protective equip- ment (PPE) process changed often, and education and communication were updated daily in Environmental Services. \"Myron worked through the constant PPE changes, adhering to clean and disinfect requirements and ensuring best practices for our patients' safety,\" said one. He constantly adapted, asked questions and followed protocols while working in this ever-changing unit. He never questioned the amount of work COVID created and always adjusted his schedule to get as much work done as he could, even if it required him to do extra. \"Myron worked overtime, 34 out of 44 weekends,\" a nominator said. He cleaned 3,657 COVID-positive patient rooms in 44 weeks and performed approxi-mately 230 discharges as well. That meant handling a minimum of 3,887 bags of linen, a modest estimate for linen. It was likely double that amount \u2014 \"a huge work load!\" said a nominator. He handled more than 11,000 bags of trash between patient care and common use spaces. For him, overtime wasn't solely about making extra money, it was about maintaining a routine and caring for our patients. Mr. Martin is always willing to help others \u2014 whether patients, nurses or staff, for any of their needs. \"He practices team work, helps mankind and is always doing the right thing,\" said one. \"He works with all staff under stressful situations: code blues, restrictions and falls.\" Compassionate and concise while performing his daily cleaning, Mr. Martin wears his PPE while keeping the environment quiet and safe. He comes in early, works through and around staff and equipment, and has friendly words for patients. Patients have shared \"he is always positive, kind and dependable.\" \"He announces himself before entering a patient room and expresses good common sense when approaching patients with conversation.\" \"Myron is polite, he does a great job, and I miss him when he's not working,\" said a patient. Mr. Martin cares for clinical staff and his own team- mates just as he cares for patients and their families. Not only does he clean the patient care rooms, he also cleans public spaces, the nursing break room, staff bathrooms, hall spaces and common spaces. \"He takes pride in the outcome of his work.\" \"Myron has made a lasting impressions on folks \u2014 he has made the difference to staff, visitors and others,\" summed a nominator. 10SUNY Distinguished Service Professor Award David Duggan, MD, MACP Distinguished Service Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Described as a \"consummate physician,\" \"educator and academician,\" and a \"warm charismatic person who is most humble and dedicated,\" Dr. David Duggan has served Upstate Medical University and beyond for 35 years with excellence and distinction. Dr. Duggan joined the Upstate faculty in 1985 as an assistant professor and rose to become full professor in 1993. He was chair of the Department Medicine for 15 years, initially the country's youngest chair of an internal medicine department. During his tenure, the faculty more than doubled and the department expanded its clinical, educational and research activities while the residency program regularly achieved a 100 percent pass rate on certification boards. He subsequently served as associate dean for Clinical Initiatives, vice dean and vice president for Clinical Affairs, and held positions as medical director and chief quality officer of University Hospital. Dr. Duggan then was named senior vice president and dean of the College of Medicine. In this role he was responsible for re-establishing full accreditation with the LCME and implementing the first major curriculum revision in decades. \"As a dean, he was supportive, insightful and inspiring,\" said one. Supported by his leadership, the Upstate Cancer Center was built, the flagship enterprise for cancer care and research in central New York. He also spearheaded the opening of the clinic at the Auburn Community Hospital. Despite his hefty administrative duties, Dr. Duggan remains an astute clinician, continuing on the forefront of clinical care as well as teaching trainees and colleagues. His research has focused around his role in contributing to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB - now known as the Alliance), a multi-center National Cancer Institute supported group for more than 30 years. He has also held several grants from the National Institutes of Health and served as principal investigator for many of Upstate's hematology and oncology clinical trials. Dr. Duggan has served in several positions in the American College of Physicians, was a founding member of the Board of Directors of the Health Advancement Collaborative of Central New York (HAC-CNY), and president of the Onondaga County Medical Society and the New York Chapter of the American College of Physicians. He was a member of the New York State Education Department's team for site visits to international medical schools and on the Liaison Committee for Medical Education to U.S. medical schools. \"He has given his heart for quality improvement that spans well beyond Upstate Medical University,\" said one. \"Most importantly, Dr. Duggan has served as a trusted and compassionate physician, wise and supportive teacher, and respected colleague to thousands of patients, learners and peers,\" added another. He is co-author on papers that serve as landmark studies in his field. He has more than 50 peer-reviewed publications and text-book chapters, including the international standard \"William's Textbook of Hematology.\" Dr. Duggan's excellence has been recognized by numerous national professional organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the American Joint Committee on Cancer, the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. He has frequently been honored in the publi-cations \"Best Doctors in America\" and \"Who's Who in the East.\" He is recipient of numerous local and national prestigious awards, including being named a Master of the ACP, receiving the Syracuse Medical Alumni Association Clinical Faculty Teaching Award several times, and has been often selected as faculty marshal by the graduating class of Upstate medical students. Dr. Duggan received a BA from Hamilton College in 1975 and an MD degree from Upstate Medical University in 1979. From 1979 until 1982, he was an intern and resident in Internal Medicine at Tufts-New England Medical Center, where he also did his clinical fellowship in Hematology/Oncology. He was a research fellow in Hematology/Oncology at the same institution, from 1983 to 1985. \"Dr. Duggan's devotion to the institution, his selfless sacrifice of professional and personal time toward all missions of the University, and his advocacy for both those who service alongside and under his supervision is superlative.\" 11President's Award for Excellence and Leadership in Research Dr. Audrey Bernstein's work in ocular cell biology, and more specifically in cornea wound healing and exfoliation glaucoma, is lauded as groundbreaking in her field. An internationally recognized expert, Dr. Bernstein's work has revealed fundamental insights and potential targets for new ophthalmologic therapeutics. It benefits patients undergoing laser correction procedures, avoiding scar forma - tion, thereby increasing surgical success. Recently, she was granted a patent for her seminal contribution to anti-scarring therapy, a major vision-disrupting pathology. Before joining Upstate in 2017, Dr. Bernstein was an asso- ciate professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, with a secondary appoint- ment in the Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics. During this time, she raised $3.3 million in external research funding, for a grand total of $5.3 million over her 16-year independent research career. In 2019, Dr Bernstein was awarded tenure at Upstate Medical University. \"Within her first month, Audrey pulled us into her office and detailed a list of things she thought we needed to do. She shared things that worked throughout her career, but more importantly, she shared failures she had overcome in this process.\" Actively contributing to the department's intellectual environment, she participates in the faculty-only director's meeting and the large weekly CVR meeting. \"She has become a powerful voice for pragmatic and strategic thinking.\" \"Her energy, pragmatism and insight are a game changer for the Department,\" where she serves as the graduate student advisor in Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, among her engagement on various other committees. Her early NIH grants \u2014 described as \"rigorous,\" \"thorough,\" \"well-controlled\" and \"complete\" \u2014 initially focused on corneal scarring. Treatments for this need to be developed because it is the major cause of blindness in third-world countries. Her laboratory \u2014 with funded projects running through 2025 \u2014 is one of the more well-funded on campus. Her career portfolio includes four separate R01 projects, one of which was a co-PI, numerous foundation/philanthropic grants and an individual post-doctoral fellowship grant. Since joining our faculty, Dr. Bernstein obtained a new R01, the first ever Veterans Administration grant in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, and additional significant funding from the Mayer Family Foundation. Total NIH support for her research career is more than $5.4 million with an additional $1.1 million in foundation support and over $1.25 million in VA funding. Committed to the next generation of scientists, she has trained junior faculty, PhD candidates, undergraduates and high school students. \"Particularly impressive is her engage- ment with high school students, as few investigators are willing to invest their time in them, although it is exactly at this stage that a unique life experience may be so impactful.\" Dr. Bernstein has authored 30 peer-reviewed papers and two book chapters; seven of which were published since she joined our faculty. In addition, she has given a large number of invited talks, nationally and internationally. She serves on several study sections, including the NIH-National Eye Institute and she chairs the DoD study section for vision research. Dr. Bernstein continues to review for high impact jour - nals including Journal of Biological Chemistry, Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, PLOS One and eLIFE. She was elected by her international peers to the ARVO Program Committee, the largest and most respected international eye and vision research organization and, most recently, she has become an editor for vision research at eLIFE. Dr. Bernstein earned her BS degree in Biochemistry from Lehigh University in 1991 and her PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Kentucky, College of Medicine in 1999. She completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 2004. Audrey Bernstein, PhD Associate Professor, Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Cell and Developmental Biology 12President's Award for Excellence in Basic Research by a young investigator Bruce Knutson, PhD Associate Professor, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Dr. Bruce Knutson has established himself as a world expert in the biology and biochemistry of Pol I. His accomplishments promise important contributions to gene regulation that can lead to disease. In a short time, he has built a vibrant laboratory, published ground-breaking research articles, trained graduate and undergraduate students and obtained funding. \"Getting faculty in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology to agree on the top candidates is not usually an easy task, but in Dr. Knutson's case it was clear and unanimous.\" He joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 2014 and rapidly recruited personnel to his lab and initiated a vigorous research program. His approach to research is unique: it combines his rigorous training in biochemistry with a highly integrative approach whose dysregulation is associated with human cancer and develop- mental disorders. His work is characterized by a unique scientific combination. He has introduced a number of new technologies to Upstate. One required state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, for which he submitted and was funded for $1.4 million to purchase this equipment. \"This grant not only supported his research, the end goal of most junior faculty, but also significantly enhanced the overall research capabilities at Upstate.\" His understanding of RNA Pol I will likely have translational relevance and long-term implications for understanding cancer and cranio-facial developmental disorders \u2014 such as Treacher- Collins syndrome \u2014 and developing drugs for acute leukemias. Using an innovative teaching style, he is in tune with getting students engaged. He teaches by example \u2014 working alongside his students in the lab, who cannot help being inspired by his enthusiasm and curiosity. During the COVID-19 lockdown, he and one of his graduate students began a project that may be useful for drug development. Although he sets high standards for his students, he goes the extra mile to help teach them difficult laboratory techniques, as well as important life lessons. \"He somehow manages to combine an easy-going manner with an intense drive to understand the molecular underpinnings of human health and disease,\" said one. He has mentored more than 20 graduate and undergraduate students. \"He has high expectations for his lab, and his students meet and exceed those expectations, supported by Bruce's unfailing scientific enthusiasm.\" Notably, Dr. Knutson took the initiative to independently write two review papers during his postdoctoral fellowship. Since joining Upstate, he has published nine scientific papers. In 2018, he was given the Richard Cross Department Excellence Award at Upstate. To support his research efforts, he has obtained eight grants including an RO1 and RO3 from the National Institutes of Health, a Sinsheimer Scholar award and several additional small grants. He also obtained a $1.4 million grant to significantly upgrade the proteomics infrastructure at Upstate. Dr. Knutson has presented his work at invited international and national conferences. He is the director of the SUNY Upstate Medical University Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program that recruits summer students into labs and attracts excellent graduate students. He also helped develop and co-directs the new Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program at SUNY Upstate (PREP-Up) that started this year and focuses on students from underrepresented backgrounds. Dr. Knutson earned a BS in Biology from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point in 2002. He obtained his PhD in Biochemistry from Purdue University in 2007. He completed his postdoctoral fellowship at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 2014, where he received a competitive NIH K22 award to help start his own lab. \"If you had to have one person at the junior level to represent the best of Upstate's basic science mission, Bruce is that person,\" summed a nominator. 13President's Award for Excellence in Basic Research by a young investigator Sijun Zhu, MD, PhD Associate Professor, Department of Neuroscience and Physiology In a short span of time, Dr. Sijun Zhu has distin- guished himself in the field of neurobiology. A nominator said: \"Thus far, he has executed a textbook- perfect start to his independent career.\" Dr. Zhu joined Upstate in 2012 and was awarded the prestigious Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award from the March of Dimes in February 2014. This extremely competitive national award is given to only three applicants per year. Shortly after, he obtained his five- year R01 grant after a single revision in 2014, within two years of joining Upstate. Four years later, he secured a second NIH grant, an R21. In June 2020, he secured the far more challenging first- renewal of the original R01 grant, with funding until 2025. He is now moving to convert his R21grant into an R01. Today, Dr. Zhu is not only close to running a multi- R01- lab, he has impressively accomplished this without any monetary laboratory support. \"Dr. Zhu's research is basic in nature. It has clear relevance to both cancer and different neurological disorders. Dr. Zhu and his research should then be competitive not only for federal funding, but also funding from a large number of additional private funding sources,' said a nominator. An emerging leader in the study of transient amplifying progenitors \u2014 called intermediate neuron progenitors in Drosophila and dendritic guidance \u2014 he has published in prestigious journals, including Elife, Development and PLoS Genetics. \"These papers have been in excellent journals and have helped him obtain an excellent reputation in the field,\" said one. \"I am confident that he will make some of the important discoveries in the near future. Sijun has all the essential traits \u2014 highly intelligent, a skillful and meticulous experimentalist, an excellent writer and speaker, excellent interpersonal skills \u2014 to be a very successful independent principal investigator,\" added another. Dr. Zhu received his MD degree from Shanghai Medical University, China, in 1993. He obtained a MSc degree in 1996 in Physiology, also from Shanghai Medical University. He was granted a PhD degree in 2005 in Molecular and Integrative Physiology from the University of Illinois. He completed his post-doctoral fellowship in Physiology in 2012 at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Zhu has made these accomplishments as a single parent of two middle school children, while his wife is in Texas doing a residency. 14President's Award for Excellence in Basic Research by a young investigator Thomas Sanford, MD Assistant Professor, Department of Urology Dr. Thomas Sanford has shown remarkable accomplishments on various research projects while at Upstate in a short, two-year period. \"I have observed his leadership, success and humility at the international, national and local level,\" said a nominator. At the international level, Dr. Sanford served as one of the first authors on a multi-national study on artificial intelligence detection of COVID-19 in CT images that was recently published in Nature Communications and was the runner-up for Best Radiology Software at the 2020 Meet the Minnies Awards. \"His ability to seamlessly coordinate collabo- rative AI techniques, such as federated learning, is exceptionally rare,\" said one. At the national level, he was invited as a speaker to four 2019 conferences to share his expertise in artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer, as well as publishing multiple first-author 2020 manuscripts involving the utility of deep-learning analysis of the prostate using multiparametric MRI. Through continual study in the field after completing his Urologic Fellowship at the National Cancer Institute in 2019, he has shown demonstrated success and respect amongst his peers. At the local level, he was the only attending physician at SUNY Upstate Medical University to mentor two 2020 summer fellows. His support of these two medical students has evolved into larger student lab group meetings. While personally attending these meetings, \"he helps us students formulate our own hypoth- esis and collaborate to study each other's topics of interest. He truly cares about each one of us and our success,\" said a nominator. He has been an invited speaker at several scientific lectures and meetings. He is also the author of dozens of peer-reviewed publications and manuscripts. Dr. Sanford is a 2004 graduate of Dartmouth College, where he earned a BA in Psychology. He obtained his MD degree from the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine in 2010. From 2010 to 2011 he did his general surgery internship at the University of California, San Francisco. He remained there until 2016 as a urology resident. He was a fellow in urologic cancer at the National Cancer Institute until 2019, when Dr. Sanford joined Upstate Medical University. 15President's Award for Advancement of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Since the inception of the Clinical Skills Program in 2003, Annette Adams-Brown has been a standard- ized patient (SP) at Upstate. SPs are actors trained to act as real patients; they help medical professionals practice important skills in effective communication while examining patients. During the simulated exam, SPs present symp- toms and problems to medical professionals for them to learn and access clinical skills in a safe, controlled environment. Medical, nursing and health professions students, interns, residents and practicing clinicians receive training under SPs. The program seeks to recruit a diverse SP pool that allows learners to develop skills to interact effec-tively with the patient populations they will serve as clinicians. It is a challenge to retain SPs from under - represented populations; Ms. Adams-Brown brings a valued dimension of diversity to her role in the program, along with her expertise. Ms. Adams-Brown is one of Upstate's most skilled SPs. She is passionate about her work providing students with high quality learning experiences, and she makes a real difference in their skill acquisition. She portrays patients across a variety of clinical symp- toms and diagnoses and is remarkably facile in creating a setting which is remarkably realistic. \"We have been truly blessed to have her as a constant presence in our program from the begin - ning,\" said a nominator. \"Her presence is of great benefit to learners and their patients.\" A nominator complimented Ms. Adams-Brown: \"Recently, one of our African-American students expressed to me how meaningful it was for her to have the opportunity to perform her first pelvic exam on a patient who 'looked like her' and shared a perspective with her as a woman of color.\" Ms. Adams-Brown helped make this student's experience feel safe and meaningful. She has provided such a positive learning environment to countless students at Upstate.\" Ms. Adams-Brown has also served the Clinical Skills Program by recruiting, supporting and retaining other SPs of diverse backgrounds. She is a role model who has positively represented the program in various public venues, including media outlets in the community. She speaks passionately about her commitment to this important work. \"Her enthusiasm is contagious,\" commented a nominator. In her role as a gynecological teaching associate, she has helped teach countless Upstate students how to perform \"sensitive exams\" such as patient-centered pelvic and breast exams. \"I cannot underestimate how important this work is, and how much we value and respect Ms. Adams-Brown. It has been my honor to work with Annette for the past 17 years. It is my privilege to know Annette and to call her my friend,\" summed up a nominator. In addition to the Clinical Skills Program, Ms. Adams-Brown also teaches in Upstate's Sexual Assault Nurses program and at Clarkson University, Le Moyne College, SUNY Oneonta and St. Bonaventure University. She is a professional actress who has performed on stage and in commercials, training videos and movies, including a recent project with Paramount Pictures. As former associate artistic director of the Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company, Ms. Adams-Brown taught, designed, administered and facilitated creative collaborations between professional, student and community performers and artists. She has a BA in Theater Production from the University of Arizona. Annette Adams-Brown Teaching Associate, Clinical Skills Center 16President's Award for Excellence in Professional Service Steven McClintic, MHA, FACHE Hospital Administration Mr. Steven McClintic is an accomplished health care executive with more than 30 years of experience in providing leadership to acute care hospitals and health care systems. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. McClintic has assumed an ever-expanding scope of responsibility to meet the need for COVID-19 testing. His initial focus was to implement testing at Upstate, but it subsequently extended to include commu-nities throughout Central New York, the State University of New York (SUNY) system, and, ultimately to a variety of strategic entities across New York State. Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. McClintic focused on the rapid expansion of our commercial testing platforms so that Upstate could test inpatients, Emergency Department patients, referred ambulatory patients and symptomatic employees without interruption. As testing capacity increased, he extended our serv- ices. Upstate now tests all patients and has a voluntary surveillance testing program for our employees. He was also instrumental in establishing onsite and offsite testing venues at both Upstate campuses, the New York State Fairgrounds, the Regional Market, and Water Street, providing the most rapid turnaround and scope for testing in our region for our employees, city and county school children and our community. When it became clear that the need for testing in hotspots and rural regions of Central New York outstripped capacity, Mr. McClintic repurposed our mammography van to become the \"CoVan,\" a mobile testing unit that could be rapidly deployed to targeted areas of need in Syracuse, Onondaga County and neighboring counties. More recently, Mr. McClintic led the Upstate team working with Dr. Frank Middleton and Quadrant Biosciences to employ the Upstate-developed COVID-19 saliva test, now recognized as the world's most accurate saliva platform. The saliva test has been a game-changer for COVID-19 test expansion, allowing students at 64 SUNY campuses, as well as other college campuses across New York State, to have individual diagnostic testing. His team also implemented pooled surveillance testing for key area businesses such as the New York Power Authority, Albany Airport, Syracuse Stage, Syracuse Crunch, Syracuse Mets and Syracuse University Athletics. \"The expertise, networking, innovation and dedication required to execute COVID-19 testing on the scope and scale that Upstate has accomplished under Steve's leadership, is nothing short of phenomenal,\" said a nominator. During the pandemic, Mr. McClintic has supervised the expan - sion, training and deployment of personnel; he oversaw the development of Information Management and Technology (IMT) infrastructure to support test scheduling, reporting and billing; navigated legal and regulatory hurdles for platform acquisition and scope expansion; operationalized a new Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment-certified commercial saliva testing laboratory promoting technology transfer with our campus research partners; and researched and purchased more than 10 COVID-19 testing platforms to provide a secure and uninterrupted supply of clinical and surveillance testing. \"Steve did all of this while simultaneously serving as a de facto point of contact for university presidents across New York State,\" said one. \"Despite the enormous pressure on him, Steve has met each new challenge with a positive attitude, an indefatigable work ethic, and a commitment to successful execution of each initiative,\" added another. The impact of his service has greatly impacted Upstate, our community, Central New York and the SUNY system. His efforts have helped keep our patients, staff and communities safe and have helped keep our schools, universities and businesses open. Mr. McClintic is a 1978 graduate of Purdue University where he received his BS in General Science/Administrative Science. He obtained a master's degree in Hospital and Health Administration from the University of Iowa in 1980. He is also a fellow in the American College of Healthcare Administrators. 17President's Award for Excellence in Faculty Service Dr. Scott Schurman is the leader and driving force in developing pediatric kidney transplant services and pedi - atric dialysis services at Upstate. In addition, he has distinguished himself as an outstanding faculty member through his tireless work supporting UUMAS, the faculty practice plan and clinical system, at Upstate. He is well known on the national pediatric nephrology scene as a clinical leader. He is well known regionally as \"the\" referral physician for pediatricians seeking high- level pediatric nephrology consultation. Further, there is always at least one learner on his popular teaching service, for which he has developed a well-organized curriculum. Dr. Schurman is also director of Pediatric Outpatient Services and vice-chair of Pediatrics for Clinical Affairs. Between those two positions, he employs his considerable expertise at planning outpatient services, addressing issues and providing advice to other pediatric leaders. \"Despite his multiple clinical and administrative roles, Dr. Schurman never gets jaded nor takes the easy way out,\" said a nominator. He consistently does what is right, rather than what is easy. He loves his work and his patients, and pours consid-erable energy into his important roles at multiple levels of leadership. He has been a constant source of strength and counsel for successive Pediatrics department chairs and UUMAS leaders, and a strong clinician and developer of clinical programs. \"One of the best and strongest of Upstate,\" he tire- lessly provides leadership in UUMAS in many ways and played a key role in the development and integration of the practice plan across the medical service groups. A natural organizer, he collaborates well with nursing staff and hospital administrators as well as other physicians. He is skilled at counseling colleagues with clinical and workforce concerns, as he speaks as a credible fellow clinician who has \"walked in their shoes.\" His considerable financial knowledge and experience with payors is especially valuable when doing strategic planning for these areas. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when Upstate needed to rapidly transition several pediatrics clinics from in-person to virtual, Dr. Schurman took the lead. He was in the forefront as Upstate moved provider practices to keep ambulatory patients safely out of the office and tran-sition to telehealth during the early peak months of the pandemic. He was constantly clarifying issues related to telehealth and appropriate reimbursement from insurers. He pursued and won support from insurers to pay our providers evaluation and management payments for tele- health, including audio only for patients who could not manage or did not have access to video. As the pandemic has continued, \"Dr. Schurman has continued to provide a model of stability and integrity to Pediatrics faculty members who feel overwhelmed, discouraged or left-out. He helps solve novel problems and make 'common sense' leadership suggestions and interventions that others do not see,\" noted a nominator. He has been previously honored with the Upstate Gold Standard award. Dr. Schurman received BA and MD degrees from Ohio State University in 1983 and 1987, respectively. He completed his internship and residency in Pediatrics at Children's Mercy Hospital University of Missouri in 1990. He did his post-doctoral fellowship in Pediatric Nephrology at Children's Hospital Medical Center University of Cincinnati from 1990 to 1993. Scott Schurman, MD Director, Division of Pediatric Nephrology Associate Professor, Department of Pediatrics 18President's Award for Excellence in Faculty Service Dr. Telisa Stewart has exhibited her intrinsic sense of service during the COVID-19 pandemic. She has proven to be an invaluable resource to Upstate University Hospital, Upstate Medical University, the community and New York state. Before joining the Upstate faculty in 2012, Dr. Stewart was director of Community Prevention and Education at Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center. Currently, Dr. Stewart's primary appointment is in the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine where she teaches a variety of public health courses and actively engages in research. She also has appointments in the Department of Geriatrics, Department of Urology, and Department of Medicine - Infectious Disease. As part of her mission to serve the broader community and make certain that underrepre-sented voices are heard, she has volunteered to work with the Madison County Department of Health, Syracuse Court System and with Focus Greater Syracuse. At the onset of the pandemic, she was added to the daily Upstate briefing known as Incident Command, serving as co-lead for the Epidemiology section. In this position, \"Dr. Stewart has gone well outside of her job expec- tations, working tirelessly to keep our community and institution informed,\" said a nominator. She has been a key contributor to a regional case monitoring Dashboard and has worked continually to create effective public health messaging for Upstate, Syracuse and Onondaga County, and state governments, including the Governor's office. Additionally, she partnered with IMT to design surveillance systems within our commu-nity, and has been a key voice in determining where we can \"hot-spot\" testing efforts as clus- ters of COVID-19 emerged in pockets around Syracuse and Onondaga County. She also consulted with regional hospitals with their creation of COVID-19 surveillance systems so they could function through this crisis. A nominator said, \"They have come to trust her as one of the family,\" when commenting on the weekly presentations she gave to the Syracuse Fire Department during the on-going pandemic. Central New York manufacturers and busi- nesses relied on her briefings. Her research \u2014 centered on an analysis of local social distancing \u2014 gave way to surveys for employee and student wellness, and vaccine hesitancy. While many of these initiatives were a team effort, \"Dr. Stewart was a linchpin in getting them created, implementing each tool to communicate epidemiological and surveillance data to those in need.\" \"I have come to rely upon her expertise,\" noted a colleague. Another added: \"Telisa has truly exceeded all expectations, working day and night and through weekends \u2014 to support our institution and our community in the middle of a crisis.\" Dr. Stewart was also a regular contributor to the epidemiological reports that were presented to Incident Command, and to the use of health behavior science to inform messaging. This extended to her contributions to survey development and interpretation for these purposes. Dr. Stewart received her BA degree in Sociology from the University of Southern Maine in 2002. She obtained a Master of Public Health degree in Health Policy and Management from the University of Massachusetts School of Public Health and Health Sciences in 2005. She was awarded a Doctor of Public Health degree in Community Health and Prevention from Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health in 2010.

Dr. Slutzky demonstrates her skill in librarianship through her outstanding reference and liaison services, where she provides biomedical and health information services to all members of our Upstate community \u2014 with a focus on faculty, students and residents. She works side-by-side with educators and learners alike, as an active member on systematic review teams, as a co-author of publications and as an instructor for information literacy sessions. \"When working with students she always goes the extra mile, taking time to meet with them about assign- ments and helping formulate effective search strategies and search the literature,\" said a nominator. This year, when classes moved to remote learning due to COVID-19, she was first to jump in and learn how to use WebEx and Zoom to meet with students and provide information literacy classes. She serves the university through her committee involvement, liaison service and volunteerism, including her roles as the liaison to the College of Health Professions, Psychiatry Department, Geriatrics Department and multiple resident groups, as well as giving her time to university, college, and library committees. Within the profession, she is a board member of the local chapters of the Upstate Special Libraries Association and Beta Phi Mu, the international honor society for library and information studies. Dr. Slutzky also volunteers her time to Upstate and the community. As a member of Pet Partners of CNY, she coordinates therapy dog visits for students in the library and similar visits for Upstate's nurses during National Nurses Week. \"There were times when therapy dogs and their humans would cancel and Dr. Slutzky would bring her own therapy dog ... because she knew how much the students and staff looked forward to interacting and visiting with a furry friend,\" a nominator commented. She has also volunteered at the Ronald McDonald house with Pet Partners, bringing joy and easy moments to its guests. Her scholarship and continuing professional growth are perennial. She regularly engages in profes- sional and faculty development opportunities, attends webinars and trainings and is forever learning from those around her. \"What is more \u2014 she helps perpetuate learning and growth by sharing the skills and information she has learned,\" said one. Dr. Slutzky is a 1981 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Cornell University, where she earned a BA in Psychology and went on to attain a PhD in psychological statistics and research methodology in 1986. She earned an MSLIS in Library and Information Science from Syracuse University in 2010. 20President's Award for Excellence in Teaching Jennette Ball, DC Assistant Professor Department of Cell and Developmental Biology Colleges of Medicine and Health Professions Since 2016, Dr. Jennette Ball has been an assistant professor and also the Musculoskeletal Curricular unit co- director. In the College of Medicine, she is a Gross Anatomy and Neuroanatomy small group instructor and laboratory instructor. In the College of Health Professions' Doctor of Physical Therapy program, she is Gross Anatomy small group instructor and labo - ratory instructor. She has been described as \"one of the giants in her depart - ment,\" and \"an artist in teaching.\" She steps up when needed and makes her team stronger by her contributions in the lab and in teaching. During the coron-avirus pandemic, she protected her students by teaching in personal protective equipment and continued lunches with them via Zoom. Dr. Ball consistently goes above and beyond to help her students excel and learn to love anatomy. \"She is one of the most passionate professors I have ever had. She has become not only a trusted mentor but a friend as well.\" Dr. Ball is a very organized in an important unit where students go into gross anatomy labs for first-time dissections. \"I witnessed her compassionate approach to students there,\" said a nominator. Gross Anatomy is known as a daunting course for most medical students. With teachers like Dr. Ball, anatomy becomes a class that students enjoy. It is commonplace to find Dr. Ball in the lab helping students discover and reinforce all the structures necessary for exams. \"She would not only run through all the structures, but make you think critically about the structures, so you were more prepared for the exam.\" Energetic and engaging, she presents explanations of diffi- cult concepts very clearly and is able to answer questions on the spot. One of Dr. Ball's greatest strengths is her ability to connect and communicate with students. \"She has the gift of being a natural teacher,\" said a nominator. \"Dr. Ball's expertise, teaching abilities and hard work are the definition of a first-rate faculty,\" noted a nominator. Besides teaching medical students, Dr. Ball is a leader in DPT students' anatomical education. She works around the clock, often skipping lunch, during evenings and weekends to ensure that students adequately grasp the material. \"She went out of her way to accommodate my studies whether it be extra office hours, emails responding to questions, or just working through the dissection in the anatomy lab together.\" She demonstrates a wholehearted commitment not only to providing quality academic instruction, but also supports her students' well-being. She exhibits a warmth that is unparalleled. \"I still delight in exchanging emails or running into her on campus. She is someone who truly takes the time to get to know her colleagues and students,\" wrote a former student. In 2019, Dr. Ball was elected to the Upstate Medical University Gamma Chapter of the national Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society by AOA student members, a tribute from them for influencing their education and developing their careers. Dr. Ball majored in pre-medical Biology at Hartwick College, pre-chiropractic at SUNY Morrisville and went on to earn her bachelor's degree in Biology from Regents College in Albany in 1997. She obtained a Doctor of Chiropractic degree from New York Chiropractic College in 1997. She received a master's degree in Clinical Anatomy, also from New York Chiropractic College, in 2010. \"I am thankful to have had her as a mentor. Her enthusiasm, knowledge, kindness and demeanor are second to none,\" summed a grateful student. 21President's Award for Excellence in Teaching Paula Farrell, MD Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine Binghamton Campus Dr. Paula Farrell has been described as \"an outstanding educator, role model, mentor and colleague\" at the Clinical Campus and to the greater Binghamton community. An Upstate alumna, she showed early leadership skills and teaching promise while she was a student here. Dr. Farrell began her career as an attending neonatologist in Indianapolis. She then returned to Syracuse to join Upstate's faculty along with a position at Crouse Hospital. Later, Dr. Farrell took a position as instructor in the Department of Pediatrics at UHS Wilson Medical Center. Since that time, she has been the medical director of the Level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at UHS Wilson Medical Center. In 2020, Dr. Farrell was appointed site director for the pedi- atric clerkship. Her students said: \"Dr. Farrell has been amazing to work with. \"She helped me more than she knows.\" \"She made me comfortable working with tiny babies.\" \"Dr. Farrell really cares about students and their learning.\" She has authored several publications on bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants. Recently, she joined a national research project on Perinatal COVID-19 infections. She has served on the Admissions Committee at Upstate and has been a member of the Clinical Campus Executive Committee. She is also actively involved in many other profes - sional organizations as well as in her local medical community. Dr. Farrell studied Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, where she earned a BS degree in 1989. She went on to earn her MD degree from Upstate Medical University in 1994. She completed her residency and a fellowship in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine in Pediatrics at Tufts Medical Center in 1997 and 2000, respectively. 22President's Award for Excellence in Teaching Jennifer A. Nead, MD, FAAP Pediatric Hospitalist, Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital Assistant Professor, Pediatrics Clerkship Director, College of Medicine Third-year Pediatrics rotation Dr. Jennifer Nead has distinguished herself as an educator who demonstrates a high standard of clinical performance. She has created flourishing programs within the Pediatrics department that have developed additional spinoff projects. When she arrived at Upstate in 2012, there was no structured protocol for resident teams to transition care from one to the next. The process took more than two hours a day. Expectations and communication were unclear. Dr. Nead learned about a structured pediatric acute care hand-off called \"IPASS\" that she brought to Upstate. IPASS \u2014 Illness severity, Patient summary, Action items, Situational awareness, and Synthesis by the receiver \u2014 is a tool used by hospitals that had shown quicker, more effective hand- offs with 70 percent reduced error. The results in adopting this at Upstate have been that hand-offs take no more than 20 minutes, have fewer errors and are more complete. She approached the implementation process as an educator, mentoring learners on the process. The IPASS team grew into \"the PRACTICE committee\" \u2014 Provider Resilience And Communication Training in Clinical Environments \u2014 which involves more residents and faculty. They took on Communication, Hand-offs, Diversity/Inclusion, Wellness, Resiliency. It also developed spin-off concepts such as the Resident Care Mentors, a big sister/big brother resident-to-resi - dent mentoring program. Work from the PRACTICE committee led to multiple national conference presentations by Upstate residents and faculty, and further mentoring relationships. As clerkship director, she meets directly with every student who rotates at the Syracuse campus. She also works very closely with the Binghamton Campus Pediatric Clerkship team. She mentors, addresses professionalism concerns, gives and seeks feedback and is constantly re-evaluating the clerkship to ensure the best possible student experience. She helped develop and subsequently tailor an innovative OPT \u2014 Oral Presentation Tool \u2014 to help students address fami-lies about their child's acute medical condition, at the bedside in lay terms. OPT sets standards for the delivery of information, how much time to spend, and where to focus the presentation. When challenged with the COVID-19 pandemic, she demon - strated exceptional responsiveness and compassion. She quickly developed online patient evaluations, redistributed inpatient learning experiences and adapted assignments to cover educational needs. \"Dr. Nead gave me some of the most helpful feedback I received during my clerkship. She invited all of us to be a part of the process,\" said a nominator. Dr. Nead also maintains an active pediatric hospitalist practice and presents her work at national meetings. She is the author of book chapters and multiple papers in pediatric hospital medicine literature. Dr. Nead is a 2002 magna cum laude graduate of Cornell University, where she obtained a BS in Biology. She is a 2006 cum laude graduate of Upstate Medical University, where she earned her MD degree. She completed a pediatric residency at Brown University/Hasbro Children's Hospital in 2009. From 2009 to 2011, she was a fellow at Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children's Hospital. In 2018, she completed the Advancing Pediatric Educator eXcellence (APEX) Teaching Program. \"Jen is an exceptional physician and educator. She is an example of what we want educators to be here at Upstate,\" aptly summed a nominator. 23President's Award for Outstanding Voluntary Faculty Service Craig John Byrum, MD Clinical Professor of Pediatrics Clinical Professor of Medicine For four decades, Dr. Craig John Byrum has been a member of the Upstate Pediatrics Department faculty. He is pedi- atric cardiologist in the Pediatric Cardiology Associates practice that is closely affiliated with the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital.

He has been the local expert in the diagnosis and management of pediatric dysrhythmias since that time. Dr. Byrum performed the first cardiac ablation procedure on a patient of any age in our area, in 1994. He has also provided general pediatric cardiology care for many children from Central New York and beyond. Although trained as a pediatric cardiolo- gist, he has also been quite involved in care of adults with congenital heart disease. He was also a long-standing member of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit committee. Dr. Byrum has invested a great deal of time in education and mentoring of young pediatricians and medical students. He was an important faculty member in an Upstate pediatric cardiology fellowship that existed in his early days, helping to train pediatric cardiologists who currently practice across the country. He was a member of the Pediatrics Department residency committee, including five years as committee co-chair. Dr. Byrum has been one of the principal faculty members for the very popular Pediatric Cardiology elective, consistently earning kudos from trainees for his teaching. He often coaches these trainees through preparation of end-of-rotation presenta-tions. Whether he coached them or not, Dr. Byrum typically attends and actively participates in these presentations, even when they take occur on his non-clinical days. Dr. Byrum is a graduate of SUNY Upstate College of Medicine, earning his MD degree in 1975. He completed his Pediatrics residency at Upstate, after which he did a fellowship in Pediatric Cardiology at the University of Michigan, before returning to practice in Syracuse. Michael Federico, DO Family Medicine, Binghamton Campus Dr. Michael Federico has been prac- ticing medicine for nearly 15 years and \"has been a fabulous addition to the teaching staff in the Family Medicine Department.\" From the day he started, he has been highly regarded by the students who have been assigned to him \u2014 mainly because he is a physi- cian who believes in primary care education and takes great interest in the professional and personal development of the future healers that work with him. He is a community leader in the areas of hospital medicine and public health; he has made a striking difference in the quality of health care in the Binghamton community. Dr. Federico has students with him nearly each moment of his clinical practice, whether outpatient or inpatient.

Dr. Federico has established himself as one of the best family physicians in the Southern Tier and certainly one of the most highly sought after teachers in the clinical arts. Dr. Federico is a 2005 magna cum laude graduate of the University of Massachusetts, where he earned his BS degree. He received his DO degree from the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in New York in 2011. In 2014, he completed his Family Practice residency at Wilson Memorial Hospital, where he was awarded Senior Resident of the Year. 24Philip (PJ) Messina, RT(T), LRT(T) College of Health Professions Mr. Philip Messina has dedicated his entire career to his patients and Upstate students. He has a long history of clinical excellence where he practices radiation therapy in the Southern Tier at UHS Wilson. He consistently receives outstanding comments from students regarding his patience, excellent teaching and consis- tently helpful feedback. Students cite his compassionate nature combined with his clinical expertise as inspiring. From his students: \"PJ is very passionate about his work and teaching students. He truly cares about each individual patient, and he encourages his students to treat their patients with the same level of compas- sion. I am honored to be able to work with PJ and learn from him.\" \"UHS Wilson is a genuine treasure for therapy students at any point in their clinical experience. PJ is a phenomenal clinical supervisor and therapist who takes the time to teach and listen in a manner which can make the most nervous/uneasy student find their own and thrive.\" \"PJ was the best clinical supervisor I had throughout my education! He's patient and kind, and takes the time to explain everything very thoroughly. His best trait as a radiation therapist is that he always makes it abundantly clear that the patients come first, period. I learned so much from him and I'm very thankful to say he was part of me becoming the therapist I am today!\" \"PJ is a phenomenal clinical supervisor. He cares so much about the students that come through UHS. He goes out of his way to make students feel comfortable here. He is very good at teaching, not only how to do things but goes on to explain why we do things. If we ever needed something he would go out of his way to get it done. He is a really great person.\" Mr. Messina received an associate's degree in Applied Science from Upstate Medical University in 1991. He has a professional certification issued by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, Radiation Therapy, also in 1991. President's Award for Outstanding Voluntary Faculty Service Jeanna Marraffa, PharmD, MPH, DABAT Associate Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine Assistant Clinical Director, Upstate New York Poison Center Dr. Jeanna Marraffa's exceptional service is an outstanding example of clin-ical and educational collaboration in support of students, faculty, providers and the community. Dr. Marraffa has been a valued member of the team at Upstate Medical University since 2007. The College of Nursing has had a unique opportunity to work with her through the development, submission and ongoing deployment, of its HRSA- funded grant program for the education of Upstate's Family Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner students in Opioid and Substance Use Disorders. \"When we approached Dr. Marraffa to ask content questions, she willingly availed her time to assist us, providing countless hours of counsel and advice from her experience as a clinical toxicologist,\" said a nominator. Once the grant program was funded, Dr. Marraffa assumed the role of site lead for the Poison Center as well as liaison for toxicology content. On a regular basis, she voluntarily works with our students through both online modules and precepted time in the Poison Center, providing valuable experiences that are uniquely formative to student success. She is a member of the grant program's advisory board, providing ongoing counsel and content advisory. \"As the prin-cipal investigator of this grant, I continue to be grateful for Dr. Marraffa's expert collaboration and willingness to assist with many elements of the grant,\" said one. Dr. Marraffa obtained her Doctor of Pharmacy at Union University, Albany College of Pharmacy in 2001. She completed her residency and fellowship at Upstate Medical University in 2002 and 2004, respectively. She obtained a certificate in Public Health from the University at Albany in 2019 and a master's degree in Public Health from the same institution in 2020. 25Special Recognition: Pew Scholar in Biomedical Sciences Upstate Medical University is honored to introduce its first Pew Scholar, Alaji Bah, PhD. Across the U.S., prominent research insti- tutions were each allowed to nominate a single young investigator for this year's Pew competition. Out of the 198 nominated, Dr. Bah was one of 22 researchers chosen to receive four years of funding to invest in exploratory research. The award acknowl- edges Dr. Bah's talent as a researcher and understanding of intricate scientific processes. Dr. Bah uses chemistry, physics and biology in his research to study how the genome is organized and regulated. Dr. Bah's lab works on proteins that are \"intrinsically disordered.\" Although these proteins do not have a single defined shape, they are able to interact with each other and with other proteins to allow cells to rapidly respond to different conditions. The Bah lab is targeting how intrinsically disordered proteins affect DNA methylation, one of the mechanisms by which genes are turned on or off. This process is important in many diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. For example, tumor suppressor genes are the body's cancer-braking system; they can turn off and lose their ability to suppress cancer growth. However, if these genes could be turned back on by manipulating methylation, new cancer therapies could become available. If Dr. Bah's ideas are proven, it could lead to better anti-cancer medications and support the mission of the Pew Scholars Program: to support independent research of outstanding individuals who lead to the advancement of human health. Alaji Bah, PhD Assistant Professor, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 26President's Award for Excellence in Philanthropic Service, Corporate Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI) Throughout its 21-year relationship with the Upstate Foundation, Dialysis Clinic Inc. (DCI) has remained stead- fast in its commitment to \"care of the patient\" through philanthropic support that totals nearly $2 million. DCI is a nonprofit leader in dialysis, serving end-stage renal disease patients. Based in Nashville, TN, it is a national organization that typically partners with academic medical universities to run its clinics. In Syracuse, the company part - ners with Upstate's Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology at University Dialysis Center on East Genesee Street, and satellite offices in Auburn and Oswego. DCI began its charitable journey in 1997 with a gift to Friend in Deed, the annual fund for Upstate University Hospital. Its relationship with the Foundation then continued through support of the Upstate Gala for 14 consecutive years. In 2012, DCI established the Edward T. Schroeder, MD/Dialysis Clinic, Inc. Endowed Professorship in Nephrology at the Foundation. The professorship celebrates Dr. Edward T. Schroeder's lifelong work to improve the care of patients with kidney disease. Further, it ensures enduring growth and leadership in the field by supporting a nephrology faculty member in his or her work at Upstate Medical University. Staying true to its commitment to continued education and research, the company created the DCI Nephrology Education Fund to encourage the development of clinical and academic nephrologists, and promote nephrology education and research. Funding has supported education of medical students in the area of renal physiology and helped establish the Lupus, Autoimmunity, Inflammation and Immune Health Center of Excellence (LACE). LACE has been instrumental in driving research and building awareness for systematic autoimmune diseases including Lupus Nephritis throughout upstate New York. In addition, two major equipment needs were purchased through the fund: a mass spectrophotometer and image stream flow cytometer. The year 2021 is a significant one for DCI \u2014 it celebrates its 50th anniversary. The company is proud and honored to have cared for patients living with chronic kidney disease since 1971. As its mission states, \"the care of the patient is our reason for existence.\" The Upstate Foundation is joined by the Division of Nephrology in applauding the loyalty and commitment of Dialysis Clinic, Inc. to Upstate's mission of patient care, education and research with the presentation of this award. 27 At 34, Brendan Dunuwila has the distinction of being the Upstate Foundation's youngest donor to contribute more than $100,000. Further, his giving history with the Foundation spans only seven years! This is a remarkable record of philanthropy that is the result of his younger brother's journey with cancer and the time he spent as an inpatient at Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. During Brendan's visits with his brother, he realized that his family was extremely fortunate in that all they had to focus on was his brother's health. They did not share some of the worries that many other families were experiencing while at the bedside of a sick child: how to pay the rent or mortgage, child care costs for siblings at home, transportation to and from another city, or even simply parking on a daily basis. This greatly concerned a 20-some- thing Brendan. Following his brother's ordeal from which he fully recov- ered, Brendan approached the Foundation. After a thorough vetting process, he opened The Hornet Fund, a patient assistance fund for families at the Children's Hospital. The name is a nod to the mascot of his high school alma mater, Fayetteville-Manlius. Every year, Brendan meets with his fund advisors to hear how the fund has helped; encourage them to spend more; and replenish the fund. Replenish the fund...hearing that the fund has a low balance at these meetings is music to this philanthropist's ears. It means the funds are being put to good use. The Hornet Fund has provided funding so that a three-year-old boy could be medically transported from the Children's Hospital to Pittsburgh for a lifesaving multi- visceral transplant. It assisted a young Amish boy who had been kicked in the head by a horse with home care following discharge because his family did not have health insurance. When Brendan became aware that a student in Upstate's College of Medicine was in crisis and couldn't afford to take a USMLE Step 1 exam, he authorized payment from The Hornet Fund. Brendan is also very generous with his time. He is currently a member of the Professional Advisory Council for the Foundation's planned giving program. He has also been active with the Foundation's grateful patient and family program, sharing his family's positive experience with the program's physician and hospital administration philan - thropic councils. He has graciously allowed the Foundation to feature his story in various publications and on social media. The Upstate Foundation is pleased to present Brendan with this well-deserved award. President's Award for Excellence in Philanthropic Service, Individual Brendan Dunuwila, CFP 28President's Award for distinguished service J. Ryan McMahon, II County Executive, Onondaga County County Executive J. Ryan McMahon, II is the 4th County Executive. He assumed office on November 2, 2018. County Executive McMahon started his career in public service as a Syracuse City Councilor in 2005 after being elected at age 25. He was reelected in 2007 for a second term and quickly earned a reputation as a bi-partisan problem solver. In 2011, County Executive McMahon was elected to the 15th District of the Onondaga County Legislature which includes portions of the City of Syracuse, the town of Geddes and the town of Onondaga. He subse- quently was elected chairman of the County Legislature in 2012 by his fellow legislators, becoming the youngest chairman in county history. As chairman, his primary focus was job creation and ensuring good fiscal disci-pline in the county. Under his leadership, property taxes were brought down to historic lows. Upon taking office, County Executive McMahon has placed a focus on three main initiatives: poverty, infrastructure and economic development. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the County Executive acted swiftly, joining Mayor Walsh in canceling most county and city gatherings as of March 12, 2020, proclaiming a state of emergency on March 14, 2020, and, two days later, requiring symptomatic county residents to self-quarantine pending a negative COVID-19 test result. Decisions like these helped the public understand the gravity of the building threat to public health. In the subsequent months, as surges of the virus across Central New York ebbed and flowed, County Executive McMahon went on to issue no less than six additional executive orders to protect the public during the pandemic: requiring masks be worn indoors at senior living facilities, daycare facilities and the New York State Fair; limiting third-party food delivery service fees; and requiring all staff of Onondaga County schools either be fully vaccinated or tested weekly for COVID-19. From the early days of the pandemic through June 2021, County Executive McMahon hosted regular public health news conferences - sometimes two per day - often featuring medical and scientific leaders from the Onondaga County Health Department and SUNY Upstate Medical University. These briefings helped keep county residents apprised of COVID-19 trends in the region, opportunities for testing and vacci- nations, as well as other interventions being taken by the county. Shortly after vaccines became available, under McMahon's leadership, Onondaga County began opening and operating a number of free vaccination clinics. The County Executive has remained steadfast in encouraging vaccinations as the single best tool for minimizing outbreaks in the community. 29President's Award for distinguished service Ben Walsh, MPA Mayor, City of Syracuse As the 54th mayor of the city of Syracuse, Mr. Ben Walsh has partnered with Upstate Medical University and has responsibly guided the citizens of Syracuse through the COVID-19 pandemic with honorable distinction. In January 2020, Mayor Walsh delivered his State of the City address from the campus of SUNY Upstate Medical University. His remarks included an update on the state's $70 million investment to create a regional Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) high school, which is expected to help serve as a pipeline for local students toward careers at advanced biomedical institutions like Upstate. Coordinating efforts by the City of Syracuse with Onondaga County and other local governments, Mayor Walsh took decisive action early in the pandemic, closing non-essential areas of city buildings to public access, moving many city employees to remote work, announcing a COVID-19 emergency loan program for small local businesses, and taking steps to ensure essen- tial services for public safety and infrastructure could continue. Joining his fellow mayors and local government leaders across the nation, Mayor Walsh successfully convinced congressional lawmakers to ensure that small-to-mid-sized cities and counties would be eligible for federal emergency financial relief during the pandemic. Working with the Syracuse Common Council, Mayor Walsh developed city budgets in both 2020 and 2021 focused not only on economic recovery, but also on investing in public safety and health services. Mayor Walsh's weekly public health briefings to the community helped keep residents apprised of the state of the COVID-19 crisis across Syracuse, and often featured leaders from schools, city service agencies and public safety departments. In an effort to protect city residents as the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 began surging across Central New York, Mayor Walsh announced a requirement that all City of Syracuse employees be vaccinated or tested weekly for the virus, and that new employees provide proof of vaccination prior to beginning their duties. Mayor Walsh earned a BA in Political Science from Ithaca College. He attended Syracuse University, where he received a MS in Public Administration from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. 30Academy of Upstate Educators The Academy of Upstate Educators was created with two primary goals. (1) To provide recognition to a group of innovative and excellent educators who demonstrate the significant commitment to education that is a core part of our mission. (2) To provide a resource to faculty colleagues and administrative leaders as they address education-related issues. Members of the Academy are individuals who have consistently demonstrated excellence in educational activities. Excellence is defined as being a leader, innovator and/or mentor in the field of education. A leader is someone who is an agent of change and moves the field forward such that student learning is enhanced significantly by his or her influence. Academy members have also made a commitment to Academy activities that will enhance the educational environment at Upstate. Examples of these activities include: serve as peer reviewers of teaching for faculty colleagues; consult to faculty colleagues on issues related to assessment, curriculum design and course development; serve as consultants to administrative leaders concerning education-related issues as requested. Academy of Upstate Educators 31The Academy of Upstate Educators inducts Amy DeBlois, PT, DPT, NCS Board Certified Neurologic Specialist Dr. Amy DeBlois is an outstanding teacher who uses innovative techniques to motivate, support and inspire her students. She provides a safe, collaborative learning community for students to become critical thinkers and lifelong learners. She engages students through clinical cases and labs, and fosters a collabo - rative style for students to learn from one another. As a creative educator, she explains topics in both basic neuroanatomy along with clinical applications in a variety of neurologic conditions in accessible, dynamic ways. She connects current and evolving evidence into the curriculum, allowing for discussion and evidence-guided care. She fosters critical thinking skills and encourages her students to think \"outside of the box\" to find solutions when encountering complex cases. From her experience as a clinician, Dr. DeBlois articulates complex concepts in neurologic physical therapy to enhance the practical and clinical educa-tion of physical therapy students. As a clinical advisor, she is patient, approachable and compassionate. Students find her application of real-life context and case studies a refreshing approach to studying theory. She began teaching three main courses \u2014 arguably the most difficult classes within the neuro-logic curriculum of the physical therapy program \u2014 at Upstate in 2014. She has adapted every course to ensure that each student has the support needed to succeed. She has created fulfilling content and assign- ments, synthesized lectures, and provided hands-on learning along with lab practice. During COVID-19, she adapted her teaching to online learning using Flipgrid \u2014 which \"creates a classroom\" for students to upload short videos of themselves so instructors can then respond with feed- back. She also sought out programs and online tools that allowed students to continue their lab work and incorporate real-life patients into their studies. These are a sampling of the methods that Dr. DeBlois used to diversify her multiple learning strategies. \"I had the opportunity during an interdisciplinary discussion with Upstate professors to share Amy's unique and thoughtful strategies. The professors acknowledged how innovative and resourceful these were and hoped to use them.\" Alumni have reported that Dr. DeBlois' content area in neurological physical therapy has allowed them to further their education and become confi- dent working with patients. \"She encouraged me to push myself to become the best clinician I could be through a post-graduate program,\" said a student. Dr. DeBlois' patient-centered research aims to have a positive effect on patients with Parkinson's Disease, among other neurologic disorders. She guides her students throughout the research process from grant writing to publication. She has a knack for creating a positive learning environment through the use of signage. \"Stay Positive,\" \"You've Got This,\" \"Make Today Great,\" flank the walls of the third floor of the Academic Building to help students stay upbeat during the pandemic. She has also created student competitions, relay races, quizzes, contests and games with buzzers \u2014 all to promote creative learning. Dr. DeBlois is a co-author on book chapters that are used by physical therapy education programs across the country and she is currently revising a chapter on spinal cord injury. She was given the President's Award for Excellence in Teaching at Upstate in 2017 and has been chosen with the honor of faculty marshal at Upstate commencement twice, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Dr. DeBlois received both bachelor's degree and master's degree from Ithaca College in 1998 and 1999, respectively. She earned her post-professional doctorate in Physical Therapy from Upstate Medical University in 2015. 32 33Past Convocation Award Recipients SUNY BOARD OF TRUSTEES' AWARDS 1988 Robert B.
