Method: Two reviewers conducted a review of the selected articles: one evaluated the methodological quality of the studies and the other performed a cross-check. Divergences of opinion were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Result: A total of 23 articles met the inclusion criteria and were thus included in the review. Most studies reported that the administration of various forms of therapeutic massage exerted a beneficial effect on factors related to the growth of preterm infants. The causes indicated by the researchers for these anthropometric benefits included increased vagal activity, increased gastric activity, increased serum insulin levels. Niemi, A.K. (2017). Review of randomized controlled reviews published randomized controlled trials on the effects of massage in preterm infants. Result: Most studies evaluating the effect of massage in weight gain in premature infants suggest a positive effect on weight gain. Increase in vagal tone has been reported in infants who receive massage and has been suggested as a possible mechanism for improved weight gain. Choi, H., Kim, S.J., Oh, J., Lee, M.N., Kim, S. et al.

Method: 123 mothers and their 3- to 18-month-old infant were randomly assigned to a routine (one week baseline of their usual bedtime routine, two weeks intervention) or control group (three weeks of their usual bedtime routine). Result: The bedtime routine resulted in improvements in child and mother night wakings, maternal perceptions of -child sleep and mood, and improvements in maternal sleep quality. Field, T., Gonzalez, G., Diego,M., Mindell, J. (2016).Mothers Massaging Their Newborns With Lotion versus No Lotion Enhances Mothers' and Newborns' Sleep. Infant Behavior and Development, 45:31-37. Method: 76 mothers of newborns were randomly assigned to a massage with lotion versus a massage without lotion group and a non-massage control group. The mothers were then taught a simple newborn massage and were asked to massage their newborns daily for 15min at bedtime for one month. Result The lotion massage group versus the other two groups showed a shorter latency to sleep and longer sleep for the mothers and fewer nightwakings and longer sleep for their infants. This may relate to the lotion group mothers massaging their infants more frequently as the number of massages was correlated with the total time sleeping and negatively correlated with nightwakings for both the mothers and the infants on the last day of the study. And, the mothers' and the infants' sleep behaviors were significantly correlated. Pediatric Massage Field, T (2019). Pediatric Massage Therapy Research: A Narrative Review. Children, 6, 1-12. *Method:*Narrative review on Pediatric literature. Result This narrative review on pediatric massage literature from the last decade suggests that massage therapy has positive effects on several pediatric conditions. These include preterm infant growth, psychological problems including aggression, gastrointestinal problems including constipation and diarrhea, painful conditions including burns and sickle cell, muscle tone disorders including cerebral palsy and Down syndrome, and chronic illnesses including diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV. Potential underlying mechanisms for the massage therapy effects include increased vagal activity and decreased stress hormones. Limitations of the literature include the need for more randomized controlled trials, longitudinal studies, and underlying mechanism studies.

Result: Positive outcomes were reported for massage therapy. We noted in an earlier study that when parents massaged their children with autism before bedtime, the children's sleep improved (shorter latency to sleep, longer sleep time and fewer nightwakings). Tsuji S, Yuhi T, Higashida H. Salivary oxytocin concentrations in seven boys with autism spectrum disorder received massage from their mothers: A pilot study. Front Psychiatry. 2015;6:58. Epub ahead of print. Method: Using mothers as the massagers, the mothers massaged their children with autism for 20 minutes daily for 3 months followed by no massage for 4 months. Saliva was collected to assay oxytocin (the \"love hormone\") before and after a session during the treatment and during the control period. Result: During the massage therapy period both the children and their mothers had higher oxytocin levels. Bed Sores Zhang Q, Sun Z, Yue J. Massage for preventing pressure ulcers. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015;6. Epub ahead of print. Method: Massage therapy was widely used until the 1950s to prevent and reduce bed sores or ulcers related to immobility in hospitalized patients. Pressure sores reputedly affect some 10% of patients in hospitals. Result: Despite this problem a recent review of the literature failed to reveal any randomized controlled trials or even quasi-randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria for a meta-analysis. Thus there were no studies eligible for this review and it remains uncertain whether massage therapy prevents bed sores. Cancer Celebioglu A, Gurol A, Yildirim ZK, Buyukavci M. Effects of massage therapy on pain and anxiety arising from intraethecal therapy or bone marrow aspiration in children with cancer. Int J Nurs Pract. 2015;21:797-804. Method: Study used self-report measures. Children with cancer, used visual analogue scales to report their pain and anxiety levels. Result: Massage therapy was used to reduce anxiety and pain associated with bone marrow aspiration. Both these levels were significantly reduced in the massage therapy group. However, when the pretest and posttest scores were compared, no significant differences were noted between the massage and control groups. Sheikhi MA, Ebadi A, Talaeizadeh A, Rahmani H.

Massage therapy alone and in combination with meditation for breast cancerpatients undergoing autologous tissue reconstruction: a randomized pilot study. Clin Pract. 2015. Epub ahead of print. Method: In a study on reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer, patients were randomly assigned to either a massage therapy group or a massage plus meditation group. Result: There were no additive effects of meditation on any of the self-report stress, insomnia, fatigue or pain measures. Although it is generally methodologically appropriate to assess the effects of two therapies combined versus one alone, the addition of meditation may have placed demands on the participants that were new to them, resulting in performance stress. Also, the comparisons can be confounded by the additional time demands on the participants when two therapies are combined. Lee SH, Kim JY, Yeo S, Kim SH, Lim S. Meta-analysis of massage therapy on cancer pain. Integr Cancer Ther. 2015;14:297-304. Method: In a meta-analysis on the effects of massage therapy on cancer in general, cancer-associated pain was noted to be one of the most common complaints. Nine high quality studies were included in this meta-analysis. Result: Massage therapy was noted to significantly reduce cancer pain as compared to no massage control conditions. Massage was effective especially for surgery-related pain, and among the various types of massage, foot reflexology was the most effective. It may have been the most effective as it typically involves the application of moderate pressure and the movement of skin perhaps more so than Swedish massage. Coronary Bypass and Cardiac Surgery Boitor M, Martorella G, Arbour C, Michaud C, Gelinas C. Evaluationof the preliminary effectiveness of hand massage therapy on postoperative pain of adults in the intensive care unit after cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled trial. Pain Manag Nurs. 2015;16:354-66. Method: In a simple post-surgery massage study, the therapy group received 15-minute hand massages and the control group a simple hand-holding for 15 minutes. These were given on 3 occasions within 24 hours after surgery. Result: Pain intensity and muscle tension were decreased for the hand massage but not the hand-holding control group. The authors concluded that this was a low-cost non-pharmacologic intervention. Although \"hands-on\" comparison groups may be better control groups, the hand-holding group may not have received the skin-moving, stimulation of pressure receptors that the massage group received. The pressure being applied needs to be measured, as can be done with a sound meter placed near the skin of the person being touched/massaged. Coronary Care Hatefi M, Jaafarpour M, Khani A, Khajavikhan J, Kokhazade T. The effect of whole body massage on the process and physiological outcome of trauma ICU patients: a double-blind randomized clinical trial. J Clin Diagn Res. 2015;9. Epub ahead of print. Method: In a massage by a family member study, trauma ICU patients received a full body 45 minute massage by a family member and the control group received routine care. Result: One hour after the intervention significant differences were noted between the two groups, with the massage group having lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate and heartrate. Significant group differences were also noted in the arterial blood gas measures including O2 saturation, PH and pO2. The authors recommended massage by a family member as a routine clinical practice. Adib-Hajbaghery M, Rajabi-Beheshtabad R, Ardjmand A. Comparing the effect of whole body massage by a specialist nurse and patients' relatives on blood cortisol level in coronary patients. ARYA Atheroscler. 2015;11:126-32. Method: A direct comparison was made between nurse and family member massage for coronary patients. Result: Cortisol levels were significantly decreased (by 90 nanomoles) in the massage by a nurse group but not in the other group. Fibromyalgia Yuan SL, Matsutani LA, Marques AP. Effectiveness of different styles of massage therapy on fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analyisis. Man Ther. trials. Result: Shiatsu decreased pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances while Swedish massage did not improve outcomes, though positive effects have been noted for different types of massage therapies. Full Term Infants Field T, Gonzalez G, Diego M, Mindell J. Mothers' massaging their newborns with lotion versus no lotion enhances mothers' and newborns' sleep. 2016, in press. Method: Taught mothers to massage their newborns from the day of birth to the end of the first month on a daily basis and compared a group who were massaged with lotion versus a group who were massaged without lotion versus a non-massage control group. Result: Both the mothers and the infants in the lotion massage group had better sleep patterns than those of the non-lotion massage and non-massage control groups. This could relate to the massage without lotion being less comfortable. Dalili H, Sheikhi S, Shariat M, Haghnazarian E. Effects of baby massage on neonatal jaundice in healthy Iranian infants: A pilot study. Infant Behav Dev. 2015;42:22-26. Method: Four days of twenty minute massages given, twice daily, to full-term healthy newborns. Result: Bilirubin levels have decreased. Basiri-Moghadam M, Basiri-Moghadam K, Kianmehr M, Jani S. The effect of massage on neonatal jaundice in stable preterm newborn infants: a randomized controlled J PakMed Assoc.2015;65:602-6. Method: Four days of massage. Result: Massage therapy may reduce the need for phototherapy or complement the phototherapy that is typically given to jaundiced newborns. Bilirubin levels were lower. Growth Measures Choi H, Kim SJ, Oh J, Lee MN, Kim S, Kang KA. The effects of massage therapy on physical growth and gastrointestinal function in premature infants: A pilot study. J Child Health Care. 2015. Epub ahead of print. Method: Massage therapy was performed twice daily for two weeks for 15 minutes per session. Result: In this study, weight gain, height and head circumference were significantly increased. In addition, the frequency of pre-feed gastric residual was decreased and the number of bowel movements was increased in the group who received massage therapy. The authors concluded that NICU nurses needed to be trained in massage therapy techniques so that all preterm infants could receive massage therapy. Immune Disorders Perez EM, Carrara H, Bourne L, Berg A, Swanevelder S, Hendricks MK. Massage therapy improves the development of HIV-exposed infants living in a low socio-economic, peri-urban community of South Africa. Infant Behav Dev. 2015;38:135-46. Method: A study on HIV-exposed infants, the mothers with HIV were taught to massage their infants which they did between 6 weeks when the study started and 9 months when the study ended. Result: Despite the massage group mothers having higher levels of maternal \"mental pain\", their infants scored significantly higher on scales of mental development and hearing and speech at 9 months. Even though the CD4 cell count (the critical index of HIV severity) was measured in the mothers, there was no report on that measure or any measure of the effects of the infant massage on the mothers themselves. This is surprising given that the mothers presumably benefited from massaging their infants. Infants With Assymetry From Congenital Muscular Torticollis Lee K, Chung E, Koh S, Lee BH. Outcomes of asymmetry in infants with congenital muscular torticollis. J Phys Ther Sci. 2015;27:461-4. Method: Infants with this condition were given massages and passive stretching for 30 minutes three times a week. Result: At the end of the study the infants showed less asymmetry as measured by the thickness of the two sternocleidomastoid muscles, head tilt and the Torticollis Overall Assessment. Despite these suggestive data from a large sample of infants, methodological problems include the lack of a control group and the potential confound of the infants receiving passive stretching exercises along with their massages. In Virtro fertilization Okhowat J, Murtinger M, Schuff D, Vanderzwalmen P, Wirleitner B, Zech NH. Massage therapy improves in vitro fertilization outcome in patients undergoing blastocyst transfer in a cryo-cycle. Altern Ther Health Med. 2015;21:16-22. Method: Oscillating vibrations were used prior to the transfer of the embryo. Result: The positive effects included greater pregnancy rates based on urine assays and ongoing pregnancies measured by fetal heartrate and birth rates as well as miscarriage rates. Knee Arthritis Qingguang Z, Min F, Li G, Shuyun J, Wuquan S, Yong L. Gait analysis of patients with knee osteoarthritis before and after Chinese massage treatment. J Tradit Chin Med. 2015;35:411-6. Method: In another recent knee osteoarthritis study, Chinese massage (moderate pressure massage) was given three times per week for two weeks. Gait was then evaluated using a motion analysis system by infrared cameras. Result: The patients experienced less pain and stiffness and enhanced function. They also showed increased gait speed and greater step width. However, there was no increase in range of motion. Field T, Diego M, Gonzalez G, Funk CG. Knee arthritis pain is reduced and range of motion is increased following moderate pressure massage therapy. Complement Ther Clin Pract. 2015;21: 233-7. Method: In contrast to other studies that were focused on the quadriceps muscles, the massage protocol of our study on knee osteoarthritis was focused on the hamstrings as well as the quadriceps. We also used moderate pressure massage. Result: Using moderate pressure and massaging both the hamstrings and the quadriceps may have contributed to unique finding of increased range of motion. Those two aspects may be necessary, i.e. the moderate pressure massage and the focus on both sets of muscles, although, unfortunately, they were confounded in this study, highlighting the need for a replication study. Massage for NICU Nurses Nazari F, Mirzamohamadi M, Yousefi H. The effect of massage therapy on occupational stress of intensive care unit nurses. Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res. 2015;20:508-15. Method: the nurses were massaged for 20 minutes twice per week for 4 weeks. Result: Two weeks after the intervention began, their overall job stress scores were significantly decreased as compared to the control group. Pain in Different Joints Bervoets DC, Luijsterburg PA, Alessie JJ, Buijs MJ, Verhagen AP. Massage therapy has short-term benefits for people with common musculoskeletal disorders compared to no treatment: a systematic review. J Physiother. 2015;61:106-16. Method: In a systematic review on pain in different joints, the 26 eligible randomized controlled trials included 2165 participants. However, twenty of the trials were considered to be at high risk for bias. Result: The results were somewhat mixed in that massage reduced pain in the short-term for shoulder pain and osteoarthritis of the knee but not for neck pain or low back pain. However, function was improved in the long-term for the individuals with shoulder pain and knee arthritis as well as low back pain. Several of the studies that were reviewed showed no greater benefits for massage than there were for joint manipulation or acupuncture. These results are perhaps not surprising in that each of those three treatment modalities involves stimulation of pressure receptors. The authors concluded, nonetheless, that the comparisons between massage and active treatments such as joint manipulation need to be replicated. Pelvic Pain Azima S, Bakhshayesh HR, Kaviani M, Abbasnia K, Sayadi M. Comparison of te effect of massage therapy and isometric exercises on primary dysmenorrhea: A randomized controlled clinical trial. J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol. 2015;28:486-91. Method: A treatment comparison was made between massage and isometric exercises.The treatment lasted eight weeks and the two groups were compared to a no-treatment control group. Result: Pain intensity was significantly reduced in both treatment groups, although the reduction was greater in the massage group. Potential Underlying Mechanisms Nelson NL. Massage therapy :understanding the mechanisms of action on blood pressure. A scoping review. J Am Soc Hypertens. 2015;9:785-93. Method: In a study that examined the underlying mechanisms for the effects of massage, for example, on blood pressure, a thematic analysis was conducted on 27 studies that considered the effects of massage therapy . Result: The author identified several potential underlying pathways for the relationship between massage therapy and the reduction of blood pressure. Fazeli MS, Pourrahmat MM, Liu M, Guan L, Collet JP. The effect of head massage on the regulation of the cardiac autonomic nervous system: a pilot randomized crossover trial. J Altern Complement Med. 2016;22:75-80. Method: Study documented parasympathetic activity following a single short session (10 minutes) of head massage. Result: Study showed increased parasympathetic activity and the head massage also reduced heartrate. Vagal Activity and Gastric Motility Saeadi R, Ghorbani Z, Moghaddam A. The effect of massage with medium-chain triglyceride oil on weight gain in premature neonates. Acta Med Iran. 2015;53:134-8. Method: preterm infants were randomly assigned to 3 different groups including an oil massage group, a non-oil massage group and a control group [5]. Medium-chain triglyceride oil was used for the oil massage group as a nutritional supplement. Result: The mean weight gain on the seventh day of the study was 105 grams for the oil massage group, 52 grams for the non-oil massage group and 54 grams weight loss for the control group. The greater weight gain by the oil massage group could be related to the oil being absorbed by the skin which could contribute to the weight gain as has been reported in other studies and/or it could be related to increased vagal activity leading to greater gastric motility resulting in more efficient food absorption, as we have shown in an earlier study - Music Abstracts Allergy Kimata, H. (2003). Listening to mozart reduces allergic skin wheal responses and in vitro allergen-specific IgE production in atopic dermatitis patients with latex allergy. Behavioral Medicine, 29, 15-19. METHODS: Atopic dermatitis patients with latex allergy listened to Mozart and Beethoven. RESULTS: Listening to Mozart reduced skin wheal responses also decreased in vitro total IgE with concomitant skewing of the cytokine pattern toward the Th1 type, that is, an increase in Th1 cytokine production and decrease in Th2 cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

The effect of music therapy on hospitalized psychiatric patients' anxiety, finger temperature and electroencephalography: a randomized clinical trial. Biological Research for Nursing, Epub ahead of print. METHODS: Hospitalized psychiatric patients were randomly assigned to a music or a control group. The experimental group received music therapy for 30 minutes each morning for 11 days. The Beck Anxiety Inventory was given and skin temperature and brain waves were monitored before, during, and after music therapy. RESULTS: The music group participants had lower scores on the BAI than control participants, after the music therapy and at 1-week follow-up. The music group had increased alpha EEG percentage and a decreased beta EEG percentage after the music therapy, suggesting greater relaxation. Korhan, E.A., Khorshid, L., & Uyar, M. (2011).The effect of music therapy on physiological signs of anxiety in patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 20, 7-8. METHODS: Intensive care unit patients were randomized to a control group or a group who received 60 minutes of classical music. Physiological signs were taken immediately before the intervention and at the 30th, 60th and 90th minutes of the intervention. RESULTS: The music group had significantly lower respiratory rates, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure than the control group. This decrease improved progressively in the 30th, 60th and 90th minutes of the intervention, indicating a cumulative dose effect. Cooke, M., Chaboyer, W., Schluter, P. & Hiratos, M. (2005).

METHODS: Twenty-eight women residing in two domestic violence shelters in a Midwestern city met with the researcher on five consecutive days for half-hour sessions. The dependent variables included: state anxiety measured by the STAI on the first and last sessions, and levels of fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Scale at waking time. The independent variable was a 20-minute recording of participant-selected music with a Progressive Muscle Relaxation script. RESULTS: Music therapy reduced anxiety levels and improved sleep quality for the experimental group. Holm, L. & Fitzmaurice, L. (2008). Emergency department waiting room stress: can music or aromatherapy improve anxiety scores? Pediatric Emergency Care, 24, 836-838. METHODS: Adults accompanying children to the emergency department were assigned to no intervention, music, aromatherapy, and both music and aromatherapy. RESULTS: Anxiety levels decreased on those days when music was playing. Lee, O. K., Chung, Y. F., & Chan, W. M. (2005). Music and its effect on the physiological responses and anxiety levels of patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a pilot study. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 14, 609-620. METHODS: Sixty-four subjects were randomly assigned to either 30 minutes of music or a rest period. The subjects were asked to answer the State Trait Anxiety Inventory scale before and after the study period and physiological indices and resting behaviors were recorded before and after the study period in both groups. The subjects satisfaction with music was also obtained after music intervention. RESULTS: The findings indicate that patients on mechanical ventilation that listened to a single 30-minute session of music showed greater relaxation as manifested by a decrease in physiological indices and increase in comfortable resting behaviors.

Autism Katagiri, J. (2009). The effect of background music and song texts on the emotional understanding of children with autism. Journal of Music Therapy, 46, 15-31. METHODS: Students (mean age 11.5 years) with autism were taught four emotions to decode and encode: happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. The treatment consisted of the four conditions: (a) no contact control no purposeful teaching of the selected emotion, (b) contact control teaching the selected emotion using verbal instructions alone, \u00a9 background music teaching the selected emotion by verbal instructions with background music representing the emotion, and singing songs teaching the selected emotion by singing specially composed songs about the emotion. Participants were given a pretest and a posttest and received 8 individual sessions between these tests. RESULTS: The results indicated that all participants improved significantly in their understanding of the four selected emotions. Background music was significantly more effective than the other three conditions in improving participants' emotional understanding. Kim, J., Wigram, T., & Gold, C. (2009). Emotional, motivational and interpersonal responsiveness of children with autism in improvisational music therapy. Autism, 13, 389-409. METHODS: Children with autism were randomly assigned to improvisational music therapy and toy play sessions. RESULTS: Improvisational music therapy produced markedly more and longer events of 'joy', 'emotional synchronicity' and 'initiation of engagement' behaviours in the children than toy play sessions. In response to the therapist interpersonal demands, 'compliant (positive) responses' were observed more in music therapy than in toy play sessions, and 'no responses' were twice as frequent in toy play sessions as in music therapy. Blood Pressure Chafin, S., Roy, M., Gerin, W. & Christenfeld N. (2004). Music can facilitate blood pressure recovery from stress. British Journal of Health Psychology, 9, 393-403. METHODS: Participants performed a challenging three-minute mental arithmetic task and then were assigned randomly to sit in silence or to listen to one of several styles of music: classical, jazz or pop. RESULTS: Participants who listened to classical music had significantly lower post-task systolic blood pressure levels than did participants who heard no music. Jeon, E.Y., Kim, S.Y., & Yoo, H.S.

The effect of music therapy on mood and anxiety-depression: An observational study in institutionalized patients with traumatic brain injury. Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, 52, 30-40. METHODS: Patients with traumatic brain injury took part in individual, weekly, 1-hour music therapy sessions over a period of 20 weeks. Each session was divided into two 30-minute periods - one devoted to listening to music (receptive music therapy) and the other to playing an instrument (active music therapy). RESULTS: Music therapy improved mood, from the first session onwards. This short-term effect was confirmed by the immediate changes in the scores after music therapy sessions. Music therapy also led to a reduced anxiety and depression from week 10 until the end of the study (week 20). Breast Feeding Vianna, M.N., Barbosam A,P., Carvalhaes, may increase breastfeeding rates among mothers of premature newborns: a randomized controlled trial. Jornal de Pediatria, 1, 87. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, mothers of premature neonates participated in music therapy or a control group. The music therapy sessions were three times a week for 60 minutes. The endpoints were breastfeeding rates at the moment of infant hospital discharge and at follow-up visits (7-15 days, 30 and 60 days after discharge). RESULTS: Breastfeeding was more frequent in the music therapy group at discharge and at the follow-up visits. Cancer Li, X.M., Yan, H., Zhou, K.N., Dang, S.N., Wang, D.L., & Zhang, Y.P. (2011). Effects of music therapy on pain among female breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy: results from a randomized controlled trial. Breast Cancer Research Treatment, Epub ahead of print. METHODS: Breast cancer patients following a mastectomy were randomly assigned to a music or a control group. The intervention group received music therapy from the day after mastectomy to the third admission to hospital for chemotherapy in addition to the routine nursing care, while the control group received only routine nursing care. Pain scores were measured at baseline and at three post-tests. RESULTS: Music therapy reduced the pain scores. Lin, M.F., Hsieh, Y.J., Hsu, Y.Y., Fetzer, S., & Hsu, M.C. (2011). A randomised controlled trial of the effect of music therapy and verbal relaxation on chemotherapy-induced anxiety. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 20, 988-999. METHODS: Chemotherapy patients were randomized into three groups. The music therapy group received a single, one-hour music session, the verbal relaxation group received 30 minutes of guided relaxation and the control group received usual care. RESULTS: Music therapy had a more positive effect on postchemotherapy anxiety than verbal relaxation and a greater increase in skin temperature. Patients with high anxiety had a greater decrease in postchemotherapy anxiety following music therapy than a normal anxiety subsample. Burns, D. S., Sledge, R. B., Fuller, L. A., Daggy, J. K., Monahan, P. O. (2005). Cancer patients interest and preferences for music therapy. Journal of Music Therapy, 42, 185-199. METHODS: The goal of this study was to examine cancer patients interest in and preferences for using two types of music therapy interventions, music-making and music listening. Sixty-five patients completed the Music Interest Survey in addition to standardized measures of coping, affect, anxiety, and fatigue. RESULTS: Results suggest adult cancer patients are interested in music therapy, especially music listening. Patient interest and preference were associated with negative affect, anxiety, age, and self-efficacy. Findings highlight the need for a comprehensive assessment of patient needs and preferences prior to intervention. Cardiovascular Argstatter, H., Haberbosch, W. & Bolay, H. (2006). Study of the effectiveness of musical stimulation during intracardiac catheterization. Clinical Research Cardiology, 95, 514-522. METHODS: patients waiting for a scheduled cardiac catheterization were randomly allocated to one of three groups: control group (standard care), exposure group (music stimulation during the procedure), or coaching group (additional music therapeutic coaching). Target variables were anxiety and physiological parameters. RESULTS: Music intervention reduced anxiety (STAI-S reduction pre-post: exposure 11 pt, coaching: 4 pt, control: 6). Physiological values and medication did not differ between the groups. Sendelbach, S., Halm, M., Doran, K., Miller, E.H. & Gaillard, P. (2006). Effects of music therapy on physiological and psychological outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 81, 205-206. METHODS: 50 patients received 20 minutes of music (intervention), whereas 36 patients had 20 minutes of rest in bed (control). Anxiety, pain, physiologic parameters, and opioid consumption were measured before and after the 20-minute period. RESULTS: A significant reduction in anxiety and pain was demonstrated in the group that received music compared with the control group, but no difference was observed in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or heart rate. There was no reduction in opioid usage in the 2 groups. Children Sussman, J.E. (2009). The effect of music on peer awareness in preschool age children with developmental disabilities. Journal of Music Therapy, 46, 53-68. METHODS: Nine children with a developmental disability participated in the study. Each participant completed 4 small group sessions with the researcher and 2 other research participants. During each session, the children participated in activities targeting peer awareness that incorporated musical and play elements. Behavioral data were recorded representing the children's sustained and alternating attention towards peers. RESULTS: Children sustained attention towards peers for the longest durations and alternated attention from peer to peer at the highest frequencies during activities that utilized a musical.

Listening to Turkish classical music decreases patients' anxiety, pain, dissatisfaction and the dose of sedative and analgesic drugs during colonoscopy: a prospective randomized controlled trial. Clinical Research Cardiology, 95, 511-513. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective colonoscopy were randomized into either listening to music or not listening to music. Anxiolytic and analgesic drugs were given according to the patients' demand. Medications were monitored and their levels of anxiety were determined using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Patients' satisfaction, pain, and willingness to undergo a repeated procedure were assessed using a visual analog scale. RESULTS: The mean dose of sedative and analgesic drugs used in group 1 smaller as compared to group 2 was the anxiety level was lower the satisfaction score was higher and the pain score was lower.

METHODS: Individuals with Alzheimers participated in weekly sessions of individual, receptive music therapy. The musical style of the session was chosen by the patient. The control group (n = 15) participated under the same conditions in reading sessions. RESULTS: Significant reductions in anxiety and depression were observed in the music therapy group from week 4 and until week 16. The effect of music therapy was sustained for up to 8 weeks after the end of the treatment period.

METHODS: Depressed patients were randomized to receive individual music therapy plus standard care (20 bi-weekly sessions) or standard care only, and followed up at baseline, at 3 months (after intervention) and at 6 months. Clinical measures included depression, anxiety, general functioning, quality of life and alexithymia. RESULTS: The music group showed greater improvement on depression, anxiety and general functioning at the 3-month follow-up. Chan, M.F., Chan, E.A., Mok, E., Kwan Tse, F.Y. (2009). Effect of music on depression levels and physiological responses in community-based older adults. International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, 18, 285-294. METHODS: Elderly people received music or standard care. RESULTS: The music group had lower depression scores, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate after 1 month. Field, T., Martinez, A., Nawrocki, T., Pickens, J., Fox, N. & Schanberg, S. (1998). Music shifts frontal EEG in depressed adolescents. Adolescence, 33, 109-116. METHOD: This study investigated the effects of music on mood state and right frontal EEG activation associated with chronic depression. Fourteen chronically depressed female adolescents listened to rock music for a 23-minute session. These adolescents were compared with a control sample of chronically depressed female adolescents who were simply asked to sit and relax their minds and their muscles for the same time period. EEG was recorded during baseline, music, and post music for three minutes each, and saliva samples were collected before and after the session to determine the effects of the music on stress hormone (cortisol) levels. RESULTS: No group differences or changes were noted for observed or reported mood state. However, cortisol levels decreased and relative right frontal activation was significantly attenuated during and after the music procedure. It was concluded that music had positive effects on the physiological and biochemical measures even though observed and self-reported mood did not change. Jones NA, Field T. (1999). Massage and music therapies attenuate frontal EEG asymmetry in depressed adolescents. Adolescence, 34, 529-534 METHOD: EEG asymmetry, specifically greater relative right frontal activation, is associated with negative affect. Depressed adults show stable patterns of this asymmetry. The present study assessed the effects of massage therapy and music therapy on frontal EEG asymmetry in depressed adolescents. Thirty adolescents with greater relative right frontal EEG activation and symptoms of depression were given either massage therapy (n = 14) or music therapy (n = 16). EEG was recorded for three-minute periods before, during, and after therapy. RESULTS: Frontal EEG asymmetry was significantly attenuated during and after the massage and music sessions. Tornek A, Field T, Hernandez-Reif M, Diego M, Jones N. (2003). Music effects on EEG in intrusive and withdrawn mothers with depressive symptoms. Psychiatry, 66, 234-243. METHOD: The EEG patterns of 48 intrusive and withdrawn mothers with depressive symptoms were assessed following a 20-minute music session to determine if the music had mood-altering effects. Half the mothers listened to classical music while half listened to rock music. Intrusive mothers were expected to have more positive responses and more symmetrical EEG following the calming classical music, while withdrawn mothers were expected to have a more positive response and symmetrical EEG following the energizing rock music. RESULTS: Although more positive EEGs were noted for rock music in both groups, only the withdrawn mothers showed a significant change in EEG toward symmetry following rock music, and only the intrusive mothers showed a decrease in cortisol levels following the rock music. Their State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) anxiety levels also decreased, while the Profile of Mood States (POMS) depressed mood levels decreased significantly for all four groups following music. Hsu, W. C., & Lai, H. L. (2004). Effects of music on major depression in psychiatric inpatients. Archives of Psychiatric Nursing, 18, 193-199. METHOD: Patients with major depressive disorder were recruited and listened to their choice of music for two weeks. Depression was measured with the Zungs Depression Scale before the study and at two weekly posttests. RESULTS: Music resulted in significantly lower depression scores, as depression decreased weekly, indicating a cumulative dose effect. Elderly Remington, R. (2002). Calming music and hand massage with agitated elderly. Nursing Research, 51, 317-323. METHOD: A four group, repeated measures experimental design was used to test the effect of a 10-minute exposure to either calming music, hand massage, or calming music and hand massage simultaneously, or no intervention on the frequency and type of agitated behaviors in nursing home residents with dementia. RESULTS: Each of the experimental interventions reduced agitation more than no intervention. The benefit was sustained and increased up to one hour following the intervention. Physically non aggressive behaviors decreased during each of the interventions. Hospice Nakayama, H., Kikuta, F., & Takeda, H. (2009).

European Journal of Anaesthesiology, 22, 96-102. METHOD: Seventy-five patients undergoing open hernia repair as day care surgery were randomly allocated to three groups: intraoperative music, postoperative music and silence. RESULTS: There was a significantly greater decrease in the level of cortisol in the postoperative music group vs. the control group after 2 h in the post anesthesia care unit. The postoperative music group had less anxiety and pain and required less morphine after 1 hour compared with the control group. In the postoperative music group the total requirement of morphine was significantly lower than in the control group. Tse, M. M., Chan, M. F., & Benzie, I. F. (2005). The effect of music therapy on postoperative pain, heartrate, systolic blood pressure and analgesic use following anal surgery. Journal of Pain and Palliative Care Pharmacotherapy, 19, 21-29. METHOD: Fifty-seven patients were assigned to either an experimental or a control group. Music was played intermittently to members of the experimental group during the first 24 hour postoperative period. Pain intensity was measured using the Pain Verbal Rating Scales, RESULTS: Significant decreases in pain intensity over time were found in the experimental group compared to the control group. In addition, the experimental group had a lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and took fewer oral analgesics for pain. These findings suggest that music therapy is an effective nonpharmacologic approach for postoperative pain management.

METHODS: Preterm infants were randomly assigned to a 30-minute period of Mozart music or no music on 2 consecutive days. Metabolic measurements were performed by indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure (REE) was similar during the first 10-minute period of both randomization groups. During the next 10-minute period, infants who were exposed to music had a significantly lower REE. Sleep Lai, H.L. & Good M. (2005). Music improves sleep quality in older adults. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 49, 234-44. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial was used with a two-group repeated measures design. Sixty people aged 6083 years with difficulty in sleeping were recruited through community leaders and screened using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Participants listened to their choice among six 45-minute sedative music tapes at bedtime for 3 weeks. There were five types of Western and one of Chinese music. RESULTS: Music resulted in significantly better sleep quality in the experimental group, as well as significantly better components of sleep quality: better perceived sleep quality, longer sleep duration, greater sleep efficiency, shorter sleep latency, less sleep disturbance and less daytime dysfunction. Sleep improved weekly, indicating a cumulative dose effect. de Niet, G., Tiemens, B., Lendemeijer, B., & Hutschemaekers, G. (2009). Music-assisted relaxation to improve sleep quality: meta-analysis.

Tai Chi as an alternative and complementary therapy for anxiety: a systematic review. J Evid Based Complement Altern Med. 2015;20:143-53. Method: the studies were non- randomized controlled trials that featured small sample sizes, non-standardized tai chi interventions and many different outcome measures. Result: Surprisingly, only one paper could be found in the recent literature on tai chi for anxiety. This was a review paper on 17 articles that met inclusion criteria with eight of them being from the US, two from Australia, two from Japan, two from Taiwan and one each from Canada, Spain and China [23]. Reduced anxiety was noted in at least 12 of the studies reviewed. However, the authors noted several limitations of this body of research. Arthritis Callahan LF, Cleveland RJ, Altpeter M, Hackney B. Evaluation of Tai Chi program effectiveness for people with arthritis in the community: a randomized controlled trial. J Aging Phys Act. 2016;24:101-10. Method: In an assessment of the Arthritis Foundation tai chi program, those with arthritis were randomly to the tai chi group or a waitlist control group. Result: Following this eight week program balance was improved. At one year improvements in pain, fatigue and stiffness were noted, suggesting long-term effects in at least 30% of those who continued tai chi practice following the end of the program. Balance Varghese R, Hui-Chan CW, Bhatt T. Reduced Cognitive-motor interference on voluntary balance control in older Tai Chi practioners. J Geriatr Phys Ther. 2015; Epub ahead of print. Method: In one study on 10 elderly tai chi practitioners and 10 age matched non-practitioners, the participants were asked to shift their weight to reach a target with and without performing the cognitive task of counting backwards. Result: The Tai chi practitioners had shorter reaction times and faster movements than the non-tai chi practitioners.

Tai Chi training may reduce dual task gait variability, a potential mediator of fall risk, in healthy older adults: cross-sectional and randomized trial studies. Front Hum Neurosci. 2015;9. Method: In a similar dual-task study, tai chi experts and non-experts were compared on their walking time while they performed serial subtractions. Result: Walking or stride time variability was lower in the tai chi expert group. Walking time variability has been considered a potential mediator of the risk for falling. Although comparisons of tai chi practitioners versus non-practitioners would be expected to reveal greater effects for the practitioners given their greater activity levels, but the two groups may also differ on baseline motivation, physical fitness and other variables, making their comparison tenuous at best. Zhou J, Chang S, Cong Y, Qin M, Sun W, Lian J, Yao J, Li W, Hong Y. Res Sports Med. 2015;23:302-14. Method: Another way of testing balance is the sway paths both to each side and from the front to the back. In a sway path balance study, a tai chi group was compared to a no regular exercise group. Result: The tai chi group showed shorter sway paths both forward and back and to each side after 24 weeks of tai chi.

Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2015;70:157-61. Method: In one study tai chi was compared to ballroom dancing. In this randomized controlled trial, the tai chi group had a lower sway velocity both with open and with closed eyes on a firm surface as well as a foam surface. Result: The tai chi group also had faster walking speed and shorter times moving from a sitting to a standing position with less sway in the final standing position.

J Back Musculoskelet Rehabil. 2015; [Epub ahead of print]. Method: In another study, tai chi was compared to regular exercise that was performed three times a week for 12 weeks. Result: Both exercise groups showed better results on dynamic balance assessments. However, the tai chi group showed better performance on the single leg stance eyes open task and on a survey of activities and fear of falling scale. Huang Y, Liu X. Improvement of balance control ability and flexibility in the elderly Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) practioners: a systematic review and meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials including 1088 participants, tai chi was compared with other interventions. Result: Tai chi was shown to have significantly shorter time on get up and go, prolonged time on single leg stand and improved balance. Other meta-analyses on a greater number of randomized controlled trials need to be conducted to confirm these data. Breast Cancer Pan Y, Yang K, Shi X, Liang H, Zhang F, Lv Q. Tai Chi Chuan exercise for patients with breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015. Method: In a systematic review/meta-analysis study, nine randomized controlled trials including 322 breast cancer patients met criteria. Result: .In these trials, comparisons between tai chi and control therapies yielded only changes in upper limb functional mobility. These included increased handgrip dynamometer strength and limb elbow flexion. No differences were noted for pain, IL - 6, physical, social or emotional well-being. It is surprising that IL -6 was the only immune measure common across the studies that met criteria.

Blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and inflammatory cytokine outcomes in senior female cancer survivors enrolled in a Tai Chi Chih randomized controlled trial. J Cancer Surviv. 2015;9:115-25. Method: A randomized controlled trial of tai chi effects on cancer, specifically senior female cancer survivors, tai chi was compared to a health education class. Tai chi was practiced and the health education classes were held for 60 minutes three times a week for 12 weeks. Result: The tai chi group had significantly lower systolic blood pressure and cortisol levels at the end of the study. There were, however, no changes in inflammatory cytokines. Cardio Respiratory Disease Holmes ML, Manor B, Hsieh WH, Hu K, Lipsitz LA, Li L. Tai Chi training reduced coupling between respiration and postural control. Neurosci Lett. 2016;610:60-5. Method: In the aging process apparently respiration affects postural sway, and by tai chi improving respiratory function it can also improve postural control. This relationship was shown in a study on a 12 week tai chi intervention versus an educational control group. Result: While the tai chi training did not alter standing postural control or respiration, the coupling between respiration and postural control was reduced. For some reason as in many other tai chi studies, the sample sizes for the two groups were unequal which may reflect a self-selection bias and which may have contributed to these null findings. Zheng G, Li S, Huang M, Liu F, Tao J, Chen L. The effect of Tai Chi on cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis. PloS One. 2015;10. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis 20 studies with 1868 participants. These included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardio output, lung capacity, cardio respiratory endurance and stair test index. Result: participants suggested that tai chi had positive effects on the majority of cardio function outcomes.

Tai Chi for improving cardiopulmonary function and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Clin Rehabil. 2015; Epub ahead of print. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of tai chi on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 15 articles involving 1354 participants met criteria. Compared to an inactive control group. Result: Compared to an inactive control group tai chi was more effective in improving exercise on six - minute walking test, on forced expiratory volume in the first second and on forced vital capacity. The tai chi group also scored better on the dyspnea score, fatigue score and total score of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. However, once again, it is not surprising that tai chi effects would be more positive than those of an inactive control group. Future studies need to compare different styles of tai chi or at least compare tai chi with active exercise groups to determine reliable treatment effects.

J Appl Gerontol. 2015;34:573-89. Method: Several researchers have conducted studies on cognitive and physical functions in various age groups. In a quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent comparison group, healthy and active women were assigned to a tai chi program (twice a week for 8 weeks) or a control group. Result: By the end of the program the tai chi group was showing better physical performance. Sun J, Kanagawa K, Sasaki J, Ooki S, Xu H, Wang L. Tai Chi improves cognitive and physical function in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial. J Phys Sci. 2015;27:1467-71. Method: In a study with an elderly sample, tai chi was provided twice per week for six months and that group was compared to a control group who participated in \"other non-athletic activities\". Result: Assessments made at three and six months suggested that the tai chi group performed better on the Mini-mental state examination, on grip strength and on walking speed. Lu X, Siu KC, Fu SN, Hui-Chan CW, Tsang WW. Effects of Tai Chi training on postural control and cognitive performance while dual tasking- a randomized clinical trial.

Increased hippocampus-medical prefrontal cortex resting-state functional connectivity and memory function after Tai Chi Chuan practice in elder adults. Front Aging Neurosci. 2016; Epub ahead of print. Method: In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that measures activation of different parts of the brain and functional connectivity between different parts of the brain, a tai chi group was compared to a qui gong (seated tai chi) group [17]. Result: Both groups showed significant improvement on a memory quotient test, and their fMRIs showed Increased functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that both forms of exercise may prevent memory decline during the aging process. This, however, was the only study that appeared in the recent literature that compared standing tai chi with sitting tai chi (qui gong), so it is unclear whether standing or sitting tai chi is more effective.

Impact of short-and long-term Tai Chi mind-body exercise training on cognitive function in healthy adults: results from a hybrid observational study and randomized trial. 2015; 4:38-48. Method: In a study comparing tai chi experts with tai chi-na\u00efve adults, the tai chi experts showed better performance on six cognitive tasks. Result: Typically, tai chi experts or tai chi practitioners have performed better than tai chi na\u00efve adults which is not surprising. Zheng G, Liu F, Li S, Huang M, Tao J, Chen L. Tai Chi and the protection of cognitive ability: a systematic review of prospective studies in healthy adults. Am J Prev Med. 2015;49:89-97. Method: A systematic review of nine studies including 632 participants. Result: The tai chi groups compared to \"usual activities groups\" showed better performance on several cognitive tasks. The problems with this review are that only five of the nine studies were randomized controlled trials and as many as 12 different tests were used, making it difficult to measure the consistency across studies.

Result: The practitioners were able to discriminate the technical from the aesthetic components of the actions. Smith LL, Wherry SJ, Larkey LK, Ainsworth BE, Swan PD. Energy expenditure and cardiovascular responses to Tai Chi Easy. Complement Ther Med. 2015;23:802-5. Method: The exercise intensity of tai chi has been evaluated by oxygen consumption and heart rate. Result: These cardiorespiratory and energy expenditure measures suggest that tai chi is a low intensity exercise. When the safety of tai chi was evaluated in a systematic review, only 33% of 153 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included the reporting of adverse events and of those, only 12% overall noted a monitoring protocol for adverse events Manson JD, Tamim H, Baker J. Barriers and promoters for enrollment to a community-based Tai Chi program for older, low-income, and ethnically diverse adults. J Appl Gerontol. 2015;[Epub ahead of print]. Method: These data came from a study in which 87 lower socioeconomic older adults from multiple ethnic backgrounds were interviewed before starting a 16-week tai chi program. Result: Barriers as well as promoters for participation in tai chi have included physical and mental health, time of day, socialization, accessibility and availability of teachers Shah S, Ardern C, Tamim H. Predictors of adherence in a community-based Tai Chi program. Can J Aging. 2015;34:237-46. Method: Another study measured adherence to a 16-week tai chi program for multi-ethnic middle-aged and older adults living in a low socioeconomic environment. Result: In this sample of 210 participants (mean age=68) greater adherence was associated with older age, greater perceived stress, higher education and higher scores on mental and physical scales. In contrast, lower adherence was associated with higher baseline weekly physical activity. Yang GY, Wang LQ, Ren J, Zhang Y, Li ML, Zhu YT, Luo J, Cheng YJ, Li WY, Wayne PM, Liu JP. Evidence base of clinical studies on Tai Chi: a bibliometric analysis. PLoS One. 2015;10. Method: A bibliometric analysis on 507 tai chi studies included 8% systematic reviews, 50% randomized clinical trials, 18% randomized current controlled clinical studies and 23% single-arm (pre-post) studies. The most frequent diseases/conditions studied were hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, breast cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, schizophrenia and depression. The primary reason given for practicing tai chi was for health promotion. The most common tai chi style was the Yang style, and typically tai chi was practiced 2 to 3 one-hour sessions per week for 12 weeks. Tai chi was combined with other therapies including medications, physical therapies and health education in 41 % of the studies and was practiced alone in 59% of them. Result: At least 95% of the studies reported positive effects while 5% of the studies noted uncertain effects, and no serious adverse events were mentioned. These data are highly suggestive, although only half the studies reviewed were randomized clinical trials. This Diabetes Hui SS, Xie YJ, Woo J, Kwok TC. Effects of Tai Chi and walking exercises on weight loss, metabolic syndrome parameters, and bone mineral density: a cluster randomized controlled trial. Evid. Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015. Method: In a study on Hong Kong Chinese adults 374 middle-age diabetes patients were randomly assigned to a 12 week training 45 minutes per day, five days per week of tai chi or self -paced walking or a control group. Result: Both exercise groups experienced moderate weight loss and significantly improved their waist circumference and fasting blood glucose. Lee MS, Jun JH, Lim HJ, Lim HS. A systematic review and meta-analysis of Tai Chi for treating type 2 diabetes. Maturitas. 2015;80:14-23. Method: A systematic review revealed mixed findings with four RCTs that compared various types of exercise and tai chi. Result: Meta-analysis failed to show group differences on fasting blood glucose which was not surprising in that tai chi and exercise frequently have similar effects. However, surprisingly, the meta-analysis of the five RCTs that compared tai chi with antidiabetic medication showed more favorable effects of tai chi than medication on fasting blood glucose. The authors concluded that these tai chi effects on fasting blood glucose in diabetes clearly need replication studies. breakdown is consistent with that of the current review. Fear of Falling Hwang HF, Chen SJ, Lee-Hsieh J, Chien DK, Chen CY, Lin MR. Effects of home-based Tai-Chi and lower extremity training and self-practice on falls and functional outcomes in older fallers from the emergency department- a randomized controlled trial. J Am Geriatr Soc. 2016;64:518-25. Method: In another randomized controlled trial, home - based tai chi training was compared to lower extremity training in elderly who had fall - related emergency room visits at least six months before being recruited for the study. Result: After a six month intervention, the tai chi group was less likely to experience any falls, had a longer time to the first fall and a lower number of \"fallers \"as compared to the lower extremity training group. Hip Osteoarthritis Zeng R, Lin J, Wu S, Chen S, Gao H, Zheng Y, Ma H. A randomized controlled trial: preoperative home-based combined Tai Chi and strength training (TCST) to improve balance and aerobic capacity in patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA). Arch Gerontol Geriatr. 2015;60:265-71. Method: Individuals with hip osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to a tai chi or a control group for six weeks. Result: After six weeks of the program the tai chi group walked farther in the 6-minute walk test and they were faster in the get up and go test. Hypertension Robins JL, Elswick RK Jr, Sturgill J, McCain NL. The effects of Tai Chi on cardiovascular risk in women. Am J Health Promot. 2015; [Epub ahead of print]. Method: A randomized controlled trial that included a waitlist control group and eight weeks of tai chi. Result: Tai chi led to reduced cardiovascular risk in middle-age women. In this study the cardiovascular-risk women who experienced tai chi had less fatigue and showed a down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins 4 and 8. In addition, the women showed increased mindfulness, spiritual thoughts and behaviors and self-compassion. Sun J, Buys N. Community-based mind-body meditative Tai Chi program and its effects on improvement of blood pressure, weight, renal function, serum lipoprotein, and quality of life in Chinese adults with hypertension. Am J Cardiol. 2015;116:1076-81. Method: A randomized controlled study on adults with hypertension. Result: Blood pressure and body mass index were reduced, but metabolic syndrome and lipid levels did not improve. Pan X, Zhang Y, Tao S. Effects of Tai Chi exercise on blood pressure and plasma levels of nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide in real-world patients with essential hypertension. Clin Exp Hypertens. 2015;37:8-14. Method: A study comparing hypertensives receiving tai chi, a hypertensive usual care group and a healthy non-hypertensive group. Result: Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased, high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by the end of the 12 week treatment period. A unique finding was an increase in nitric oxide, which is significant because of its anti-inflammatory effects. Further research is needed to confirm the nitric oxide effects in a larger cohort. Immune Markers Irwin MR, Olmstead R, Breen EC, Witarama N, Arevalo JM, Nicassio P, Bootzin R, Cole S. Cognitive behavioral therapy and Tai Chi reverse cellular and genomic markers of inflammation in late-life insomnia: a randomized controlled trial. Biol Psychiatry. 2015;78:721-9. Method: A randomized controlled trial on tai chi and immune markers, 123 older adults with insomnia were randomly assigned to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), tai chi or a sleep seminar control group for two hour sessions weekly over a four-month period. Result: Given that sleep disturbances are associated with inflammation, several pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured. Both the CBT and tai chi groups experienced reduced levels of C-reactive protein, pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory gene expression. These results were surprising inasmuch as CBT is a physically inactive therapy. However, a potential underlying mechanism common to CBT and tai chi may be the facilitation of sleep which would in turn improve immune function in both groups. Insomnia Lee LY, Tam KW, Lee ML, Lau NY, Lau JC, Lam CH, Kwan WK, Chan B, Chan PZ. Sleep quality of Tai Chi practioners. Jpn J Nurs Sci. 2015;12:27-34. Method: Comparison of different styles of Tai Chi. Result: For insomnia, tai chi was surprisingly ineffective. In one study, linear regression analysis suggested that the duration of practicing tai chi and the style of tai chi did not make a significant contribution to sleep quality. In this null finding study, however, most of the participants were good sleepers which would reduce the likelihood of sleep being altered. In addition, it is surprising that the duration of practicing tai chi did not make a difference as longer-term practitioners typically experience greater benefits. Different styles of tai chi are rarely compared, so the finding that different styles did not have different effects needs to be replicated. Knee Osteoarthitis Pain Tsai PF, Chang JY, Beck C, Kuo YF, Keefe FJ, Rosengren K. A supplemental report to a randomized cluster trial of a 20-week Sun-style Tai Chi for osteoarthritic knee pain in elders with cognitive impairment. Complement Ther Med. 2015;23:570-6. Method: For knee osteoarthritis the only recent tai chi papers featured a randomized controlled trial and a review. In the randomized controlled trial, older adults were recruited from eight study sites and then the sites were randomly assigned to participate in either a 20 week Sun - style tai chi or an education program. Result: The active tai chi groups experienced a greater reduction in pain than the inactive education group. Field T. Knee osteoarthritis pain in the elderly can be reduced by massage therapy, yoga and Tai Chi: a review. Complement Ther Clin Pract. 2016;22:87-92. Method: In our recent review of tai chi for knee osteoarthritis, pain was assessed by the WOMAC scale in most of the studies reviewed. Result: Range of motion and range of motion pain are highly affected by knee osteoarthritis, but those measures were not assessed in most of the studies. This was surprising given that tai chi predominantly exercises the hamstrings and quadriceps which are both involved in flexion and extension of the knee. Range of motion and range of motion pain would need to be measured to determine the primary effects of tai chi on knee osteoarthritis. Lung Cancer Zhang LL, Wang SZ, Chen HL, Yuan AZ. Tai chi exercise for cancer-related fatigue in patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial. J Pain Symptom Manage. 2016;51:504-11. Method: In a randomized controlled trial on tai chi effects on patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy, tai chi was compared with low impact exercise [67]. The groups practiced every other day for one hour for 12 weeks. Result: At six and at 12 weeks the tai chi group had lower physical fatigue and general fatigue scores, although no differences were noted on the emotional subscale. Lui J, Chen P, Wang R, Yuan Y, Wang X, Li C. Effect of Tai Chi on mononuclear cell functions in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. BMC Complement Altern Med. 2015;15. Method: A randomized controlled study on tai chi effects on cell functions in lung cancer patients, tai chi was simply compared with a treatment as usual control group. In this study, Tai chi 24 - form was practiced for 60 minutes three times a week for 16 weeks. Result: Immune cell number and immune cell activity increased in the tai chi group as compared to the control group. Again this finding may result from comparing an active group (tai chi) with an inactive group (treatment as usual), highlighting the importance of comparing active treatment groups to determine the efficacy of tai chi. Muscle Strength Zhou M, Peng N, Dai Q, Li HW, Shi RG, Huang W. Effect of Tai Chi on muscle strength of the lower extremities in the elderly. Chin J integr Med. 2015; [Epub ahead of print]. Method: In a study on muscle strength of the lower extremities in the elderly, long-term tai chi practitioners were compared to those who did not practice tai chi. Result: The strength of several muscle groups including the quadriceps and hamstrings was greater in the tai chi practitioner than the non-practitioner group. Further, muscle strength and the duration of tai chi practice were significantly correlated. Sun J, Kanagawa K, Sasaki J, Ooki S, Xu H, Wang L. Tai Chi improves cognitive and physical function in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial. J Phys Ther Sci. 2015;27:1467-71. Method: Muscle strength is typically measured in the lower extremities following tai chi, at least two studies have assessed upper limb strength. In one of these studies, elderly participants were randomly assigned to a tai chi group that practiced for six months as compared to a control group who participated in other non-athletic activities. Result: After 3 months there was no difference between the groups on one leg standing time with eyes open. However, grip strength was greater and both the five minute fast walking speed and 10 minute normal walking speed were significantly greater in the tai chi group. Lin SF, Sung HC, Li TL, Hsieh TC, Lan HC, Perng SJ, The effects of Tai-Chi in conjunction with thera-band resistance exercise on functional fitness and muscle strength among community-based older people. J Clin Nurs. 2015;24:1357-66 Method: Researchers used resistance training with the upper extremities in conjunction with tai chi as compared to a group that did not receive tai chi or resistance exercise. Therabands (wide rubber strips) were used for the resistance training which was held for 60 minutes twice weekly for a period of 16 weeks. Result: After this training, the intervention group showed a significant increase in muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities. These effects are not surprising inasmuch as the tai chi exercise would be expected to strengthen the lower limbs while the Theraband resistance training is focused on increasing upper limb strength. Muscular Sclerosis Azimzadeh E, Hosseini MA, Nourozi K, Davidson PM. Effect of Tai Chi Chuan on balance in women with multiple sclerosis. Complement Ther Clin Pract. 2015;21:57-60. Method: A randomized controlled study, 36 women with multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned to a tai chi or a control group. Result: After 12 weeks of twice a week Yang style tai chi sessions, the tai chi group had better balance scores on the Berg balance scale. Unfortunately this was assessed by self-report rather than objectively observed. Myocardial Infarction Nery RM, Zanini M, de Lima JB, Buhler RP, da Silveira AD, Stein R. Tai Chi Chuan improves functional capacity after myocardial infarction: a randomized clinical trial. Am Heart J. 2015;169:854-60. Method: A single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, patients assigned to the tai chi group participated in three weekly sessions of tai chi for 12 weeks while the control group participated in full-body stretching exercises. Result: Patients with myocardial infarction typically show decreased peak oxygen consumption. At the end of the study the tai chi group showed a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption while the control group showed a nonsignificant decline. Obesity with Depression Symptoms Liu X, Vitetta L, Kostner K, Crompton D, Williams G, Brown WJ, CC, Oei TP, Byrne G, Martin JH, Whiteford H. The effects of Tai Chi in centrally obese adults with depression symptoms. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015. Method: In a study on obese people with elevated depression symptoms, 213 participants were randomly assigned to a 24-week tai chi intervention or a waitlist control group. Result: The tai chi group showed a significant decrease in depression and stress and an increase in leg strength. These improvements were maintained for the tai chi group over the second 12 weeks of follow-up. Hsu WH, Hsu RW, Lin ZR, Fan CH. Effects of circuit exercise and Tai Chi on body composition in middle-aged and older women. Geriatr Gerontol Int. 2015; 15:282-8. Method: In still another study on body composition, a Yang style tai chi group was compared to an exercise group, with both groups exercising 60 minutes three times per week for 12 weeks. Result: The tai chi group showed a decrease in systolic blood pressure. However, the exercise group showed greater benefits included increases in basal metabolic rate, total body muscle mass, lean body mass and bone mineral content and decreases in body mass index, body fat and diastolic pressure. These results perhaps are not surprising in that the tai chi group practiced with the same frequency but with only 50 to 60% the intensity of that of the exercise group. Osteoporosis Wang H, Yu B, Chen W, Lu Y Yu D. Simplified Tai Chi resistance training versus traditional Tai Chi in slowing bone loss in postmenopausal women. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015. Method: one randomized controlled trial and one systematic review on osteoporosis were located. In the randomized controlled trial, 119 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to a Yang style tai chi resistance training, a traditional tai chi or a routine activity group. Result: Although the routine activity group had lower L2 - L4 bone density, neither the tai chi nor the resistance training groups experienced bone loss. Parkinson's Disease Zhang TY, Hu Y, Nie ZY, Jin RX, Chen F, Guan Q, Hu B, Gu CY, Zhu L, Jin LJ. Effects of Tai Chi and multimodal exercise training on movement and balance function in mild to moderate idiopathic Parkinson disease. Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 2015;94:921-9. Method: In still another randomized controlled trial, tai chi was compared to multimodal exercise training and the groups were assessed after 12 weeks of the program. Result: In this study, both groups improved on movements, balance and on Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor examination scores. Zhou J, Yin T, Gao Q, Yang XC. A meta-analysis on the efficacy of Tai Chi in patients with Parkinson's disease between 2008 and 2014. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015. Method: Meta-analysis, of the aggregated results of 9 studies. Result: Results favored tai chi on improving motor function and balance. Once again, gate velocity, stride length and quality of life were not affected. However, the authors interpreted these findings cautiously because of the small treatment effects, the methodological flaws of the eligible studies and the insufficient follow-up. Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Shin JH, Lee Y, Kim SG, Choi BY, Lee HS, Bang SY. The beneficial effects of Tai Chi exercise on endothelial function and arterial stiffness in elderly women with rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis Res Ther. 2015;17. Method: Given that rheumatoid arthritis is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, several measures of that risk were taken in a tai chi study on rheumatoid arthritis [53]. Patients were randomly assigned to either a tai chi group receiving once a week sessions for 3 months or a control group who received general information about the benefits of exercise. Result: Endothelial function increased and arterial stiffness and cholesterol decreased in the tai chi group. Surprisingly, pain was not assessed in this study. Schizophrenia Ho RT, Fong TC, Wan AH, Au-Yeung FS, A randomized controlled trial on the psychophysiological effects of physical exercise and Tai-Chi in patients with chronic schizophrenia. 2016;171:42-9. Method: Patients were randomized to tai chi, exercise or waitlist control groups. Both exercise groups received 12 weeks of the intervention and assessments were made at 3 and 6-month follow-ups. Result: Both exercise groups showed significant decreases in motor deficits and increases in backward digit span, and the exercise group also showed fewer negative schizophrenic symptoms (such as lethargy and apathy) as well as fewer depression symptoms. Seated Tai Chi Lee KY, Hui-Chan CW, Tsang WW. The effects of practicing sitting Tal Chi on balance control and eye-hand coordination in the older adults: a randomized controlled trial. Disabil Rehabil. 2015;37:790-4. Method: In a randomized controlled study on seated tai chi, sitting balance and eye hand coordination were assessed. In this study, the tai chi group was compared to an exercise group who underwent three months of training for a total of 36 sessions including one hour sessions three times per week. Result: The tai chi group improved on weight shifting while sitting and on maximum reaching distance from the seated position. Hsu CY, Moyle W, Cooke M, Jones C. Seated Tai Chi versus usual activities in older people using wheelchairs: a randomized controlled trial. Complement Ther Med. 2016;24:1-6. Method: In another seated tai chi randomized controlled study, older people in wheelchairs were randomly assigned to a group receiving seated tai chi versus a group engaging in their usual activity.The tai chi group had 40 minutes of seated tai chi three times a week for 26 weeks. Result: The seated tai chi group had lower depression scores and higher quality of life scores including general health, physical health, psychological health, and social relations. Unfortunately, once again, only self-report measures were taken. Spinal Cord Injury Pain Shem K, Karasik D, Carufel P, Kao MC, Zheng P. Seated Tai Chi to Alleviate and improve quality of life in individuals with spinal cord disorder. J Spinal Cord Med. 2016; [Epub ahead of print]. Method: Seated tai chi has been used with those who have spinal cord injuries. In a single arm study, 26 participants were enrolled for a 12 week seated tai chi course consisting of weekly sessions. Result: After each session the patients reported less pain, better sense of emotional well-being, mental distraction, physical well-being and a sense of spiritual connection. However, attrition was high with only nine participants completing half of the 12 sessions and once again this was not a randomized controlled study with a comparison group to validate the effects of tai chi on spinal cord injury pain. However, this is a rare example of the use of seated tai chi. Tsang WW, Gao KL, Chan KM, Purves S, Macfarlane DJ, Fong SS. Sitting Tai Chi improves the balance control and muscle strength of community-dwelling persons with spinal cord injuries: a pilot study. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015. Method: In another seated tai chi study, patients with spinal cord injuries were given 90 minute sessions two times a week for 12 weeks or assigned to a control group. Result: At the end of the intervention, the seated tai chi group showed improved dynamic sitting balance and greater hand grip strength. However, the groups did not differ on quality of life measures. Once again, this is a small sample and the groups were not randomly assigned. Further, seated tai chi is rarely practiced, although it would clearly be the tai chi of choice for patients who are immobilized with spinal cord injuries. Stroke Zheng G, Huang M, Liu F, Li S, Chen L. Tai Chi Chuan for the primary prevention of stroke in middle-aged and elderly adults: a systematic review. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015. Method: In a systematic review 36 eligible studies with a total of 2393 participants were identified. Result: When the risk factors for stroke were considered, the analysis revealed that tai chi was correlated with lower body weight, body mass index, as well as lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and lower low density lipoprotein levels even for less than a half year of intervention. However, when tai chi was compared to similar exercises, the primary effect was only lower blood pressure. Student Stress Bao X, Jin K. The beneficial effect of Tai Chi on self-concept in adolescents. Int J Psychol. 2015;50:101-5. Method: A control group comparison, a randomized controlled trial and a systematic review were found in the recent literature on tai chi for student stress (see table 1). In the non-controlled group comparison 160 middle school students were given a one-year tai chi program comprised of 60 minute sessions given five times a week [9]. Result: The tai chi group showed improvement in behavior, intellectual and school status and popularity as well as reduced anxiety as compared to the control group. Zheng G, Lan X, Li M, Ling K, Lin H, Chen L, Tao J, Li J, Zheng X, Chen B, Fang Q. Effectiveness of Tai Chi on physical and psychological health of college students: Results of a Randomized controlled trial. PLoS. 2015;10. Method: In a study on college students, 206 participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week tai chi group or to a control group that was instructed to continue their original activities. Result: The tai chi group showed significant improvements in flexibility on the sit and reach test and on balance, and no adverse events were noted. Webster CS, Luo AY, Krageloh C, Moir F, Henning M. A systematic review of the health benefits of Tai Chi for students in higher education. Prev Med Rep. 2015;3:103-12. Method: A systematic review on tai chi with university students including 68 reports on a sample of 9,263 students. Result: Four primary and eight secondary outcomes were noted. These included increased flexibility, reduced depression symptoms, decreased anxiety and improved interpersonal sensitivity. The secondary outcomes were improved lung capacity, better balance, faster running time, better quality sleep, reduced symptoms of compulsion, somatization and phobia and decreased hostility. The authors suggested that universities may provide tai chi as a means of promoting the well-being of their students. Vagal Activity Studies Wei GX, Li YF, Yue XL, Ma X, Chang YK, Yi LY, Li JC, Zuo XN. Tai Chi Chuan modulates heart rate variability during abdominal breathing in elderly adults. Psych J. 2015; [Epub ahead of print]. Method: A comparison between tai chi practitioners with approximately 20 years' experience and controls matched by age, sex and education. Result: Suggested increased vagal activity for the tai chi group and greater balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic activity during tai chi. Vagal activity has been noted to increase even after only five minutes of tai chi exercise by inexperienced individuals. Fong SS, Wong JY, Chung LM, Yam TT, Chung LM, Lee YM, Luk WS, Ng SS. Changes in heart-rate variability of survivors of nasopharyngeal cancer during Tai Chi Qigong practice. J Phys Ther Sci. 2015;27:1577-9. Method: Monitoring of vagal activity. Result: In this study, during the fourth and fifth minutes of tai chi exercise increased high-frequency power and decreased low-frequency power were noted. It is not clear, however, whether these effects were transient or maintained as the monitoring of vagal activity was too short. It would also be important to compare the effects of tai chi and other forms of exercise on vagal activity. - Yoga 2015-2017 Arthritis Cheung C, Park J, Wyman JF. Effects of yoga on symptoms, physical function, and psychosocial outcomes in adults with osteoarthritis: a focused review. Am J Phys Rehabil. 2016;95:139-51.

Improving access to yoga: barriers to and motivators for practice among health professions students. Adv Mind Body Med. 2015;29:6-13. METHOD: The purpose of this study was to study the barriers and motivators to practicing yoga in health professions students. RESULTS: The barriers given included time, cost, lack of pragmatic information about access to yoga classes and stereotypes related to flexibility, athleticism and typical yoga practitioners. The motivators given included athleticism, health promotion, emotional well-being, seeking pain relief and sense of community. Beneficial effects Jiang Q, Wu Z, Zhou L, Dunlop J, Chen P. Effects of yoga intervention during pregnancy: a review for current status. Am J Perinatol. 2015;32:503-14. METHODS: The purpose of this systematic review of 10 randomized controlled trials was to see the beneficial effects of yoga on pregnant women. RESULTS: The study suggested that those in the yoga groups had a lower incidence of prenatal disorders, lower levels of pain and stress, higher relationship scores and greater gestational age offspring. Rakhshani A, Nagarathna R, Mhaskar A, Thomas A, Gunasheela S. Effects of yoga on utero-fetal-placental circulation in high-risk pregnancy: a randomized controlled Med. 2015; [Epub ahead of print]. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of yoga on fetal growth measures and uterine artery resistance a yoga group was compared to a group who received standard care plus walking. RESULTS: The results suggested significantly better growth measures for the fetuses of the yoga group including parietal diameter, femur length, head circumference and fetal weight, and uterine artery resistance was significantly lower in the yoga group, thus suggesting better fetal circulation.
