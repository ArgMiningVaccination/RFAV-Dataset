Immunity and health There's no inside or outside according to Ayurveda. Seasonal changes affect not just the weather, but also the health of people. Some people are particularly vulnerable and fall ill during changes of season. This problem worsens during spring and fall, causing allergies. In a household of five people, one suffers from allergies while others may not face this problem. Have you ever wondered why is it that all members of a household don't fall ill when they eat the same food and stay in the same environment? The answer to this question is immunity! Immunity refers to the ability to fight diseases. Everyone has an immune system in their body that fights diseases and overcomes viruses and bacteria. Those who have a strong immune system face no problems during the flu seasons, while those with weak immunity are more likely to fall ill. Once immunity is compromised, the body loses its ability to fight diseases. In such a situation, a wellness-based medical system like Ayurveda can be helpful. Herbal immune system boosters as recommended in Ayurveda can help improve your immunity. Ayurveda and Immunity Ayurveda is a 5000-year-old wellness system that has its origins in India. Ancient texts describe medicinal herbs to be used to treat diseases and improve health. Ayurveda uses the concept of Tridosha or three functional energies to explain diseases. Vata, Pitta, and Kapha are the three energies in your body present in varying proportions depending on your Prakriti or unique constitution. So, when does a health problem or an illness arise? When the Tridosha, the three bio-energies, are not at their optimal levels. Your Ayurvedic practitioner can explain any imbalance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha your body is experiencing. In Ayurveda, digestion is treated as a key metabolic process that helps in ensuring good health. Agni is the digestive fire, which according to Ayurvedic principles needs to be strong to ensure digestive strength. Agni may be weakened due to an imbalance in any of the Doshas. This can cause various health problems. A key by-product of digestion is Ojas: a substance that imparts vigor and vitality to the body and is considered responsible for immunity. According to Ayurveda, a weak Ojas of the body can make you susceptible to several illnesses. It occurs when our digestive system is not functioning in a manner. The vigor and vitality decrease, and thus immunity falls. In addition to herbal immunity booster, Ayurveda's approach will never divert you from your path of holistic treatment.
