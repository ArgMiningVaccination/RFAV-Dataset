The CDC recommends that everyone stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines for their age group: Currently, the CDC recommends one updated COVID-19 booster dose for everyone 5 years and older, and for children 6 months to 4 years who completed the Moderna primary series. Multiple studies show that the updated bivalent COVID-19 booster works against highly contagious omicron subvariants, including [XBB.1.5](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/new-xbb15-covid-19-variant-spreading-rapidly-through-us), as well as the original coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) strain. See below for more information and follow the state's progress on the [California vaccine administration dashboard](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccination-progress-data/). Vaccine news and information Updated COVID-19 boosters target omicron subvariants, including XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.5, and the original coronavirus strains. People 5 and older are eligible to receive a Pfizer bivalent booster and people 6 months and older are eligible to receive the Moderna bivalent booster. Both [are authorized](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines) to be given at least two months after the second dose in a primary vaccine series or two months after someone's last booster shot. Some experts recommend waiting three months after a COVID-19 illness to get the bivalent booster. UCLA Health is offering bivalent booster appointments at several primary care clinics. Patients can [directly schedule their booster appointment in myUCLAhealth](https://my.uclahealth.org/MyChart/Scheduling). If your preferred bivalent booster appointment is not available in myUCLAhealth, [you can make an appointment at a local pharmacy](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/). Kids 6 months to 5 years eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccine: The [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0618-children-vaccine.html) the COVID-19 vaccine for all children 6 months to 5 years. The [FDA authorized](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-children) both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for this age group. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that is authorized for children from 6 months through 4 years is delivered in three doses. The initial two doses are administered three weeks apart. The third dose is administered at least eight weeks after the second dose. You can [review the Pfizer-BioNTech fact sheet here](https://www.fda.gov/media/159313/download). The Moderna vaccine that is authorized for kids 6 months through 5 years is delivered in two doses, one month apart. A third primary series dose may be administered at least one month after the second dose to immunocompromised individuals. You can [review the Moderna fact sheet here](https://www.fda.gov/media/159309/download). Vaccine appointments for children 6 months to 5 years old can be scheduled via [myUCLAhealth](https://my.uclahealth.org/MyChart/Authentication/Login?) or by calling your child's primary care clinic. Novavax vaccine authorized by FDA for emergency use: The [FDA issued an emergency use authorization](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-adjuvanted) for the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in July 2022. This authorization is specifically for unvaccinated adults who are 18 and older. The Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted is administered as a two-dose primary series, three weeks apart. You can view the [Novavax fact sheet here](https://www.fda.gov/media/159898/download), and see [more information on the CDC website here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/novavax.html). Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines FDA approved: In August 2021, the [FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine) two-dose primary series for people 16 and older. They extended the full approval for adolescents 12 through 15 years old in July 2022. It is now known as [Comirnaty](https://www.comirnaty.com/). In January 2022, the [FDA granted full approval to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-key-action-approving-second-covid-19-vaccine) two-dose primary series for people 18 and older. It is now known as [Spikevax](https://spikevax.com/). Lower doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine are still available to children ages 6 months and older under emergency use status. When to consider Johnson & Johnson vaccine: The CDC now advises that in most situations, the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for both the initial vaccine series and booster dose due to the risk of serious adverse effects. The CDC notes that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may be considered in some situations, including for people who: - Had a severe reaction after an mRNA vaccine dose or who have a severe allergy to an ingredient in the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. - Would otherwise remain unvaccinated for COVID-19 due to limited access to the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. - Want to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine despite safety concerns. Additional primary vaccine dose recommended for certain immunocompromised people [The CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) that moderately or severely immunocompromised people aged 5 and older who are more susceptible to infection \u2014 and meet the following criteria \u2014receive a third mRNA vaccine dose as part of their primary vaccine series. - In active cancer treatment for solid tumors or hematologic malignancies. - Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system. - Received a stem cell transplant or CAR T-cell therapy within the last two years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system. - Have moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency, such as DiGeorge syndrome or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. - Have advanced or untreated HIV infection. - Undergoing active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory. This additional vaccine dose is different than a booster. Immunocompromised people should follow booster guidance when eligible and reach out to their primary doctor with questions.
