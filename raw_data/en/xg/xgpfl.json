The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine--have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Public Health, School of Pharmacy, the Graduate School, and the Faculty of Religion. The University, operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, is committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. Loma Linda University is a Seventh-day Adventist coeducational, health-sciences institution located in inland southern California. It is part of the Seventh-day Adventist system of higher education.

It is committed to equal education and employmentopportunities for men and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissionspolicies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or anyUniversity-administered program. Any student with a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) who needs to arrange reasonable accommodation must contact the dean, or designee, ofthe School of Allied Health Professions. All discussions will remain confidential. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and in substantial compliance with T itle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the V ietnam Era V eterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans ofthe V ietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without dis - crimination on the basis of age, except in those programs where age is a bona fide acade - mic qualification for admission in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimina- tion Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employ - ment, including but not limited to 42 USC Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 6-15 of 12926(d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the CaliforniaCode of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and ArticleI, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that T itle IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day AdventistChurch. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles ofmorality and deportment as interpreted by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. TheUniversity claims exemptions from the provisions of T itle IX set forth Action The University routinely monitors its educational and employment practices regarding women, minorities, and the handicapped to ensure compliance with thelaw and University policy. The University's affirmative action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, studentservices, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to processstudent complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy ofnondiscrimination based on gender or handicap. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmative action officer. Employment-related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provi-sions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination inacademic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the acade-mic administration.12 SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS Charles Dart

United States immigration regulations require a prospective student to document his/her financialresources for tuition, fees, and living expenses.For international students, on-campus employmentis allowed but limited by visa regulations. Forexample, for F-1 and J-1 students, employment islimited to a maximum of twenty hours per weekwhile school is in session. Scholarships, assistant - ships, and living stipends are rarely available at Loma Linda University because it is a small, pri - vate university (i.e., not supported by the U.S. orCalifornia state government but rather is churchsponsored). Employment plans require approval bya designated school official in InternationalStudent Services. VISAS F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 stu-dent visa is the choice for most international stu-dents attending Loma Linda University. This visaallows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates,preceptorships, and English-as-a-second-languagestudies). Degree-earning students are subject tostudy-load requirements and are allowed limitedon-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after astudent has been accepted into a program, haspaid the advance deposit, and has documentedhis/her finacial plan for the chosen program.Contact International Student Services at (909)558-4995 for further information. J exchange-visitors visas Loma Linda University has an Exchange Visitor Program that is approved by the U.S.Department of State. This J-visa exchange pro-gram is authorized to sponsor degree-earning stu-dents, nondegree (continuing education) short- term scholars, visiting professors, and researchscholars.

Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations(e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution,Loma Linda University has limited authority overan exchange visitor since the authority resides inthe sponsoring organization. Under current exchange-visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or fulltime at Loma Linda University. Also, their creditsearned can be either degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work, but employment guidelines depend on the exchange category.

REGISTRATION AND ATTENDANCE Registration The student must register on the dates desig- nated in the Loma Linda University Course Schedule and Registration Instruction booklet pub- lished each quarter, as well as on dates designated in the quarterly Student Information Sheet availablefrom the Office of University Records. AutumnQuarter registration procedure includes recordinginformation on forms furnished by the Office ofUniversity Records, clearing financial arrangementswith the Student Accounting Office, and having astudent identification picture taken. A late-registration period of five days is provid- ed to accommodate students who have been unableto return to campus by the beginning of the term. Alate-registration fee of $50 will be charged duringthis period. The student may not attend class with- out being registered. Course changes A student may add courses that follow the gen- eral University calendar during the first seven calen-dar days of the quarter.

Course changes after the four-teenth day of the quarter affect the permanent graderecord. A Change of Program form must be filed. Withdrawal from school A student who withdraws from a program of study must file a Withdrawal from All Classes form.Tuition is refunded according to the practice out-lined in the Financial Information section of this BULLETIN. Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load isconsidered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a fullgraduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter.Professional programs, however, require consider-able clinical experience, for which only partial acad - emic credit is given at times. Consequently, a full study load often is not reflected by the number ofacademic credit units carried. To be considered a full-time student, an under - graduate student must be registered for at least 12 units of course work per quarter; and a graduate student must be registered for at least 8 units. A registration of 400 clock hours per quarter is alsoconsidered to be full time for any student. This isbased on forty hours per week for a ten-week quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at thisor another institution, is 16 quarter units for anundergraduate student and 12 quarter units for agraduate student. Full-time study loads are thosespecified by the departments for each program.Students of exceptional ability may register for addi - tional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. Non-LLU courses as part of total load for financial aid Correspondence, extension, independent study, and course work taken at any other institution con-stitute part of the student's study load. Only whenthe student enrolls in such courses using theConsortium Agreement form (from the Office ofPolicies and General Regulations Students of the School of Allied Health Professions are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting the policies and regulations pertinent toregistration, matriculation, and graduation.34 SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS Financial Aid) will the course(s) count on the stu - dent's total load as eligible for financial-aid and loan- deferment purposes. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or the-sis, is classified as a student. By filing an AcademicLoad Validation form every quarter at registration,the academic load may be validated for loan-defer - ment and immigration purposes. The student must be carrying IP (in progress) units or registered for aminimum of 1 new unit of research, dissertation, orthesis for the quarter. The academic work load iscounted as follows: full load\u2014minimum of 36 clock hours/week three-quarter load\u2014minimum of one-half load\u2014minimum clock hours/week one-quarter load\u2014minimum of 9 clock hours/week. A student may simultaneously earn more than one baccalaureate degree, provided there is a mini- mum of 20 units unique to each degree and provided all other degree requirements are met. Graduate-level courses Seniors who meet prerequisites may , with approval of the instructor and consent of the dean of the School of Allied Health Professions and the deanof the school offering the course, enroll for a limitednumber of graduate-level courses (500-level orabove). Only with special permission may credit beapplied to the undergraduate degree, in which casethe credit will not apply toward a graduate degree. Attendance Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinical, laboratory , special assignment, chapel) is required beginning with the first day of each term.Voluntary absences from laboratory assignments arenot permitted. Special examination It is expected that the student will take quizzes and examinations at the regularly scheduled time.To take an examination at a time other than when it is scheduled, the student must secure the consent of the instructor and the chair of the department andmust file with the instructor a permit obtained fromthe Office of the Dean. A fee is charged for a specialexamination. (See the Schedule of Charges in theFinancial Information section of this BULLETIN .) Academic residence In order to graduate from Loma Linda Univer- sity with a bachelor's degree, a student must com-plete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimumof 45 total units of course work, at this University. Aminimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required forall B.S. and postbaccalaureate degrees. Leave of absence A student who requires a temporary dis- continuance of studies must request in writing aleave of absence after one quarter's absence. Themaximum term for a leave is one year. A studentwho is not registered after one quarter' s absence (summer excluded in most cases) and has notrequested a leave of absence will be considered no longer in the program. In this case the student whoseeks re-entry must meet the entrance requirementsin force at the time of re-entrance and will enterunder the new BULLETIN . PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS It is important that students portray a professional image to those with whom they come in contact. Inappropriate dress, grooming, or conduct oftendetracts from patients' confidence in the quality oftheir care. In addition, Loma Linda University's affil-iating hospitals have standards that are reflected inthe guidelines below. For these reasons the followingstandards are provided. Students are required toadhere to these standards while enrolled in the pro-gram. A student failing to observe these dress and grooming codes may be dismissed by a faculty mem-ber from a class or building. Students will be allowedto return to the class/building when the problem iseliminated. Personal grooming Good taste indicates that haircuts, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat, and conservativerather than ostentatious. Grooming and style shouldalso be practical, so that the student can performassigned duties without embarrassment or inconve-nience. Specifically: Men's hair must be neatly trimmed and not fall below the collar . Ponytails, spikes, and dread - locks are not acceptable. Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and closely trimmed. Women's hair , if long, may be required to be tied back. Spikes and dreadlocks are not acceptable. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with a Christianinstitution and sensitive to a diverse studentpopulation. Excessive makeup and fragrances are not appropriate. Rings, if worn, should be low profile and limited to one finger per hand. Male students are notallowed to wear ear ornaments. If worn bywomen, ear ornaments are limited to simplestuds and should not drop below the bottom ofthe earlobes. Such ornaments are limited to oneper ear. Rings or ornaments in other anatomi-cal sites are not acceptable. Fingernails should be maintained in a profes- sional manner, closely trimmed, and should notinterfere with patient safety and comfort duringtreatments. Nail polish, if worn, should be of asubdued color. General attire Modest, casual wear is appropriate on campus and in class. Shorts must be neat and at least mid-thigh in length. Bare feet, bare midriffs, low neck-lines, or skin-tight clothing are not acceptable.POLICIES AND GENERAL REGULATIONS 35 Laboratory attire For many classes, students will have to \"dress down\" for laboratories. Instructors will specifyappropriate attire, which is to be worn only for labo - ratories and is not appropriate in other classrooms,on the main floor of Nichol Hall, or in any clinicalfacility. Clinical attire Professional dress is required for all clinical assignments, chapel attendance, any class that isheld in a clinical facility, and any class wherepatients are present. Professional dress includes:skirts /dresses of modest length or long pants (dresspants are recommended\u2014no jeans), closed-toeshoes, and name tags. Laboratory coats may berequired in some clinical settings. Conduct Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinicaltraining. Professional conduct includes (but is notlimited to) punctuality; and respect for other people,their property, and their right to learn. It alsoincludes an appropriate respect for those in authori - ty. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticismupon themselves, the School, or the University.Because students may be exposed to patients' rela-tives and friends in any public place, and becausetheir conversation and their attitudes have an effecton those around them, students are asked to observethe following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record mustbe held in strict confidence. Therefore, the dis-cussion of a patient' s diagnosis and treatment and other clinically related topics should beextremely guarded. A patient' s family and com - munity people may be listening and may incor- rectly interpret the things discussed. Carelesstalk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayedsince it may seem uncaring and be disturbing tothose who are ill and suffering, as well as to thefamily members. Student and staff behavior in the professional situation may be the deciding influence for oragainst Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. SPECIAL COURSE WORK/CREDIT Correspondence course As a general rule, the student may not register for a correspondence course that duplicates a courseoffered at the University. If the student is a candi-date for graduation, the course must be completed amonth before graduation. Information and applica-tion forms for Griggs University Home StudyInternational (the Seventh-day Adventist correspon - dence school) in W ashington, D.C., may be obtained at the Office of University Records.Extension study To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an accept-ed course. Registration for it requires the approval ofthe department chair and the consent of the dean. Independent study Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair . The student is responsible for completion of theDirected/Independent Study Title Request form inaddition to the regular registration. Credit is normal-ly limited to 2 units during the program of study.Under special circumstances, more than 2 units maybe taken. The work is to be completed in adequatetime before graduation to allow recording in theOffice of University Records. Waiver/Equivalency A requirement may sometimes be waived on the basis of prior course work, experience, or licen-sure. If certain conditions are met, credit may begiven. In either case, an examination may berequired. An examination in a given subject may be taken only once. The grade for any credit granted isrecorded as an S after the student has earned atleast 12 units of acceptable credit at this Univer-sity.Credit cannot be earned in this way to make up for acourse in which an unsatisfactory grade wasreceived. All examinations must be taken before thelast quarter of the program of study. Requests are made to the dean on the Petition to Obtain Credit by Examination form. There is afee for an examination.

Newborn, pediatric, adult, and elderly patients are treated for a wide range of problems\u2014infant respiratory distress syndrome; trauma; cardiopulmonary arrest;conditions brought on by shock; postoperative surgical and respiratory dis-eases such as pneumonia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. The respiratory care practitioner is a member of the health care team in medical cen- ters, skilled-nursing facilities, outpatient rehabilitation programs, physician offices, and in-home care. Many are involved in research and development of new and innovative careand equipment. They are effective communicators and compassionate caregivers, possess-ing an awareness of cultural sensitivity and diversity. They have leadership roles in patienteducation, wellness intervention, and development of respiratory care plans. Respiratorycare professionals apply critical-thinking skills in cardiopulmonary diagnostics and patientassessment to optimize decision making and delivery of patient care. In a time of high tech-nology, increasing growth of the elderly population, and increasing numbers of patientswith asthma and chronic lung disease, there is a greater demand for educated and skilledrespiratory care practitioners. PROFESSIONAL ACCREDIT ATION, LICENSURE, AND CREDENTIALING Respiratory care program accreditation is provided by the Commission on Accred- itation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) upon recommendation ofthe Committee on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC).

The primary concern of both therapist and assistant is to stimulate those changes in behavior patterns that will increase the patient's personal independence and ability to work within his/her cultural and personal milieu. To accomplish this goal, the occupational therapist evaluates the patient; sets up treatment goals; and works together with the occupational therapy assistant in selecting tasks from the gamut of normal daily self-careactivities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent-living skills regardlessof disability or handicap. Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adjustments to life's circumstances.A desire to teach and a background or interest in medical science are beneficial. Thoseinclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients developtheir capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creativearts, crafts, music, and teaching to work with disabled homemakers, children, and retiredpersons. OPPORTUNITIES Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants practice in general hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skilled-nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand-rehabilitation, work-evaluation, and adult day-care facilities). Occupa- tional therapy professionals have a wide choice of positions (using varied therapeutic skills with individuals of varying age and disability) and opportunities for advancement.

Medical Dosimetry is a very dynamic, exciting field involving a combined knowledge of mathe-matics, physics, and the biological and medicalsciences. Dosimetrists plan optimal isodose distri-butions and treatment dose calculations for a vari-ety of external beam as well as brachytherapytreatments. The medical dosimetrists must pos-sess excellent analytical skills, an ability to criti- cally evaluate data, and an aptitude for physics and mathematics. They must also be able to workclosely as a team with physicists, physicians, radi- ation therapists, and other personnel. Due to a lack of training programs in this disci- pline throughout the United States, there is ashortage of medical dosimetrists in many areas ofthe country. This program will aim to provide asupply of well-trained dosimetrists who will beable to meet the needs of Radiation Oncologyfacilities in the local area and beyond. THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Upon completion of the program, the graduate should be qualified to: 1. Demonstrate an ability to accurately com- plete dosimetric calculations and proceduresas they pertain to all aspects of treatmentplanning for external beam and brachythera-py techniques. 2.Develop and refine critical thinking skills to enhance ability to analyze and compute dosi - metric data as it relates to all aspects of radia - tion therapy treatmetn. 3. Exhibit professional behavior which includes ability to communicate with other profession- als and work well both individually and as ateam member. 4.Manage patients in an empathetic manner and exhibit basic patient care proficiencies. 5. Support the professional code of ethics and comply with the stated scope of practice. ADMISSION Educational Background Students will either need to have 1) ARRT registration in Radiation Therapy Technology witha minimum of two years post graduation clinicalexperience or 2) A baccalaureate degree inphysics from an accrediated university. Program Design The length of the program will depend upon the entering qualifications. For ARRT candidatesthe course will be 4 quarters in length. For BScandidates it will be 5 quarters long. Instruction will be a mixture of lecture, labo- ratory , and clinical work. Students will be exposed to a variety of different methodologies withindosimetry including work with proton therapytreatment planning. All instruction will be conducted in the Radiation Medicine department at Loma LindaUnivesity Medical Center. The only exception tothis will be a two-week laboratory session inBrachytherapy at Long Beach Memorial MedicalCenter. The program faculty consists of physicists and dosimetrists who are extremely experiencedin their field, many of whom are experienced inboth photon and proton therapy treatment plan-ning. Accreditation The American Association of Medical Dosimetrists (AAMD) strongly supports the con-cept of formal dosimetry training, which leads toboard eligibilty for the certificate in medicaldosimetry (CMD). This qualification is consideredto be the \"gold standard\" in dosimety education.

Theseare: the Del E. Webb Memorial Library, includ- ing the Jorgensen Learning Resources, the Jesse Medical Library and Information Center, and the Veterans Administration Library Services. In addition to these facilities, specialized libraries are located in various medical and schooldepartments on campus. Central library The Del E. Webb Memorial Library is the cen- tral library of Loma Linda University. Its historicalroots go back to 1907, when a small library collec - tion was started in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium. In 1953 the growing collection wasmoved to its own building on the Loma Lindacampus. Then in 1981, a new library building wasbuilt from a grant by the Del E. Webb Foundation,giving the library a total floor space of 87,670square feet. This structure now houses the mainlibrary, while the old structure is now sharedbetween the Department of Archives and SpecialCollections and the bound retrospective journals.According to<http://www.llu.edu/llu/library/about/libstats2001-2002.htm> as of June 2002, the library has: 31 databases; and a total of 335,848 books, bound and current journals/periodicals, and media items,including: 156,041 monographic titles (print); and 6,138 journals (print and electronic). Library mission The mission of the Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of theUniversity's instructional, research, and serviceprograms. To this end the Library provides a fullrange of information-support services, including,but not limited to, reference, circulation, reserve, access to the Internet, and hundreds of onlinedatabases, e.g., full-text, automatic, selective dis - semination of information (SDI) services; programs; and services that supportdistance education and University outreach programs. Worldwide access The Library provides access to other collec- tions worldwide using Internet technologies. Italso participates in a number of national andregional networks. One of these is the NationalNetwork of the Libraries of Medicine, founded bythe National Library of Medicine. This structure isdivided into eight regional sections, one of whichis the Pacific Southwest Region. The Del E. WebbMemorial Library belongs to this region and is the designated medical resource library for San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Local librarycooperatives include the IEALC (Inland EmpireAcademic Library Cooperative) and SIRCULS(San Bernardino, Inyo, Riverside Counties UnitedLibrary Services). Membership in these coopera-tives gives our students, faculty , and staff access to the collections of these libraries. Archives and special collections The Department of Archives and Special Collections is the central repository of informa-tion on the history of Loma Linda University , the health sciences, and major collections onAdventism. In addition to print materials thatinclude rare books, theses, and dissertations,there are microforms, sound recordings, and sev - eral thousand photographs. Searchable digitized indexes for various document files are also avail - able via the Library's web site. The collection also includes 14,000 linear feet of archival materials, which include papers of various denominationaland University officials, as well as the congres - sional papers of the Honorable Jerry and Shirley Pettis.
