Top tips on how to detox heavy metals from vaccines.", "sitename": "Gentle Healing - Homeopathy in Dublin and Online", "date": "2020-11-30", "cleaned_text": "Did you notice that the number of people looking for heavy metals detox has multiplied lately? A few years ago we had barely heard of it. Trying to deal with vaccine damage has certainly played a role in rising interest. We all want to do our best to protect our children. When it comes to vaccination, the debate gets heated. Some believe vaccines are a godsend and will save the world. Others wouldn't touch them with a barge pole. Parents who belong to the second group are worried about mandatory vaccination. Current situation with Covid-19 and the race to develop a vaccine makes a lot of people nervous. They ask me time and time again what they can do to reduce the risk of vaccine damage in case we are left with no choice. The issue doesn't concern only children. Adults who work in certain sectors such as healthcare have to get vaccines to keep their job. If getting vaccinated doesn't particularly thrill you, it may be a good idea to do a blood test to check for antibodies. You may discover you are already immune. No matter whether you vaccinate by choice or because of the lack of it, there are things you can do to help the body cope better. After vaccinations our immune system needs all the help it can get. I compiled a list of suggestions, the more you can incorporate the better. 10 ways to detox from vaccines: 1. Bentonite clay First thing to think of as soon as the jab is given. Bentonite clay absorbs and removes toxins, heavy metals, chemicals and impurities. It carries a negative charge that bonds to the positive charge in many toxins. Apply it in a thick layer over the injection site, cover with wet gauze and leave it on for two hours. You can repeat this a few times. 2. Vitamin C Multiple vaccines raise the level of histamine in the blood, in rare cases to a fatal level. Vitamin C plays a crucial role in lowering blood histamine levels. It also encourages the immune system to develop antibodies and neutralises toxins such as mercury. Vitamin C has \"a potent and highly significant protective effect\" in the context of vaccine reactions, as stated in this [article](https://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/30/prevention-vaccine-reactions) in the respected peer-reviewed British Medical Journal. I suggest increasing vitamin C intake for at least a couple of weeks before the vaccination date and continue taking high enough dose for a few weeks after. On the day of the vaccination and the following couple of days consider taking enough vitamin C to reach the bowel tolerance. Dr. Klenner has done an incredible amount of research on the therapeutic effects of megadoses of vitamin C. Dr. Cathcart lays down the key principles of this research [here](http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1981/pdf/1981-v10n02-p125.pdf). This [table](http://www.doctoryourself.com/klenner_table.html) summarises the recommended dosage. 3. Heavy metals detox bath Make sure to soak in plenty of Epsom salt every day for a couple of weeks. In general, it is a good idea to have regular Epsom salt baths to draw out toxins and top up your magnesium. Magnesium is critical for removing heavy metals from the body. If you can't manage a full body bath, a foot soak is the next best thing. 4. Zinc Another mineral that protects against vaccine toxicity. Taking it for a couple of weeks before and after vaccination is very helpful. 5. Activated charcoal Tried and tested food poisoning remedy. Activated charcoal has been used for thousands of years. It attracts and binds toxins in your gut helping to eliminate them easily. 6. Probiotics Include high strength good quality probiotics to support your gut. 7. Silica Silica prevents aluminum from being absorbed in your gut and ensures that it's flushed out from the body. Bamboo extract contains very high levels of silica. You can also look at horsetail tincture. Homeopathic Silica 6x is another option. Even better, take it alongside bamboo extract or horsetail tincture. This will improve the absorption of silica. 8. Cilantro and chlorella Two very effective heavy metals detox components. Cilantro removes mercury and other heavy metals from the brain and hard-to-reach places. Chlorella detoxes most of environmental toxins and has high metal-absorbing capacity. It is also rich in various nutrients that aid the detoxification process. 9. Fulvic acid It's a naturally occurring organic deposit that helps to re-mineralize our body. Modern soil is depleted, which makes it very difficult to receive the required amount of minerals and nutrients even from a good variable diet. Clearly we need even more when we are fighting off an infection or experience a high level of stress. Vaccination certainly falls into the category of events that warrant extra support. For a few days before and after the vaccine make sure to include a high-quality mineral supplement. 10. Plenty of water Last but not least, plenty of pure water! All of the above supplements require lots of water to work. You need to be able to flush the toxins out. Homeopathy for vaccine detox Homeopathy can do a lot to help. First of all, you need to make sure you or your child is in the best possible shape before you vaccinate. Being as healthy and as strong as you can be will ensure that your body has the resources to handle the stress of the vaccination. If you are already depleted and unwell, suffering from chronic health issues, vaccination is much more likely to knock you off your feet and make you really ill. Getting your house in order before the vaccination is the most important step. Its impact far outweighs all the support measures listed above. This is where [constitutional homeopathic treatment](/homeopathy-rocks/) comes in. Constitutional treatment that is tailored to your specific symptoms and needs will get your immune system as strong as it can possibly be. As a result, you will handle the vaccines better and reduce the risk of developing adverse reactions and long-term vaccine damage. I work with clients from all over the world and find that [online consultations work really well](https://gentle-healing.com/homeopathy-online/). If you decide that you want to improve your health and you want my help, you can opt for an online treatment no matter where you are. Secondly, there are remedies made from specific vaccines. These remedies can be given before and after each vaccination. And finally, some remedies are particularly indicated in cases of adverse vaccine reaction. For example, Thuja, Silica, Sulphur - the list is long. As everything else in homeopathy, the remedy is selected based on the specific symptoms. Hope you find this post helpful. It's dreadful to feel cornered, defenceless and helpless. I want my patients to know that there is a lot they can do. Homeopathy is about empowering people, and this is hugely important to me.
