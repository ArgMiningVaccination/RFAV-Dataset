Vaccines are a desirable solution to prevent viral infections in poultry and reduce transmission to humans. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of an oil-adjuvanted inactivated H5N6 vaccine against highly pathogenic H5N6 and H5N1 influenza virus infections in chickens. Methods: The polybasic amino acid cleavage site depleted HA gene and NA gene of A/Waterfowl/Korea/S57/2016 (clade 2.3.4.4) (H5N6) was assembled with the rest of the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genes to construct the vaccine virus. The vaccine virus was propagated in fertilized eggs, partially purified using a tangential flow filtration (TFF) system, and inactivated using formalin. The chickens were intramuscularly immunized with 384 HA, 192HA, and 96HA units of oil-adjuvanted inactivated H5N6 vaccine. Antibody titer, survival rate, and lung pathology were evaluated against the homologous H5N6: A/waterfowl/Korea/S57/2016 (clade 2.3.4.4) and heterologous H5N1: A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (clade 1) viruses 12 and 4 weeks post-vaccination (p.v.), respectively. Data were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The 384HA (n = 10) and 192HA (n = 5) antigen-immunized chickens showed 100% survival after lethal infections with homologous H5N6, and no virus shedding was observed from tracheal and cloacal routes. All chickens that received the 384HA vaccine survived the challenge of heterologous H5N1 after 4 weeks of immunization. The chickens that received the 384HA vaccine showed mean HI titers of 60 and 240 after 12 and 4 weeks of vaccination, respectively, against HP H5N6, whereas a mean HI titer of 80 was observed in sera collected 4 weeks after vaccination against HP H5N1. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that one dose of 384HA oil-adjuvanted inactivated H5N6 vaccine can induce a long-lasting immune response against both homologous H5N6 and heterologous H5N1 infections in chickens.", "sitename": "IMR Press", "date": "2022-09-28", "cleaned_text": "[ Show Less ] These authors contributed equally.
