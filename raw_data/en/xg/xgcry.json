While many oncogenic drivers and drug resistance mechanisms have been discovered, it is generally unclear how these mechanisms interact to induce sensitivity or resistance in a cell line for a particular drug. To systematically unravel these mechanisms, we developed a combined computational and experimental approach based on high throughput datasets and show these can be employed to predict response to anti-cancer agents. Specifically, we characterized 30 breast cancer cell lines at the DNA, RNA and protein level, and measured the response to various inhibitors. We then constructed Bayesian models encompassing several of the important driver pathways and resistance mechanisms, which we extracted from the literature and knowledge bases. Subsequently we tested how well these models describe the available data. The models provide estimates of the relative contribution of each of the drivers and resistance mechanisms and allow estimation of latent variables such as 'pathway activation'. We demonstrate the utility of the models by thoroughly analyzing which parts of the data cannot be explained even by fairly extensive models. This provides interesting new leads and narrows down which follow-up studies may be most fruitful to advance our understanding of drug response. The systematic, quantitative understanding of drug response gained from these models will contribute significantly towards precision medicine for individual cancer patients.Citation Format: Lodewyk Wessels, Bram Thijssen, Kathy Jastrzebski, Roderick Beijersbergen.
