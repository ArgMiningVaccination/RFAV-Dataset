In our more rational moments we recognize how much we need you, how incomplete we are as educators and persons without your divine guidance. We thank you for your infinite patience with us, for your ever con- tinuing desire for an intimate relationship with us in spite of our frequent and complete rejections of you. Please help us to make better use of the unlimited power for good that is so easily available to us through you. You well know the tremendous challenges we face in our chosen profession. Help us, we pray, Father, help us meet the needs of our students, improve our relationships with our colleagues and our administrators, maintain the necessary close affinity to our families, and still be the persons you intended us to be. We thank you for this opportunity to gather together and to learn more about our profession, one another, and ourselves. Finally, we thank you for this food you have provided. May it sustain us in our efforts to serve our profession, ourselves, and you. Amen.Wayne Brum bach 14 PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS THE \"REAL\" WORLD OF PHYSICAL EDUCATIONSHELDON L. FORDHAMUniversity of Illinois at Chicago CircleSeveral weeks ago as I began to think of what I should say to you, I was re- minded of a story told about one of our sports philosophersa man named Lawrence Berra. You'll remember him better as Yogi Berraformerly a catcher with the New York Yankees and currently the manager of the New York Mets. He was given an ovation on Yogi Berra Day in Sportsmans Park in St. Louis, and the fans gave him a heartfelt expression of their esteem with a trip to Ber- muda, matched luggage, and several television sets. When his turn came to re- spond, in typical Berra fashion he said, \"I sure want to thank everyone who made this day necessary.\"Your president last year, Vern Sprague, spoke eloquently about the keys to a fun( floral profession. You will recall that he asked for a reexamination ofour program if we are to achieve the objectives sought by all of us. He pro-posed a plan for developing guidelines for future directions and missions of theprofession 10, meet the dynamics of a changing culture. I believe that, alongwith the implementation of this plan, we need to assess what is happening today in what I wish to call the \"real\" world of physical education. How many times have college teachers and administrators been accused of not knowing what is happening out where the action is? How many times have students been critical of curricula that do not adequately prepare them for the realities of the job situation?The primary focus of my remarks is a personal assessment of what is hap-pening in physical education in one geographical section of this country en- compassing a total population of approximately 8 million persons. I have had an opportunity during the past' four months to observe programs and talk withprofessionals at the elementary, secondary, and junior college level. My vis- itations included a kaleidoscope of schools from a neat, well-ordered suburbanhigh school on Chicago's North Shore to a crowded, understaffed inner-cityhigh school on Martin Luther King Drive and from a small rural high school adjacent to the city to a metropolitan junior college with an enrollment, of 20000 students and facilities for half that number. Whether or not these obser- vations represent a cross section of programs throughout the United States isnot for me to say, or to decide, but I believe they represent an honest appraisalof the status of programs in elementary and secondary schools and junior col- leges in metropolitan Chicago.There was general agreement among those with whom I talked that schools arc now enlisting the help of all constituencies in the planning and uti-lization of facilities for physical education and recreation. One suburban school district has appointed a task force of citizens, parents, college professors, clergy, and agency people to study the issues of (I) required versus elective physical ed- ucation in the public schools, (2) coordination of all community recreation fa-cilities. and (3) adult recreation. 1515 16 The specter of an overemphasis on interscholastic and intercollegiate ath-letics still haunts many physical education programs. Physical education classesare still being used too often as tryout camps for recruiting varsity athletesinsome cases even at the elementary and junior high school level.A junior college department chairman asked me why many senior collegeprofessors look down their noses at junior college teachers and programs. Thissame chairman wondered why so few senior colleges have failed to articulateand adopt a common program for junior college transfers.The perceptual-motor learning concept is being implemented in many ele-mentary schools in the area, with more and more programs being conducted bytrained physical educators in cooperation with the classroom teacher. Someconcern was expressed by teachers regarding claims made for the intellectual as-pects of perceptual-motor learning without supporting research evidence.I saw behavioral objectives written in bold letters on a high school gym-nasium wall visible to all students in a gymnastics class, and an elementaryschool principal proudly showed me such a list for every academic subjecttaught in his school.Parents are becoming increasingly more involved in all types of schoolprograms, particularly in the elementary schools, and the importance of astrong physical education program was expressed by many educators. I heardseveral elementary school physical education teachers say, \"This is where it's allat.\" A recent nationwide survey conducted by the Athletic Institute indicated adefiniteincreasein elementary physical education activity throughout theUnited States.The teacher's role as a counselor and friend outside the classroom was con-tinually referred to, particularly in the high school. Teachers in the inner-cityschools were especially cognizant of such a role and expressed a strong beliefthat in many schools the dropout rate was directly proportional to the ability ofteachers to relate to their students.Some teachers felt that we should be less concerned about the cardio-vascular effects of exercise and more concerned that students have fun. Othersfelt that the process and functions of learning are infinitely more importantthan the color of the uniform. There was complete agreement that students atall levels must understand why they are doing things.\"Get rid of driver education\" was the plea of a high school departmentchairman who had lost instructional time from his physical education programto serve that area.A high school superintendent felt that a schoolwide discussion of the issueof all required versus elective courses in his school would result in some maturequestioning and reasoning as to the values of each. Obviously this discussionwould include physical education.\"We are learning a great deal from the women,\" said a high school de-partment chairman. Teaching assignments are now being made in manyschools based on competency rather than sex. The practice of men and womensharing the same offices has improved communication at our own institutionby at least 200 percent.The importance of every administrator being visible and available was con-stantly alluded to at every level. Teachers stated that along with this visibilityand availability administrators should be knowledgeable about what everyone isdoing. The're are no answers to problems in the confines of the ivory tower. 16 17 One of the most highly respected high school superintendents in the areatold me he believes there is no substitute for motivation and intellectual capac-ity on the part of his teachers. On the subject of motivation, he felt that we failto comprehend sometimes what an important part it plays in the success orfailure of a teacher.Decision-making in many of our schools is now becoming a team effort.An elementary school principal told me that he enlists the approval of all ap-propriate bodies before the appointment of any new teacher.Cooperating teachers in the high schools said they are continually lookingfor student teachers with the ability to organize and to be flexible. They wereemphatic in their belief that early exposure to a teaching experience (even asearly as the sophomore year) is an important component of the teacher edu-cation curricula. This is felt to be particularly true for students preparing toteach in the inner-city schools.The wordrecruitment,for so long a questionable word among educators,was a topic for discussion among many persons. Demographic studies indicatethat student enrollments are likely to decline in the next decade. Will our class-rooms and playing fields and gymnasiums be empty because we fail to providelearning experiences that are meaningful and relevant?The opportunity to observe on a firsthand basis the programs I have justdescribed was a rewarding experience, and I am pleased to report that manyphysical education programs, particularly at the elementary level, are movingahead in metropolitan Chicago. Innovative, creative, and imaginative programsoutnumber the stereotyped ones with which we are all so familiar. I saw lead-ership in many schools that is creative, intelligent, and democratic rather thanautocratic and self-centered.It is a sobering and disturbing experience, however, to observe that manyproblems we are facing in 1975 are essentially the same ones that existed as farback as the 1950s. Two studies conducted during that decade clearly illustratethis fact. A study by C.E. Forsythe, in which 34 selected physical educators wereasked to list current problems, was completed in 1952. The following is a par-tial listing of their comments:I. There is a lack of standarization and sequential development of ourphysical education curricula throughout our public schools and colleges.2. The professional preparation program provided in many institutions ofhigher education is of an inferior quality.3. There must be a reevaluation of the objectives and goals of physical edu-cation and the interpretation and understanding of these goals and ob-jectives by the professional physical educator..1.there is an irrational application of the competitive spirit in the pro-gram of activities for boys and girls at all levels.5. We must close the gap between what we know and what-we do in the Another compilation of basic issues and problems facing the professionwas completed by R.J. Francis in 1956 at the University of Wisconsin. He liststhe following: 1.There is a need for better public relations directed toward a better under-standing of physical education by our \"publics.\"21 There are too many impoverished curriculums in physical education.3. There is poor recruitment, selection, preparation, and retraining of pro-fessional personnel.1 7 18 4.\"filmy arc athiet Itproblems at all levels. There has been a cleavage be- tween athletics and other pliaSes of the physical education program. 5. We need a philosophy of the profession. There are too many sharply conflicting concepts of the nature and purposes of our profession.!Itis significant that these lists of problems represent the opinions and views of leaders in the profession, some of whom were presidents of this associ- ation. Have we been spinning our wheels during the past 25 years? Are we still struggling to establish the place of physical education in relation to themany other areas of organized subject matter?In an effort to seek a solution to some of the problems listed above and with a view toward strengthening the profession, I am proposing three courses of action. None of them is particularly profound; they cost little in actual dol- lars and can be practiced byeveryone. I suggest that we (1) increase our circle of communication, (2) maintain the glow of our teaching, and (3) make our prac- tice conform to our preachments.Everywhere, we turn todaywe encounter small circles of communication. These circles may encompassa private club or office or even a private road.The implication \"it's mine, keep out\" is always present. Inone sense, each of us needs a place of refuge. But there is another sense in which the bigness of a human being can be measured by the circles he draws to take in the world. The same analogy can be made to a profession. Some professionals include only physical education in the circle they draw. Others include health and recre- ation; stillothers include other disciplines. But there are too few Albert Schweitzers who draw a circle large enough for all. This profession will thrive and prosper only if we increase our circles of communication. Edward Mark- ham sums it up nicely in a poem:He drew a chile that shut me outHeretic, rebel, a thing to flout.But love and I had the wit to win:We drew a circle that took him in.Those of us who haveseen the newest teaching devices are impressed withhow this new technologycan extend the services of the teacher. High fidelityrecording and playback equipment can add audio collections to library books. Radio and television and language laboratories have increasedour level of teaching effectiveness. We will argue, however, that the teacher is still the nu- cleus around which our educational system must be built, and it is vital that we maintain our glow of teaching. \"Warm, understanding, friendly teachers are more effective than aloof, egotistical, and restricted teachers. Responsible, busi- nesslike, and systeMatic teachers are more effective than evading, unpleasant, and slipshod teachers. Stimulating and imaginative and' enthusiastic teachers are more effective than routine and dull teachers. Mediocre teaching exists be- cause it has been tolerated and condoned, not because institutions have failed in earnest efforts for improvement.\"3 Ralph Tyler, director of the Center for Ad- vanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, says that too many college professors find teaching a dull routine. They enjoy research for the excitement of discovering new knowledge. They like consulting with busi- ness and government for the application of knowledge to new problems. One significant way to revitalize teaching is to engage in experimentation that can at the same time yield the satisfactions of research and consultation and the rewards of working with young, active minds sharing the same quest.18 19 \"The best teacher wears a large invisible button that reads, '1 give a damn.\" \"4The teacher who believes that students become important not simply as prodi-gies in his area but as human beings engaged in the venture of living and at-tempting to achieve a higher level of individual and community or societal lifeis one who has maintained his glow of teaching.If the teacher is as important as we believe, then it is important that we re-alize the implications of our influence upon our students. Do you as a teacherdisplay personal drive, initiative, decisiveness, and good judgment? Do you alsodisplay the basic human qualities of compassion, reflectiveness, self-control,humility, and a touch of grace? It is a solemnly serious business to tell a stu-dent what to do, and itis also solemnly serious to set before him an examplethat runs counter to what we tell him. William James said, \"It is well for theworld, that in most of us by the age of thirty, the character has set like plaster,and will never soften again.\" Even though we feel that our own cast of charac-ter is safely set, we shouldcarefully consider those who are not so set and whowatch our words and our ways and shape their actions and utterances after us.In keeping with the long-established policy that NCPEAM presidents makerecommendations, I am proposing the following for consideration by PresidentI hisman and the Executive Council:I. Appoint a special committee to investigate the possibility of closer artic-ulation between senior colleges and the junior/community colleges inan effort to share mutual concerns and increase membership.2. Create a joint NCPEAM-NAPECW task force to make recommendationsto the Resolutions Committee for taking a stand on critical issues facingthe profession.3. Request that the NAPECW-NCPEAM Conferences and Projects Com-mittee be continued and proceed toward implementation of the recom-mendations made at this meeting last year by President Vernon Sprague.Create a special joint NCPEAM-NAPECW committee to be called theProfessional Communications Network. The report submitted by theCommittee to Review the Purposes of NCPEAM might prove-extremelyuseful in developing a plan of action. The committee should represent awide geographical area and be composed of persons with expertise andexperience in public relations.I would like to cluse with these words taken from James Michener's Firesof Spring:For this is the journey that men make: to find themselves. If theyfail in this, it doesn't matter what else they find. Money, position, fame,love, revenge are all of little consequence, and when the tickets are col-lected at the end of the ride, they are tossed into a bin marked failure.But if a man happens to find himself ... if he knows what he can be de-pended upon to do, the limits of his courage, the position from whichhe will no longer retreat ...the secret reservoirs of his determination,the extent of his dedication, the depth of his feeling for beauty, hishonest and unpostured goals . .. then he has found a mansion which hecan inhabit with dignity all the days of his life,REFERENCESI.

REACTION TO \"I KNOW YOU THINKYOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEANT\"GARY S. KRAHENBUHLArizona State UniversityMr. Scannell has given us an interesting and humorous look at some barriers tocommunication: It might be worth our while to review these barriers and tolook at some examples, especially as they relate to physical education.One of the barriers to communication presented is that of poor listeninghabits. Much has been written about people who are great speakers or who pos-sess special gifts for improvisation; yet rarely is an individual paid his due as acourteous, enkindling listener.Poor listening habits not only limit communication but suggest a lack ofcourtesy as well. The following exhortation admonishes Between Parent and Child andBetween Parent and Teenagerhave been written on this general theme byHaim Ginott. The essence of Dr. Ginott's thesis is that we should not only hearbut listen and try to understand feelings behind the words. It is only then thatan individual can truly communicate with the other party.A second barrier to communication discussed by Mr. Scannell is the gener-al problem area that includes such things as assumptions, inferences, and pre-dispositions. Perceptions of this nature are troublesome because they are almostalways narrower than reality and frequently distorted. A relevant example ofthis was highlighted several years ago in an article by Louie Crew in SaturdayReview: Education. The author had grown up as a less than physically giftedyoung man; however, he participated in physical education programs as part ofhis school experience. Unfortunately, this experience was unsatisfactory beca-use22 23 of certain assumptions made by his teachers. Instead of trying to teach thisyoung man to learn more about his physical health or help him develop abroader range of activities and skills that he could use in later life, his teachersled him to accept the role of a physically incompetent person with limited al-ternatives. Ile received no sympathy and little guidance. A short quotation mayfurther demonstrate his feelings:For a long time I treasured illusions that my experiences with physical mis-educationresulted merely from my provincial isolation, that real pro-fessionals elsewhere had surely identified and rectified these ills. But as Imoved from south to west to east, and even to England, I found very fewreal physical educators.Almost no one is interested in educating individuals to discover theirown physical resources and to integrate them with all other personal experi-ences. Almost everyone is interested in developing ever better professionalsto provide vicarious entertainment for a physically inept society.Themessageis clear. A false assumption lead Mr. Crew's teachers to encouragehimawayfrom activity. On the contrary, Mr. Crew wanted to learn about him-self and to improve his physical abilities.Another barrier to communication that Ed spoke about is the barrier oflanguage, semantics and the words themselves. This problem is especially evi-dent because although the number of technical words in the English languageis increasing, the general vocabulary of the typical American is shrinking. Anexample of this problem was brought home to me as I was doing some consult-ing work for the US Air Force. The specific project involved an analysis of in-structional cues used by instructor pilots with student pilots attempting tolearn the perceptual-motor skill of flying a jet fighter. It was found that 77 per-cent of the instructional cues given by the instructor pilot were essentially dys-functional. In other words, the cues that were given, which supposedly wouldhelp the student pilot execute the maneuver that was planned, in fact served asno help at all or actually led to a response opposite to the one planned. As allthe instructions were verbal, it is obvious that this lack of communication in-volved a problem with language or semantics.Another personal example that comes to mind is that of a young studentteacher attempting to teach children the overhand throw. This student wasfresh from his undergraduate kinesiology class. Part of his verbal instructionwent like this:Elie left foot steps out toward the target., knees slightly flexed, and the pel-vis Iwgins to rotate to the left, followed by the upper spine. When the fore-arm is rotated back to a lxmt horizontal' and the body is nearly facing thetarget, the arm immediately rotates and the shoulder and the elbow extends.As you might imagine, even though this explanation of the overhand throwwas correct, no useful information was communicated to his first grade class.To an experienced teacher this mistake is obvious, but this problem of commu-nication was very real to the young students.In conclusion, we might take a short look at Mr. Scannell's definition ofcommunication: \"Communication is a mutual exchange of information andunderstanding by any means.\" The responsibility for successful communication 23 24 rests on the shoulders of both the speaker and the listener. A person must not only hear but listen, however, and if communication ended here, I am afraid it would be a pretty dull world.It has been said that \"the mind is a fire to be lighted, not a vessel to be filled.\" For meaningful communication to take place in the teaching realm, we must strive to go beyond hearing, listening, and understanding. It is only when the topic becomes meaningful that the fires of intellectual .inquiry will be lit. Our purpose is to keep the flame of learning from being snuffed out by barriers to communication. 24 BODY OF KNOWLEDGE THE SOCIAL SCIENCE OF SPORT:A NEED FOR FURTHER KNOWLEDGESUSAN L. GREENDORFERUniversity of New MexicoThe recent growth of the social science of sportmore specifically, the sociol-ogy of sportas a field of study has stimulated great interest in both physicaleducation and sociology. A concern has arisen among some physical educators,however, as to the relationship of this area of specialization to physical edu-cation. They have argued that the social science of sport more appropriately be-longs in a.department of sociology, that the research problems undertaken havelittle to do with the study of human movement and thus are not aspects ofphysical education. On the other hand, there are physical educators who havewel\u00abmied this sulxlist ipline into the profession hoping that the contributionstoward positive social values claimed by physical education can finally be sub-stantiated. Unfortunately, both viewpoints have neglected the substance of thesubject matter with which the social science of sport is concerned, the meth-odology it employs, and the nature of the questions investigated. Therefore, thepurpose of this paper is to present another perspective, which may have rami-fications for the two viewpoints previously mentioned. ft is hoped that a fewguidelines and alternative directions for the social science of sport will be theresult.Although not a new idea, the possibility of the behavioral sciences' offer-ing new facts, meanings, and implications with reference to several given prob-lems in physical education has not been fully exploited. Despite the currentbandwagon interest in the behavioral sciences, the profession has not addresseditself, sociologically speaking, to the plea made by Cowell for an intelligent,systematic endeavor to revise current beliefs, to weed out errors, and to test theaccuracy of beliefs) Essentially, the achievement of this goal could be accom-plished through acquisition of more knowledge, which would result in agreater understanding of those influences and consequences of man's par-ticipation in sport and physical activity. Likewise, the goal of the social scienceof sport isto identify the regularity of underlying patterns of behavior in asport contextto describe them, to explain them, and eventually to predictthem. The objective is the understanding of sport and physical activity per se,with the assistance of sociological theory and atethodology.2Therefore, one of the first questions to be asked is simply, What are we tostudy? Past and present research offers a partial answer to this question: wemerely need to examine the literature. It becomes obvious that the sport sociol-ogist, as well as the physical educator, has been preoccupied with three mainaspects of social behavior: (a) behavioral dispositions toward sport and physicalactivity, (2) affective dispositions toward sport and physical activity, and (3) so-cial attributes of those individuals who are involved in some manifestation ofsport or physical activity. However, these topics hardly run the gamut ofhuman movement that can be explored from a behavioral perspective. Of neces-sity, knowledge is needed beyond observation of selected personality traits, atti-252 5 26 aides, and self-image.Itis time to reexamine these topics from more socio-logicallysignificant perspectives. Rather than listing personality traits, we should shift focus and treat aspects of personality as behavior induced by spe- cificsocial situations. For example, particular types or the degree of com- petitive and stressful sport situations that evoke aggressive behavior are yet to Ix identified. Furthermore, which significant others influence the developmentOf attitudes toward sport and to what degree? At what point during the lifecycle are such attitudes developed?hi order to gain a greater understanding of the role and significance ofphysic-al activity. we will need more abstract ideas and theoretical constructs and must use concepts from the social sciences. Unfortunately, physical edu-cation has been preoccupied with the concrete and the practical, with tech- nique, and with isolated findings that do not relate to a theoretical framework. In essence, we have been long on application or practice-and short on ideas.\"[hose great ideas that permeate the profession have been so grandiose as to be useless with respect to measurability, testability, and hence validity. Never-theless,it has been those general notions of character building, good sports- manship, and social benefits of physical education that have become dogma. Iloweccr, we should not permit such dogma to limit our inquisitiveness, our rigor in the pursuit of understanding, and our quest for knowledge about top- ics that essentially belong in physical education and need to be researched. Let us consider a few topics that can provide useful information. Keep in mind thatthese possibilities hardly exhaust the realm of potential ideas.First of all, knowledge can be extended beyond behavioral and affective dis-positions. Elements of social structure and the culture of given social systems should be examined.1 For instance, norms, values, and sanctions held by vari-ous sulx'ultures. relative to sport involvement, have not been fully explored. Al-though some information pertaining to the relationship of sport to the school exists, there has been little effort to distinguish between the values held by theschool as an entity in itself and those subgroups that constitute the populationof that school.In other words, the issueis one of reification as well as stratification.Furthermore. with the exception of the literature on the black athlete, thetopicrf minority group sport socialization has been virtually ignored. Whilesome Mementol notions pertaining to the black athlete have been explored,pertinent questions relative to the saliency of sport or concerning norms, sanc- tions, opportunity set (socializing situation), and other significant influences on nonblack minority groups have not been asked. What knowledge do we have twrtaining to the agents of socialization, role models, and reference groups of ethnicminorities? Thus, it would be of great value to pursue informationabout the Chicano and the Native American, particularly in the Southwest. We need to examine the extent to which physical activity is significant and the roleit plays within the cultures of these two groups. We need to discover the types of games most salient to both groups. Pursuit of such problems would broadenout base of knowledge. Findings would be relevant to the physical educator, as the knowledge rendered could have application to curriculum decisions andpractit es.With respect to racial issues, instead of posing questions that can be sys- tematically analyzed, we perpetuate notions that have never been verified. Doessport really promote good race relations and ethnic understanding? If the racesplay well together will such behavior be exhibited off the field? Are there suchthings as carry-over values and behaviors? We don't know; there is a dearth of research and empirical evidence on the subject. Small-group investigations of2( 27 team performance have not been concerned with the process of integration orwith the compatibility of contrasting value structures of team members. Need-less to add, consequences of such mixtures also remain unknown.Thus, there is a need to establish priorities for topics to be considered.Rather than devoting excessive time and energy to the descriptive studies ofgames and costumes, perhaps we should examine the social structure and socialprocesses of minority groups in a game or sport situation, As a result, questionscould be posed regarding the function of physical activity and sport withinthese sulxultures. Similarly, we could obtain explanatory as well as descriptiveinformation, We could gain insight into the values, expectations, and socialstructure of the culture as well as determine the extent to v.nich games reflectsuch social phenomena. More- specifically, the emphasis that both the cultureand the game activities place on conformity, cooperation, competition, achieve-ment, or aggression can be examined. The extent to which these behavioralmanifestations are evident in games could be empirically measured, and suchresearch would be theoretically derived utilizing continuous rather than nomi-nal variables. Thus, the problem of mutually exclusive behaviors would beeliminated.These notions can he extended into the realm of application as well. Oncepertinent facts are obtained, decisions relevant to curriculum can be made. Forinstance, a curriculum suitable for reservation Indians could be developed; ac-tivities and skills appropriate to the specific group could be included. Theadaptability ofitsimilar curriculum for urban Indians would not be prob-lematic. Thus, reasons and rationale for research and implementation wouldhave a foundation based on systematic investigation of the same social realityfor which application was intended.Another parallel example can also be cited. If, according to Merton, eachstratum or subgroup in a society has a socially approved adaptive mode of be-havior related to its social structure, and if, according to Loy, there is a link be-tween these adaptive modes of behavior and a typology of games, then boththeoretical implication and .practical application' can be served. On the onehand, hypotheses could be tested and some semblance of construct validitycould be obtained; on the other hand, grime forms and social class variablescould be related. In this respect, understanding can lead to selection of appro-priate activities, recognition of similarities between various game forms, and de-signed curriculum planning.Thus, in-depth study of the cultural milieu in which sport or physical ac-tivity takes place is essential. Focus should shift from one of description to oneof structural-functional relationships between games and the fiber of the cultureunder examination. Rather than posing unanswerable questions, such as thewhy of physical activity, emphasis should be placed on the how, when, andwhere of sport involvement. Within such a framework various theoretical no-tions pertaining to processes can be utilizedsuch as a social-learning para-digm, sociological theories of group organization, and social-psychological con-structs of aggression, achievement, cooperation, and competition.Somewhat related to the concept of culture and subculture is the notion ofsocial structure. The discovery of existent (or confirmation of nonexistent) re-lationships between elements of social structure (e.g., social-class variables) andsport involvement would provide more insight into the process of sport social-ization. Although physical education has been concerned with the notion ofgeneral or diffuse rolessuch as good sport and clean playerrecent literatureindicates that focus on the acquisition of specific roles would be more fruitfulfor research and application purposes.4 Moreover, awareness of how individuals2 7 28 acquire the necessary skills, knowledges, and dispositions to fulfill variousspent roles(e.g., participant, Ian, referee) could facilitate more effective en-actment of the role of physical educator. Knowledge of how, where, and underwhat circumstances individuals learn various sport roles and develop their sport'attitudes can enhance the physical educator's role as a socializing agent. Behav-ioral objectives could be written for ourselves, professionally, as we wouldknow the directions in which teaching behaviors should be designed and theteaching styles that would be most applicable. Utilizing such techniques, sportsocialization goals could be carefully delineated for each age group, objectivescould be determined in accordance to specific opportunity sets, and the typeand degree of exposure to sport role models could be predetermined and incor-porated into the physical education curriculum.,,.Another topic requiring further knowledge from the perspective of the so-cial St iences involves the development of motor patterns of children. To date,motor,development and motor learning have been devoted to the biological andneuromuscular aspects of movement. However, the inclusion of behavioral andaffective variables in studies of growth and development could provide several,heretofore unknown, explanations. For example, most specialists in motor de-velopment acknowledge the fact that skill and motor patterns are age relatedbut not necessarily age determined. It would seem, then, that behavioral, soci-etal, and cultural factors could influence movement activities and game prefer-ences. But the mechanisms and extent to which such influences are significantare not known.How much more enriching would motor development studies be if aspectsof child-rearing practices, social-class background, ordinal position in the fam-ily, and demographic data were included? Perhaps peers serve as a positive ref-erence group while the family serves as a negative influence on sport in-volvement. Or there may be certain normative mechanisms operant in thefamily but not in the school. Perhaps the existence of contradictory values be-tween these two social systems accounts for differential motor performances andmotor developmentperhaps not. Itis possible that certain reference grouprole models influence the development of motor patterns. We simply don'tknow.Although physiological stages of motor development have been identified,sociological and psychological influences on such development have not beendetermined. To what extent is skill acquisition a function of opportunity set?During childhood is reinforcement a factor in movement performance and incontinued physical activity? Given the complexity of skill acquisition, mightthere also be behavioral explanations as well as biological predictors?1,ogically, then, there may be interaction effects of physiological and so-cial-psychological factors. Yet collaborative endeavors with respect to the col-lection of multiple measures from the same subject are wanting. Perhaps someof the complexity of skill learning and motor development could be better un-derstood through combined efforts of several specialists in the field. Further-more, such strategies would increase depth and breadth of data; these endeavorswould be feasible and productive. Resultant information would certainly pro-vide material and principles for application.With respect to strategies of methodology, there is another point worthy ofemphasis. In addition to cross-sectional data-collection methods, more effortcould be directed toward longitudinal studies. Institutes devoted to the study ofhuman movement over the life cycle from many scientific perspectives mightriot be a figment of the imagination.28 29 Most noticeable in the s wrt scx-ialization literature is the absence of dataon childhood participation patterns. The primary subjects have been adolescentor college-age students who have been asked to recall earlier sport experiences.Nowhere in the literature have we studied the socialization process of the ath-lete as he or she develops from childhood to adulthood.Lest these past few remarks be misunderstood, let me hasten to add that myintention is not to tell specialists in motor learning, motor development, or thesocial science of sport what their interests ought to be. Rather, the purpose is toexpand potential sources of information. A little imagination can go a longway.At this juncture I would like to mention two additional areas that could bestudied from a social sciences perspective: the phenomena involved are play andleisure. Although both phenomena quite often serve as the medium throughwhich human movement occurs, these are two spheres about which physical ed-ucation knows very little. We have abdicated our role in dealing with conceptsand acquiring an understanding of play and leisure activities. Instead, we havebeen content to let psychologists and anthropologists become the experts onchildren's play and games and sociologists, the experts on leisure.We have done little work with both phenomena. In fact even our efforts to-ward description and definition have been minimal. Essential to the under-standing of both phenomena are identification and clear definition of con-structs. It is not adequate to label all activities engaged in during free time asleisure. Nor isit sufficient to consider all nonutilitarian behavior play. Tech-niques for identifying theoretical concepts, statements for specifying definitions,establishing linkages between concepts, and ordering statements to constructtheory are primary needs: Thus, the subject matter of leisure and play needs tobe approached from a perspective of context as well as text.5If understanding is our goal, then labels need to be converted to generalvariables and either-or concepts need to be transformed into measures of vari-ance. Relationships between measures need to be established. Now, it might beargued that theory building is not our hag. However, physical educators shouldbe the experts in play and leisure activities, particularly when gross motor skillsare involved, Therefore, it is logical that those most concerned with these phe-nomenashouldbetheleadersingathering knowledge and gainingunderstanding.Theoretical models and paradigms are used in the social sciences to testgeneralizability and thus to increase explanatory power. Physical educationcould benefit from use of such a strategy. For example, pursuit of leisure activ-ities could be explained from theoretical models that have measurable conceptsthat can be subjected to validation procedures. Perhaps the tension-excitementmodel could be used as a framework, or the socialization model may prove use-ful. The former paradigm views tension and excitement as a pleasurable con-trast to routinized aspects of everyday life, whereas the latter focuses on leisureinvolvement as a function of family influence. However, if both are inadequate,we willneedtosearchfor another framework in which to test viablehypotheses.Theory building would enable us to explain leisure and play involvement.A theoretical framework can focus our attention and assist in asking the rightquestionsthose that penetrate the surface of the phenomena. Leisure and playare multidimensional concepts of great complexity. We can understand some ofthis complexity by carefully defining concepts. The more carefully we defineconcepts, the more precision we gain in measuring phenomena. The more pre-29 30 cision in measurement, the greater the meaning of results. The greater themeaning, the more implication and application of information obtained.In essence it is maintained that we need more abstract ideas and theoreticalnotions in order to understand some of the phenomena with which we are con-cerned. To date, we have left pertinent aspects of both play and leisure to otherfields. It. is time we buy back into the sociology of leisure and into the anthro-pology of play. However, we must do so with a perspective that requires morethan mere description. We must have conceptual insight into play and leisure;utilization of a social sciences frame of reference can assist in this endeavor. Itis further maintained that such an approach would have application and mean-ing to the practitioner as well as to the researcher. In so doing we can weed outerrors, revise current beliefs, and test the accuracy of beliefs.Moving from conceptual 'aspects, let us now examine some ways in whichthe social science of sport could add to knowledge about some current issues.One issue pertains to the female participant or athlete: the second is related towhat is commonly known as athletics.With respect to women and sport there are many levels at which infor-mation can be sought. Although there are practical matters related to legal andeconomic aspects of this topic, little effort has been extended to understand thesignificance of recent legislation beyond these practical considerations. In fact,those relationships of most concern involving women, sport, and the law havebeen specific court cases. However, historical precedents that have influenced fe-male sport participation have not been utilized to gain perspective for thepresent or future. Moreover, several decisions relative to policy-making, guide-lines, and regulations have been based on past philosophy, which may or maynot have been more emotional than rational in foundation. If we are to trulyunderstand the phenomenon of female sport participation and the impact offiscal and legal realities, perhaps some attention should be given to underlyingprinciples as well as the social reality within which women's sports currentlyoperate.Furthermore, with the exception of attitude, personality, and self-imagestudies, the topic of women in sport has been relatively unexplored. Moreover,most of the knowledge available on female athletes has been obtained from eliteperformersnational and international competitorswho are predominantly ofcollege age. We still do not know who the female participant is, where shecomes from, how she became involved in sport, or the operant value and re-ward structure during her participation. There are some .hypotheses, but littleempirical evidence. Similarly, we do not know the degree to which social-learn-ing variables exert positive influence on the participant and negative influenceon the nonparticipant. Do the same factors that account for participation alsoaffect nonparticipation? Or are there entirely different explanatory variables?In addition to these questions, other information pertaining to women isneeded. For instance, those factors that distinguish the elite athlete from theparticipant who possesses a lower degree of involvement have not been identi-fied. The role of physical education in the female sport socialization processhas not been determined. Thus, there is a nerd to study the effect of various so-cial systems, role models, opportunity sets, and social structure variables in re-lation to initial involvement as well as contityred sport involvement. Moreover,those factors that account for nonparticipation might have greater implicationfor altering teaching behaviors and practices in physical education than dothose variables that influence participation. 30 31 Some theoretical consuletations are also pertinent to this discussion. Al-though a juxtaposition between norms, sanctions, reference group influences,and opportunity set has offered insight into sport involvement, there is need to analyze further the social-learning paradigm itself. Perhaps some of the inde-pendent variables previously considered to act simultaneously could be treatedas intervening variables. It has not been determined whether the socializationrmxlel that accounts for initial involvement in sport is valid for explanations ofcontinued sport involvement. In addition, we need to consider whether this the-oreticalframeworkispowerful enoughto supply explanations for non- participation as well as participation. Such theoretical considerations may offerinsight into significant questions that physical educators frequently ask. For ex-ample. what relationships exist among attitudes, values, and behavior towardsport? Which factors determine these relationships, if, indeed, there are any? Ofcourse, these are only two possibilities.A second issue to be considered deals with the structure and organizationalnature of sport, particularly in the school. However, it should be rememberedthat highly, organized sport (e.g., athletic competition)- has also flourishedunder the auspices of the community, private clubs, and business enterprises.Therefore, the following remarks could be applied to these contexts as well asto the school. Several concepts from organizational theory could be utilized tounderstand the relationship between sport and the school. For example, goals,structure, technology, leadership, and the environment could serve as frames ofreference for analysis. The influence of the public, boards of regents, andbooster clubs could be studied From a structural Functional perspective. Utiliza-tion of such concepts can provide meaningful information and avoid the peren-nial problem of condemning or attributing positive values to athletics.In addition. theories from economics might be useful in analyzing the re-lationship between sport and the school. Moreover, an analysis of the powerstructure and processes of decision-making could be most informative. It isequally appropriate to ask, Who makes what decisions about sport, for whatreasons. under what circumstances, at what time, and with what consequences?as it is to pose the same questions about government and political institutions.Let me emphasize, however, that the purpose of such questions would be to de-termine the degree of institutionalization of sport, the role and function it ful-fills, and its relationship to other institutions. Therefore, the intention of suchinquiry is the search for social significance, not justification.Closely related to the issue of athletics.is the claim that sport participationenhances social mobility. However.- mobility patterns have not been thoroughlyexamined. Indeed, the concept of mobility is quite complex; it has elements oflevel as well as dimension.6 A difficult task. nevertheless an enlightening one,would be to follow the career patterns of athletes after graduation. Informationrelative to educational achievement, occupational status, income attainment,and postgraduation sport participation patterns could be systematically ob-tained. Furthermore, such an endeavor would have implications for account-ability as well as research. Through such data we could learn the ways inwhit h sport participation serves or does not serve as a vehicle for social mobil-ity. At the same time some of our claims and beliefs would be tested.As a final consideration I would like to mention the apparent schism thathas occurred between the social science of sport and physical education. Per-haps some aspects of the issue are related to the discipline versus the professioncontroversy. Also related may be the normative (or value-oriented) versus non -normative (or value -free) approach to research. However, the gap between these31 32 perspectives does not refle(t mutually exclusive functions. Rather, the gap is areflection of communication breakdown, lack of collaboration, and feelings ofinferiority. It 'would appear that one possible bridge across this gap is to in-crease communication and to share interests. Therefore, it is more important atthe present time to answer \"knowledge of what\" than to answer \"knowledgefor what, for whom, or from what.\"In summary, I would like to conclude with the following remarks. Al-though focus has been directed mainly toward research endeavors, it is hopedthat the types of research questions posed would expand knowledge and thatsuch an extension would have professional implications and application. De-spite the variety of topics considered, there have been several recurring themes.Essentially, more knowledge is needed regarding the process of socialization,whether it be concerned with sport involvement, leisure pursuits, or motor de-velopment. Furthermore, the relationship of other social processes to sport in-volvement should be examined; conformity and deviance, social change, strati-fication. and social behavior dynamics would be a few examples. Sociological,psychological, and cultural factors need to be examined concomitantly with bi-ological aspects of physical activity and sport. There is a definite need for agrowth of ideas and theoretical frameS of reference from which empirical re-warc h can Ix' based. Moreover, collaboration should be encouraged among thevarious specialists in the field. Although there are many specific topics that canbe investigated from a social sciences frame of reference, the purpose is to un-derstand the complex constellation of variables that influence physical activity.Only through a grasp of the multidimensionality of these biological, behav-ioral, affective, and cognitive dispositions can we hope to improve our field.REFERENCESI.

BILLINGUniversity of ConnecticutSport in its variety of forms has permeated the culture of man since recordedhistory. :in most societies it has held a prominent position as a social institu-tion. Today sportis exploding with new activities, competitions, and par-ticipants. The drive to be involved is producing new sport forms at an ever in-creasing rate. Not too many years ago school sport teaching and competitioninvolved only the four major sports: football, basketball, baseball, and track.Today most schools offer instruction in three times that number and are beingpressed to include newer activities as supplements to their current offerings.NEED FOR CLASSIFICATIONTo date, the study of sport has been only scantily undertaken. No other so-cialinstitutionhaving such impact on society has received so little scholarly at-tention. hi the past ten years the academic study of sport as a sociophysicalphenomenon has evolved and gained acceptance in some institutions of higherlearning. An important prerequisite to the systematic investigation of any fieldis a classification system for describing and ordering occurrences in that field.This undertaking in the field of sport is obviously complex even when one ca-sually observes the multitude of combinations of activities, implements, envi-ronments, and participants that now make up the variety of sports. Currentlythere is no accepted scheme for classifying sports into meaningful categories.The few techniques for sorting out the diverse components of sport proposed todate include suggestions of labeling sports as individual, dual, or team or haveused a common environmentfield games, aquatics, court gamesor a generaltype of implementball games, racket sports. None of these has been well ac-cepted by a majority of those involved with sports. Kenyon feels that inter-preting physical activity in a programmic sense (e.g., as team versus individualactivities, dance, combatives, racket sports, aquatics) may have operationalvalue for neatly organized programs and curricula but has no value whatsoeverwhen attempting to conceptualize physical activity and, further, that this heu-ristic categorization, based purely on pedagogical grounds, has held backthoughtinphysical educationinterms of accurately denoting physical activity)In fact, many of the commonly used classifications create significant con-fusion as to what constitutes each category. For example, is swimming an indi-vidual or a team sport? One participates as an individual but scores are com-puted on a team basis. Is tennis a ball game or a racket sport? Are all aquaticsportsdiving, water polo, and crew racingreally that similar? Grouping ofsports together under a single label implies great commonality. Obviously thisis not true in the examples above. It would be as meaningful to classify certainsports as uniform sports denoting that uniforms are worn by contestants ori terming certain sports as summer sports since competition is usually engagedin during the summer months. These means of classification fail to identify anyelements that critically differentiate between the nature of sport activities.Kenyon, rioting These shortcomings, suggests the focus of attention beshifted to the participants in sport. He suggests physical activity be divided into 3 4 35 six subdomains chatacteining the \"perceived instrumentality\" that. sport hasfor the participants: social experience, health and fitness, pursuit of vertigo, es- thetic experience. catharsis, and ascetic experience)Though these may prove helpful in understanding the personal drive forinvolvement in sport, they provide no guidance toward classifying sport itself, since different individuals may partake of the same sport for a variety of reasons.Roberts and Sutton-Smith suggest that games be classified by their out- come attributes: (1) games of physical skill, (2) games of strategy, and (3) gamesof chance.' Similarly, Cal lois has classified sports into a subgroup of games (agora) whose central characteristic is competition. Further, \". ..the contest hinges on a single qualityspeed, endurance, vigor, memory, deftness, inge- nuity. etc.operating within defined limits and without any external help. \"\" Both imply the use of intended outcome as a-central theme. However, to date, no encompassing classification system has been proposed that would accom-plish grouping of sports by common intent.A meaningful system of ordering and describing the diversity of sport into generic categories would appear to be a necessary prerequisite to the systematic study of the field. Such a schematic would provide a taxonomy enabling the identificationof common characteristics. Examination of the constituentsmight greatly aid in the quest for enlightened generalizations about sport forms, popularity, strategy, rules, skills, and potential public acceptance. It might also serve its a basis for theoretical statements indigenous to similar sport forms. As a further extension it could serve as a guide to developing new sport forms possessing specific predetermined characteristics. If nothing else,it should provide a schematic to aid in the understanding of the complexity ofsport forms by accomplishing the homogeneous grouping of activities to whichgeneralized concepts of rules, strategy, and scoring are applicable.WHAT IS SPORT?The tern] sport denotes a variety of meanings. For the purposes of the fol-lowing classification system it is necessary to distinguish between those activ-ities constituting sport and activities that will be termed games or recreational activities. The intent is not to demean any group of activities but rather to de- fine explicitly the focus of attention of this classification system. In 1968, JohnLoy proposed the essential distinction between sport and other activities in hisarticle \"The Nature of Sport: A Definitional Effort.\"' Paraphrasing Loy, sportis an institutionalized game occurrence involving physical prowess, strategy, and chance, in conbination. This definition requires that an activity meet several criteria before being termed a sport. First, it must be an institutionalizedgame, i.e., have published rules defining manner of play and declaration ofwinners and possess a tradition. Second, physical prowess must play a domi- nant role in the outcome of the contest:Third, it must allow for the applica-tion of strategy by competitors, and, fourth, there must be some element ofchance. involved in the conduct.The first criterion. that of being an institutionalized game, implies that winners are declared as in all games. This eliminates many recreational activ-ities including hunting, fishing, mountain clinbing, and bird-watching fromthe realm of sport. Although these activities may meet all the other criteria,without the one element of competition, they nust be eliminated. Further, thehitting of golfballs on -a-driving range only qualifies as sport practice until one35 36 actually enters into competition and keeps score in organized play. Likewise thepopular recreational activity of skiing fails to meet the competitive criterionuntil one enters into organized races.The elements of chance and strategy are probably present, to at least a lim-ited degree, in most games; however, the element of physical prowess greatlydelimits the possible activities. Although included in Sports Illustrated and onmany a sports page, the game of bridge fails to guiltily as demanding physicalprowess. Similarly chess, checkers, card games, word games, etc., fail as sports.Physical prowess is not limited to strength and endurance but includes all ofthe highly complex and coordinated lxxtily movements indigenous to a multi-tude of activities. -Chits billiards, croquet, and Ping-Pong qualify as sports al-though not demanding great physical strength.THE TAXONOMYHaving identified the scope of the concept sport, the following taxonomyis proposed as a method of classifying sports into generic types and furtheridentifying their characteristic ingredients. The taxonomy consists of sevenmajor classifications based on primary intent of the sport, followed by five cate-gories depicting critical elements that constitute the nature of the sport form.The seven generic sport types are: (a) Distance sportscompetition is con-ducted with distance covered as the criterion to distinguish between winnersand losers. (2) Speed sportselapsed time is the measure of success in thesesports; all races fall into this typology. (3) Body-control sportswinning is de-termined subjectively on the basis of difficulty and execution of bodily move-ments; all sports scored on \"form\" are of this type. (I) Coal sportsobjects arepropelled at a goal to result in some standard score; the purpose is to accumu-late more goals than the opposition. (5) Target sportsobjects are propelled ata target thus providing for differentiated scoring; the purpose is a high degreeof accuracy resulting in a maximum score. (6) Terminal reciprocating sportsobjects are put into reciprocating play; the purpose is to terminate the ex-change and thus score. (7) Unique sport formssports that have a very special-ized primary intent and thus do not fit well into the previous six categories.The following abbreviated list gives examples of the variety of sport formsindicative of of any sport form, after having determined its generictype by intent, is obtained by applying the following dichotomies of criticalelements.I. Nature of the physical act: either (a) manipulative, (b) ballistic, or (c)unified. Manipulative skills locus primarily on accuracy or form. Ballistic, skillsinvolve primarily speed or power. Unified skills involve approximately equalemphasis on each. The physical au is further classified as: (I) object oriented or(2) lxxly oriented. Thus ice-skating is classified as manipulative-body, discusthrowing as ballistic-object, and tennis as unified-object.2. Nature of opponent interaction: either (a).autonomous or (b) reactive.Autonomous means opponents are free to set their own pace and directioli ofperformance. Reactive requires that an opponent respond to the actions of hisadversary. Bowling and gymnastics are autonomous; basketball and wrestlingare reactive.3. Units of competition: either (a) individual or (b) team. Competitionwithout the assistance or cooperation of any other competitor during the timeof performance is individual, even if scores are summed to determine teamstanding. Team implies at least two performers engaging in the activity to-gether as a unit. Swimming and archery are individual; football and tennisdoubles are team.I. Time component: either (a) continuous or (b) intermittent. Continuousinvolves play in unbroken intervals at least until a score is made. Intermittentimplies several attempts separated in time by rest intervals. Soccer and ice-skating are continuous; shot put and football are intermittent.5. Environment: either (a) constant or (b) varied. A constant environmenthas exacting definitions of play areas, surfaces, or apparatus. A varied environ-ment uses nonprescribed settings, often natural terrain, and thus varies fromOne competition to another. Field hockey and gymnastics occur in constant en-vironments; cross count!), and yachting arc conducted in varied environments.Exemplifying the applicution of the taxonomy, archery would fall in type5target sports and would be further classified as: (I) manipulative-object, (2)autonomous, (3) individual competition, (1) intermittent, and (5) constant envi-ronment. This identifies the major dimensions of the sport form. In notationthis can be summarized: archeryTARG, MO, A, I, I, C. In contrast, volleyball would Ix.: volleyball TREC, UO, R, T, C, C. This notation system allows forthe examination of any group of sports based on one or a combination of com-mon elements. It succinctly identifies similarities and differences among thevarious sport forms and hopefully will lead to future refinement and deeper un-derstanding of the commonality in sport.Figure Irepresents how the basic intent of a sport is diversified by its crit-ical elements. Beginning at the center with one of the basic intents each con-centric ring represents a dichotomy that further defines the nature of the sportform. The position on any ring does not determine the position on other rings;each is independent of the others. The proposed taxonomy thus accounts for672 possible combinations of elements encompassing the variety of sport forms.37 38 Figure I.

Or, beginning with a particu-lar sport form, a printout of all similar sports having one or more like elementscan be secured. The obvious advantage of this technique is to identify the simi-larity in sports. As an example, since water polo and soccer have the same clas-sification (goal, unified-object, reactive, team, continuous, constant environ-ment), teaching of basic strategies and offensive and defensive patterns might begeneralized. In fact new tactics based upon those used in similar sport formsHaight prove advantageous.The taxonomy offers a succinct statement of sport types that might be in-corporated into surveys of physical education and sport programs or used asone means of analyzing curricular offerings. By classifying a local high school'scourse offerings, it was noted that no activities were conducted in either body-33 39 control or target sports, that an approximate equal balance was evident betweenindividual and team sports, and that no offerings were conducted that are prac-ticed in varied environments.Sport popularity is an additional area where the application of the tax-onomy might prove valuable. What combinations of qualities produce the mostpopular sports? A survey of sport popularity among college students revealedradical differences between the classification of the most popular spectatorsports and the most popular participant sports. Why are there no sports withspecific combinations of qualities, i.e., distance sports using team competition?Could we predetermine the characteristics of a new sport form to maximize itsspectator and participant appeal or to enhance the chance of equal competitionby women? Might the class of sports most popular in various countries or cul-tures be related to their governmental structure, their standard of living, ortheir geographic location?SUMMARYAn important prerequisite to the systematic study of any field is a classi-fication System for identifying and ordering occurrences. A taxonomy of sportforms is proposed based on the primary intent of the sport and modifiedthrough five critical dichotomies existing in sport settings. The value of thetaxonomy rests in its ability to provide a scheme enabling generalizations aboutthe subsets of sport activities,REFERENCES1. G. Kenyon, \"A and B.Sutton-Smith, \"Child Training and Game In-volvement,\" in Sport, Culture, and Society, edited by J. Loy and G. Kenyon(New York: Macmillan, 1969).3. R. Caillois, \"The Structure and Classification Games,\" in Sport, Cul-ture, and Society.4. J. Loy, \"The PERSPECTIVEROBERT M. MAUNAUniversity of Texas at AustinAll people the world over participate in physical activities in some form orother. They represent a broad lot, ranging from daily routines and subsistenceactivities to play activities to specific societal rituals to highly competitivesports. Basic to such activities is movementits style, level of skill, intensity,duration, and meaning, which, needless to say, varies with the activity, withage and sex, and with population groups. In this broad context, the basic ques-tion to which this paper addresses itself is simple: How does a physical anthro-pologist view physical activity in the human species?39 40 It is perhaps best at the outset to inquire why one might expect a physicalanthropologist's view to be different from that of other disciplines. Certainly,the public stereotype of a physical anthropologist's activities suggests an indi-vidual seeking answers to questions largely of academic relevance. To mostpeople, physical anthropologists are guardians of the past and keepers of thebones, seeking to reconstruct our phylogeny and that of our primate ancestorsand to classify humans into various racial categories.Physical anthropology, however, is currently broader in its orientation, fo-cusing on the analysis of human biological variability. Physical anthro-pologists attempt to understand the biological development and organization ofhuman populations both of the past and the present and to make a link be-tween the past and the present, since evolution is a continuous process.Variability is the central theme of physical anthropology. It implies, ofcourse, differencesdifferences between individuals, within populations, andbetween populations. Differences can be genotypic, phenotypic, or cultural anddepend largely on the interaction of the organism and its environments. suchdifferences between individuals and populations have accumulated over timeand space, thus providing a broad range of substantial and meaningful vari-ation. Physical anthropologists attempt to organize this variation and to under-stand its origin, adaptive significance, and maintenance in human populations.How, for example, does such variability come about? How does the.apparentvariation aid a population to live and persist in its ecological setting?Central to the understanding of human biological variation is the recog-nition of man as a biocultural organism in constant interplay with his environ-mentsthe natural, the man-made, and the human (social). The biological andcultural evolution of man proceeded in concert, such that biology and culturecannot be separated. Hence, the interaction of biology and culture as co-determinants of biological variation is emphasized. We cannot approach manin a purely biological way; similarly, culture cannot serve as a complete expla-nation for human behavior in the sense that the biological organism is behav-ing. Hence, physical anthropologists focus on the biocultural approach tohuman variation.It is within this perspective of man as a biocultural organism that physicalactivity, broadly conceived, as a part of man's adaptive apparatus must be un-derstood. The physical activity of an individual or a group, however, is de-pendent upon, conditioned by, and adapted to cultural influences. Activities areperformed within a local cultural pattern, which as the consensus of individualbehavior patterns, relationships, and values has coherence, continuity, and dis-tinctive form. In addition, the conditions that maintain specific cultural codesfor physical activities and the means by which they operate in different culturesmust be determined if the role of physical activity as a part of the human adap-tive process is to be understood. Similarly, it is essential to realize that whatevertalents or skills an individual may have, his ability and creativeness will expressthemselves within the limits set by his culture.Problems and methods considered by physical anthropologists have muchin common with those considered by physical educators. Both, for example, de-vote much effort to understanding growth and development, physical per-formance, development and biomechanics of movement patterns, health anddisease, and so on. Differences between physical educators and physical anthro-pologists revolve about questions asked of similar problem areas and the per-spective within which an answer is sought. Physical anthropologists generallyoperate within the perspective of human biological variability and man as a40 41 biocultural organism; physical educators generally operate within the perspec-tive of physical activity as a part of the school curriculum, as an essential ad-junct to healthy living, and, more recently, in terms of sport and society.In light of the preceding, this paper considers physical activity, be it sub-sistence, play, exercise, dance, and/or sport, in terms of four themes: (I) theevolutionary context, (2) the concept of plasticity and human adaptability, (3)motor-skill development as a part of the adaptive process, and (4) a speculativeattempt to link the past and the present through the use of a motor skill.AN EVOLUTIONARY OVERVIEWWithin an evolutionary context, three coordinated changes are generallyconsidered basic to the concept of \"human-ness\": (I) the acquisition of uprightposture and habitual bipedal locomotion, (2) toolmaking, and (3) language.'The changes leading tothe development of these human characteristics appar-ently were coordinated, emphasizing the concurrent progress of man's biologi-cal and cultural evolution. The two can be regarded as two faces of the samecoin.The beginnings of human-ness go back 3-4 million years to theAustralopithecines, small creatures who showed a mosaic of manlike and ape-like characteristics.) They stood erect and walked bipedally and were found inassociation with crude but unmistakable stone tools. A remarkable feature ofthe fossil record at this time is that these early hominids made and used toolslong before their brains were much larger than those of apes, indicating per-haps a synergistic interaction of cultural and biological evolution. One canspeculate thatthere would have been strong selection pressures for neuralmechanisms underlying the efficient manufacture and use of tools. Indeed, se-lection pressures for proficiency in motor skills (e.g., bipedal locomotion, man-ual dexterity, hunting ability) at this early phase of our evolutionary devel-opment must have been quite strong.The next well-documented phase of man's evolutionary history is repre-sented by Horno erectus, who dates back about 1 /2 -I million years ago. As hisname implies, he perfected upright posture and thus walked habitually erect.Homo erectus was likewise an efficient toolmaker and mastered the control offire. His brain was distinctly larger than Australopithecus, but smaller thanthat of modern man. It is further suggested that the human way of hunting,i.e.. hunting as a whole social pattern (planning, technical skill, sharing, coop-eration, and sexual division of labor), had evolved by the time of Homoerectus.3Our species, Horno sapiens, appeared on the evolutionary scene about100,000 years ago, although the earliest fully modern types appeared only some30.000 to 35,000 years ago. Physically, he was very much like us today, perhapsa bit more robust. He had a well-defined culture, had more and well-definedtools, and was the first hominid to take himself outside his place of origin, i.e.,from the Old World land mass into America and Australia ;-His adaptive capac-ities were undoubtedly grealty extended by his cultural' evelopment, and so hewas able to meet environmental challenges, expand his range, and increase hisnumbers.By the time we reach the more elaborate cultures of early and relatively re-cent Homo sapiens, we find a marked variety of cultures with different empha-ses. Ten thousand years ago we had the beginnings of agriculture and domes-tication; 7,000 years ago we had the beginnings of urbanism; and only 200 years41 42 ago we had the industrial Revolution, whose impact we are still feeling todayin the form of our vast scientific-technological establishment. These devel-opments from the beginnings of agriculture to the present are actually quite re-cent on an evolutionary scale that goes back at least 3-4 million years.Man has thus been a hunter and gatherer for a major percentage of his his-tory. Although we have made the transition from an active to a more settledway of life,it is within this evolutionary past that many of our behavior pat-terns are rooted. It is no wonder, therefore, that there is much interest in ethol-ogy, the study of animal behavior including human behavior. Such discussionsas Lorenz's On Aggression, Ardrey's Territorial Imperative, Morris's NakedApe, Tiger's Men in Groups, and Tiger and Fox's Imperial Animal, to mentiona few, are quite common and much in demand. Popular interest in under-standing our past as it might relate to current behavior patterns is perhaps wellsummarized in the title of a recent article in New York magazine: Who KnowsWhat Primitive Instincts Lurk in the Heart of Modern Corporate Man?\"Although we have changed little structurally over the past 30,000 years orso, there have been numerous sociocultural changes and perhaps physiologicaladjustments permitting man to adapt to the stresses imposed by a more settledand sedentary life-style and by the vast, interconnected technological establish-ment we currently live in. Not everyone is adapting successfully, however, asone can surmise from the increased frequency of degenerative diseases. Suchconditions have distinct correlates in stresses within the sociocultural domain.Physical activity is implicated as beneficial in reducing the risk of degenerativedisease. Activity changes toward a more sedentary life-style with our tech-nological advancement are relevant here, considering that for most of our his-tory we were dependent upon subsistence activities that were physically quitevigorous. THE CONCEPT OF PLASTICITYPlasticity is an aspect of the adaptive process and refers to the ability of anindividual to respond to environmental pressures with short-term phenotypicmodifications (i.e., morphological, physiological, biochemical alterations),It isa characteristic, not of a population, but of the individual, as individuals varyconsiderably in their plastic responses. Plasticity can be viewed in two ways,that operating during the period of growth and development (developmentalplasticity) and that operating during adulthood. The former is differentiatedfront the latter in that growth and development are among the most plasticprccesses we can observe in nature. And, short-term modifications in thegrowth and development processes in response to environmental stress can be-come permanent and are thus irreversible after adulthood. The response de-pends, of course, on the intensity, duration, and timing of the stress.How is plasticity related to physical activity? Two of the more frequentlycited biological objectives of physical activity programs are related to this con-cept: (I) exercise stimulates growth of the child and (2) exercise promotes or-ganic fitness. Changes associated with activity programs during childhood andadulthood fall into the category of plastic responses. Children will grow wheth-er they are physically active or not, and adults will persist in light of minimalactivity programs. Exercise-associated changes in body tissues (e.g., size, func-tional efficiency, etc.) during the years of active growth can perhaps become42 43 permanent charm. teristu s of the individuals and perhaps enhance his func-tional efficiency as an adult (not discounting the importance of carry-over ef- fects of activity habits learned during childhood). On the other hand, exercise-associated changes noted in adults are dependent upon continued activity fortheir maintenance. In a sense, the changes are short-term physiological adjust-ments to the exercise stress and are reversible. Thus, changes associated withregular physical activity reflect plastic responses, and the limits of an individu- al's plasticity is set by his genotype. Such phenotypic variation related to activ- ity programs and pursuits in turn contributes significantly to biological vari-ability observed within and between populations.MOTOR-SKILL DEVELOPMENTMotor skills are an important component of an organism's behavioral rep-ertoire and are an important aspect of the adaptive process, i.e., successful adap-tation, to the environment. As such, motor skills per se and their role in theadaptive process are an important source of variability. There are undoubtedlymany motor patterns and skills common to man as a single biological species.There is also variation in the organization of these patterns and skills acrossdifferent cultures.'' The study of motor skills and their development, refinement,use, and relationship to survival or to a successful way of life of an individualand/or his group is thus essential to an understanding of human adaptability.'Implicit in the preceding is the cross-cultural study of motor skills. Thecross-cultural method is basically a research strategy rather than a field of sub-stantive interest in itself.\u00b0 The strategy is largely comparative, with much focuson antecedent-consequent relationships. Evidence for differences between differ-ent cultural groups then becomes a starting point for further inquiry.Motor-skill development, an oft-cited objective of physical education, hasreceived considerable study. The study, however, has concerned itself primarilywith skill development in the Western cultural context and has not entered thecross-cultural laboratory. As with other developmental processes, perhaps more so, motor development is quite plastic. There is variation in the timing of de-velopment, which can be related to rearing practices and demands and tochanges associated with weaning. The significance of early variation in motordevelopment for later skill development and performance, however, has notbeen investigated in Western groups or across different cultures.9 10In addition to a developmental perspective, there are other reasons forstudying motor skills cross-culturally (these reasons, it should be noted, are notmutually exclusive of a developmental approach): (1) to analyze motor skills orperformance attributes that are related to survival or to a successful way of lifeof an individual and his group and (2) to determine the ease or difficulty withwhich primitive, preliterate, or preindustrial groups may accept technologicalchange.' The first reason relates motor skills to human adaptability per se, i.e.,as adjustments to the natural and cultural environments; the second reason isapplied more as it relates motor skills to adaptation to a new way of life.Skill characteristics of so-called primitive, preliterate, or preindustrial pop-ulations vary from culture to culture depending of course on the environment,resources, and specific cultural demands and sanctions. It would be of im-portance to know the nature of these skills, how they are learned, specific meth-ods and techniques, and so on. The motor programming of an Eskimo youthto hunt, for example, involves a series of general and specific activities begin-ning very early in childhood. These include special tendon-lengthening exer-cises and throwing exercises from a seated position designed for hunting from akayak.I243. 44 On the other hand, rapid technological progress, especially in developingareas of the work!, presents potential problems for the technologically simpleprimitive groups. Their skills are not necessarily suited to the demands of atechnological society, and it is increasingly becoming necessary to evaluate thecapacity of individuals in these groups to learn the new skills of a machine-ori-ented technology.?LINKING THE PAST AND THE PRESENT: ROOM FOR SPECULATIONE:Ztrapolating from observations on contemporary populations to earlierhuman populations is indeed difficult and hazardous. Nevertheless, it is neces-sary if we are to develop a better understanding of the way of life of early man:The Pleistocene way of life can only be known by inference and specu-latipi:'.. As we go farther back in time, there is less evidence and the bio-logical and cultural difference becomes progressively greater. Yet it was inthose remote tunes that the human way of life took shape, and it is onlythrough speculation that we may ,gain some insights into what the life ofour ancestors may have been.3In this regard, attention has recently been drawn to the indications thatspatial abilitythe ability to create, maintain, and mentally transform a visualimagehas an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance in Caucasians and thatmales apparently have a proportionately greater facility in this ability,\" This isan important focus for anthropological research, for it might be argued thatany sexual specialization of roles that might have been fostered by recessive sex-linkage of spatial ability at a given point in time would have had direct sur-vival value for human groups and thus become an integral part of our geneticmakeup. This thus becomes an interesting concern for cross-cultural research,when one considers that man has been a hunter for 99 percent of his history.Laughlin particularly stresses the concept that hunting behavior is prior, psy-chologically, to the use and manufacture of tools.\" 'When stated in these terms,the relevance of spatial visualization to the hunting way of life is apparent.In addition to the evolutionary advantage conferred by the development oftools, other aspects of spatial ability are integral to successful hunting. Mere di-rectional orientation and memory for visual landmarks must have been re-quired for man to find his way back to the group, for surely no other animalhas ranged as far a man. in search for food.3 If; in addition, improved judgmentof distance was involved and was correlated with throwing accuracy in males,e.g., the ability to throw stones and spears accurately and forcefully, this couldpresumably have allowed hunters to hit game at somewhat greater distances,thereby making the hunting enterprise less hazardous and resulting perhaps inlonger-lived hunters as well as more meat.Within this framework, we looked at an available set of data relating sever-al measurements of throwing velocity and accuracy to spatial ability in asam-pie of boys 14-16 years of age.\" Regression analyses indicated a relationship be-tween spatial ability and throwing accuracy only in a vertical plane (verticaldeviation accuracy). This unique relationship between spatial ability and verti-cality is especially interesting in that vertical deviations on an upright targetwould trttnslate into skill and judgment with respect to distance were the targetlaid on the ground. Therefore, while emphasizing that only a small percentageof the variance in accuracy (14 percent) is accounted for by the spatial ability 4 45 test, the data suggest tentative evidenc relating spatial skills to throwing, animportant component of the hunting enterprise. Although caution is warrantedin extrapolating from the present data to our hunting heritage, inference andspeculation, as indicated earlier, are essential to gain insights into the life ofearly man.In closing, physical anthropology and physical education have much incommon. It is hoped that this paper contributes a sound perspective to thiscommunality.REFERENCES1. George G. Simpson, \"The Biological Nature of Man,\" Science, April 22,1966. p. 472.2.

The result is that the cultural descriptions we haveare somewhat incomplete, and our ability to move toward a thorough and com-plete description of man is somewhat impeded. On the other hand physical ed-ucators, in their preoccupation with exercise physiology, motor development,and kinesiology, have not fully taken advantage of anthropology. The result isthat physical education lacks a basis for understanding cultural diversity andlacks a basis for understanding the universality of sport.The anthropological analysis of sport has a potential value for both an-thropologists and physical educators. Anthropologists will benefit from an un-derstanding of the extent to which behavioral patterns are consistent in allspheres of culture. Physical educators will benefit through an understanding ofthe cultural complexity and diversity involved in the patterns of behavior we la-bel sport.Some research has been done that illuminates this potential value, but be-fore proceeding to that research Ishall briefly discuss a conceptual tool thatdistinguishes anthropology from other disciplines and briefly discuss the focusof anthropological research.THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN EMIC AND ETIC DESCRIPTIONCultural anthropologists seek to identify the core of behavioral phenomenathat make us human and about which there exists cultural variation. Usuallywe begin with some very obvious biological or social phenomena and seek todescribe the strategy used by cultural groups to deal with those immutable fac-tors. For example, the human phenomena of language has led linguists to de-scribing the essential parameters of human language while also describing thetype and extent of variation existing on those parameters. Linguistic analysis isnot of particular relevance to sport analysis, but because the conceptual prin-ciple upon which linguists base their attempt to describe human language is ofthe utmost relevance, I shall pursue this example a hit further.Over the course of many years, the attempt to construct a description ofhuman sound production led to the identification and solution of a crucialproblem. The problem stems from the fact that each language system hasmeaning according to a different sec of basic sounds. Although all humans canemit the same sounds, each language system makes differential use of a portionof this complete repertoire. A linguist is faced with two tasks: (1) the identi-fication of the basic sounds that have meaning, the phonemes of a language,and (2) the comparison of the phonemic structure of one language to that ofother languages.But the two tasks appear to be mutually exclusive. If you are successful indescribing the phonemic uniqueness of one language system and you attemptto describe a second language from that unique point of view, you will fail tocapture the uniqueness of the second language.46 47 The solution to the problem was the creation of a new language system es-pecially designed to facilitate the comparison of different sound systems. Thenew language incorporates all of the basic sound units of all languages butdoes not do so in their own terms. The use of the \"meta language\" to analyzethe distinctive features of all languages is phonetics, while the study of one lan-guage is phonemics.The principle that distinguishes anthropology from other disciplines hastwo components: (I) each culture must be described in terms of the phenomenaseen by its members to be meaningful, but (2) comparisons between cultures re-quire another set of terms and symbols including all of these independentlymeaningful phenomena. Emic analysis will provide a description of a culturein its own terms; etic analysis will demonstrate the similarities and differencesamong cultures in a way that will lead to the minimum number of conceptsnecessary to describe man.'The task of a cultural anthropologist thus becomes the production of emicdescriptions that when analyzed along with other emit descriptions lead to aparsimonious etic description of the human group.THE FOCUS OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDYIn a fundamental sense cultural anthropologists are concerned with the hu-man process of communication and therefore provide emic descriptions of thestructure and content of communication systems. This entails the careful identi-fication of patterns of behavior, as these patterns are shared by varying numbersof people in varying situations.The minimal interactive unit required for the analysis of any commu-nicative behavior is a dyad, and the task is to describe those behaviors that havemeaning to the participants in the dyad. Meaning is located in those behaviorsthat have an observable impact on the synchrony of interaction. Once a descrip-tive map of meaning can be produced for a pair of people, the task becomes theidentification of meaningful patterns in other dyads, as the original pair ofpeople interact with various others. As the communication system is describedby patterns of meaningful behavior in a variety of situations, those patterns ofbehavior shared by all of the members of a group can be identified, as well asthose patterns shared by fewer numbers of people.2The determination of the content of communication simultaneously de-pends upon time and level of analytic focus. By observing those behaviors thatdisrupt the synchrony of interaction, one can infer the cause of and the solutionfor those disruptions. Thus, over tim,e patterns of synchrony disruption and res-toration can lead to supportable emic descriptions of the essential content ofdyadic communication.I-have argued elsewhere that a Mormon physical education teacher's simplequestion \"Why aren't you dressed to play today?\" dealt simultaneously withseveral levels of concern.3 When this question was asked of Ute Indian students,it caused a change in the usual synchrony of dyadic interaction. At one levelthe question concerned the school rules regarding participation in physical ed-ucation classes. But at a far more fundamental level the question dealt with dis-parate cultural premises concerning relationships between man and man. ForAnglo-Mormons life is conducted in a way that suggests the appropriateness ofone man's control Over another; the Utes behave in ways that suggest the ap-propriateness of almost total independence. The teacher's question was simulta-neously focused on a rather minor school rule and a fundamental difference inthe way life is lived.4 7 48 The event was no different from a hundred other events where the teacherasked lite students questions, except that the pattern of verbal and nonverbalbehavior was asynchronic as long as the topic concerned the right of individu-als to be free to choose to play or the right of the teacher to require the studentsto play. This behavioral asynchrony was inferred to be caused by the cultural-premise nature of the question rather than by the form of the question or itsexplicit content (the school rules). However, the inference is only supportablebecause it is based on observed patterns of dyadic communication over time.Thus, this example suggests the importance of time and analytic focus in deter-ming the content of a communicative sequence.The structure and the content of communication must be studied carefullyas varying numbers of people interact with one another over time. By identi-fying the structure of patterned synchronic and asynchronic behavior the con-tent of communication systems can be determined. When we are able to identifythe patterns of meaningful behavior used by members of a culture; we will havean emic description of the structure and content of that culture.THE POTENTIAL VALUEIN THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF SPORTAs anthropologists seek to describe human universals through the emicand etic analysis of communication, they will be aided by the inclusion ofsport, and their inclusion of sport will be of value to physical educators. An-thropologists cannot describe a single culture completely unless they include allof the jx..ople's behavior in all spheres of life: political, economic, religious, andrecreational. A complete etic description of humanity cannot be produced untilwe have complete emic descriptions.As anthropologists include sport, they will be providing descriptions thatdetail the complexity and diversity of the behaviors we call sport. These de-scriptions should be of value to physical educators because they are concernedabout the universal nature of sport and the educative potential of specific sportsin a situation involving cultural diversity.A few research projects illuminate the potential value of sport analysis foranthropology by demonstrating that the structure and content of behavioralpatterns in sport are essentially the same as those of behavioral patterns in oth-er spheres of cultural life. Research conducted by educational anthropologists atthe University of Florida has demonstrated that racial integration in an urbansouthern city is patterned according to the task that must be accomplished.Black and white residents segregate themselves residentially and socially exceptwhen a common task brings them into contact. Integration occurs when peoplework, receive health care, use public transportation, or attend school. In school,racial polarization occurs except when the students have a common task: tosmoke (a smoking area exists on the school ground), to relieve themselves, or toplay football.The football team reflects the overall community and school pattern of in-tegration: segregation, by choice, except for common tasks. Thus, before and af-ter practice sessions or games the boys remain in their own groups, but forfootball they disregard ethnicity and associate according to \"task and talent.\"'Recently completed research in Appalachia will demonstrate that schoolbasketball provides an opportunity forintricatepatterns of kinship or-ganization and political independence to be woven together to sustain a com-munity's integrity. The forum provided by basketball is in structure and con-tent analogous to other community activities.548 49 A researt h team in Montreal has demonstrated that the manipulation ofprofessional wrestlers' identities is organiLed to represent in structure and con-tent the basis of prejudicial behavior in the involved communities. For exam-ple, they cite an occurrence in the Montreal Forum:Fast to nu the ring was Baron Frit/ Von Erich who was introduced as aNdii from Germany to a largely Jewish audience. Sixnting a swastika onIns aim and wearing high black boots the baron stomped around the ringscreaming ohs( (alines in German [and] raising his arm in Hitterian fashion.Pointing to the skull-capped members of the audience, the baron promisedto send his opponent. bark to Aurhwit/ [so]. Following the baron's dramaticfive-minuteu h performance, his opponent, Rabbi Raphael Halpernran into the arena with prayer book in hand, skull-cap on [his] head andwearing a blue and white costume cosered with stars of David. The crowdrearedI h approsal. Needless to say the forces of good prevailed and theRabbi was vii torious.^These research examples illuminate the potential value of sport analysisfor anthropology by demonstrating that behavior is similarily patterned acrossseveral, if riot all, spheres of cultural life. Although some of these researchprojects were not designed to be culturally comprehensive, they do suggest, inspecific detail, that patterns of behavior associated with sport are the same asbehavioral patterns in other spheres of life.Many physical educators are concerned with the universality of sport; eventhough we are a long way from the etic formulation that will accurately de-scribe the fundamental and unique elements of human play, games, sport, orexercise, we are on our way through a number of research projects that emicallydefine the structure and content of behavior in sport.My own research among Ute Indians and Anglo-Mormons in Utah demon-strates that the form and content of basketball behavior communicates dra-matically different meanings for the two cultural groups. For the Anglo-Mor-mon community basketball is structured and played according to an apparentorientation toward mutuality. Teamwork, individual sacrifice for the good ofthe team, group strategy, and group status are key principles adhered to in bas-ketball. The l'te community, however, stresses individuality in team structure,in play, in skill acquisition, and in status. Basketball has no intrinsic meaningbut has at least several culturally specific meanings, expressed dozens of ways.7In another research project, Kendall Blanchard found that basketball struc-ture and strategy differed between the Navajo and Mormons. This research, likelily own, demonstrates that basketball has unique meaning for each group andthat those meanings stern from differences in cultural background.\"Thomas Carroll has argued a unique perspective on the cultural premisesof work and play in an urban city in the United States. The emic definition hehas observed in operation is that work is anything that contributes to the main-tenance of the proper order of the universe, and that work requires know-how.Work has nothing to do with pay, type of activity, or location of activity; it hasto do with behavior that supports and sustains man's relationship to othermen, to nature, and to the supernatural, etc.If you don't have know-how, you cannot work, but you can help one whohas know-how or you can learn. Thus, he found that children are being implic-itly taught that some activities support the proper order of the universe andthat they must come to know how to do those activities in order to be propercitiLens. Other activities, they are taught, do not concern the proper order and49 50 therefore do not requite know-how and can be defined as nonwork.9 The phys-ical education program, as it is structured around learning proper skills andtechniques as a prerequisite to playing a game, presumably falls into the cate-gory of work. not play..These research efforts describe sports as they are emically significant to.cul-tural groups. Together with other similar descriptions they will lead to an eticdescription of the universality of certain patterns of human behavior, repletewith the complekity and diversity of cultural life. Physical educators can usethese and other works to examine their notions about the universal meaning,value, or significance of sport, and they can now get a feel for the tremendousvariations attributable to cultural differences in the educational potential forany number of sports. This, I should think, is of potential value to the pro-fession of physical education.CONCLUSIONAs anthropologists increasingly provide emit descriptions of the structureand content of communication in sport, we will be closer to our goal of provid-ing a parsimonious etic description of humanity. As physical educators encour-age, sustain, and integrate anthropological studies, their search for an under-standing of the universality of sport will be enhanced. The potential exists, ifwe can establish a common understanding and maintain mutual respect andencouragetnen t.REFERENCES1.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THOUGHTON PHYSICAL EDUCATION BY SELECTEDCONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHERS*CLAY E. COSTNEROuachita Training CenterHodgens, OklahomaIn several of the more popular history textbooks on physical education thegreat educational philosophers of the past are often cited. The great educationalthinkers, such as Plato, Aristotle, Quintilian, Froebel, Milton, Bacon, Mon-taigne, Locke, and others, are often quoted demonstrating the depth and extentof philosophical thought on physical education through recorded history.However, the authors of these same histories in the discussion of physicaleducation in the twentieth century rarely quote ideas from outstanding edu-cational philosophers of this century. This study grew out of the writer's beliefthat a number of educational philosophers of this century, like the philos-ophers of the past, can make contributions to our understanding of physical ed-ucation and its place in education.Some of the representative ideas of ten outstanding educational philos-ophers of this century are presented in this paper. The philosophers were select-ed by a jury of experts who are specialists in the history and philosophy of edu-cation. The men chosen are: William James, Alfred Whitehead, John Dewey,William Bagley, Herman Horne, William Kilpatrick, Boyd Bode, Bertrand Rus-sell, Theodore Brameld, and Robert Hutchins.In a preliminary study it was found that leaders.in the field of physical ed-ucation generally believe that the major objectives of a physical education pro-gram are the same as those of education in general. These leaders generally per-ceived that an ideal program should aid the individual in attaining numerousspecific objectives. In grouping these specific objectives into major areas thewriter found that generally there are six major areas of objectives: mental, phys-ical, emotional, social, moral, and leisure development.In studying the ideas of the educational philosophers previously named,particular attention was given to each philosopher's ideas concerning these ma-jor objectives of physical education. This writer should like to stress that theseare only a few representative statements, selected from a much longer study.*Materials for this paper were drawn from the writer's dissertation of the same title. Thedissertation may be obtained on microfilm from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Michigan.51 52 MENTAL DEVELOPMENTObjectives generally listed under mental development include knowledges,thinking, interpreting, and decision-making.William James writes that an individual's readiness and vitality in the faceof a task is improved by physical fitness:Consider, [or example, the effects of a well-toned motor apparatus, nervousand muscular, on our general personal self-consciousness, the sense of elas-ticity and efficiency that results.,Alfred Whitehead has suggested that we should not forget the nature of thepupils we attempt to teach:vatIlay it down as an educational axiom that in teaching you will come togrief as scxm as you forget that your pupils have bodies. This is exactly themistake of post renaissance Platonic curriculum. But nature can be kept atbay by no pitchfork; so in English eduattion, being expelled from the class-room, she returned with cap and bells in the form of all-conqueringathletic ism.,John Dewey is probably the philosopher who most strongly supports theuse of physical education activities in the education of children. He, like James,emphasizes that the instinctive needs, as well as interests, of the child must beutilized for the best education. When most educators are talking of play as anextracurricular activity, he is advocating that such activities are actuallyessential:... the primacy root of all educative activity is in the instinctive, impulsiveattitudes and activities of the child. ... accordingly, numberless spontane-ous activities of children, plays [sic] games, mimic efforts, even the appar-ently meaningless motions of infantsexhibitions previously ignored astrivial, futile, or even condemned as positively evilare capable of edu--rational use; nay are the foundation-stones of educational method.3He further notes that many schools realize the value of physical activitiesin developing healthy bodies in their students; however, only a few pioneers ineducation clearly understand the extent to which young children learn throughthe use of their bodies and the impossibility of general intelligence withouttheir use.'William Bagley also thinks that play could be a valuable stimulus to learn-ing, and especially for children it makes learning more interesting. AlthoughBagley emphasizes that education should begin with the sensuous and concrete(therefore, play activity is of much importance), it should move toward the ide-al and abstract. There is less need for play as the child's education becomesmore abstract; the proposition of all \"education through play\" is pemicious.5Bagley does, however, note an indirect relationship between physical edu-cation and mental development:Assured and confident physical control as expressed in the erect posture andthe alert movement suggests mental strength and mental alertness just asclearly as the slouchy posture and slow, uncertain movements suggest un-directed or \"flighty mental activity.\"652 53 Herman Horne lxlieves that the efficiency of the brain's functioning de-pends upon the state of the brain and the state of the body, and brain energycorresponds with physical energy. The memory, as well as apperception, isaided by good health and exercise, and the weak body finds it difficult to main-tain attention.?I le also argues against the contention that games discourage scholarship;instead, \"..athletics develop desirable qualities such as quickness, alertness,self-knowledge, and the ability to think in a crisis.\"6William Kilpatrick, like Dewey, is an advocate of education through activ-ity. After making a study of the summer vacation activities of school children,he suggests that these play activities should actually be considered the mainpart of the school curriculum. Children learn what they live whether at home,school, or playground and the most important thing is the quality of the1 iv ing.9Boyd Bode, after discussing various views on mind and body relationships,concludes that \". ..whatever view we may take regarding the nature of themind, it is an undoubted fact that our mental life is conditioned by the body.PnoTheodore Brameld writes of physical education as one of the spokes in thecurriculum wheel. lie explains that games require reflection, imagination, andenergy and that learning occurs not so much deliberately as by the fact that thehuman organism functions as a unified whole and every experience affects thepersonality.\"Generally, Robert Hutchins is critical of schools that give credit for phys-ical education activities, especially at the college or university level. The uto-pian university should be a center of independent thought and anything that isnot thought should have no place.'2 However, in a letter to this writer he doesadmit that intellectual development at certain ages \".. . perhaps must be per-formed in the context of physical development.\"\"PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENTObjectives generally listed under physical development include coordi-nation, fitness, health, organic vigor, growth, posture, and strength.William James eloquently describes how a future humanity without mus-cular development would be a horror to perceive. He believes that a tech-nological society might cause some individuals to see little use for muscular de-velopment. If this became common and we should lose our hardihood, weshould also lose our courage.\"Dewey notes that the first rule, if we reverence childhood, is to make sureof a healtIfy, bodily development. He further suggests that strength and. fitnessshould be primary concerns in progressive schools. The students should receiveregular physical examinations and those lacking in fitness should be given ex-tra time in the gymnasium or on the playground. He goes so far as to approveof the practice in one school where \"the pupil who is physically unfit to sit at,a desk and study goes to school, and spends all his time outdoors with a teacherto help him get strong. \"\"Bagley has written that next in importance to knowledge about bacteriaand their relation to health is \". .. the fact that a healthyvigorous body maysuccessfully resist invasion by these disease breeding parasites.\"16 He also be-lieves that resistance to fatigue is greatest when one enjoys health and physicalfitness.5.3 54 Horne stresses that the first requirement for an ideally educated person is physical fitness. lie supports competitive athletic contests and lists the benefits as strength, force, power, agility, dexterity, ease, grace, and swiftness.'7 Physicaleducation should not be for males only, as the ladies also receive strength, poise, beauty, and health.18The development of vitality is often the subject of Bertrand Russell in his praise of outdoor activity. He writes, in part, that \"vitality is rather a phys- iological than a mental characteristic\" and \"where it exists, there is pleasure in feeling alive, quite apat from any specific pleasant circumstance. It heightens pleasure and diminishes pains.\" A superabundance of energy is needed to off- set the many handicaps and restraints in civilized life. He describes one man who had this type of energy; a man the age of 70 who would work tirelessly all day and cycle to and from work for a total of 32 miles.\"Hutchins cites a study made by Kraus and Hirsh land in which Americanchildren are shown to be far inferior to European children on a muscular fit- ness test. He concludes that this study indicates a need for attention to health in a technological age.2' However, more typical of Hutchins is the following state- ment: \"Whatever may be the responsibilities of a college, a university is not a custodial establishment, or a church, or a body building institute.\"22 EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENTObjectives generally listed under emotional development include mentalhealth, self-control, perseverance, initiative, self-confidence, and courage.James states that \"our moods and resolutions are more determined by thecondition of our circulation than by our logical grounds.\"23... I cannot believe that our muscular vigor will ever be a superfluity. Evenif the day ever dawns in which it will not be needed for fighting the oldheavy battles against Nature, it will still always be needed to furnish thebac kground of sanity, serenity, and cheerfulness to life, to give moral elas-ticity to our dispositions, to round off the wiry edge of our fretfulness, andmake is good-humored and easy of approach.2'The emotions, Dewey believes, may be affected in two main ways by phys-ical activity or rather the lack of it. First, the child is naturally active; therefore,to suppress his physical activity adversely affects his mental health. He assertsthat \"suppression is not annihilation\" and \". ..a suppressed activity is the cause of all kinds of intellectual and moral pathology.\"25 Second, the will hebelieves to be a bodily phenomenon; therefore, its development requires bodilyactivity.Bagley describes how, as a result of fear or anger, physiological changes oc-cur in the body that prepare it for activity. Strong emotions can be dissipatedby action and play is one means of displacement activity.26 He also notes that the etnotional development of the hypersensitive student could be aidedthrough the hardening experiences of vigorous sports.27Horne, simikir to James, emphasizes the physical basis of emotional devel-opment and points out that modertahysiological psychology has a workinghypothesis that brain states condition mental states. This \". .. demands that the sound body house the sound etnotion.\"28 Rigid discipline with restrictionson movement, the pattern in some schools, is unhealthy. The obstructed will5 1 55 needs an outlet; play is indispensable for this. Horne agrees with Bagley in the,idea that the timid child could be aided by play. Finally, he lists a number ofqualities of emotional control that are the results of competitive athletics:Third, they develop moral qualities of self-control, self-reliance, force, en-durance, courage, the sense of the value of training, the discipline of defeat,if not humility in victory, the sense of the value of concerted action, nerve,practicality, and will power.29Kilpatrick notes how physical health is basic to mental health in insistingthat an unhealthy body upsets individual life. Inner urges must be satisfied andthe most insistent inner urge is the need for interesting and exciting activity.Maladjusted children need play and, characteristically, mature children love toplay:The more fortunate boy is on the whole sweeter tempered, though he canget angry; but in both moods he is more reasonable. Play means much tohimespecially with other boys, but also with girls.\"The life and writing of Bertrand Russell continually centered on fightingagainst bigotry, narrowness, intolerance, and suppression of man's natural ani-mal instincts. He emphasizes that in the suppression of instinctual urges thereis the greatest threat to a desirable emotional development. Man is naturally ag-gressive and destructive but could be saved from destroying himself if his in-stinctual drives were channeled into constructive outlets. Russell writes that ifevery working man were \". .. enabled to engage in some dangerous and ex-citing pursuit involving quick personal initiative, the popular love of warwould become confined to women and invalids.\"' Russell prefers such activ-ities as mountain climbing or sailing rather than the popular sports as an out-let for the aggressive nature of man.SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTObjectives generally listed under social development include sociability, co-operation, courtesy, leadership, fellowship, loyalty, and poise.James has noted that muscular vigor resulting from games furnishes thebackground to make us cheerful, good-humored, and easy to approach. Simi-larly, poise and confidence have the same source:Weakness is too apt to be what the doctors call irritable weakness. And thatblessed internal peace and confidence, that acquiscentia in seipse, as Spinozaused to call it, that wells up from every part of the body of a muscularlywell-trained human being, and soaks the indwelling soul of him with satis-faction, is quite apart from every consideration of its mechanical utility, anelement of spiritual hygiene of supreme significance.32Whitehead, in dialogue, talks about the friction and division in Americanmiddle classes. He claims that such divisions do not exist in England partlydue to the fact that the aristocratic and working classes get acquainted throughtheir sports. He also notes that sports help to foster understanding in theschools and that he had received leadership training himself as a captain of afootball team.\"55 56 Dewey recognizes the link lx..tween play and socialization; however, he tc,,sieves that unless children arc guided in playing well, they simply imitate theprejudices of their parents. He also describes how a sport such as baseball canbe useful in developing social control of a group. Such control is possible with-out the violation of individual freedom.\"Bagley argues that initiative is a quality that could best be developed inathletic and literary clubs. He also notes the value of athletics in socialization.In addition, he states that social amenities could be taught at school dances inthat \"the delight in rhythm is one of the fundamental traits of youth, and thedance is a world-old educative force that modern education can hardly afford tocast aside.\"\"Horne has suggested that the personality is afferted by a healthy body.Children working and playing together in a supervised setting could developconfidence and learn unselfishness. Similarly, even in the sport he considersmost objectionable, there are valuable social outcomes:Football, the most objectionable of athletic sports, is the prince of games inmoral quality, Its team, which is an organized unit, is the finest training inassociated effort.\"Kilpatrick states that the social value of games is evident in that childrenby their very nature are eager for companionship, and games provide the meansfor association with others. In addition, he believes ':hat desirable cooperativebehavior results from the playground \"... because every movement, every act isconditioned by the presence and behavior of others.\" 37 The social life and free-dom of women also improves as a result of camps and athletics.Russell is the miry philosopher who really questions the efficacy of teach-ing cooperation through play or sports' He writes that athletic games are sup-posed to teach cooperation, when actually they only teach it in the competitiveformthe form used in war. Instead of having a victim, as in school games, heprefers that the enemy should be nature. However, he stresses that one need notpedantically follow his advice, as competition is natural to man and one couldscarcely find a more innocent outlet than games.\"Brame Id suggests that the playground provides a laboratory kir social in-novation in which convergence and cooperation could be implemented in prac-tice.. 1.-k further notes that one of the deficits of education in Puerto Rico is dueto a lack of sufficient cooperative activities, such as games and dances. Inter-cultural socialization should be an aim of education; in the following statementhe asserts the importance of recreation and sports in attaining this goal:One of the widest channels through which intercultural relations progressin schools is in games and sports. In the northern section of America, it isalready commonplace for youngsters of all races, religions, and nationalitiesto play together on both intramural and interscholastic teams, and to buildmutual respect for prowess, courage, and good sportsmanship.\"In a brief notation, I-Iutchins indicates that sports have some part in thesocialization of immigrants along with the law, media, and advertising.\" 5 6 57 MORAL DEVELOPMENTObjectives generally listed under moral development include honesty, citi-zenship, sportsmanship, respect for others, and justice.James states that even the moral character of a nation can be improvedthrough sports, as shown by the British Empire in its worship of the athleticoutdoor life and sport. More specifically he writes that games \"... are the chiefmeans of training in fairness and magnanimity. \"\"Dewey believes that play and art have a distinct advantage in moral devel-opment over conventional methods. They are not bound by a strict, un-changing moral code and thus are more easily adapted as vehicles for a modernmorality. He further expands-on-this idea:Moreover, while perhaps they may not be absolutely necessary for survival,many other activities, such as games, contests, dances, festivals, celebrations,songs, and recitals of brave deeds, provide emotional stimulation and satis-faction; they strengthen social feelings and social ties. All these activitiesand agencies, although not primarily intended to promote morality, are yetimportant as making for the formation and development of intelligence,character, and right relations between men. They may be called cosmic andsocial roots of morals.42Bagley outlines how play instincts of fighting, hunting, and the like couldbe translated into play ideals where the impulse for vigorous exercise counter-acts the unhealthful tendencies of civilized life. Similarly, he suggests that rival-ry, like play, could be modified in order to develop sportsmanship ideals.:lie must be led to feel that cheating, deception, \"hitting below the belt,\"tale-bearing, and \"knocking\" arc dishonorable and forbidden means of ri-valry. 1-k must learn to \"play the game\" fairly and squarely and to preferhonorable victory; and he must generalize these standards of conduct beyondthe athletic situation, and apply them to every situation in which he com-petes with his fellows.43Horne believes that athletics advances morals by making the students ap-preciate strength, courage, virility, skill, and loyalty to an institution. Cleansportsmanship is also encouraged.On the other hand, a lack of physical fitness has quite different effects onmoral development:'Filene is a predisposing cause Of badness in so common and prosaic a fact asunlit physical condition.Our social responses may be maladusted becausewe have aclenoiils, inflamed tonsils, bad teeth, poor hearing, defective. eye-sight, indigestion, autointoxication, or maybe, just because we are all tiredout. A flabby muscle is poor support for a strong will.\"Kilpatrick asserts that in the old Alexandrian system of education, wherethe emphasis was completely on books, memory, and tests, there was little con-cern for moral or character development:It would be hard to conceive a situation, except solitary confinement, worseadapted to character building. Fortunately \"extra-curricular\" activities werecontrived which did encourage character building.... 4557 58 He also implies at another point that it is impossible to coach a gamewithout teaching morals in that the one cannot be separated from the other.In order to develop into a moral person, Russell believes the child needsconstructive outlets for his instinctive needs. Skill development, he points out,allows for direction of the instincts: \"The great cultivator of instinct is skill:skill which provides certain kinds of satisfaction but not others. Give him thewrong kinds, or none at all, and he will be wicked.\"46Hutchins admits that extracurricular activities may very well confer moralbenefits but that this still does not justify their inclusion in the college curricu-lum. He argues that the YMCA, Scouts, country clubs, and other like or-ganizations can do this job more effectively. He further states:The moral virtues are habits. The environment of education should be fa-vorable to them. But only a diffused sentimentality will result from the at-tempt to make instruction in the moral virtues the object of education. And,in addition, resources that might go into intellectual training will be lav-ished on athletics, sociallife, and student guidance, a king of coddling,nursing, and pampering of students that is quite unknown anywhere else inthe wor k1.41Hutchins does think that the college has a place in moral development andthat is to train the mind in intelligent choices.\"LEISURE DEVELOPMENTObjectives generally listed under leisure devekipment include enjoyment ofrecreation, attitudes and habits toward play, relaxation, and appreciation ofbeauty, nature, skill, and sports.James writes long passages praising the beauty of nature and how one isrevitalized through contact with the outdoors. A mountain climber himself, hesuggests some of the benefits of such activity in the following passage:III the mountains, in youth, on some intoxicating autumn morning, afterinvigorating slumber, we feel strong enough to jump over the moon, and,casting about us for a barrier, a rock, a tree, or any object on which to mea-sure our bodily prowess, we perform with perfect spontaneity feats which atanother time might demand an almost impossible exertion of muscle and ofwill.\"Workmen need relaxation and refreshment, Whitehead observes, and hesuggests that \"the normal recreation should be a change of activity satisfyingthe cravings of instincts. Games afford such activity.\"5\u00b0Dewey in describing that he calls the older type of schools notes that juve-nile delinquency is the natural result from the friction engendered by the sup-pression of activity. However, in describing schools of the future he writes ofhow the children's energies could be channeled by an effective leisure-time ac-tivity program:There are rooms for the boys to hold meetings and to play games, and awell-equipped gymnasium. The teachers of the school take turns super-vising these evening gatherings.... Giving the boys a place for wholesomeactivities has done much to break up the habit of street loafing and thegangs which were so common in the district.5I53 59 Bagley notes that sui.xtvised sports during recess periods at school preventdegenerating influences from growing. An either/or situation exists in the useof leisure time in that \". ..recreation and relaxation must be on the highestpossible plane if the degenerating effects of dissipation and prodigality are tobe counteracted.\"52Horne has stated that people will play or be amused at something. Moreimportant to him is in what manner. He suggests religious, educative, and his-torical movies should be provided, as well as supervised indoor and outdoorsports. He warns that we should not forget \"... the educational agency of ath-letics in suppressing criminal physiological inclination.\"\"Home also emphasizes the importance of experience in a natural outdoorenvironment:Associate with nature.Thisis a true principle of human development, be-cause the physical environment so influences man.... We have not vet real-ized in the west the Oriental benefits of living and teaching in the open, es-pecially as an aid to the quieter mental virtues of contemplation,meditation, and reflection; our religious worship has particularly sufferedthereby, becoming both narrow and artificial.54Kilpatrick also believes that recreational activities on the playground coulddeter delinquent behavior:There is excellent reason for believing that much youthful crime is but theunfortunate and misdirected working of these psychological principles.55Such crime he believes is the result of society's failure; he suggests that va-cation activities must point the way for a solution.Russell writes of the profound satisfactions that one can receive throughcontact with nature:1 have seen a boy two years old, who had been kept in London, taken outfor the first time to walk in green country. The season was winter, and ev-erything was wet and muddy. To the adult eye there was nothing to causedelight, but in the boy there sprang up a strange ecstasy: he kneeled in thewet grass, and gave utterance to half-articulate cries of delight. The joy hewas experiencing was primitive. simple and massive. The organic need thatwas being satisfied is so profound that those in-whom it is starved are sel-dom completely sane.56Russell in 1935 writes that the modern industrial state would do well tohave a four-hour work day. The additional leisure time should be used in activepursuits rather than in watching a game or movies. He believes that an activitysuch as folk dancing is a much better use of leisure.\"REFERENCES1.

REACTION TO \"CONTRIBUTIONS EDUCATION BY SELECTEDCONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHERS\": DUALISM PERPETUATEDBRIAN W. FAHEYUniversity of New MexicoTo begin with, I would like to address my remarks to some suggestions forstructural change in Dr. Costner's paper. First, I think he could possibly havepresented the comments of only five of the educational philosophers and thengone into more detail presenting their position on the major physical educationobjectives. Second, possibly another way of approaching this type of paperwould be to focus one's efforts upon the uniqueness of each author's position 61. 62 relative to the objet tives lor the purpose of comparisoncontrast with the otherphilosophers. Third, I feelit might be helpful if after each presentation of anobjective, a discussion of the potential implications of the philosophers' com-ments would be included. Finally, I would suggest that some sort of an overallsummary might be in order. In other words, what does all this mean for thoseof us concerned with physical activity as well as with philosophy?I would like to present a discussion o[ some of the possible implicationsfrom the \"dental Develop-tent\" and \"Physical Development\" sections of Dr.Costner's paper. With all due respect, for the purposes of this presentation Iwould like to retitle those .sections \"Dualism Perpetuated.\" Even a cursory ex-amination of the comments made by nearly all the educational philosophersleads me to believe that the mind-body unity is only a philosophic idea, not afundamental actuality of life.What I am attempting to do is to discuss something that is not talk, some-thing that is only represented by words and symbols. I am referring to the con-crete sensual organism called the human body as \"it\" is experienced as a livingorganismic whole. I am suggesting that for a moment we focus on what is hap-pening as opposed to the various ways in which what is happening is describedby means of words and symbols. Can we, for once, not confuse our facility fordescription with what is ac tually going on, or that which needs to be described?In another way, what I would like to examine is the world, or in this case theperson, as labeled and classified, compared with the world or person in reality.would like tosuggestthat mind-body dualism is a \"myth of polarity.\"From my perspective, polar refers to something that has ends, parts, or ex-tremities that are related and joined to form a single whole. Polar opposites aretherefore inseparable opposites, similar to the two sides of a coin. From this ob-servation we can look at the lift-world (the world as personally experienced)and see a fundamental ambiguity that might be symbolized by the concept ofthe oneness of opposites.\" That is, the supposedly explicit polar opposition ofthe mind and the body conceals an implicit unity of the integrated self-body, orperson. So itis then that we have a polar and mutually sustaining relationshipbetween two entities considered to he opposed or basically opposite. In reality,as experienced they are the yin and yang of mind-body in perpetual interplay.Just because our language is inadequate in depicting the unity of body andmind does not deny an integrated existence in reality. Because we think interms, words, or symbols we seem necessarily to divide in our thought what isundivided in nature. As L.L. Whyte suggests:Inbiological development dualism or conflict k always superimposed on aprint unto,. Hie existence Of organism capable of survival implies inte-guitionind tinilyis therefore always prior to inner conflict. Conflict mayarise as the result of an inappropriate adaption. am! it may prove fatal or itrnay- be overcome. But the recovery of organic health never involves the syn-thesis of fundamentally opposed principles, since these cannot co-exist in anorganism. It only seems to do so because the actual condition of the or-ganism hasbeen inisintriprtedin using a dualistic language. The histori-cal puxess does not involve the synthesis of pre - existing logical opposites,though it may appear to in the confused language of immature dialecticaltheories.'I really think itis about time we made a concerted effort to deny the per-petuation and reinforcement of the dualism \"my body,\" which is of coursegrammatically correct hut, in my opinion, psychologically disastrous [or us ashuman beings seeking some semblance of unity.62 63 I would like to support the position that suggests the human body has itsown intrinsic organic intelligence, which is dichotomized, denied, and finallydestroyed by us through avoidance (inactivity), denial (mind-tripping), frag-mentation (mind-body split), and of course disregard (improper health care).This inside-out and outside-in confusion will remain if we continue to support(don't attempt to deny) a split between body and mind.How can we reverse this orientation and initiate a process directed towardpersonal integration? I would like to propose that initially this might involvean acceptance and specialized appreciation of the basic feelings of our bodyalong with the positing of spontaneous involvement in body movement as afoundation for existence. By truly letting go, it is possible for us to reverse thenormal orientation of ego control and begin feeling the excitation and joy ofour own organism.A fluid, living, spontaneous body, with feelings flowing, will have a ten-denty to reinforce the unified, integrated, spontaneous experience of body-as-self, according to its own principles and not according to the principles of anobjective observer, the ego, which exists as something apart from (a spectatorof) the movements of the body. No longer can the exercise and experience ofspontaneous feeling be subordinated to the value priorities of the empirical egothe implication being that the more rhythmic the motoric functions of ourbody, the greater the capacity for pleasurable integrated movement experiences.In most instances, the level of the experience of body-mind integration issuch that the bask integrity and organic intelligence (wisdom) of the body isdenied by being so strongly under ego control.What I would really like to see happen is that we as human beings attemptto incorporate and subsequently actualize a new bodily attitude in whichawareness and acceptance of bodily feelings might propel us on the way to amore joyous identity of body-self. In essence, I am suggesting a new moralitywith a different set of values based upon the wisdom and personalized integrityof the body rather than upon the directives of a detached ego. A working prin-ciple of this new morality would be that \"you are your body.\" Period!If my wish were ever to come true, in the future we would encounter move-ment situations in which any conscious volitional effort would become subordi-nate to an opening up, a letting go, a giving oneself up to the immediacy ofthe moment and the wisdom of the body. I think, possibly, that a certain kindof body-mind unification could result in the very process of being moved fromwithin, of the person doing something which is not fragmented, not con-tradictory, but very worthwhile precisely because one's own integrity is beingconfirmed.All of this suggests to me that the \"importance principle,\" which arbi-trarily places ego before body (rational before sensual), must be overthrown andpossibly reversed. Furthermore, it implies that acceptance of basic bodily feel-ings is the starting point for the more significant step of expressing those feel-ings. From my perspective, as human beings we must all be in touch with andbe able to accept the constant interplay of at least two vital human energies,one active and irrational, one passive and rationalboth mutually com-plementary in their continuous interaction.I am inviting you to be an active participant in a new-world celebration inwhich you reclaim and live the body that is uniquely yours and not the body ofthe social world. Do not base your bodily identity on a socially imposed role,for that role may eventually abandon you under the stressfulness of real-life sit-uations. Rather,I encourage you to incorporate, express, and actualize that63 64 identity you are, which can be rediscovered by letting go and experiencing yourbodily feelings in an honest and accepting fashion.For too long now we have allowed ourselves only minimal awareness ofthe expression, attitude, and the overall state of our bodies. Tension, rigidities,and anxieties that are not felt or that are concealed by processes of intel-lectualization constitute direct denials of the truth of the integrated body-self.By continuously disregarding those bodily feelings authentically your own, youreinforce and often compound a limited sense of self-awareness, thereby lim-iting your ability to experience yourself as an integrated whole.Unfortunately, many of you are not aware of your own lack of alivenessbecause you have never felt alive before! You continue to observe your body; itis riot you and you are riot it. You can still perceive very well, the movements,gestures, and posture of your body, but you really do not feel that you areactively your body! Your tense, tight, contracted body indicates a fear of lettinggo, a fear of experiencing yourself as an integrated, spontaneous, pleasure-seek-ing organism. As Alexander Lowen suggests:As long as the body remains an object to the ego, it may fulfill the ego'spride but it will never provide the joy and satisfaction that the \"alive\" bodyoffers.Che alive body is characterized by a life of its own. It has a mobilityindependent of ego control which is manifested by the spontaneity of itsgestures and the vivacity of its expression. It hums, it vibrates, it glows. It ischarged with feeling.2I an inviting you to return to your body with the hope of creating a newway of seeing and moving through the world, riot as an affectless physiologicalsystem, but rather as an integrated life-force of energy, flowing, pulsating, andfeeling.I an inviting those educational philosophers who, in my opinion, only paylip-service to the idea of integration, to take a chance on trusting an intuitiveunderstanding of the reciprocal interaction of body and mind in joyous unity.I invite you all to open up and discover that which is already therea lev-el 'of pleasurable excitement or feeling-tone in which the body-self seems todance, in which you experience firsthand, for yourself, how good it feels to co-operate with the laws of nature flowing within yourself.REFERENCES 1.Whyte, in Alan W. Watts,The Two [lands Collier Books, Body(New York: Macmillan,Collier p. 209. 61 65REACTION THOUGHTON PHYSICAL EDUCATION BY SELECTEDCONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHERS\"WILLIAM HARPERKansas State Teachers College of EmporiaPlease forgive me for not restricting my remarks to Mr. Costner's paper. I shallinstead make somewhat More general remarks. In such a way you will have thefreedom to hold up Mr. Costner's paper against tny comments and judge foryourselves what its merit may or may not be.A short time ago I was watching a television program on which a youngcomedian was warmly recounting for his national viewing audience his ownschool days. As you might expect, he eventually got around to physical edu-cation. Ile informed us that his physical education instructorwhose name, Ithink, was Mr. Bigbodydid riot speak English. He spoke gym.'['here is no need to go into all the peculiar idiosyncracies of this languageall of us know so intimately well. I will only remind you that it is largelymonosyllabic and never includes a complete sentence. Some of the popu-lar fight.\"But our comedian friend is out of touch with things. lie doesn't know thatwe have become bilingual. Not only can we speak gym as the conditions andcin tunstances dictate, but we can also speak learned. Our comedian would bestartled to know that in the short space of thirty years (about one generation)we have put together a remarkable array of trappings that give all the appear-ances of a solid and respectable area of study. Let me mention just a few ofthese trappings to give I ou an idea of how respectable we have become. Theyinclucie dissertations, journals, books, associations, anti conventions.On DissertationsWe have a regular production of theses and dissertationsall duly notingthat they are only \"in partial fulfillment of the requirements,\" In them we usea style of writing designed to be so abstract that the words used refer in fact tonothing that is, in reality. It is a form of communication that does not commu-nicate. It is, of course, polysyllabic and usually includes complete sentences, butitis both monomorphic and tnonotonic. Its overall purpose is to give the effectthat something significant has transpired, but it makes every effort to hide whatthat significance might be. What is more, somehow it even writes itself, scarcelyrequiring any effort of original composition. And being largely patched togeth-er from other works, its distinctive mark is that it really never smoothly or log-ically progresses toward a genuine conclusion.On JournalsWe also have a variety of journals in which we publish our shorter ver-sions of learned. We do not have very many such journals, but, until recently,enough to allow most of us to publish most anything we wish to publish in 6j 66 spite of its inherent quality, geeral importance, immediate need, or long-rangeusefulness.Recently, however, we have hit the high-water mark of re- spectability. We have to wait in line to publish, sometimes one year, oftentimestwo years or more. So, by the dictates of our logic, more journals are soon ex-pected to make their appearance, picking up the surplus of articles and researchfindings apparently in such desperate need of being given to the world.On BooksSometimes itis easier and quicker to publish a book than to wait for ac-ceptance of an article. What with the relatively recent enforcement ofthe pub-lish-or-perish mandate in our field, as the good academicians we are trying to he, we have dutifully accepted the pressure, and we publish whether or not we have anything sensible to say. If we are not ready to fill up a book ourselves,we can always dash off one of those anthologies, thereby. satisfying the institu-tion, occasionally satisfying ourselves, but rarely satisfying the reader or the rig-orous demands of patient scholarship. And, of course, others of us can keepbusy reviewing the great mass of literature, in some cases even abstracting arti-cles or books in order to make another book.Our book trappings have finally approached the point where we each can have an impressive (and expensive) professional library. In fact, do you realize that we have written or are writing so many books that we now boast of a bookclub? Just before Ileft home for this convention I received in the mail the re-markable invitation to join the Physical Education Book Society. If I accept a membership reservation, I will he kept \"informed of current significant booksof interest\" and have the right to purchase monthly the selections of the societyat specially reduced prices. As my bonus, I get the society's first selection, thefifth edition of The Physical Education Handbook by Seaton et al. for $.99 (regular price is $5.95).On AssociationsIt is not enough of course for a field of study to have a hodgepodge of dis-connected scholars scholaring. The individual efforts are indeed necessary, butit is the collection of us that makes for coordinated and systematic progress, or so it is said. I would not bet my life on it, but I might wager a small sum thatwe have swollen to such a degree that we may have the largest number of dif-ferent associations within our walls of any of the groups speaking learned. Andat times it seems that the only things these varied associations of ours have incommon are the challenges of remembering their distinctive initials in theproper order and the personal budget juggling necessary in trying to afford topay the dues.On ConventionsVhere there are associations, there are conventions. And we most certainlydo have our share of conventions (not to mention symposia and conferences).Originally,I suppose, these meetings were called in order to bring togetherpeople of common interests, but of diverse minds, to solve some problems ofgeneral concern. To( lay, however, we have the meetings regularly anywaywhether we have problems or not. In fact, many of our problems are actually created for us by our having the convention in the first place. Consequently, it60. 67 is no surprise that now we all converge for no specific reason and seem to bringwith us a common mind, but diverse interests.Now I suspect that our comedian friend, if treated to such developments inour transition from speaking gym to speaking learned, might just roar withlaughter. And I must admit, even as an insider, I am certainly bewilderedandeven a little amusedby the developments during the last generation. BertrandRussell remarked somewhere, in speaking about the bulk of his philosopherchums, that they were \"clever sillies.\" I am beginning to come to the conclu- sion that we are just plain silly, not even bothering to be clever about it.Our silliness has taken the form of having a bent of mind that is largelyimitative and derivative, not creative and originating. We have expended mostof our individual and collective energy on these learned trappingsthe con-ventional and ornamental dressing. All the while we have let others, usually nomore capable than ourselves, do the hard and steady thinking necessary to hav-ing anything, such as a body of knowledge, to clothe at all. The so very im-portant work of substance is clone for us, not by us.It is, therefore, no wonder that these, trappings, and others like them, havetrapped us. Instead of being merely the means we have for making a sensiblecontribution to the preserving and perpetuating of civilization, they have be-come ends in themselves. The forces of the clay persuade us to preserve and per-petuate the trappings, convinced as we are that they are symbols of professionalhealthiness. And it looks as though we will go to most any lengths to protectthem.But it was Blake who reminded us that \"an error must be taken to its ex-treme before it can he combated.\" Before what is supposed to be our lifebloodbecomes our hemlock, we really ought to think through our trappings and seeif some combat isn't in order. Hopefully, we will discover that our preoccu-pation with the trappings is but a stage in our development. We will then befar beyond speaking either gym or learned. We shall be speaking truth. THE BIOLOGY OF AGINGLEONARD HAYFLICKStanford University'The following surronary of Dr. Hayflick's presentation orginally appeared inthe Newsletter, February 1975. ... Dr. Hayflick is the discoverer of cell strain WI-38, which has been usedto identify almost all of the 100 human cold viruses now known. Also, this cellstrainis presently used, world wide, to produce vaccines for polio, rabies,smallpox, measles, and other virus diseases.As a result of his work with this cell strain, he soon began to study howhuman cells age. ... Apparently, the commonimpression that modern med-icine has lengthened the human life span is not supported by either vital statis-tics or biological evidence. Accomplishments in medicine and public healthhave merely extended the average life expectancy by allowing more people toreach the upper limit, which for the general run of mankind still seems to beapproximately the biblical fourscore years. Aging and a limited life span appar-6 7. 68 ently are characteristic of all animals that stop growing after reaching a fixed,mature size. In the case of mart, after the age of 30 there is a steady, inexorableincrease in the probability of death from one cause or another; the probabilitydoubles about every eight years as one grows older. This general probability issuch that even if the major causes of death in old ageheart disease, stroke,and cancerwere eliminated, the average life expectancy would not be length-ened by much more than 10 years. It would then be about 80 years instead ofthe expectancy of about 70 years that now prevails in advanced countries.Work with fibroblast cells taken from human embryos has revealed thatthese cells will undergo between 40 to 60 doublings with the average being about 50 times. After reaching this limit of capacity for division, the cell popu- lation dies. It is therefore concluded that normal human cells have a finite life- time amounting to approximately 50 population doublings. When these cellsare preserved at sub-zero temperatures, they stop dividing and can be \"banked\"indefinitely. However, when the cells are taken from cold storage they begindoubling again but then stop at about 50. Apparently, the cells contain an in- herent mechanism for \"remembering\" at what doubling level they were at when stored in the cold.Hurnan aging seems to result from deterioration of the genetic program that orchestrates the development of cells. As time goes on, the DNA of di- viding cells may become clouded with an accumulation of copying errors (anal- ogous to the \"noise\" that develops in the repeated copying of a photograph).The coding and dec(xling system that governs the replication of DNA operates with a high degree of accuracy but the accuracy is not absolute as the enzymes involved in the transcription of information from DNA, for the synthesis ofproteins, may deteriorate with age.Man is endowed with a longer life-span than other animals because humancells have evolved a more effective system for correcting or repairing errors as they arise. Nevertheless, man, like all other animals, has a \"mean time to fail- ure\" because his normal cells eventually run out of an accurate program andthe capacity for repair.Implication. The implication from Dr. Hayflick's presentation is that hu-man life span is basically fixed and nothing can be done about this; therefore,we must endeavor to expand or lengthen our productive years by maintaininghigh energy levels and good health. The potential role of our discipline in the scheme of things is quite clear. 68 SPORT AND LEISURE THE RIO SALADO PROJECTDEANE E. RICHARDSONArizona State UniversityThe Rio Salado (Salt River) Project is an exciting concept for multiple use ofland through greater Phoenix. It involves the development of a forty-milestretch of the Salt River, traveling west through Maricopa County from thepresent Granite Reef Dam (or from the Orme Dam when'completed); throughthe cities of Mesa, Tempe, and Phoenix; through unincorporated areas ofMari-copa County; and thrOugh the Gila River Indian Reservation of the intersectionof the Salt and Agua Fria rivers. Arizona State University is located on thesouth bank of the river just north of Tempe.The Salt River was a continuously flowing river before a series of damsand lakes were built to control the flow early in the twentieth century. Sincethen the river has been dry except for occasional overflows caused by storms orthe spilling of water from the dams to keep the man-made lakes at the desiredlevel. Its purpose is to furnish water to the Salt River Valley. The occasionalflooding of the river has resulted in very little building along its banks. Thisfact makes the Rio Salado Project economically feasible and separates it fromthe pattern of development occurring in most cities where the earliest landclaimed was along the river banks.The Salt River has had a divisive influence in separating north Tempefrom the main city of Tempe and south Phoenix from Phoenix proper. Veryfew bridges have spanned the river as roadbeds were laid across the river chan-nel. When the river flowed, the cities were indeed separated.In addition to flood control, the Rio Salado Project presents a concept forthe restoration of life in one of the area's greatest natural resources. Long-rangeplans call for a gradual functional change in the Salt River bed from vacantland to water-oriented recreation. The project will connect several existing parksystems and will enhance the quality of living for residents of Maricopa Countyand visitors.The project began as an assignment for Arizona State -University fifth-yeardesign students in the College of Architecture. The students were directed bythe dean of the college, James Elmore. From 1966 to 1969, students produced anextensive regional analysis. Then_ the Valley Forward Association, an or-ganization conceived to help develop an orderly pattern of growth for MaricopaCounty, carried the project. A consulting firm was employed to develop a com-prehensive planning approach. The firm proposed a three-phase program asfollows: Phase I, a \"plan for planning,\" was to specify work, costs, and person-nel needed to develop the project; Phase II called for the development of alter-native concepts; Phase III requested feasibility studies, implementation, and se-lection of the best of the Phase II plans.Phases I and II have been completed and are recorded in bound volumes ti-tled Rio Salado Project, Phase 1, April 1972, and Rio Salado Project,'Phase II,September /974. The recommendations recorded in Phase H are:696 9 70 1. Maricopa County and c ities dire( tly affected by Rio Salado should ac- cept the plan as a development goal.2. A Rio Salado commission should he formed to continue to promote Rio Salado.3. Local projects should proceed and not await completion of Orme Darn before taking major overall action.1. Such agencies as the State Parks Board, the Rio Salado Development Corporation, and the Rio Salado Special District and County Operated Agency should assume major responsibility for the project.5. The Maricopa County Flood Control District and the US Army Corps of Engineers shall be the authorities concerning flood control as flood- ing cannot be controlled locally.6. There must be intergovernmental agreement with land-use controls maintained by cities and the county.The heart of Rio Salado is water and various sources are available. The key is the Central Arizona Project, Orme Dam, which will be built east of Phoenix close to the junction of the Verde and Salt rivers. The dam will store 1.6 mil- lion acre-feet of water with 400,000 acre-feet for active storage and the rest for flood control. ['mil Orme Dam is built, there will continue to be occasional flooding; therefore provision must be made to let the water flow from the pro- posed series of lakes through the natural course of the river. Permanent dams can be built after the Orme Dam has been completed because flooding will thencease as 950,000 acre -feet of flood storage is projected to more than care for fu- ture storage of flood waters.Other sources of water are wells, municipal runoffs, and municipal drain-age systems. Another source is from the Salt River Project. This quasi-govern-mental agency was formed around the turn of the twentieth century to provide water for part of the Salt River Valley. Dams were built in the mountains andlakes were created. RooseVelt Dam, the largest, was dedicated by President The-odore Roosevelt in 1911. Water is distributed through the valley in a series of canals. One possibility is to take water from the Salt River Project at the east- ern section of the project and return the water to SRP at the western end of theRio Salado Project.Various sources of financing have been explored thoroughly and are in- cluded in the Phase II document.Phase II recommended two demonstration projects, one of these being the Tempe ASU Demonstrati(in Project, located in Tempe. This project will ex- tend from the Hayden Road bridge in the east to the Mill Avenue Bridge, two miles west. A schematic drawing will help locate areas discussed (Fig. I). 7 051: 3], 71 The phasing of this project is planned and is under way as follows:I. Rights to river boundaries, now held by public and quasi-public agen-cies, must be secured by the city of Tempe and ASU.2. Bridges must be built at both Hayden and Scottsdale roads. The HaydenRoad bridge has been completed and the Scottsdale Road bridge, locatedhalfway between Hayden Road and Mill Avenue, has been started. Theprojected lake will be four feet deep under the Hayden Road bridge andextend for two miles to a proposed dam near the Mill Avenue bridge.The lake will be 650 feet wide at the Scottsdale Road bridge and widereast of the bridge. There will be a 7.5-foot clearance under the bridge.Biologic growth and sediment from flooding is expected to provide aneffective sealant.3. The present somewhat meandering channel will be moved north to al-low the lake to run straighter east and west. The purpose is to provide a2,000-meter rowing course. By moving the channel north, ASU will in-crease its land holdings. Work has been started on diverting thechannel.4. One of the most unique aspects of the proposed lake is the building ofan inflatable dam at the western boundary of the project near Mill Ave-nue. There must be provision to allow flood water to pass through theriver until Orme Dam is built. Inflatable dams are now being used suc-cessfully on the Los Angeles River and the same principles are proposedfor the Tempe/ASU Demonstration Project. The footings would bemade for the permanent dam but a fifteen-foot barrier fitted with a com-bination of air and water will anchor the lake. When flood water mustpass through, the dam will be collapsed allowing the lake to empty.The dam will back the water to an elevation of 1,152 feet and hold 1,840acre-feet (250 acres) of water.5. A confluent structure will need to be built opposite the mouth of IndianBend Wash, located east of Scottsdale Road on the north side. Thiswash provides the flood drainage for much of the city of Scottsdale'sflood waters. The connection of Indian Bend Wash, now used as a parkby Scottsdale, will allow bicycle, hiking, and bridle paths to link. Theconfluent will guide the fast flowing water on a westerly course downthe Salt River.6. One of the plus factors for the Tempe/ASU Demonstration Project isthe fact that the city of Mesa, directly east from Tempe, has a sewagedisposal plant located approximately two miles east of Hayden Road. Ithas been proposed that the effluent be allowed to seep through the soilto purify itself and then be pumped into the proposed lake near HaydenRoad. The Mesa sewage disposal plant has a capacity of 5 million gal-lons a day. Although the plant is to be phased out in 1980, the effluentcould still be used for the Tempe/ASU Demonstration Project. Thisconcept of using reclaimed sewage water for recreational purposes hasbeen successfully implemented for several years in Santee, California, asuburb of San Diego. This community created several lakes, designatingone for swimming, one for fishing, and another for boating. Careful medical examination of swimmers found the water to be safe. Fishcaught the first year were not eaten, but fish residing in the lake havenow been declared safe for eating. 72 7. One objective of the project is to gain total public access around theproject. This may prove to be a little more difficult through the areas owned by nongovernmental individuals and groups. One of the excitinggoals is to link Papago Park with the project. Papago Park is a large, natural desert park shared by the cities of Phoenix and Tempe. Linkingthese areas would provide an opportunity for hikers and cyclists to move from Phoenix to Scottsdale through Tempe without the threat ofautomobile traffic.There must be cooperation among the agencies for development of bicycleand hiking trails. Local control has been reserved for individual cities and otheragencies such as ASU connecting directly to the river. Each should make thedecision as to how it can best serve its own citizens and, of course, the entire population of the county.Arizona State University has requested from the federal government two plots of land totaling 160 acres fronting the river. It is too early to make plans for the use of the ASU land, but there is no doubt that the entire university community will benefit from the Rio Salado Project. Aquatic activities such as rowing, sailing, and canoeing will be available. A golf course with greens and fairways watered from the lake will be made. A university seminar center is also a possibility. The green belt along the north border of the campus will giveASU additional beauty and greatly expand recreational opportunities.With Tempe./ASU leading the way, the Rio Salado can indeed become one of the finest examples of intergovernmental and private cooperation to improve Ihe environment for people to enjoy. DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE SAILING PROGRAMDICK MURRAYUniversity of California at Santa CruzSailing, a very popular sport in this country, has been relatively ignored byphysical education and athletic departments. The reasons for this situation areunderstandable: \"Yachting is for the elite; there is no place for it in ourschools.\" \"Sailing are not prepared to teach this activity.\" \"Sailingbelongs to the recreation department.\" \"Our students don't care about sailing.\"Most of these comments are mythical in natureseemingly good rationale forthose who do not understand the nature of boating sports and for those whodare not tread into the \"New Physical Education.\" It is true that an in-structional sailing program or a full-fledged comprehensive sailing program isriot the easiest to develop and operate; it takes work, dedication, and a lot ofpromotion. Young people today are fortunately interested in many new and dif-ferent activities. If you find out that a reasonable percentage of your studentshave a real interest in boats and how they work, dream of the freedom of get-ting away on the water for a relaxing day of sailing with a friend, have a desireto become involved in the demands and skills of competitive racing, or (quitelikely) wish they could someday cruise away to a tropical island on a boat oftheir own, then it is your responsibility as a physical educator to provide an ex-perience, an outlet, a beginning for reaching those dreams and desires.72 73 The purpose of this paper is to outline succinctly the basic requirementsfor providing good instructional sailing courses, the parameters of a compre-hensive sailing program, the personnel requirements for a comprehensive pro-gram, and some ideas for the funding and general operation of the sailing pro-gram on an annual basis. Throughout the text there are resource-references forcontacts in the event the reader needs further and more detailed information.BASIC REQUIREMENTSI, Prime Mover. We all know that good programs usually have good peo-ple to lead then]. To embark on a sailing program requires that your de-partment assign a staff member to the task of developing and administering theprogram who will be committed and who has the personal and professionalqualities to be successful in whatever work is to be done. This person shouldeither have or develop a personal interest in sailing, as this type of active per-soal involvement by the leadership of the program will surely show in thesuccess of the program.Unfortunately,fewprofessionalpreparationprogramsincludein-structional sailing methodology in the curriculum; therefore, we must oftenlook to retraining our staff or looking outside the physical education realm forperson nel.2. Body of Water. Institutions located near lakes, oceans, large rivers, andreservoirs have definite advantages not only in the development of comprehen-sive sailing programs but also in creating interest in sailing activity in the stu-dent lxxly. Although it is true that a great deal of basic instruction for boathandling can be accomplished in a swimming pool, it is not recommended thatsailing instruction be conducted without some exposure to and experience inopen water.3. Instructional Boats. It seems as if there are more classes of boats thanthere arc words in the dictionary. If your department decides to purchase a fleetof boats, the following is advised: select a boat that is manufactured by a repu-table firm; it should be well constructed, durable, easy to maintain, locally pop-ular, and sufficiently complex that your instructional offerings are not limitedto basic or beginning classes. Buying cheap equipment is usually the primarycause for failure in a new and experimental program. Also, most programs can-not afford to purchase separate types of boats for the beginning courses, the in-termediate courses, and the advanced courses and then another fleet for the rac-ing team. It is most advantageous to select a type of boat that can do almosteverything. For these reasons, it is recommended that a boat similar to the Fly-ing Junior be selected) The FJ is thirteen feet long and five feet wide; weighs22:5 pounds; is normally constructed in fiberglass (which is easily repaired andmaintained); uses a mainsail, jib, and spinnaker (optional); carries two peoplebut can easily be sailed alone or with three people; will plane when the wind isstrong; and is an international class boat that has active fleets all over the Unit-ed States. Also, the FJ is the most popular boat in the United States for inter-collegiate sailing teams in two-person competition. This type of boat, built bya good manufacturer, will cost from $1,500 to $2,000.The size of your fleet can, of course, vary according to the individual situ-ation, but we have found at. Santa Cruz that six boats for instruction is the op-timum number. With less than six the class size is too restricted for economicalefficiency, and with more than six the degree of effective instruction and super-vision is lessened. With a fleet of six boats our classes are limited to eighteen73 74 studentstwelve sailing in the boats and six observing and rotating in. Wehave found that those observing and listening to the instruction learn morethan the students who are actually in the boats; therefore, it is advantageous tohave students rotating in and out.Learning how to sail two-person dinghies like the Flying Junior properlyand safely is the most practical way to develop sailing knowledge, as the con- cepts and skills are most easily transferred to other types of boats. However, fora truly comprehensive sailing program it is good to have boats of other types,such as single-handed dinghies and larger keelboats so that students can have the opportunity actually to experience and develop personal skills in thesecharacteristically different types of boats.For single-handed instruction, recreation, and competition, a boat like theLaser is recommended.2 This boat is also thirteen feet long and weighs about150 pounds, is unsinkable, is very simply equipped, and is extremely popularthroughout the world. This boat is used almost exclusively for single-handedintercollegiate competition and is a very lively but physically demanding boatto sail. The cost is currently $950, and the boat is so durable that one shouldlast for several years of institutional use if properly supervised.Keelboats are a little more complicated. They require a harbor berthing ormooring facility, are much more expensive, and require more extensive mainte- nance and expertise. An institution that has the capability of owning largerkeelboats is certainly fortunate in that it can offer a program that is truly wellrounded. 'Hie boat most often used by colleges and universities in the UnitedStates is the Shields-30 sloop.5 The reason for this is that a very generous man on the East Coast by the name of Cornelius Shields, Sr., who started the Shieldsclass a few years ago, has donated many of these boats to various colleges. Pres-ently, on the East Coast a Shields-30 costs 513,000 with sails. A great deal ofgood will has resulted from-these fleets of Shields sloops, as the colleges thathave them have made the boats available to other colleges from time to time.Intercollegiate competition in keelboats is, quite naturally, conducted inShields-30 sloops. The boat is extremely well designed and has proved to be a fantastic boat for instruction, recreation, and racing.1. Safety Equipment. Sailing is a potentially dangerous activity that re-quires that institutional programs follow sound guidelines for the prudent andsafe conduct of classes and recreation. Lifejackets are part of the equipment ev- ery sailer has.4 The student should become aware that it is wise to wear theproper safety equipment alwaysnot just in class. Vest-type lifejackets are verycomfortable to wear, they are warm, and the good ones last a long time if prop-erly stored and cared for, To fulfill its responsibility, the institution must pro- vide this type of equipment for every person using boats.it is very important to have a small utility boat with an engine when class-es are conducted anywhere but in the most restricted bodies of water. This boatacts as a teaching platform, personnel carrier, safety vessel, tow boat, race com-mittee boat, and water taxi. The Boston Whaler and the Zodiac inflatable boatshave proved to be very satisfactory for these purposes.5 65, Miscellaneous Equipment and Facilities. There are always various addi-tional items necessary to conduct any program, and sailing is no different. Stor-age boxes for sails, lifejackets, and miscellaneous equipment are essential, Forsmall dinghies it is highly advised to have dry-storage facilities, as the boats lastat least twice as long as when they are kept constantly in the water. This re-quires launching facilities such as a ramp or hoist. The better collegiate pro-grams have, in addition, shop space, classrooms, toilet and shower facilities,and slip or dock space. 75 6. Insurance and Liability. Most institutions carry basic liability insurance,Which is a blanket policy for all aspects of operations on and off campus. Some of the new additions to physical education are potentially niore dangerous thanothers, and in these cases it is wise to have students sign statements indicatingthat they understand the nature of the activity and the hazards involved. This,of course, is not a license for the instructor or institution to be negligent in anyway.All boats should be covered with hull insurance with a $100 deductible.This usually runs about $20 annually for a Flying Junior sailboat and $120 fora Shields-30 sloop.7. Maintenance Program. Colleges generally have the reputation of nottaking care of their equipment. Thus, the boats that they own soon lose theirluster, fittings fall apart, participants lose their desire to keep things in goodshape, and the program suffers immensely as a result. This type of behavior islargely due to poor planning and an unrealistic concept of the proper oper-ation of a boating program. Student volunteers can contribute a great deal tothe proper maintenance of equipment, which in itself can be very educationaland rewarding, but there is a need for leadership to supervise the work andkeep the volunteers coming. Cutting back on maintenance expenses is falseeconomythe equipment will have to be replaced all the sooner. Also, nothingwill deteriorate the morale of the instructor more or frustrate the students morethan having to spend half of the class jury-rigging broken equipment on theboats.We have found at Santa Cruz that the best maintenance program is onethat provides a portion of each instructor's time for maintenance duties. Theinstructors encourage students to assist; in this way a feeling of pride is estab-lished in taking care of equipment that is used, and the equipment is generallynot abused. Itis least profitable to have an outside person be responsible forfixing everything. As the fleet of boats grows and as the program expands tovarious classes of boats and includes one or more power boats, the need in-'creases to have personnel with special talents in fiberglass repair, woodworking,mechanical and electrical skills, painting, and welding abilities. People withthese talents are rare and well worth the salary it takes to keep them around.PARAMETERS OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMA department that can fulfill most of the basic requirements outlinedabove has the potential for conducting a very comprehensive sailing program.With the necessary boats and equipment used for instruction, the program iseasily expanded to include recreational sailing in the evenings and on week-ends, competitive racing teams, and even cruising.1. Sailing Instruction. The following is a brief summary of the types ofclasses that may be offered:a. Basic Dinghy Sailingnomenclature, tacks, jib-es, docking; capsize, rules-of-the-road, safety, and care of equipment.Two-hour classes meeting once or twice per week with 18-24 total hours' ofinstruction.h. Intermediate Dinghy Sailingan advanced beginning course that ex-pands on the concepts covered in the basic sailing experience and includes anintroduction to racing techniques and more concern with the theory of sailing. 76 c. Beginning Keellxiat Sailingthis course should be designed as an intro-duction to keelboat sailing and should require as a prerequisite some basic sail-ing knowledge and skill, preferably having taken the basic dinghy sailing class.The special skills of handling a larger and heavier boat are quite unique. Al-though the basic theory and concepts are similar, keelboats and dinghies are asdifferent as foil and saber in fencing, downhill and slalom in skiing, and inter-nallineman and running back in football.d. Intermediate Keelboat Sailinga course designed for those students whowant to further the development of their keelboat sailing. This course can getinto racing techniques and special cruising abilities, such as setting courses, us-ing anchors, picking up moorings, and using a variety of sails such asspinnakers.e. Competitive Sailinga course that can be taught in a combination ofboats and concentrates strictly on specific aspects of racing such as starting,mark rounding, and racing rules.f. Navigationwith the interest generated by the various sailing classes,there will be thosestudents who would like to become accomplished in sailing-related skills, such as navigation, including position-fixing with celestial bodiesand using electronic devices. Course offerings in these related areas add a great deal of professionalism to the program, and the students who follow throughwith the total program can certainly achieve a feeling of accomplishment andsatisfaction with what they have learned.2. Recreational Sailing. When boats and equipment are not being used forclasses they should be available for use by those people who qualify on a recre-ational basis. We have found that this is best accomplished through a sportsclub program or through the supervision of the recreation department. It is notpractical to develop a recreational program without careful guidelines and closesupervision. Also, itis unrealistic and unfair to offer sailing instruction andnot have an outlet for people to practice or use what they have learned.3. Competitive Teams. There are over 300 college sailing teams in NorthAmerica that compete on a regular basis. College sailing is regulated by the In-tercollegiateYacht Racing AssociatiOn of North America, which compriseseight geographical districts. New college teams interested in becoming involvedin intercollegiate competition need only write the ICYRA of NA executive vicepresident, who can direct the inquiry to the nearest district association.7 Com-petitionis conducted at the local or district level and interdistrict, inter-sectional, and national levels. The ICYRA of NA national championships arenormally held annually in the second week of June. The competition is opento both men and women, and two-year community colleges compete rightalong with the major four-year universities. The strong areas are in the NewEngland states, the Midwest, and the Pacific Coast.Characteristically, there are far more colleges supporting intercollegiatesailing teams than there are colleges supporting instructional sailing programs.Many colleges have large fleets of sailing dinghies reserved for team use, al-though the average student has no opportunity to become involved.In a comprehensive program it is logical for the sailing team to use the in-structional boats for team practice and then possibly purchase one or two rac-ing boats that would be used for competition only. Here again it is importantto purchase instructional boats that are capable of serving a wide variety ofinterests. 7 77 Intercollegiate \u00abnitirtitionis conducted throughout the school year inseveral types of boats. Regattas are hosted by colleges that have the necessaryequipment and the expertise to manage and supervise the competition. Mostteams trailer or car-top their boats to the event. On occasion a college will pro-vide the boats and charge a use fee _for every entrant.1.Cruising.Many students today have a deep desire to travel to farawayplaces, and getting there by sailboat is often a dream come true, an adventure.Colleges that have a basic sailing program but do not have the larger boats totake day trips. over righters, weekend outings, or longer excursions must usetheir harbor contacts and friends to get on a boat trip.There is an entire body of knowledge involved in a sailboat cruise. Most ofthe general boating public are novices who purchase a small boat with the in-tention of cruising. Their background in boating is extremely limited, and theyusually learn as they go, which is often expensive and sometimes a tragedy.Therefore, ifitis at all possible, a college sailing program should include in-struction in cruising techniques and promote sailing trips as a firsthand learn-ing experience.Many colleges have been fortunate in receiving gifts of large ocean-goingyachts. .['hose colleges that have the ability to support the operation of a largerboat can certainly offer a worthy outlet for those interested in ocean sailing, Atthe University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC), we have been given largerboats and have thus completed two trans-Pacific crossings to the Hawaiian Is-lands as part of summer cruises, and we have traveled to Mexico twice duringspring breaks, 'Fhe number of weekend and day trips that have been completedare countless. Because this boat has since been sold (proceeds will help fund asailing center), the liCSC Sailing Club is promoting a spring cruise amongseveral of the local yachtsmen. So far there are five boats lined up to go, andeach one Will be taking several of the club members.PERSONNELPrograms normally begin very small and progressively develop dependingon particular successes and student interest. As stated previously, an industriousprime mover is essential to initiate, promote, and develop a meaningful sailingprogram. As the program grows, other assistants can be generated with knowl-edgeable students who could be hired on a part-time basis.Boat maintenance, as discussed, is so important that it is essential to allowtime and personnel for it. Under proper direction, work-study students can beincorporated into completing many maintenance jobsand at a great savingsto the budget. Also, sports club and sailing team members can often be re-cruited to assist with maintenance of boats and equipment on a volunteer basis.For weekend recreation it is important to have proper supervision with thechecking in and out of boats. Therefore, a person of responsibility and knowl-edge is essential. At UCSC we have worked with the Federal Probation Officeand have employed volunteer workers who must give their weekends to non-profit agencies as an alternate service to the military.As the sailing program grows in comprehensiveness there understandablycomes a time when full-time staffing is necessary. The assistant you choosemust have impressive credentials. Of course, it would be nice to find someonewith an MS in physical education from Springfield, but he would rank belowsomeone who has earned a BA and acquired ten years of sailing experience,won the Sears Cup Junior Championship at 16, constructed a wood and fiber-7 7 78 glass boat of original design, worked in a sail loft during the summer, taughtsailing in a yacht club junior development program, and crewed on an offshoretuna boat and who practices yoga and carves model airplanes as a hobby. Sucha person could plug a lot of holes and keep the program afloat.FUNDINGUnless your department has a lot of money or it decides to alter the prior-ities for budgeting, the sailing program will have to generate a great deal of in-come to offset the expenses. Some ideas for developing income that have provedsuccessful at -UCSC follow:1. Fees for Classes. $15 $20 for keelboat sailing are chargedeach student.2. Expanding Use. The boats are scheduled for maximum usage by en-couraging localsecondaryschool, community college, and recreation de-partment use of the facilities as available. An appropriate contract is developedand an expense fee is charged.3. Weekend Recreation. An agreement is established with the UCSC Sail-ing Club for weekend use of the boats and an appropriate annual fee ischarged.1. Regatta Fees. A nominal use fee is charged visiting colleges when theboats arc supplied for competitive events.5. Contributtons. Boats, equipment, and other items of value are solicitedfor donations and arc sold when appropriate to fund various needs.6. Departmental Funding. The department budgets funds to offset deficitsin the income.The primary concept is to run the program at maximum usage and chargea nominal fee for every user so that no one has to pay for another person's fun.A CASE STUDYUCSC hires a person to initiate a small sailing program, money is budget-ed to purchase four Flying Junior sailboats, and a highly beat-up whaler isscrounged from marine studies and with some artistic repairs an incrediblygood utility boat is put into service. With a timely gift of two Shields-30 sloopsand a maintenance loan of two others, the keelboat fleet is complete. Anothergift, a 43-foot sloop, rounds out the cruising outlet. Through justified requests,a full-time staff assistant is hired and more classes are offered. With satisfactoryincome, the old F.'s are sold and six new boats are purchased. The Sailing Clubbuys two additional F.'s of its own for racing and now a fleet of eight identicaldinghies is available. Local high schools and the community college are offeredthe opportunity to use the facilities and community interest and support grows.Fresno State College, located 150 miles inland from Santa Cruz, conducts ele-mentary sailing classes in their college pool using loaned boats and contractswith UCSC for the use of its facilities for weekend outingsgiving their stu-dents the necessary ocean experience. Other nearby colleges do the same thing.We end up with a regional sailing center shared and supported by many andthe costs are reasonably inexpensive for everyone.Check your area and see if another campus near you has facilities you canuse or help develop. If not, maybe you can develop a comprehensive programof your own. Don't forget to include your neighbors! 8 79 REFERENCESI.

A DYNAMIC PHYSICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMFRED DREWSNorth Carolina State UniversityThe Department of Physical Education and Intramural Athletics at North Car-olina State University has as its mission the charge to develop through knowl-edge acquisition and total body activity, primarily of the lifetime sports type,the physically, mentally, and socially effective individual and to provide a com-prehensive intramural athletics program for the student body.To achieve mission accomplishment, the university requires physical edu-cation of the undergraduate student body. In addition, the department providesa well-organized and varied intramural activities program. We do not offer amajor curriculum in physical education. Therefore, it is evident that our entireinterest rests in the required/elective physical education program and the intra-mural program.The overwhelming majority of students complete their requirement in foursemesters. In that time frame they have passed a survival swimming test, a se-mester-long course in health and physical fitness, and six physical educationactivity courses. At the minimum exposure level, wherein the student may com-plete requirements in two semesters, the student has passed a survival swim-ming test, the freshman course in health and physical fitness, and two vigorouslifetime sports proficiency examinations at the grade level of B+ or 85. Nearlyall of our activity classes are of eight weeks' duration. Individual permanentrecords of all student work in physical education are maintained in the centraloffice.79 80 To enhance further the student's opportunity for election of activities, ourfaculty is organized to conduct an internal registration for classes twice a semes-ter. Priority of choice is to upper classmen and on a first-come, first-served ba-sis. The schedule of courses taught each eight weeks is based on facilities avail-able, faculty teaching capabilities, season, and student interests as determinedby an annual curriculum preference survey.The department currently teaches 36 courses. They are categorized as pre-scribed courses, aquatics, combatives, developmental activities, individualsports, and team sports. In 1973-71 we taught 5,527 different students. Thisteaching load represented 842 sections of physical education. We have just coth-pleted the first semester of 1974-75 in which we taught 6,485 students in 517sections of physical education. The average size of a section in the prescribedfreshman course was 27; in other classes the enrollment varies between 12 and36 depending on the nature of the activity. The current university full-time en-rollment is 13,931of which 11,775 are undergraduates. All physical educationcourses carry letter grades and quality points that are computed in the gradepoint average.The intramural program at NCSU is an integral part of the physical edu-cation department. It is staffed by three faculty members each of whom is co-assigned to teach several sections of physical education in addition to his intra-mural duties. The 1973-74 academic year had 4,350 different students participatein the program, for a gross participation figure of 10,749. In the past four yearsour sports clubs program, under the direction of our intramural office, hasgrown to 13 clubs with several more on the way. Our intramural program cur-rently has 32 different activities. The student intramural board is an advisorybody to the intramural director. Another interesting point is that of our 1,846faculty members, we currently have 396 members of the university faculty usingour facilities for recreation and participation in the faculty intramuralprogram.The facilities for physical education instruction, intramural sports, andphysical recreation are situated in a complex entirely separate in control and lo-cation from the facilities for intercollegiate athletics. Overall, the physical edu-cation complex consists of three interconnected buildings with 216,036 squarefeet and a gross cubic footage of 4,371,075 and with one building holding 25 of-fices, 7 classrooms, 10 handball courts, and 6 squash courts and with anotherbuilding holding a large gymnasium in which are 8 basketball courts that weset up as multiple-use teaching stations for basketball, volleyball, badminton,physical fitness, and gymnastics. Also contained in the building are lockerroom areas for men (8,919) and women (2,305) and separate teaching stationsfor fencing, dance, and combatives and a golf-cage room and 2 weight-trainingrooms. The third building is a fine natatorium of 25 yards x 25 meters withample deck space for teaching, as well as an excellent spectator area. Our out-door facilities consist of 26 tennis courts, an all-weather track, a golf-puttingarea, and 12 acres of turf used for touch football, soccer, lacrosse, archery, golf,and jogging.Funding for operations of the department, exclusive of salaries, is from stu-dent fees, which are in trust funds and assigned with legal responsibility to thedepartment head. Currently, the general physical education fee is $17 and theintramural sports fee is $3. These fees are charged to all students annually. Ad-ditional support is given the department by the state of North Carolina for thepurchase of equipment and supplies for the instructional program. The currentoperating budget, exclusive of salaries and utilities, is $238,100.80 81 The depattment is presently staffed by 29 faculty members and 10 supportpersonnel. All faculty inembrs are full-time employees of the department. Apoint of interest is that 8 of our faculty members have accepted additional du-ties, beyond their full-time assignment in our department, as coaches under sep-arate contract with the Department of Athletics. This arrangement has been ef-fective for both departments. In all instances, the Department of PhysicalEducation hires and evaluates its teachers completely free of influence from theDepartment of Athletics.The basic: organization, for the department isline and staff. The de-partment head is held responsible for all actions. He receives formal adminis-trative advice from the two most senior faculty members. Other key adminis-trative positions reside in three men among whom are delegated responsibilityfor scheduling classes and faculty, monitoring and recommending actions forfacility maintenance and improvements, purchasing equipment and supplies,directing proficiency testing, directing physical fitness testing, and coordinatinginstruction of the prescribed freshman course in health and physical fitness.These men are the key personnel for effective day-to-day operations of thedepartment.The faculty-at-large are assigned a variety of committee assignments. In all,there are 3'1'activity committees. plus a senior faculty review committee andcommittees for curriculum, facilities, research, and registration. All committeesreport atleast annually to the faculty-at-large. Through committee assign-ments, junior fat ulty members are provided a variety of opportunities to dem-onstrate their knowledge, creativity, and other abilities. The budgeting processactively solicits from the committees a projection of needs after which final al-locations are determined by the department head in consonance with the de-partmental purchasing officer. The planning, programming, and budgeting se-quence involves all committee chairmen and administrative personnel and hasconsistently demonstrated sound fiscal management.The formal communications system for the department is mainly conduct-ed through weekly faculty meetings. These meetings are structured as businessmeetings with the political process of voting utilized sparingly and only in con-junction with broad overriding policy decisions and curriculum matters. Otherofficial communications involving coordinations are between the senior admin-istrative personnel and appropriate faculty members and are conducted on aman-to-man and eye-to-eye basis. It is a rare event when written memoranda areused to communicate.The annual evaluation of faculty for retention, renewal, promotion, andsalary is managed by the department head, who receives advice from a seniorfaculty review committee of four persons. The review process consists of numer-ous observations and a review committee discussion of each faculty member'swork, a Submission by each faculty member of a statement of his year's work, astudent evaluation, and finally a written evaluation rendered to the departmenthead by each review committee member. The final step is a compilation andrank ordering of the evaluations, which are both narrative and quantitative.The department head has the final responsibility for all personnel actions.The criteria used in evaluating faculty members are defined, weighted, andcategorized. Under teaching effectiveness, the faculty members are rated on or-ganizing ability, punctuality, professional attitude, thoroughness, performanceability, appearance, enthusiasm, fairness, availability, and care of supplies andequipment. Othercriteriaincluderecords management, completing de-81 82 partmental assignments, demonstration of leadership qualities, availability for departmental committee work, and constructive participation in departmental committees or projects. Also rated are the individual's efforts to improve through attendance at professional meetings, clinics, and graduate schools. Each of the criteria mentioned has a working definition and each is weighted as either indispensable, extremely important, important, or desirable. The scoring system applied is on a one-to-five-point scale and defined as poor, below aver- age, average, above average, and superior.Each member of the senior faculty review committee, in submitting hisevaluations to the department head, concurrently submits an order-of-merit or rank-order facultylist. This listing is combined with the department head'sevaluation and forms the quantitative basis for personnel decisions. A finalstratification of faculty members is determined and is categorized as out- standing, superior, excellent, effective, marginal, or inadequate.This presentation began with a statement of mission. The appropriatequestion in consonance with the principle of accountability is, How well is themission accomplished? To address this question several measures are employed. Each course has a definite written course of study including a prescribed procedure for evaluation of student performances. From year to year the results of skills and knowledge tests are reviewed and revised as required. Student eval- uations of courses are used minimally. Their greatest value is to provide infor-mation to the individual teacher in the form of direct feedback. The de-partment's faculty review board inspects them mainly to detect any negative trends, and if found, the situation is quietly pursued to establish a more accu- rate estimate of the situation. Additional feedback is gained through student-at-titude surveys, personal interviews with students, and grade analyses. Extensivedata are collected in physical fitness measures of freshmen at entrance to the university and at the end of their semester's work in the health and physical fit-ness course. This data is systematically reviewed and compared with earlieryears. These data studies are often the basis for changes in techniques of in-struction and in course content.I have described what any informed listener would recognize as a line-and- staff organization that requires leadership and adherence to high professional standards in order to insure success. Such an organization requires, on the part of its membership, a significant desire for the overall mission of the department to be successfully achieved. With a setting for both leadership and followershipin combination with opportunities provided for talents to surface, the NCSUprogram is thriving.We recognize that our manner of organization is unique in modern edu-cational practice. With a minimum of formal political action in a university where a great deal of political action is encouraged it may be an appropriate question to ask, What special considerations undergird this organization? I shall partially answer this question.First, we assign each person in a leadership role definite, clear-cut re- sponsibilities. Second, we give each leader definite, clear-cut authority to carry out the responsibilities assigned to him. Third, we establish clear lines of au- thority, paying particular attention to the principle that a person should be subject to direction from only one source in carrying out his assignedresponsibility.A main concern is for humanizing the organization as an open system: that is, the organization is in constant interaction with the environment, thereby re- ceiving a stream of inputs from the various publics and officials from both in- 82 side and outside of the organization's boundaries. Formal and informal feed-back is constantly solicited from the department's faculty, staff, students inclasses, students in intramurals, and faculty users of the physical education fa-cilities, thereby providing simple and effective communications linkups.Finally, we recognize that at least three general attributes can be expectedto characterize any good organization: balance, stability, and flexibility. An or-ganization in balance is one whose components have been allowed to developfully but only to the point of contributing their utmost to the organization'sobjectives. Stability in an organization indicates that it can develop and sustainitself without overdependence on individual key or specialized personnel. Con-siderable effort is made in the Department of Physical Education at NCSU toinsure that at all levels of personnel persons are prepared to step up or stand inas the situation requires.Many factors contribute to flexibility, the quality that permits changingworkloads to be handled quickly and economically. The key point in maintain-ing flexibility is recognition of the need for redefinition of tasks and assign-ments. Identified tasks of an unusual magnitude and of a long-term nature mayrequire a change in the tailoring of department organization. If the task is sig-nificant but of a short-term nature our usual manner of attacking the situationis to appoint selected personnel to prepare an appropriate action forconsideration.In conclusion, the Department of Physical Education at North CarolinaState University is traditional in its line-and-staff organization and effective inits results in terms of its curriculum, students' learning, faculty morale, andbusiness management. THE COMMUNITY/JUNIOR COLLEGE AND NCPEAMGEORGE F. CARTERTriton CollegeI would like to motivate you to consider the community college physical edu-cator as a professional working in the community college, an integral part ofthe system of higher education.Many of you represent the best minds in education, and you are among themost learned people in the world. The reputation of the NCPEAM was consid-ered when Dr. Fordham first approached me about speaking at this prestigiousconvention. I was both flattered and apprehensive. Most of us who work in acommunity c011ege are not accustomed to having this opportunity, and manyof us are awed by the changes taking place in higher education. One obviouschange is the recent emergence of the community college on a national basis.These two-year schools are becoming a viable _entity within the spectrum ofhigher education; although their rapid growth will level off, their usefulnessmay increase.In years _past, the community college has not always enjoyed a pleasantreputation. Many educators have considered the community college as a dump-ing ground or as a place to send educational rejects. You may harbor such aconcept of the two-year college. Much of the way you believe is due to yourpersonal experience or the manner in which you have been taught.83 84 There were only ten or eleven junior colleges in Illinois when I accepted ajob at Triton College in 1967. Public Law 1710establishing junior collegedistrictswas enacted by the Illinois General Assembly in 1964, and most of thenew junior colleges in our state had their beginning. Since there were no facili-ties, many of these colleges began their operation in high schools, factories, andstorefronts.It has been my experience that most people who are a product of the col-lege system of the 50s and 60s think negatively when discussing community col-leges. 'I'he meager beginning of the community college in our state reinforcedmany of these old beliefs, thus creating a real image problem. Historicallyspeaking, a college education has been limited to the elite (both academicallyand financially) and oriented toward the four-year degree. Thus, these new two-year schools have had to overcome many obstacles in establishing their nichewithin the higher education community.As our society moves into the late 70s and beyond, many changes are goingto take place. An area that may change dramatically is higher education. Thischanging haS already begun to some extent,' witness the battle for students,dropping enrollments, challenges to tenure, unionism, collective bargaining,and so forth. Cormnunity.junior colleges will play an important role in theI anging ecluctional concept.Junior colleges had their beginning in 1901 with Joliet Junior College in,Joliet, Illinois. 'Ibis college and most of the other early junior colleges offeredbasically the first two years of the four-year program. For the most part, theywere intended for those financially unable to go away to college and for peoplenot acceptable to the four-year college. Eventually, these two-year collegesevolved into the comprehensive junior college and began serving many publics,especially in technical and vocational education. Next, the comprehensive ju-nior college became the comprehensive community college, adding adult edu-cation and many community services to their offerings. This brief historical re-iew brings us to today.Did you know that community junior college enrollment hit 3.5 millionin fall 1974?The concept of community college education in Illinois is to allow all citi-zens above high-school age the opportunity and access to higher education,whether in transfer programs or job skills training. There are 47 communitycolleges in Illinois and others are planned. Many of these new colleges have de-veloped in the urban areas or in dense population centers. Community collegeshave become a vehicle to provide an opportunity for education to the masses.Over the last seventy years, citizens as well as educators have experiencedan environment where the educational system has been expanding. Attemptshave been made to meet the needs of society through the creation of many newschools and educational techniques. Some of these have been successful, othershave fallen by the wayside. Our profession has been studied, researched, talkedabout, and changed so often that the American public is confused.Declining public approval of higher education began five to six years agowhen discipline hit an all-time low, students took control, and riots became theorder of the clay. Public opinion has deteriorated further in recent months dueto the economy and job market. The number of students entering elementaryschools is noticeably less, some college enrollments are down, some colleges arefoundation funding is clown, and budgets are tighter than ever before. 84 85 however, there air many ways to view our situation. It appears that thisera is a time of opportunity. Much as we might not like to admit it, supply anddemand operate in education as well as in other sectors of American life. It willbe a difficult few years as the transition from a growth climate in higher edu-cation adjusts to a climate that requires fewer educators. Many of the changesin higher education may seem unfair to you, especially when you have investeda lifetime in preparation. But, at the community college, change keeps us dy-namic. The use of part-time faculty, utilization of paraprofessional personnelinstead of faculty wherever jx)ssible, and better utilization of facilities and fulltime personnel are commonplace to us.Community colleges may now serve as-a threat to many of you. They werenot very awesome-in the 60s when college enrollments were peaking and moneywas plentiful. Some persons in higher education would blame the communitycollege [or the problems besetting higher education. For those of you who mayfeel that way. let me remind you that most of the persons attending the com-munity college would not attend the four-year school. The typical, or average,community college student at Triton College (enrollment almost 20,000) (1) is apart -timer (he carries less than 12 credits); (2) is a commuter (no dorms areavailable); (3) is 27 years old; (4) often comes from a culturally, socially, or fi-nancially deprived background; and (5) spreads his education over several years.Many community college students are married with families; work either full-or part-time; would not qualify for admission to four-year schools; are reversetransfers from four-year schools; and are not interested in a four -year degree butin immediate job training.Many of the problems facing an educator at the four-year school are thesame as the ()TICS facing the educator at the two-year school. Probably the big-gest concern for all of us is whether or not the American public will continueto be willing to invest millions of dollars in public higher education. In assess-ing the job market and the quality of the work performed by our graduates,serious concern does exist. Those of us who work in the community college be-lieve the salvation for higher education is our ability to reach the massesthrough our varied educational opportunities. In the education marketplace, allsegments of the education system are evaluated by the public, including gradeschool, high school, and college. We are all in this together.At Triton College, the Department of Physical Education and Health Edu-cation is one of nine within the School of University Transfer Studies. CareerEducation has fourteen departments at our school and over 50 percent of theenrollment: Our department offers both a majors program and a basic in-struction program. The majors program is limited with regard to lecturecourses inasmuch as not many would transfer. You see, for any of our coursesto be transferred as credit courses, they must articulate with one of the state se-nior colleges within Illinois. Therefore, most of the courses in the majors pro-gram are taught at the senior colleges. which is as it should be.Courses offered in our majors program usually have one hour of lectureand two hours of lab or activity. Naturally, it is our belief that our programserves the need of our students, but our faculty believe they should be able toteach some classrcx)m courses. This is impossible because of Illinois law, whichprohibits upper-division courses from being taught in the two-year college. Inthe future, many four-year colleges may start to offer courses at the two-year siteutilizing their own staff and qualified community college instructors. If stu-dents- do not come to us for our service, the service must be taken to thestudent. 86 Our basic instruction jnogram at Triton College serves about 1,100 stu- dents per semester. This figure does not include health education, recreation,and physical education offered through adult' education. Since our student body is so diversified and we do not have permanent on-campus athletic facilities, this number has significance. Many of our courses are taught at nearby commu- nity centers, park districts. YMCAs, other colleges, and wherever space can heborrowed or rented,A full program of activities is offered and the courses are taught by our full-time staff or a part-timer with expertise in a particular area. The use of part-time instructors is on the increase and has more drawbacks than advan- tages, but it does allow our program to expand.In December 1971, the Illinois Board of Higher Education eliminated in-voluntary physical education as a requirement for graduation at all state col-leges and universities. At that time, it was feared that the decision would elimi-nate some of our staff, especially since we did not have permanent on-campusfacilities for our activities. Initially our enrollments dropped, but through hardwork on the part of our department and our administration, many credit hourshave been recovered. No instructor lost his job because of the loss of therequirement.The future appears brighter for us. Next year, Triton anticipates the instal-lation of outdoor play areas. Already there are twelve modern buildings to serve our students. The first phase of construction for athletics and physical edu-cation will include an Astroturf play field:an allweather track, a baseball dia-mond, and tennis courts. As money becomes available, the stadium and spec-tator seats will he provided. Indoor facilities are currently in the planningstages. Since the Capital Development Board (the approval agency for buildingin Illinois) will not approve construction funds for physical education facilities,the college district must fund all physical education and athletic facilities fromdistrict tax dollars.Plans are now tinder way to Construct a community career center on thecampus. This building will house a child-care center, a senior citizen center,many health career programs, adult and continuing education centers, policescience, tire science, recreation leadership, and locally funded physical edu-cation Facilities. This project will go before the Capital Development Boardsome time this year. This is a new concept in facility planning and shouldprove to be a bonanza for out physical education enrollment inasmuch as stu-dents from a variety of subject areas will be exposed to our activities.What about the community college and NCPEAM? By now you have someidea of the community college. What (toes the NCPEAM offer to the commu- nity college physical educator? There are a great many demands placed on allof us; yet, as an individual and a professional, we all make some commitments.As I reviewed my memberships, I realized that some adjustments would need tohe made in the coming years. Time, money, and commitment to the many or- ganizations cannot continue.I low do you decide which organization you will join? There are as manyreasons for joining as there are people. One of the general rules is that you joinbecause of a friendship or your friend's. recommendation. If a person joinsthrough friendship, the experience will usually be a good one as immediatecontacts can be established and enable the newcomer to feel right at home.Some may join out of professional commitment; others, to make personal con-tacts or for job advancement. Certain individuals may join to present a paper orseek a scholarship or grant. Why should the community college physical edu-cator join?86 87 A principle that many of us use when considering an organizational mem-bership is to find out what the organization can do for us and what we can dofor the organization. When you stop to analyze the community college physicaleducator, he usually does not relate to the NCPEAM and for some goodreasons.The community college faculty are not pushed to publish or perish, theyare not research oriented, they are not necessarily inclined to pursue a doc-torate, and they work with students who are quite different from typical four-year students. There are some other differences that influence the two-year-school faculty member. Normal teaching loads are geared to 14-20 contacthours per week and usually include some other assignment. It would seem fairto say that the work load of the community college teacher is a cross betweenthat of the high school teacher and that of the teacher at the four-year school(at least in terms of teaching load).Another area of important diversity is that of the faculty selection and re-tention. Many two-year colleges employ faculty who can instruct in generalrather than specific disciplines or who are willing to take on additional duties,such as coaching. They must also prefer to teach in the basic instruction pro-grain, since our majors programs are limited. A number of the two-year col-leges do not recruit faculty beyond their local districts; many of the new facultyat these colleges come from nearby high schools.It usually has been considered a promotion to move up to a higher schoollevel and a demotion to move down. This trend over the years has influencedmany educators to believe that the community college teacher is inferior to hisfour-year counterpart. Some of these beliefs are changing, many due to theoverabundance of teachers and the state of the economy. Teaching at the com-munity college is gaining in prestige, promoting increased interest in workingat this level.The relationship between the NCPEAM and the community college maynever end in a marriage. The nature of the programs, the nature of the institu-tional commitments, the nature of the person who works at the community col-lege, and other considerations, such as budget, might never allow for wide par-ticipation by community college people in the NCPEAM. If and when the timearrives that a community college person feels the need for this organization, I'mcertain that he would feel welcome; my personal relationship, which began in1967, has always been good.All of us have learned a long time ago that we can manufacture needs; wedo this through promotion. In a manner of speaking, the NCPEAM has ini-tiated the elementary steps to solicit community/junior college members. Thishas been done through the attempt to establish some junior college leadershipand through this session here today.There are many philosophical considerations that merit discussion byNCPEAM leaders when they consider recruiting two-year faculty as potentialmembers of this organization. Since persons working in two-year colleges havea different orientation and need toward organizations, it is questionable wheth-er great numbers will join. If the NCPEAM leadership is committed to reach-ing out to the community/junior college for membership, these suggestionsmight prove helpful:I.Begin your membership drive with the community college memberswithin the organization. Request their input and actively involve themwith the work.2.Consider different types of memberships. Each category would requirea separate dues and provide different services.87 88 3: Consider dividing the US into geographical districts. Find a strongcommunity college leader within each district and utilize him.4.Devise a technique to insure that community college people recognizecornnmnity college leadership exists in the NCPEAM. If necessary, es-tablish a fund to pay expenses for an individual to appear on the na-tional convention program.5.Establish incentives for membership. Develop appropriate remuner-ative and prestige awards for district leaders.6.Involve every new member in some project immediately. Make certainthat the new member has more than a dues-paying commitment.7. Work on the image of the NCPEAM. Make it relevant to the commu-nity college person.8.Develop a reward system for those serving on committees, attendingconventions, making speeches, and helping to promote and build theNCPEAM.9. Develop a membership certificate that is suitable for framing andmounting on the office wall. Issue these certificates and update theyear on them for all-members.10. Do not expect immediate success.Many of these suggestions have probably been considered at other times.The odds are against the NCPEAM increasing community college membership.As you may be aware, though, there is not one agency that provides for thecommunity college physical educator. There are over 600 of these two-year col-leges, which do not have a national organization or national leadershipopi)ortimities.Economy, budget, energy, leadership, and timing are important ingredientsto change. There appears to be a void on the national level for leadership at thecommunity/junior college level. There are many obstacles to be overcome butthe NCPEAM might well be the organization to adopt the community collegephysical educator. It will take time, compromise, and understanding, but itcould prove worthwhile for all concerned. HEALTH, PHYSICAL EDUCATION, AND RECREATION IN THE \"NOW\" COLLEGEMILLARD J. FISHERDe Kalb CollegeINTRODUCTIONThe unprecedented growth of community colleges in the United States duringthe last decadea 300 percent increase in enrollments and a doubling of thenumber of institutionsattests to the popularity of these remarkable institu-tions of higher learning. Many advocates of the community college envision itas \"one of the few unique accomplishments of American Education in the 20thCentury. \"\" Since the last decade, community colleges have been established forthe first time in most major cities. Within a few years, more than 1,000 publiclysupported community colleges will make education beyond high school avail-able to youth, adults, and senior citizens in every state. Mar land points out that88 89 \"the community-junior college movement is perhaps the most significant andcertainly the liveliest phenomenon in American education.\"2 He further sug-gests that by 1975 the enrollment at two-year colleges will rise from 2.5 millionto 3.3 million students.' Willingham, in his state-by-state analyses of the needfor additional educational institutions, proclaims that if the number of newcommunity colleges continues to amass at its present rate, universal higher edu-cation through the fourteenth year for 90 percent of the population of thiscountry will become a reality by 1980.4 If this becomes a truism, think of theimplications that this tremendous growth will have for the various disciplines,including our own.In recent years, the Carnegie Commission recommended that no tuition becharged for the first two years of a college education at a public institution.5The continuing pressure to expand the accessibility of higher education is theproduct of many forces. Low cost institutions appeal to students who could nototherwise afford college or to those who are undecided about their future ca-reers. The access of most community colleges to both college-age and adult en-rollees creates a unique institutional appeal. Local employers seeking trainedworkers view the community college as an economic asset, and civic leaderslook to it for cultural enrichment.PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVESOE THE COMMUNITY/JUNIOR COLLEGEDemocracy is dependent upon an educational system that permits the de-velopment of an informed and literate citizenry. The community college is ded-icated to the democratic way of life. Because it has faith in the integrity andworth of each individual both as a human right and as a guarantee of a just,stable, and dynamic social order, its philosophy is to provide equal opportunityfor the development of each individual's capabilities. Opportunity in higher ed-uc-ation for all people is essential to this philosophy.As an outgrowth of the aforementioned philosophy, the six objectives thatfollow are generally the concern of the community college.I.General Educationprovides an opportunity for the education of eachindividual so that he may achieve a broad understanding of the social andphysical forces affecting his life and become an effective member of his family,community, and world society.2.College Transfer Educationprovides carefully planned programs of aca-demic courses that are acceptable to colleges and universities and, when success-fully completed, prepare the student for upper-division courses leading to vari-ous academic and professional degrees.3.Occupational Educationprovides educational opportunities that are oc-cupationally oriented and designed to prepare an individual for employmentupon completion of a program of study, including opportunities relative tomeeting the effects of technological changes or automation.4.Developmental Studiesprovide programs for those individuals who havebeen identified as needing remedial courses and allow students to achieve attheir own rates with some assurance of academic success and self-actualization.5.Guidanceprovides each student with the necessary information, coun-seling, and direction to assist him in developing and progressing toward hisgoal .6.Community Servicesprovide facilities and leadership for education andopportunities for participation in a variety of activities so that the college maybe a living social force and a cultural center of the community.89 90 STUDENT POPULATION TO RE SERVEDHigher education has just about reached the saturation point for the brightyouth from the upper socioeconomic levels, since 80 to 90 percent of this groupare now in college. The newest college student is going to come from the sec-ond and third quartiles in ability and the lower socioeconomic strata of our so-ciety. The backgrounds and characteristics that shape the interests, career goals,and values of community/junior college students are diverse, and there is em-phasis on the disadvantaged, the minority, and the home-based student. Thesecharacteristics can serve as important background information upon which fac-ulty and administrators can build their strategies for helping students learn. Ifwe think of these factors as inputs to the planning process, trends in studentcharacteristics will be helpful to those concerned with predicting future needs.ASSESSMENT OF GOALSGoal achievements often depend upon the care with which subsystem ob-jectives are specified. Subsystem or intermediate objectives can be used by facul-ty members to guide students as they progress through a given subject mattertoward terminal performance objectives. The goals toward which performanceobjectives are pointed represent the longer-range mission of an instructionalprogram and provide an integrative thread for the learning program as awhole.Presently, there appears to be a concerted effort to focus attention on per-formance assessment as the major criterion for determining the effectiveness ofa school. For the purr3ose of amplification, the three comments that follow ap-pear to be appropriate. First, restating objectives in terms of output, or changesin the learner's performance, offers the advantage of relating inputs and in-structional processes to results, with close attention to the interaction betweenthese three classes of variables. Second, broader educational goals stated interms of the Ixthavior that students should realize upon completion of a pro-gram of study need to be broken down into more specific short-term or interimoutput objectives that collectively lead to improved student performance. Third,for certain types of learning experiences the learning process itself defines theobjective being served. In some instances, general goals are all that can bestated. and subobjectives can he clarified through experience with individuallearners.By converting the broad educational goals of community/junior collegesinto more specific output and process objectives, college administrators and fac-ulty should'be able. to identify a .minimum set of skills, knowledge, and atti-tudes to be achieved by a majority of the students enrolled in a particularcourse.METHODS OF FULFILLING THE GOALSI.Variety in Curriculum is essential. The courses and programs offeredshould be dependent on the needs and interests of the people and institutions,not on tradition and so-called normal college-level programs.2. Personal Assistance to Students is viewed by many educators as one ofthe most important entities of the community college structure. It appears thatwe need to divorce ourselves from the professional counseling syndrome and be-gin to develop by a substantial reallocation of educational resources the coun-9 0 91 seling potential inherent in imolvement of students, faculty, and laymen fromthe community, including business and the professions.3.Grading Systemsthat eliminate failure in the traditional sense are beingexperimented with by several community colleges. Supporters of nonpunitivegrading systems and procedures believe that it is important to know what a stu- dent has masteredwhat skills he can perform, problems he can solve, and in-formation he can apply hut that it is not necessary or advisable to record fail-ures in addition to successes.f. Concepts of Timelimiting education to the completion of a certainamount of courses that yield a certain number of credit hours in a few years arebeing questioned. Education as a lifelong activity appears to be gaining accept-mice philosophically and practically. Educational closure is no longer a reason-able concept.5. NewLocations and Nezv Instructors are needed because many students function more effectively in other environments than the campus. Off-campuscenters in neighborhocxls and industrial locations are examples. Communitiescan be used as laboratories. Educational opportunities can be taken to peoplewhere they live and work, using mobile facilities if necessary.ti.Methods and Mediathat allow different-instructional approaches mustbe utilized. Because of financial and other constraints, the feasibility of doingsomething different is getting more emphasis now.7.Improved Teachingis essential in any institution of higher learning.The cluster concept shows some promise but does have many interpretations. Itis essentially a way of closely relating faculty and students. This arrangement isintended to lead to a greater acceptance of responsibility for student learning byall panic's.NEED FOR DIVERSITY IN FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORSBoth the administrator and the teacher are managers of learning. Recog-nizing common responsibilities and a large community of interest helps closethe gap that too often exists today between faculty and administration. It is thespan of responsibility rather than the substance of the task that differentiatesthe roles of administrator and faculty member. In the community college, theteacher faces the challenging assignment of improving the learning process inan institution with an ever increasing breadth of program and diversity of stu-dents. His role is to provide leadership to the participants in the learning ex-perience as they shape their objectives and to assist in tailoring educationalprograms to achieve the objectives. The faculty member makes available re-sources that will be useful to the studentinformation through computers,books, tapes, laboratory equipment, and perhaps work-study opportunities. Heparticipates in the process by which evaluation is conducted on a continuingbasis so that learners may be able to correct errors and identify deficiencies. Theadministrator, too, finds himself facing an assignment that is changing in itsrequirements for success. Traditional administrative skills as perceived by somewill probably have to give way in importance to increased emphasis on work-ing with broader constituencies to make the learning process work moreefficiently.A special kind of person' with special skills and attitudes is going to beneeded for community college work. This is already apparent, and the needwill become even more apparent in the-future because of pressures already atwork. The transition from where we are to where we are going will be made 9 1 92 easier if faculty and administrators see themselves as partners in the manage-ment of learning.MAJOR TRENDSAlthough enrollments in four-year institutions of higher education willlevel off or decline during the decade, community college enrollments will con-tinue to soar, reaching a level of approximately 4.5 million full- and part-timestudents by 1980. Students will be older, more self-directed, and more certain oftheir career interests. The effects that the aforementioned will have on the na-tion's community/junior colleges will probably develop into the followingtrends:1. Continued support for the concept of the open-door policy will requiremore effective developmental education program offerings.Faculty members will require radically improved preservice and in-service training if they are to meet effectively the needs of a diverse array ofstudents.3. Greatly expanded minority group enrollment will require dramatic in-creases in the number of minority group faculty representatives, counselors, andadministrators. Expanded recruitment programs and inservice training willhelp resolve the current imbalance between the number of minority studentsand faculty members.4. Strengthened lifelong learning programs will require institutional com-mitments and appropriate staffing well beyond the current level5. Clustered courses and core curricula will help to improve the articu-lation of career and transfer programs. In addition, work-study programs, part-time enrollment, intermittent enrollment, and external degrees offer promisingalternatives to traditional procedures.6. Closer linkage of the community with the college will be achievedthrough systematic needs assessment and communication efforts. Off-campuscourse offerings, involvement of community leaders in policy-making, tele-vision coverage of campus events, and outreach recruiting will help to insure acloser collaborative relationship between the community and the college.7. New organizational structures that encourage those who should par-ticipate in decision-making to do so will emerge. The typical bureaucraticstructure of the past, with its hierarchical alignment of administrators, staff,and students, will give way to a participatory management framework withboth faculty and administrators serving as learning managers.8. Result-oriented goals and objectives will facilitate a more effective allo-cation of resources for the benefit of the student and community.9. The utilization of a greater diversity of media and hardware will en-hance the satisfaction of meeting the needs and interests of the populace in thecommunity.10, The community college will take a more active role in assisting thecommunity it, the resolution of economic, educational, cultural, political, andsocial problems.INNOVATIVE PROGRAMSRelative to the foregoing topics, how does the health, physical education,and recreation division fit into the picture for contributing toward the pro-vision of this comprehensive education? What are the implications for physical92 93 education in the \"now\" college? In addressing ourselves to these questions, it isimperative that we discuss innovative physical education programs. There arenumerous examples of these at the community college level. A few examples ofthese programs taking place at the present time at DeKalb College are: skin andscuba diving trips to Grand Cayman Island and Florida; skiing at Vail, Col-orado; a European trip concerned with the visitation of physical education fa-cilities, plants, programs, and places of historical interest in the development ofphysical education; and an interdisciplinary course to discover the developmentof man through science entitled \"The Ascent of Man,\" which deals with the in-terrelationship of science and technology on the course of human events (ofwhich physical education is a part) and consists of an on-campus seminar everytwo weeks. A television series transmitted for thirteen weeks serves as course in-struction; the same program is shown twice a week on two different evenings.6Other innovative physical education programs utilized in community col-leges arc various individualized approaches to learning, independent study op-tions, student choice of independent study units, self-directed learning, goal-centered individualized learning elective curricula, miniquarter and trimesterextended school-year plans, student-designed elective courses, contingency con-tra( Ling, and competency-based programs. Fitness learning laboratories are an-other innovation. The program at Brookdale Community College is an exam-ple) In their program they require a fitness profile for each entering freshmanthat inc Icicles a medical examinationphysiological parameters that includeheight, weight, girth, cardiovascular, pulmonary function, muscular strength,and skinfold measurements. In addition, a physical activity interest inventory,physical activity history, and .nutrition profile for each individual are developedand used.Hodges did a research project with the purpose of determining the currentstatus and organizational structure of physical education in public two-year col-leges in the Midwest!' He writes: \"Innovation and change were apparently apart of the service program at many of the colleges. Independent study was pro-vided for at 11% of the colleges. Other innovative ideas currently in use includ-ed contract teaching, modular scheduling, mini-courses, closed-circuit tele-vision, and proficiency testing. Thirty-three percent of the colleges offered whatthey considered to be unusual or unique activities. The top five included self-defense activities (judo and karate), backpacking, canoeing, skiiing, and cy-cling. Itis interesting to note that 56% of the colleges augmented the .facultywith community specialists,\" The researcher concludes that physical educationin the public two-year colleges in the Midwest is considered an integral part ofthe total college curriculum, and that future expectations appeared even moreencouraging.PHYSICAL EDUCATION FOR THE COMMUNITYPhysical education in the \"now\" college includes the expansion of param-eters hole on-campus experiences to physical education for the community. Itnot only provides the accessibility to on-campus facilities, such as golf, tennis,swimming, and physical fitness measurement and testing, but also brings manyof thew activities to areas olcloser proximity, such as churches, Ys, and clubs,both day and night whenever feasible. In addition, the utilization of in-strm tional services that in( hide qualified physical educators and others who areexperts in their particular activity is essential. Moreover, the ultimate purpose 9 3 94 of these expelieu\u00abs should b to enhance the development of education and good health by the acquisition of skills, knowledge. and positive attitudes to-ward recreative experiences and lifelong physical activity. Bird suggests that\" .once mobilized, this community partnership. under the direction and su-.peryision of professional physical educators, could furnish a substantial creativeresonue opening to the adult community. offerings that span the entire spec-trum or human movement.\"'\"A couple of examples of places where the 'emerging \"community centerschool\" has shown immediate success is the I moan Resources DevelopmentCenter in Hamilton County. Tennessee, and the John F. Kennedy Center in At-lanta, Georgia. In addition to providing the community with programs inhealth, physical education. and recreation, they serve many of the other socialSCRto e delivery systems and c ivic functions. For the purpose of exhibiting theneed lotphysical education beyond the student population, Bird writes that.. pain( ipation inphysical activity has to have a place to happen, the toolsto make it happen. and it !mist be stimulated and reinforced. Physical educatorsshould readjust their sights and broaden their sphere of direct influence to in-( hale two-thirds more of the population.\"\"CONCL l'SIONStudents floc Led to campuses all over the United States in the 1960s, ashundreds of community colleges were built. It was the decade of bricks andmortar, of staff recruitment and program development, and of advisory commit-tees and master plans. The decade of the 1970s is the decade to fulfill the prom-ise and to achieve the goals through the learning process.It appears toclearly discernible that economic, social, political, and so-cietal pressures magnify the importance of the provision of community servicesfor the j)opulace by utilization of all the community resources that one canmuster, with pcAsibly the most important one being the community college.Ube community college is both the catalyst to stimulate a community con-sciousness arid the produc t of this consciousness. In many cases, this institutionof higher learning has helped to facilitate the establishment of new alignmentsand commonalities of interest among the aggregations of people in the commu-nity. Tomorrow's student will exhibit greater concern for shaping his own des-tiny. Cut ric alum offerings and institutional procedures need to be plannedwith student participation. Independent study opportunities, more flexiblecourse schedules, and greater attention to individual learning styles will be re-quired. College students are demanding that the learning process be shaped tothen tequirements. Community colleges are doing more than respond tochange. Fhey are influencing the direction of change in our society by the pri-orities that they are establishing.Some critics will decry the aforementioned suggested roles for physical edu-c mot s in the community college and predictive comments concerning physicaleducation in the \"now\" college. They will charge that such a faith is naive andtimealism.I hese people cannot envision themselves performing new and dif-ferent toles; participating in new methods, programs, and teaching techniques;and serving a wider patameter in the community. With the changing role offright,' education, the economy, 11('V technology, the emphasis on account-abilityto the college student.. the community, the profession, and oneself,among others. let me hasten to assure you that physical education in the \"now\"college, as suggested. may very likely become a reality. 9 4 95 REFERENCES1.

HEALTH, PHYSICAL EDUCATION, AND RECREATION IN THE \"NOW\" COLLEGEDON JONESTarrant County Junior College\"Texas: land of contrast, where almost II million Texans are dealing effectivelywith diversity-7thanks to education. They are learning and relearning at two-year colleges that have grown phenomenally during the last decade and arecalled by many different namescommunity college, junior college, or simplycollege. But for the tens of thousands of Texans enrolled in these publicly sup-ported two-year institutions, they are the \"now\" colleges. They are comprehen-sive community colleges, combining the best of traditional education with ef-fective answers for contemporary problems. Literally, they are where thecommunity and college meet.These institutions arc sensitive to community needs. They are stable, yethave the resiliency to react quickly to changing educational needs in a rapidlychanging world.The Coordinating Board, Texas College University System, soon after itscreation in the midsixties, foresaw the upcoming importance of these institu-tions. The board divided the state into 53 Junior College Regions; there are 48publicly supported two-year colleges in Texas.Ten years ago, only one in ten college-bound high school graduates en-rolled for rxmtseconclary study in junior colleges. By the fall of 1971, more thanhalf of Texas's college freshmen and sophomores were in these two-year col-leges. The Texas statewide system is now one of the largest in the UnitedStates. These are open-door institutions, available to all persons. 95 96 One important aspect of this new approach is the ever changing role ofphysical education in the \"now\" college. In order to understand this new rolebetter, let us look at the underlying philosophy of physical education in a\"now\" college.The philosophy of the Division of Health, Physical Education, and Recre-ation on the Northeast Campus of Tarrant County Junior College is uniquenot only in course offerings but in approach to educational experiences for thestudents. Our philosophy is based upon (I) the extension of life through ahealth-fitness course (Health Concepts), (2) the preservation of life through be-ginning and survival swimming and the Medical Self Help Program, and (3)the enjoyment of life through a lifetime sports and recreation program.EXTENSION OF LIFEIn our philosophy, the extension of life is the most important concept. Notonly students, but faculty and staff as well, can benefit from Health Conceptsbecause of its emphasis on preventive medicine. This course is based on thepredication that everyone wants to live longer. People can live a long, usefullife without ever hitting a golf ball, but the) cannot live a long, healthy lifewithout a good heart, good lungs, and a good circulatory system. Heart diseaseis the number-one killer in America today. We provide scientific facts about theneed for exercise and then illustrate what exercise will do physiologically andanatomically. We aid our students by providing techniques by which they canmeasure their own CVR efficiency and other fitness levels. A skinfold caliper,for example, measures fat content; the Harvard Step Test and the Cooper 12-minute test determine cardiovascular efficiency. Other evaluations indicate flex-ibility and strength, We then prescribe exercise programs for the student thatwill develop, maintain, andior improve his fitness level.In order to make this course available to the student's convenience and tai-lored to his particular learning pace, we have completely packaged it in twodifferent formats, a written package and an audio-tutorial slide-tape pre-sentation. This course is offered at a regular class time and also on a to-be-ar-ranged basis. Many police officers, pilots, and other professional people havefound this course to be very suitable because they may work at their ownconvenience.Another innovation within our division is student contracting. After theyhave had Health Concepts and evaluated their fitness levels, many students liketo continue, since they realize that consistency is the important key to fitness.We draw up contracts with the students on an arranged basis. They can workout anywhere they wantat a local school, at home, or in our facilities. Theteacher is a learning manager or a resource person whose primary function iscounseling students. The student lists what his personal objectives are and mayreevaluate those goals periodically to decide upon realistic ones.PRESERVATION OF LIFEWe consider our aquatics program second in importance in our program.Since Texas had 516 deaths attributed to drowning last year, our objective is toprovide survival and other swimming skills to as many persons as possible.With an inth)or, eight-lane heated swimming pool, our program is excellent. Inaddition to regular college students, we have about 1,000 children who learn toswim each summer in the Community Service Program. Our Medical Self HelpProgram also makes an important contribution to this area.9G 97 ENJOYMENT OF LIFEOur lifetime sports program includes such courses as badminton, tennis,golf, archery, and scuba diving. These are activities that people can continue toparticipate in throughout life. Our courses at TCJC, Northeast Campus, areunique in that all are coeducational, contrary to the practice of most collegesand universities. Society is coeducational; consequently, our curriculum isbased on that reality.Our approach to teaching lifetime sports is nontraditional. For example,the student's time is not wasted in the classroom, going over rules, terminology,scoring, etc., which ultimately have to be learned individually; these are taughtin educational packages, thus allowing more time for practicing the actual ac-tivity. For example, the decompression charts in our scuba classes are all pack-aged for individualized learning.In addition to the on-campus courses outlined above, we have some off-campus courses, which include horsemanship, canoeing, bowling, and rollerskating. For bowling and roller skating, we have negotiated with public facili-ties. Our classes are scheduled around their regular hours.In order to offer horsemanship to our students, we utilize the riding facili-ties at a local riding stable. Via television equipment, we recorded all horse-manship lectures, edited them, and wrote educational packages to supplementthe tapes. Students view the tapes and complete the educational packages thatcomplement these tapes. The students spend two Saturdays at the stables, wherethey receive professional instruction and actually handle the horses.A similar course is canoeing. We made video tapes of canoeing techniqueswith the cooperation of the American Red Cross. We also have written pack-ages that complement these tapes. The students spend ten hours in our swim-ming pool practicing their canoeing strokes. In addition, they spend a weekendon the Brazos River or at Lake Benbrook for the laboratory experience.Our department is also offering contracting in the area of lifetime sports.Many students, because of scheduling problems, are unable to take. the activitycourses they need. These students may sign up for lifetime sports contracting.We have contracts available in tennis, bowling, golf, and canoeing. In addition,if the student is interested in a different activity, we will draw up a contract forthat activity, providing we have enough supplementary materials. There are afew activities, such as team sports, which do not lend themselves to a con-tracting format, but since we do not teach team sports, this is no problem.After the activity is selected, the instructor makes available information inthe form of workbooks, handouts, media presentations, and individual meet-ings. The student is given a skills pretest to determine his beginning skill level.Then he is free to master the course objectives using the materials made avail-able. The student may ako choose to learn his skills off campussay, golf ortennis from a prowhile still receiving college credit. Through the contractingcourse, it may be possible for a student to receive credit in many areas notavailable on campus, such as snow skiing, sailing, or any activity in which spe-cific criteria can be met.Other courses utilizing individualized materials are archery, fencing, bad-minton,bowling, and tennis. In order to make the multimedia kits that gowith these packages more accessible to students, we have added in the gym alearning center with 25 carrels. This enables usage of a variety of instructionaltechniques. The lab is open at all hours the campus is in operation, thus en-abling students to drop in at their convenience.97 98 In physical education vety few colleges offer credit by examination, but ithas been available for some time within our division. There are students whocome to us who already possess the skills taught in our classes, but in order tomeet graduation requirements or catalog requirements, they need college credit.Rather than make them retake tennis, bowling, or whatever, we offer them asystem of credit by examination. The interested student is given a course syl-labus to see what the course involves and if after reading it he thinks he is com-petent in that area, he may then take the skills and knowledge tests. If he scores80 percent or,above, he is given a grade.So far we have talked about the academic program, but to increase contactwith the student body at large and the community we have a recreation pro-gram that includes community services.In order to give the student an opportunity to use the skills he learns inour academic classes, and in keeping with our philosophy of enjoyment of life,the Tan-ant County Junior College, Northeast Campus, HPER division has de-veloped the Recreation Department to meet the needs, interests, and demands of\"now\" college students and staff and of our community.Recreational services provided by the Recreation Department are (1) an in-tramuntl program for men, (2) an intramural program for women, (3) coed in-trarnurals, (4) extramural club participation, (5) a studen.t recreation program,and (6) community services, a continuing education noncredit- program for thecommunity.Participants in the various recreational service programs-come from aca-demic classes where students have the opportunity to implement interests andskills in various activities on a competitive basis or in a recreational setting.The men's, women's, and coed intramural programs in conjunction withan extramural program provide the students an opportunity to participate on acompetitive basis against other students enrolled at TCJC-NE and other areacolleges and universities. Activities include team sports, such as flag football,basketball, three-man basketball, volleyball, and softball, and individual-dualsports, such as golf, tennis, badminton, bowling, pass-punt-kick contests, free-throw contests, table tennis, cross-country, archery, weight lifting, fencing,spaceball, and other activities in -response to student interest and needs.The extramural program is an extension of the intramural programs,-withintramural championship teams or individual champions competing with otherintramural champions from junior and senior colleges in our geographic re-gion. In 1971 and 1972, the men's intramural basketball championship teamwon the state extramural basketball championship against senior colleges andjunior colleges in our area. In 1974 our women's basketball team won the statechampionship and participated in the national AAU tournament in Gallup,New Mexico.Sports clubs are another recreational service provided for students with spe-cific needs and interests. HPER staff members provide supervision and assist inorganizing activities for the different clubs. Student interest determines sportsclubs that will be organized, and the number and types of clubs that are activevary from year to year.One of the most popular recreational programs provides students and fac-ulty with the opportunity to utilize our facilities and equipment under HPERstaff and supervision. At the present time we are open five days a week for stu-dent recreation. Students and faculty-staff may check out equipment with their11) cards or utilize facilities in a recreational setting during their leisure or freetime. Our equipment and facilities are available to recreational service pro-93 99 grams from 7:30 a.m. to 1(1:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 7:30a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays. Academic classes have priority in using facilities andequipment, but when a facility is not used for classes, it is available for recre-ational service programs. Equipment available to student and staff includes bas-ketballs; volleyballs; footballs; tennis, golf, gloves; such as bicycles and exergenies. HPER facilities include onelarge gymnasium, a weight room, an indoor swimming pool, sauna baths,gymnastic areas, a combative area, trampolines, a spaceball area, and six hand-ball courts. Outdoor facilities include tennis courts, horseshoe pits, a seven-hole.golf course with artificial greens, and jogging-cycling trails.Students not enrolled in physical education classes have the opportunity toparticipate in the various recreational programs, and community needs and in-terests are met by a variety of community-service continuing-education classesand programs. The HPER continuing education classes and activities are non-credit classes or supervised recreational activities. During the past two years wehave averaged 2,500 participants-in our continuing education program. Classesand activities offered under contfoluing education include a family recreationprogram similar to the student recreation program in which the communitypays a fee and utilizes our facilities and equipment in a recreational setting.The program is for one college semester. In 1972-73 (fall, spring, and summersessions), 1,105 people participated in the family recreation program. Youthand adult swimming is another program that has been very successful. In 1972-73, 770 students enrolled in the swimming program. Othercontinuing edu-cation Classes include figure control, golf, tennis, gymnastics-trampoline, yoga,scuba diving, jujitsu, self-defense for women, and a family fitness program.The Division of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation is an integralpart of the \"now\" college. The division provides a variety of activities to meetthe needs and interests of its diverse clientele. Individuals have the opportunityto learn skills in the academic or continuing education programs and imple-ment these skills on a competitive basis or within a recreational setting. Tar-.rant County Junior College, Northeast Campus, is one of the many \"now\"colleges. WOMEN IN SPORTS: CROSS-NATIONAL COMPARISONSOF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND BODY IMAGEELDON E. SNYDERJOSEPH E. KIVLINBowling Green State UniversityEvery society prescribes legitimized role expectations according to gender (seereference 3 for, a critique of gender roles). Such expectations raise noteworthytheoretical propositions concerning \"variations from group to group and fromtime to time, their interrelations, the extent to which encumbents [sic] of partic-ular positions actually conform to or deviate from them, and the like. \"\" Oneaspect of role performance is to consider the role expectations in one area of be- (.11.71. 100 havior and the degree of \u00abmipatibility of expectations in another segment ofone's life space. fate conflicl (more spec ifically interrole conflict) is the termused to denote a situation when the incumbent occupies two or more roles si-multaneously with conflicting role expectations.\" 23 An individual exposed torole conflict tiinnot behave consistently with both sets of prescriptions at thesame time.'In the Unitecl States the role expectations of woman and athlete have tradi-tionally been contradictory. flan points out, The woman who wishes to par-ticipate in sports and remain 'womanly' faces great stress. By choosing sportshe usually places herself outside the socia! mainstream.\" The history of phys-ical education for girls and women has emphasized light exercises and rhythmicdancing rather than competitive sports.2 8 In a recent study Brovennan et al. re-port the behavioral traits a group of clinical psychologists feel characterize ahealthy adult femaleshe is dependent, emotional, intuitive, and passive.6However, the traits desirable for athletic participationaggressiveness, tough-mindedness, dominance, self-confidence, and risk takingare usually associatedwith males rather than females.\"Further specification of the social expectations associated with the womanathlete roles has been outlined by Metheny.\" She notes that athletic com-petition for women varies with the activity. Least acceptable physical activities,and thus the greatest likelihood of role conflict, include body contact, applica-tion of force to a heavy object, projecting the body through space over long dis-tances; and face -to -face competition. Conversely, the most acceptable forms ofcompetition include presentation of the txxly in esthetically pleasing patterns,use of a manufactured device to facilitate bodily movement, utilization of alight implement, and maintenance of a spatial barrier with the opponent. Em-pirical findings generally support Metheny's conclusions regarding variationsin social acceptability of sports for women.\" 21 Recent research by Malumphylikewise indicates variations and inconsistencies among woman athletes them-selves regarding the effect of participation in sports on their feminine image.15Some women in this study feel that athletic participation enhances their femi-nine image.The importance of role conflict is evident when the potential effects areconsidered, If the individual has internalized two contradictory prescriptions,we might anticipate behavioral and attitudinal ambiguity, confusion, and anx-iety.' Parsons points out that exposure to role conflict is likely to create a situ-ation that is incompatible with a harmonious integration of personality.20 Amajor focus of the present paper is on an analysis of degrees of athletic par-ticipation by women and the dependent variables of psychological well-beingand body image. Specifically, if woman athletes experience role conflict, its concomitant effects are likely to be reflected in these aspects of self-identity.Furthermore, from the literature on variations in the type of physical activityacceptable to women, we might expect that the type of sport involvement willshow corresponding differences in psychological well-being and body image.The deixdent variables, (I) psychological well-being and (2) body image,have long research traditions and are considered reliable indicators of feelingstoward one's self. The measures of psychological well-being follow a researchtradition from the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan.2 22The specific items dealing with aspects of psychological well-being tap feelingsof contentment, life satisfaction, and happiness.\" 1;) 0 101 Since :ithletup.11111 ipation is a physical activity and ix)dy appearance islikely to be a major factor in the female identity, we used body image as thesecond dependent variable. Marcia and Friedman indicate that the body struc-ture is particularly imixmant in the ego-identity of women.' Secord and Jour-ard point out that \"the individual's attitudes toward his body are of crucial im-portance to any comprehensive theory of personality. ... \"29 Additionally, studies of body image show positive correlations with self-esteem and self -con- cept' 28 29 31 and negative correlations with anxiety and insecurity .29 We used amodification of the Second and Jourard scale that was used in most of the stud-ies of biidy image cited.16A particular level of analysis in this study is the presentation of cross-na-tional data collected in India, Australia, and the United States. Glaser andStrauss have noted the advantage of comparative data in determining the struc-tural boundaries and generality of social facts.'' Comparative data also provide a means for independent checking and validation of initial facts. In short, wewill be interested in determining the consistency of our findings when exam- ined from a cross-national perspective for purtxmes of theory clarification andconstrue lion.MF:11101)Thedata for this study were collected by means of a self-administered ques- tionnaire. One sample of respondents consisted of women athletes in the Unit-ed States who participated in the 1972 Women's National Intercollegiate Chant-picmships in basketball, gymnastics, swimming and diving, and track and field,or who had participated in the 1972 Olympic tryouts in gymnastics. The pur-pose of selecting respondents from these four sports was to get a variety of re-spondents from sports that seem to differ in the degree of social acceptabilityfor women. The number and tiercentage of respcmdents were highest for basket-ball players (N=I20) and gymnasts (N=116). Because the swimming and divingand track and field c hampionships were held late in the school year, the timewas limited for suturing addresses and mailing. As a result, the number of re-spondents from these sports was less (swimming and diving, N=60; track andfield, N=32). These women were deeply involved in their athletic roles andmight represent the epitome of the stereotyped woman athlete. Separate dataanalysis was made of the entire sample of athletes and the two subsamples ofbasketball players and gymnasts.'''A second sample of American college women was gathered from studentsenrolled in general sociology classes at Bowling Green State University in Ohio(;sl,275). 1.111' rootof these c lasses approximated a cross section of col-lege women at this institution. Bowling Green is similar to many tnedimn-sizedstateuniversitiesinthe United States. For comparative analysis these re-spondents were dichotomized into high and low participants in sports, but itwas coincidental if any of the high participants were competing at the nationallevel, as were Mt. respomlents in the woman athlete sample.Two additional samples of respondents were secured from university wom-en in Australia and India. '['he Australian women constitute a sample (N=252)including most of the female students taking courses in physical education at a teachers college in western Australia in the spring of 1973. Since physical edu-cation is compulsory for all students at the college, this sample closely approxi-mates a cross section of woman students enrolled there. Separate analyses weremade of the high and low participants in sports.1jI 102 \"The Indian women were enrolled in lower-level courses in psychology in amajor south\u00abmtral Indian university in the winter of 1973. The upper-level stu-dents were studying for examinations at the time the questionnaire was admin-istered, so they were unavailable as respondents. The administrator of the ques-tionaires was an experienced researcher and reported no other particular biasin the sample. The Indian sample was identified as representative of collegestudents from that region of India.\" The Australian and Indian samples werealso divided into high and low sports panic ipants.Empirical (Jilting 1.i/inns were used with these samples to dichotomizethem into high and low spot ts participation.\" Thus, we have three levels of in-volvement in sports by the American women, the national intercollegiate com-petitors and the high and low participants at Bowling Green State University,and two levels of involvement (high and low participants) of Australian and In-dian university students. These samples include sufficient variations to explorerelationships between our primary independent variable (involvement in sportby women) and the selected dependent variables. Additionally, the cross-nation-al analyses provide a testing ground to explore the generality of findings inseveral social settings.FINDINGSOne of the stereotypes of woman athletes is that they tend to be \"Ama-zons.\" If this is true, comparisons of woman athletes and nonathletes on the de-pendent variables of psychological well-being and body image may reflect thedifferences in physique. Data presented in Table I do not support this stereo-type. Comparisons of the high and low participants within all three samples ofstudents are very similar. When the height and weight of the woman athletesare analyzed, their average weight is slightly more than the other Americansample; however, they are also slightly taller. Among the woman athletes, asmight Ix expected in tight of the emphasis of their sport, the woman gymnasts'weight is least in relation to their height. While these data do not tell us any-thing alxmt the perceived attractiveness of the women, they suggest that theheight and weight ratio is not a likely explanation for differences on the mea-sures of psychological well-being or body image.TABLE 1Height and Weight Comparisons of Woman Students Mean HeightMean Weight (lbs.)All woman athletes 5 ft. 6 in. 129Basketball 5 ft. 7 in. 136 Gymnasts 5 ft. 5 in. 116 American studentsHigh participationin sports activities 5 ft. 5 in.126Low participationin sports activities 5 ft. 5 in 125102 103 Mean HeightMean Weight (lbs.)Australian studentsHigh participationin sports activities 5 ft. 5 in. 122Low participationin sports activities 5 ft. 5 in. 121 Indian studentsHigh participationin sports activities 5 ft.1 in.112 Low participationin sports activities 5 ft. 0 in. 101Table 2 presents data on the samples and subsamples and the three dimen-sions of psychological well-being. The data generally indicate that par- ticipation in athletics is not associated with a negative affect. When comparingthe high and low participants in all .three samples of university students thewomen who are high participants demonstrate positive attitudes toward life.The one exception to these findings is evident in the sample of Indian students.However, in this sample two of the three dimensions support the conclusionthat athletic participation is associated with a positive psychological well-be-ing. A comparison of the woman athletes and the American subsample of highparticipants indicates they have a similar outlOok on life. With all three mea-sures of psychological well-being the gymnasts show more positive attitudesthan the basketball subsample. Yet by all measures, the basketball players dem-onstrate more positive responses than the low participants. In short, our ex-pectation of a negative relationship between athletic participation and psycho-logical well-being was not supported.TABLE 2Psychological Well-Being Responses of Woman Studentsby Type and Extent of Participation in Sports Activites SatisfiedHappiness Basketball American insports insports activities 619640'13Low participation insports activities 31523223Table 3 displays items measuring attitudes toward various parts or pro-cesses of one's body.\" The ranking of items in the table is based on the left col-umn, which is the entire sample of woman athletes. It is interesting to note,however, that the ranking of items from one sample of respondents is approxi-mately the same across all four samples of students. When comparing the re-sponses of woman athletes with the sample of American students the findingsdo not support the expectations of the athletes' having negative feelings towardtheir bodies. On the contrary, the general pattern of responses suggests that ath-letic participation is positively associated with body image. This generalizationis apparent when comparing the athletes and the American students. It is like-wise true on most items when comparing the high and low participation sub-saniples within the American student sample. Additionally, this conclusion isevident in the majority of the items marked positively in the Australian and In-dian samples. These findings raise serious questions about the assumption thatathletic participation by women is likely to lead to negative images ofthemselves.TABLE 3Percent Positive Body Image Responses of Woman Students byType and Extent of Participation in Sports Activites reflected in Table 3 is that athletic participation isassociated with a positive body imageacross all three nationalities. When theresponses by gymnasts and basketball players to the body image items are ana-lyzed, however, the differences between the sports do not reveal consistent differ-ences. These data in Table 3 suggest that the body image items are measuring adifferent dimension of self - attitudes than the three measures of psychologicalwell-being in Table 2. We expected that there would be differences in body im-age between the gymnasts arid basketball players that would reflect in morepositive body images by the gymnasts. Since this was not apparent, it may bethat even with greater public acceptance of the more esthetically pleasing gym-nastics performances, and the probable reflection of this acceptance in perceivedwell-being, both groups of athletes view their bodies in relation to the way theyuse them in their chosen sports. Or, perhaps, their physical expression throughsport promotes positive body-cathexis regardless of the social acceptability ofthe sport.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSThe findings presented in this study raise serious doubts about the stereo-types of the woman athlete. Our data do not indicate that she is likely to be an\"Amazon.\" Furthermore, the assumptions of the woman athlete roles resultingin negative self-attitudes are not supported. The findings comparing the psy-chological well-being of basketball players and gymnasts do suggest that differ-ences in the type and social acceptability of physical activity are variables thatshould be analyzed. However, these variables were not important in the con-comitant body image items.While the findings of this paper are exploratory, their consistency and thesimilarities noted from the cross-national data lend considerable support andcredence to them. There are several tentative explanations for the positive re-lationships displayed between aspects of self-identity and athletic participation..Apparently, even though woman athletes have frequently received negativesanctions, their participation in sports has been sufficiently rewarding to coun-ter the social costs and tensions associated with the conflicting roles. It mightbe argued that for the woman athlete the athletic role is of primary salience andshe does not seriously embrace her feminine role, i.e., she plays the latter rolewith detachment and little personal involvement.\" This conclusion, however, is1 5 106 not supported by additional data collected on the samples that show the wom-an athletes measure as high on questionnaire items dealing with femininity asthe nonathletes.42 Another possible explanation is'ihat many female athletes are sufficiently st.:.urt in their femininity and they can participate in a socially de-fined unfeminine activity without suffering an identity crisis.12 54Would suggest also that our society is moving toward a broadening ofthe sex roles. There is less agreement in defining the male and female rolesthan in the past. When alternative roles are open to women, they have in-creased freedom of choice (and responsibility) and \"those women who have de-veloped an independent sense of self and positive self-esteem will be able toelect their roles and enjoy their freedom of choice.\"' In this sense, the increasedfreedom to select alternative courses of action may be initially stressful; yet thissocial situation is likely to be the prelude to a redefinition of appropriate be-havior. Perhaps social change has already advanced to the state where the sexroles are less sharply differentiated and more symmetrical (see reference 14, p.659). Thus, there is the need to redefine the probable consequences of athleticparticipation for females. Several studies have cited significant differences be-tween athletes and nonathletes; however, most of this research has stressed thei)ositave aspec is of participation for males. 24 25 26 27 30 31 According to the find-ings of the present study, we would anticipate that with an increased accumu-lation of research on female participation the positive consequences will be- come more evident. Furthermore, the cross-national data presented wouldsuggest that this conclusion is not peculiar to the American society.REFERENCES1.

STEVENSONUniversityofNew BrunswickA belief in socialization is the cornerstone of education. It is the essential ratio-nale upon which rest our programs in physical education and athletics. Thisbelief, however, presents us with a problem. We experience great difficulty indemenstrating the actual existence of socialization effects in schools, in col-legrs, and in programs of physical education and athletics.3 8 9 19 12 It might bethen, on the one hand, that, contrary to the belief, socialization does not occurin such educational institutions and programs. On the other hand, of course, itmight be our research methodology at fault. Thus, we might argue that social-ization does occur and itis simply that our research techniques are insuf-ficiently refined to detect it. There is, however, a third alternative; perhaps we108 109 are using an inappropriate theoretical model of socialization. Admittedly this isa rather unusual approach to the problem, but as I read the literature in the so-cial sciences I find myself, like Alice's Queen of hearts, believing sometimes siximpossible things before breakfast.Perhaps we in education, physical education, and athletics are indeed us-ing an inappropriate titcxlel of socialization. The model that we typically use Icall theinteractionmodel of socialization. This is a model that was developedin order to explain the socialization of the child in the family. It was developedessentially from various psychological considerations of the family vis-a-vischild development. I have some difficulty in believing that the situation in theschool, in the college, in the physical education program, and in the athleticprogram is sufficiently analogous to that existing in the family to permit theuse of this model.What then are the alternatives? There do exist, in fact, a number of non-interactionist concepts of socialization, that is to say, concepts of socializationin which the source of socialization effects is not located in interpersonal inter-actions but rather isexternalto such interactions.I would like to offer youthree such concepts of socialization. (I should note that this is by no means aninclusive list of noninteraction concepts.)-First, institutional socialization is aconcept in which socialization effects occur as a consequence of the structuralconnections between the socializing institutions and given positions in the oc-cupational and social structure.' 5 6 \" An example of this is the professional so-cialization of medical students, which is dependent upon the structural linkageslxtween medical school and the occupational and social position of doctor. Asecond concept is cultural compression, a concept from cultural anthropologythat refers to the very rapid and often quite massive socialization that occurs asa result ofrites de passage.' \"Third, there is the notion of labeling often re- ferred to in deviancy and criminology. I14 This is a concept in which social-ization occurs as a consequence of an externally applied social label.Three very diverse concepts of socialization, yet it is possible, I think, togeneralize from them. It is 13ossible to argue perhaps that these three conceptsare examples of a more general concept of symbolic socialization,which, I sug-gest, cxcurs as a consequence of a symbolic act, an act in which a person issymbolically identified as occupying a particular social role. Such a symbolicact would be an initiation rite, for example, upon the completion of which achild becomes a man. Other examples might be the final PhD oral, uponwhich one moves symbolically from graduate student to professional, or thejury's decision of guilty whereby a citizen becomes symbolically transformedinto a thief, a rapist, ora murderer.'Hie suggestion is being made here that socialization effects occur as a con-sequence of such symbolic acts. Behavioral changes, attitudinal changes, andeven personality changes occur as a result of symbolic acts. A person who issymbolically identified as a particular social role becomes that role; he takes onthe characteristics of that role and fulfills the interaction expectations that sur-round it, Ile is a man; he is a doctor of philosophy; he is a thief, a rapist, or amurderer.Let ine say here that I recognize the possible importance of interaction as areinforcement mechanism of such socialization. I would suggest, however, .thatinteraction is simply that, a mechanism for reinforcement that can operate onlyafter a symbolic ac t of identification and within the limits set by that act. Iwould suggest furthermore that interaction is important only in inverse relationto the power of the symbolic act. By this I mean that where the symbolic act. is 19 110 powerful, where the ac tor takes on the given social role automatically and with-out question, then interaction reinforcement is unnecessary. The interactionmechanism can play a part, however, when the symbolic act is somewhat lesspowerful, where the taking on of the social role is somewhat uncertain andwhere the socialization is less complete.Let us consider now the power of the symbolic act. I would like to offerthree sets of variables that affect the power of the symbolic act. One set of vari-ables revolves around the issue of legitimacy. Thus, symbolic power is de-pendent upon (I) the degree of legitimacy of the symbolic act in the culture inwhich it occurs, (2) the degree of legitimacy of the conferer of the symbolic' act,and (3) the degree of legitimacy of the social role conferred by the symbolic act.Put simply, the greater the legitimacy, the greater the power of the symbolic actand the more effective and complete the symbolic socialization.A second set of variables is concerned with value. Thus, symbolic power isdependent upon (I) the perceived value of the social role in the culture inwhich the symbolic act occurs and (2) the perceived value of the social role tothe socializer. Here also the greater the value, the greater the power of the sym-bolic ac t and the more effective and complete the symbolic socialization.The third set of variables concerns cultural understanding. Thus, symbolicpower is dependent upon (I) the degree to which an understanding of the sym-bolism involved in the act pervades the culture in which the act occurs (i.e.,what the ae t means) and (2) the degree to which an understanding of the socialrole conferred by the symbolic act pervades the culture (i.e., the nature of therole, the set. of expectations assox kited with it, its value, and so on). Once more,the greater the cultural understanding, the greater the power of the symbolic actand the more effective and complete the symbolic socialization.What, you might ask, has all this to do with physical education and athlet-ics? Well, throughout their tenure with us we confront participants with manysymbolic acts. Many of these acts are, of course, of negligible symbolic power,but a few are quite significant. The process of selection of an athletic team isrife with significant symbolic acts. The boy who is selected for his junior highschool basketball team is symbolically identified as an athlete, the boy who iscut from the team is symbolically identified as not an athlete. The concept ofsymbolic socialization suggeSts that any socialization differences that may occurbetween these two boys occur primarily as a consequence of the symbolic act ofrole identificationaihleteand not because of differences in interactionexperiences.Perhaps, then, by employing this concept of socialization we may he ableto understand better what is happening symbolically around us in education,physical education, and athletics. On the other hand, of course, it may simplyhe one of the Queen of Hearts' impossible things; unless you have had one ofher tarts for breakfast.REFERENCESI. H.S.

HATFIELDBowie State CollegeIt has been some years now since J.P. Scott delivered his address on sport andaggression to the Second International Congress of Sport Psychology.' It repre-sented very nearly the sum total of what was then known, or speculated about,regarding the occurrence of violence in sport. Strangely, however, no referenceswere made to any systematic studies that directly involved sport as a variable. Infact, none of the other delegates made reference to such studies except Laymanwho made reference to four studies, all of which were done over a decade ear-lier.2 A search of the literature subsequently revealed that with the exception ofa few discursive comments on sport and violence, there simply was no workdone in the area.In order not to belabor the issue, it is perfectly admissible that much un-derstanding was, and is, gleaned from the nonsport literature on aggression.The addresses of Scott and Layman appeared to be the spark needed to ignitethe interests of sport-oriented scientists from many disciplines in the applica-tion of existing theories and models of aggressive behavior in sport contexts. Inthe six years following the Washington, D.C., congress, well over thirty note-worthy works have appeared that center specifically on sport-related aggression.A great majority of these deal directly with the proposals and ideas forwardedby Scott and Layman.This paper is concerned with the research and other writings that involvespon arid aggression. Naturally enough, however, research findings not specifi-cally related to sport contexts are considered when appropriate. The paper is di-vided into five bask parts: (I) innate propensity, (2) psychological stress, (3)physical or verbal attack, (4) in-group/out-group competition, and (5) social-ization. Much overlap, however, occurs between the parts with regard to their111 112 conceptual frameworks and related research. This is unavoidable but under-standable in light of the tremendously complex nature of the problem. No sin-gle scheme or model can explain sport violence. Taken together, however, theyoffer much in the way of understanding about the phenomenon.INNATE PROPENSITYBy now, everyone has heard reference made to the theory that violence inman is an innate characteristic.. The most noteworthy proponents of this notionare found among psychoanalysts, who through case studies and animal obser-vation have come to believe that human aggression is resultant of pent-up in-ternal energy discharge. Not so noteworthy, from a purely scientific point ofview, arc the claims of such ethologists as Lorene and Ardrey' who, like thepsychoanalysts, make unsubstantiable leaps from animal to human behavior.Sport theorists and scientists have had little supportive to say about the rel-evance or tenability of instinct theory in explaining or predicting sport vio-lence. A noteworthy exception is the position taken by Tandy and Laflin, whobuild what appears to be an historical argument for the instinct theory. Theypropose that although the aggressive instinct may still exist in man, we need tolearn how to alleviate it through positive methods, such as engaging in com-petitive sport. They conclude their statement by saying that it really doesn'tmake any difference whether violence is instinctual or learnedwhat does makea difference is that the role of sport in the development of the American charac-ter be further scrutinized, since sport will continue to influence Americansociety.5Most usually the argument against the instinct theory is that since there isan alleged accumulated drive toward aggressiveness, it would follow that thedischarge of that aggressiveness (through direct sport participation or throughvicarious catharsis) would tend to make that person more docile thereafter.This, most often, has not been found to be the case. Layman sums up this as-pert of the literature appearing prior to 1968 quite well:Controlled studies [i.e., Ilusman6; Johnson and limionl; Lemkaus; Slone]indicate that when aggression occurs in the presence of anger there is a de-(ream.. in the level of anger and a decrease in the tendency to aggress for ashort period. Also, unless the individual has feelings of guilt because of theaggressive act, there will be a reduction of tension and improved feeling ofwell-being. However, when aggression occurs in the absence of anger, thereis an increase in the tendency to aggress, unless the tendency to aggress isweakened by guilt or anxiety. Thus, reactive aggression in general supportsthe catharsis hytxuhesis but instrumental aggression does not (p. 29).2On a more recent level, Goldstein and Anns'\u00b0 reject the theory of catharsiswhen applied to spectators. They measured pre- and postgame hostility amongfootball fans and found that regardless of who won or lost, postgame hostilitywas greater than pregame hostility. No such increase was noted among spec-tators at a gymnastic meeta noncontact sport. This, note Goldstein and Arms,is directly contradictory to the catharsis hypothesis and in fact supports the so-cial-learning theory that watching aggression will strengthen or increase one'sown level of aggression.\"'Despite such contradictory evidence, the catharsis hypothesis still incites re-search efforts. The apparent attractiveness seems to be due to the .fact that insome instances it seems applicable, and the amount of sport-related !iteratureindicating otherwise is scant.112 113 Other notewot thy comments on the innate nature of man's aggressivenessin sport can be found in the writings of Smith\" and Dunning,12 as well as in amyriad of paperbacks written by athletes, philosophers, and others. Most re-sponsible theorists have not disregarded the instinct theory as completelyinvalid. Their reluctance to do so apparently stems from the few studies sup-portiv of the catharsis hypothesis, as well as the often maddening untestabilityof certain precepts couched in Freudian and neo-reudian thought. Further, ap-plying what little insight that has been afforded by laboratory research to areal-life setting has proved frustrating as a result of contamination effects.Perhaps the most one can hope for with regard to the instinct theory of ag-gression is to realize that irrespective. of one's decision of acceptance or rejec-tion, environmental and social sources loom as vastly more important in expli-catig the full impact of man's aggressiveness on his sport pursuit or inexplicating the full impact of man's sport pursuit on his level of aggressiveness.PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS'f'he frustration aggression hypothesis, originally formulated by Dollardand his associates, has been the primary backdrop for most of the general re-search clone in aggression.\" Since its origin, the frustration/aggression hypoth-esis has been rtitxlified to account for more and more exigencies. There arethose, Smith most notably, who have relegated the importance of this hypothe-sis in sport-related violence to a minor plateau. Smith explains this position asresultant of its relative inapplicabilitythat is. most violence committed in,,Port is \"instrumental\" insofar as extrinsic rewards are the motivating force: .much of the violence in sport scents to be of this type [instrumental]; vi-olent c is done in order to attain social rewards (such as the respect or ap-proval of others) and as an aid to winning.Although frustration and anger are not necessarily present, the latterstate secins often to be induced, perhaps, to justify the aggression.\"As an alternative to this hypothesized inducement theory, however, it seemsjust as reasonable that while violence is often used as a strategy in winning,such strategic use of violence may have become the dominant choice of behav-ior as a result of previous frustrating experiences. The act of violence, in suchan instance, was perpetrated after the frustration and subsequent anger, butonly upon recognition of an appropriate cuethat cue being the opportunityto have the at appear as though it was done as a means of winning or socialapproval.\" Tlw notion that anger can he brought on after the fact appears tohi at odds with prevalent theory. which states that the state of anger may onlybe achieved if frustration precedes it. 14 It seems possible, therefore, that the in-ducement of anger to which Smith makes mention is not really inducement atall, but rather a redirection of anger brought about by previous frustration.The point of this foregoing line of reasoning is that while much of the vi-olence in sport is of the instrumental type, much too is very likely to be of thereactive type in which frustration and subsequent anger are involved. The factthat any subsequent violence is instrumental in nature may be purelycoincidental.Layman has contributed to this area of concern also. She observes thatcompetition itself is an agent of frustration for the loser, who may be angeredat having lost, and for the winner, who may have been angered at the loser's at-tempts to block his goal.2 This situation has manifested itself quite oftenamong spectators and players alike.113 114 There are othet ps%c hologic al considerations besides frustration that need to be accounted for. Or example, various psychological characteristics appear to he instrumental in allowing or predisposing an athlete (or team).to violence. Hatfield observes that athletes who are more intolerant of. socially ambiguous situations are more apt to aggress than those who are tolerant of such situ- ations. Further, he observes that athletes who are intolerant of ambiguity tend to gravitate toward team sports, possibly as a strategy on their part to minimize through cohesive :u tion or by diffusion of responsibility the personal effects of inherent in-group and out-group sources of ambiguity.\" Small wonder, then, that more violence is observed in team as opposed to coactive or individual Sports.It must be concluded that before the frustration aggression hypothesis is discarded as minimally important or before psychological characteriStics of ath- letes are overlooked as unfruitful sources of information on sport violence, re- search is needed. To date, most of what has been written about these areas is conjecture based on research or speculation that does not involve sport as a variable.PHYSICAL AND VERBAL ATTACKAlthough related to frustration aggression literature, physical and verbal attack situations are common enough in sport to warrant separate discussion. Greenwell and Dengerink find that aggression is influenced not only by the ac- -Mal severity of physical attack but also by the attacked individual's belief about its harshness. This belief, it seems, is intensified if the attacked individual per- ceives that he is in a competitive situation.\" These findings indicate that inter- pretation of the situation is an important consideration in interpreting aggression.Verbal attack also appears to have the potential of eliciting aggressive re- sponses. Gum distinguishes between verbal attack and frustration. He'describesthem both as having the capacity to elicit anger and thus aggression.\" Gentry also makes such a distinction.\" Both Gem and Gentry observe that verbal at- tack provokes more aggression than did frustration.As was the case with the general areas involving the instinct question andthe psychological stressors issues, little, if any, research has been carried out in this area that relates directly to a sport context. It is quite possible that an ath- lete engaged in sport would respond differently than would the average research subject either to pain (as in physical attack) or to disagreement, sarcasm, or negative appraisal (as in verbal attack). Again, as Greenwell and Dengerink point ota, interpretation of the situation is an important consideration in defining aggression.\"'IN-GROUP OUT-GROUP COMPETITIONInternatinnal sport competition has long been heralded as a means of in- creasing international good will and understanding. There have been many sit- uations that tend to contradict this belief. The 1961 Peru-Argentina soccer com- petition is one case in point. The riot that followed the game left 293 dead. Another example that contradicts this long-held belief occurred when, pre- sumably resultant of a border dispute between Honduras and El Salvador, riots followed all three World Cup soccer games between these two countries. These riots resulted in the eventual severing of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Such violence may be explained, at least in part by reviewing the lit- erature on intergroup conflict.114 115 Sport, by its very nature, has the capacity to evoke strong feelings of identi-fication among players and spec tators alike. These strong feelings of identi-fication lead to the formation of in-groups and out-groups. M. and C.W. Sherifnow that \"when groups engage in reciprocally competitive and frustrating ex-periences ... unfavorable stereotypes come into use in relation to the out-groupand its members\" (p. 10).19 Canying the Sherif observations a bit further, rela-tive to sport, strong feelings of identification can become heightened such thatethnocentric behavior is the result. As Heinila has pointed out, open conflict,or -violence. is more imminent in situations where such marked separation ofcompeting groups occurs. Further. Heinila states, \"the higher the expectationsof teams and of the public with respect to success, the more frustrated will the'in-group' be in case of failureand the higher the probability of unfair behav-ior and inter-group violence of some kind or another\" (p. 346).20There is another aspect of intergroup violence with regard to the cleavageof teams resulting from in-group and out-group feelings. Layman alludes tothe idea that modeling of the aggressive behavior of team leaders by other play-ers can occur more frequently if a team is cohesive.2 Team cohesiveness is aproduct of such behaviors traditionally associated with interpersonal attractionand group identification. Hatfield refers to this process also:... as the .social situation [i.e., sport contest] becomes too complex or in-soluble. or when the team is confronted with too many novel situations ...their strategy of friendliness no longer works in their favor. Disorganizationresults, causing an increased impersonality within the team plagued withsuch ambiguities.. ..the opposition, drawn even closer by their well-exe-cuted strategy Of cohesiveness, becomes even more distant front the teamcaught in the throes of social ineptitude. This \"distance,\" coupled withfrustration felt by the losing warn, is suggested to be a common inflam-matory factor supporting the occurrence of player violence in team sports(p. 5).,5Underlying much of the literature and research on in-group and out-groupaggression is the frustration-aggression hypothesis. It appears that frustration isbrought on more easily if a group effort is thwarted as opposed to an individu-ars.2o 21SOCIALIZATIONPerhaps more has been written on the socialization of young athletes intoviolence than any other aspect of sport violence. Most of what has been written,however, can Iw summed up in a single paragraph:The socialization into aggressive behavior involves reference being made tonormative groups, from which sanctions for violence are derived, and from rolemodels, which serve as a frame of reference for aggressive behavior. The aggres-sive behavior resulting from the socialization process is most often of the in-strumental type, which is carried out for reasons of social acceptance (by peergroups, role models, and,or reference groups) or as a strategy for winning,which has been legitimized by the sanctioning bodies involved. These sanc-tioning bodies are the perpetuators of laws, rules, mores, and values governingsuch behavior. The main problem with regard to legitimized violence and in-strumental violence is the fact that both lead to illegitimate violence all too of-ten. Further, over time there is a general increase in both amount and intensityof legitimized and instrumental violence. This problem is seen to be resultantof societal disorganization, or a breakdown in the effectiveness of the sanc-tioning bodies' control mechanisms.F; 116 Papeis on this genetal subj\u00ab t appear to be in close agreement with regardto the clv ninnies of the sot ialization process. Of considerable note are the papersby Vaz on cultural aspects of socialization,22 by Gary 'Smith on social disor-ganization,25 by Mike Smith on role theory as well as parental, peer, and coach-es' sanctions of assaultive behavior,\" 23 24 and by Scott' and Layman,' - whichappealed, as indicated earlier, to give the initial impetus to the flurry of re-seatc h and commentaries that followed.Because of the overwhelming importarne of the socialization issue, howev- . et, we cannot leave the topic with just an encapsuled statement. Following areexamples drawn from the literature that deal with three of the most pervasiveasjwc ts of the socialization issue: (1) sanctions, (2) modeling, and (3) social dis-otganization. Itis important to note that most proponents of the socializationthew), on aggression reject the notion that violence is innate,like Smith, in a convinc ing presentation of a role approach to sport vio-lence, concludes that \"sports are seen as social systems consisting of, in part,values, which legitimize aggression, norms which provide rules for the conductof aggression, and mechanisms by which individuals are mobilized into aggres-sive toles\" (p. 251.21 The mechanisms that Smith speaks of involve the social-ization process. Relefew e groups (specifically normative groups, comparativegroups, and audience groups) serve to articulate the athlete with the appropri-ate imlhanisms of socialization. Sundt notes a paradox that exists in hockeyand that speaks to the three issues noted earlier. He writes: \"official norms areviolated with impunity even though official negative' sanctions [time in thewataltv box] are attached, while unofficial, but apparently more obligatory, ag-gressive norms aleonfornred to rather closely\" (p. 23).24 'The norms to whichthe athletes conform anvolve role expectations provided by both the normativegroup and the Comparison group. The comparison group's function in this in-stall\u00ab. involves modeling behavior, as is seen in the modeling of an esteemedsuperstar or even the athlete's conjured up idea of what an aggressive player islike. That there arc situations in which advantages can be obtained althoughpenalties ate awarded is a commentary on the extent of \"disorganization be-c tinting prevalent in sport.Ac\u00abirding to Gar Smith, \"sport is a form of social organization, as op-posed to the soc ietal disorganization that is shown to breed violence. Because itis a fowl Of sot jai control, sport has the power to eradicate violence.\" GarySmith goes on to say that while football is inherently violent, little violence isseen as a result of organizational rules being imposed. This is not the case withicehockey, which is not inherently violent and yet is riddled with violent fight-ing, Smith \u00abme hales that the major reason for this is that the fans like thefighting and would likely stay away if it were stopped.25 From a personal per-spective, while there appears to be sanctions Operative in hockey that tend to le-gitimize overt violence, similar sanctions are operative in football, although ona more subdued plane, '['here is probably little difference between the blood-lustof hockey versus focuball fansthe difference appears to be quantitative as op-posed to qualitative. Possibly this condition is a result of the hockey organizers'desire w increase gate receipts, not a result of the level of organization that ex-ists in the respective sports.Be that asit may, Scott observes that social disorganization is a cause ofmoth of the violence in the world in general. He notes that the transience ofIcnver- and middle -c lass societies contributes to this as does the fact that most(1 1111 itials are between the ages of 18 and 25the period during which theyoung adult begins on his own. Ile further notes that this is also the age wheremost athletes are actively competing in their respective sports.' It may be, then,116 117 that the athletes themselves, not the organizers of sport, are to blame for muchof the violence, Itis clear, regardless of where one points a finger, that re-lentless adherence to organizational rules and changing rules to reduce thestrategy fat tor of gaining advantages by breaking them are the procedures thatmust be adopted if the social-disorganization hypothesis is to be discounted as aprecipitating factor in spin-t violence.One other aspect of disorganization needs to Ix' mentioned. Hatfield notesthat social disorganization ran exist on a team level as well as on the sport orleague level. Ile notes that team disorganizationiresults from a lack of cohesive-ness or an inability to woe with various ambiguities inherent in team sport sit-uations..11w result. of such disorganization appears to be at least similar to thatwhit h can 1w expected from league or sport disorganizationfrustration occurs.Also, disorg;anization appears to foster the tendency on the part of the athletesaffected by it to get away with anything they can get away with in order to en-hance their team's status, often irrespective of sanctions.15REFERENCESI.

G. Smith, \"Violence and Sport,\" Journal Canadian AFIPER 37, no, 7 ttly-August 1970): 19-22, DEVELOPMENTS IN THESOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF COMPETITIONJOE WALSHSUNY College at Brockport\"Hue predominant approach to sports competition in American society is thezero -sum approach: one wins, one loses, and we always have a zero value. Themajor distinction of how one defines competition is often determined by howone defines success. If winning is the only means of evaluation, then all com-petition is thought to be tero-sum, It seems that in our society the winner al-ways receives more reinforcement or rewards for his behavior than do othercontestants. We tend to reinforce direct competition (i.e., people or teams strug-gling against each other in a clearly personal context, interindividual com- petition) much more than indirect competition (i.e., competition against one'sown best previous performance or a standard, intra-individual competition).The predominant coaching model in intercollegiate athletics is one that tends to emphastie motivating athletes toward excellence hut only when excellenceand winning are synonymous. We may then ask whether sport conducted in this manner is being used to demonstrate superiority, not excellence. Winning then becomes the main value....In a recent interview, star relief pitcher Mike Marshall of the Los AngelesMxIgers indicated that \" if he throws a pitch according to the knowledge thenin his possession, and gets it exactly where he wants it with good stuff on the ball, the batter might hit it over the fence and beat him. Nevertheless, he wouldhe satisfied with his own performance. \"\"1 8 119 Now, it is the conviction of this-writer that such a statement has direct im-plications for the social psychology of sports competition. We have an examplein which a professional athlete (a highly skilled one, I might add) has nicelyarticulated a specific sport experience where he allows for a more liberal inter-pretation of success. It would seem to me that many sociologists would ac-knowledge. the above description by Marshall as a good example of a non-zero-sumapproach to sports competition, which allows for a varying degree of par-tially winning and partially losing. In other words, pitcher Marshall accom-plished exactly what he had wanted to do with the ball at that moment, andeven though the end result (a home run) allowed a run to score against himand his team, he does indeed consider this a successful experience in sport.This anecdote seems to articulate clearly that although the majority of situ-ations in our American competitive sports ethic seem to be regarded as zero-sum in nature, there are classic examples where it is possible to demonstrate thenon-zero-sum approach. I am not insinuating that this approach should alwaystake precedence over the zero-sum approach, but I want to make the point thatthere are possible alternatives to winning in judging success in sport. This isalso another way of stating that non-zero-sum approaches to sports competitionare bring articulated more today than ever before.A Sc( ond example from the sports media illustrates\" another specific re-search construct that has received considerable attention in the social psycholo-gy of sports competition. The fullback of the Oakland Raiders was speculatingon why they lost their playoff game to the Pittsburgh Steelers, thus eliminatingtheir chances to play in the Super Bowl: \"'Sometimes you play games to winand sometimes you play them not to lose.... I think we played not to lose andso we weren't playing to win. And we didn't win.\"'9The quote seems to illustrate very clearly the possible implications we cansee in recent work in the achievement-motivation field. There is research workthere that implies that man enters potential achievement settings with one oftwo possible tendencies: the tendency to achieve success or the tendency toavoid failure. Although both are competing tendencies, the stronger tendencywill usually prevail. For example, achievement-motivation theory and researchhave indicated that high-need achievers have a strong motive to achieve success.Likewise, low-need achievers have a strong motive to avoid failure. Of course,in professional athletics, where we deal with athletes who are highly skilledand who come from strong success backgrounds, one expects such athletes toenter with the motive to achieve success the stronger tendency. However, it isinteresting to note that in the view of fullback Mary Hubbard, the team mightwell have entered this particular game with the tendency to avoid failure stron-ger than the motive to succeed.In the past two years, achievement motivation has aroused much interestand scholarly work in the social psychology of competition. It is not my intentto examine the findings and theory hut, rather, to identify the significance ofthe pursuits in this domain. The writer recommends to the reader the works byAtkinson,' Heckhausen,2 Maehr,\" Ryan,14 Martens,\" and Scanlon\" for a morethorough view of the literature.Another area that might well be considered in the domain of social psy-chology and Competition is aggression and sport. Major papers by J.P. Scott\"and Leonard Berkowitz3 have certainly helped bring this area into greater per-spective and interest for our field. I have found the work by Bandura2 to be a most useful source in looking at aggression literature. Of course, we do havespecific individuals in our field who have also contributed greatly to the area of119 120 aggression and sport (spec tin ally, some of Mike Smith's work, Burris Husman'sreview, and some studies from the University of Maryland). Again, this is an-other area of interest in the social psychological domain that is now receivingscholarly research not only in looking at participant or player aggression invarious situational sport settings but also in looking more thoroughly at spec-tator aggression ill such settings.Rainer Martens\" has been one of the few individuals in our field to takeon the very difficult task of developing a theoretical approach to looking atcompetition in the sport setting. Martens's work is greatly influenced by socialevaluation theory, which is an important ingredient in his basic definition ofcompetition. his work in this area is influenced by Festinger,5 Robert White,\"and achievement-motivation theory. Martens's work deals with specific types ofcompetitive settings, mostly interindividual competition. Martens proposes fourstages in the competition process: the objective competitive situation, the sub-jective competitive situation, the respcmse, and the consequences.'2 In the diffi-cult task of attempting to look at competition from a more theoretical ap-proach, Martens's work certainly makes a most worthwhile contribution.I want to note the significance of intercollegiate athletics in reference tothe social psychology of competition in this country because this type of com-petition receives widespread media coverage and seems to be at a critical periodin our history: It's a very difficult thing to describe pressure. Much of it isself-inflicted pressure you bring upon yourself, demands you bring upon your-self.I resigned because of a combination of things, the sum total of 24 years asa head coach. . .I made the decision with my head. If I had made it with myheart, I prolxibly wouldn't have made this decision.-2'The resignation statements of Ara Parseghian demonstrate current prob-lems in big-time football and basketball coaching. Why do coaches continue towork under such pressures? Why doesn't this insane approach to intercollegiatesports stop? Where will it all lead us? Unfortunately, too many people in pow-erful administrative positions in the intercollegiate athletic movement in thiscountry today are making decisions with their hearts and not their heads. Ifever we needed drastic change in terms of bringing intercollegiate athletics intothe mainstream of educational thought, it certainly is now. The recent pilotstudy by the Carnegie Foundation under George Hanford implies that the col-lege presidents and boards of trustees in this country continue to show a \"be-nign neglect\" in regard to the problems in this area. I feel Hanford is morethan kind in this section of this report. College presidents and boards of trust-ees simply refuse to deal with the major issues; therefore, they don't even at-tempt to recognize (at least not publicly) that major problems do exist. It seemsto me that the neglect is definitely more malignant than benign. God help thewomen if they insist on following the dominant role models available to themfrom our current programs.I think the best way I can end this particular discussion as it relates to in-tercollegiate athletics, is to present a quotation from Thoreau:Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperateenterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it isbecause he hears a different drummer. Let. him step to the music which hehears, however measured or far away.In my opinion, we could definitely use some new role models and differentdrummers in the area of intercollegiate athletics today.120 121 I have taken recent statements one can find almost daily in the sports me-dia in this country and then tried to show how such statements illustrate cer-tain areas of scholarly interest and concern in the social psychology of sportscompetition. It will now be my intent to relate some thoughts on what the fu-ture developments in social psychology of competition might provide.It seems quite safe to state there is definitely a need for more longitudinalapproaches to investigate fully the effect of sports competition, not only on theparticipants involved but on society as a whole. There has been too much as-sumed in our profession based on opinion (from both the establishment andcounter-culture people) and on selective experimental studies that seem ques-tionable in predicting long-range effects. Longitudinal work seems to be one ofthe most efficient means to examine the effect of such programs on the peopleinvolved. With Berkowitz,' I think that more efficient and more situationallyspecific means of measurement are needed in competition and sport areas. Morespecific measurement tools related to different competitive sport situations invarious sport settings (i.e., approaches from zero-sum, non-zero-sum, direct andindirect) might well be better suited to supply the profession with more perti-nent information.In many ways, we might be better off in studying competition (or com-iwtitiveness) by developing our own personality instruments to measure factorsdealing with the kind of settings we are talking about. Although the projectivetechniques in gathering data may have more potential than we currently attri-bute to such devices, we need to develop tools that are situationally specific tothe sport competitive setting being measured.Of course, we are all aware from personality research of the difficulty inprojective measurement techniques. We do know that such techniques requireprofessional people who possess clinical backgrounds and qualifications to in-terpret such data. Bonet has attempted to develop such techniques.' The Uni-versity of Maryland has also produced work in this regard, using such devicesas the standard TAT, Rorschach, and H-T-P measures. We do recognize the dif-ficulty in such testing, but that doesn't mean the profession should not at leastattempt to develop measurement tools (both projective and profile). In myopinion, we (as a profession) should be seeking substantial grant money for de-veloping some sound pilot programs to look at competition in the sporting so-ciety from a more longitudinal approach using our own tools. I have completeconfidence that we could muster the very qualified minds in our own pro-fession to take on such a venture.It seems conceivable that such a project might, therefore, bring forth dataat least to recommend possible alternatives in sporting situations offered in thiscountry. If there is anything we desperately need in our field today, it is morediverse viewpoints of sports competition in action programs. I am not talkingabout lip service, which our profession (as many professions) can certainly beaccused of, but I mean on-going, viable, action programs on the part of theprofession. This doesn't mean to imply that what we are currently doing in thearea of competition is entirely wrong; for that matter it may even be right inmany aspects. However, it does mean to imply that we do need more reliabledata to justify what we are doing.If the traditional approach to competitive sport (zero-sum) is developingbehavioral objectives that seem undesirable (i.e., creating extreme amounts ofaggression, tension, and stress in participants, developing exaggerated author-itarian traits, etc.), then we need data to suggest possible competitive alterna-tives that will help alleviate such problems. As Walsh has stated previously and121 122 as Hendry's research seems to indicate, we are on a very fine line in many areasof our field in continuing to create what can be termed a closed-shop or iso- lationist viewpoint, and our approach to sports competition seems to be limited in offering alternatives.\u00b0 This would be an especially fruitful area to examine in this regard.New role models are recommended in terms of offering alternatives to com- petitive sports inour society. I seriously doubt that initiating action on the part of major college football coaches to take lie detector tests is the ultimate answer to intercollegiate athletic problems. President Ford's recent statement, \"In ath-letics and in most other worthwhile pursuits, first place is the manifestation of the desire to excel, and how else can you achieve anything?\"6 might also be questioned as to its value in solving our problems in this area. We now seem to lack enough diversity and viable action alternatives in our programs dealing with competition and sport. The zero-sum approach to competition seems to be the traditional and only approach available to participants in American society today.It may be interesting to note that the Canadian Council, which encourages the arts, literature, social sciences, and the like, has made funds available for an unusual hockey project in Windsor, Ontario. According to Dr. James Duthie of the University of Windsor Sports Institute for Research, \"the sport is being re- turned to the children by taking the competitive aspect out of it.\" No points are awarded for winning or losing, no goals are counted, and there are no records for leading scorers. Thew are 28 teams in the noncompetitive league, and ob- servers are trying to investigate such areas as frustration, anxiety, and aggres- sion.\"' Role models in terms of different approaches to sport that might well employ a non - zero -sum approach or something that at least allows a rede- finition (or more liberal 'interpretation) of what success is in competitive sport seems to be in order..So I would speculate that one way we are going to study competition con-clusively, especially sports competition, is through the process of observing ac-tual behavior of people not only in sports generally but in specific sport situ-ations.I would speculate further that we will study situations where there isevidence Of direct competitive settings (i.e., interpersonal struggles, interteamstruggles), where there is evidence of indirect competition (i.e., intra-individualstruggles against prior performances, nature, or standards), and where there arezero-sum approaches and non-zero-sum approaches. I believe that such obser-vations have to be made and must deal with specific sporting situations (i.e., avariety of contact, noncontact, team, individual, nature-oriented, and risk-tak-ing sports). I think that such investigative procedures could contribute a greatdea Ito the study of competition in the sporting setting. More specific mea-surement techniques (as I have previously attempted to illustrate) related moreprecisely to looking at sports competition in zero-sum, non-zero-sum, and directand indirect situations must be used to gather more meaningful data. The 16Pf, CPI, Eysenck, Edwards, OPI, and other measures have certainly supplied us ivith some useful information. However, we must recognize the limitations, andwe do need our own measures that can account for the specific situational set-tings in sports competition today.REFERENCESI. J.W.

SAGEUniversity of Northern ColoradoThe behavior of Ametican athletic coaches has come under an avalanche ofcriticism in recent years. By and large the critics have focused their attacks onthe personality traits and value orientations of coaches) 2 3 Coaches have beenaccused of being authoritarian. dogmatic, insensitive, extremely conservative invalue orientation, and demanding obedience to arbitrary and inflexible rules..The persniiraity-trait approach has found congenial reception amongsports psychologists because of their interest in individual characteristics. Onemajor problem with this approach is that the coaches are treated as. thoughtheir background of social experiences was unimportant. There is a suggestioneither that in some mysterious way persons with certain personal-social charac-teristics are attracted to coaching or that the occupation develops persons witha specific set of personal-social attitudes, values, and behaviors. Exactly whichof the two processes is operative is never specified. In this regard, Edwardsnotes, \"Information available in the literature is inconclusive as to whether thedemands of the coaching role operate selectively to weed out non-authoritariantype personalities, or whether experiences while training to become a coach orwhile fulfilling the coaching role condition people to react in an inflexiblemanner.\"4 Vhat is overlooked in this view of coaches' beliefs and behaviors isthe actual realities of the social milieu that has been part of their lives sincebirththeir social-class background, social activities in youth, and the oc-cupation itself in which they work.The position of this paper is that coaches' personal-social characteristicsare a product of the lifelong socialization they have undergone. Socializationis the process by which an individual learns attitudes, values, behaviors, and ex-pectations of others to enable him to assume particular roles in society effec-tively. The foundat\" -if cultural beliefs, behaviors, and expectations is laid inchildhood.and adolescence, but socialization is a continuous proc. ess through-out the life cycle, since the individual is constantly taking on new Toles. In thecourse of the various social experiences, the socializee develops a set of person-al-social characteristics that tend to conform to those who have been significantothers in his life, and his beliefs and behaviors tend to conform to the ex-pectations of the socializers.Sot ialization is managed in a variety of formal and informal ways. Formalsocialization takes place primarily through the family, school, and church dur-ing childhood and adolescence and through the occupation in adulthood. In-formal socialization agents and agencies are more diverse, but relatives, peers,and role moclels constitute significant others inducing normative complianceand, typically, an actual sharing of beliefs and behaviors.The present task is to examine from a sociological perspective the anteced-ent to coaches' personal-social characteristics. This is in contrast to the usualpsychological explanation of coaches' behavior. The underlying theoretical ori-entation for this perspective is that the social milieu in which an individual haslived is highly associated with his present beliefs and behavior. Three aspects ofsocialization will be examined: family background, social experiences in youth,and occupation. It will be suggested that the socialization experiences in these124 125 settings lead to pedic Lions about beliefs, behaviors, and value orientations ofcoaches. Empirical studies will then he reviewed to ascertain the relationshipsbetween the predictions generated and the research findings.CHILD- REARING PRACTICES AND CONSEQUENCESThe priniary role that parents play in the socialization of their children isemphasized in all socialization theories. There is a wealth of research in thepsychology and sociology literature that suggests that parental attitudes, values,and lihavioral patterns are likely to be transmitted from one generation to an-other via their offspring through the socialization processes of family living. AsBarber says, \"Society tends to reproduce itself by the ... expression of its normsand aspirations through actions of the parents who socialize the young andthus make new adult members of society.\"6If we assume that many of the foundations of adult personality, beliefs,and values are laid in the experiences of childhocxl and adolescence, greater un-derstanding of the differences if, attitudes, values, and behaviors of adults fromdifferent. classes might come from knowing something about the differences andsimilarities in their youth. Children -grow up in different social and economic(iictunstances and in families of varying role structure, and it is clear that thesocialization of children in American society is markedly influenced by theirparents' position in the social-class structuresIt has Ix'en repcatedly found that parents from the various social classesdiffer in their child-rearing practices. 7 \"0 Bronfenbrenner reports that \"in mat-ters of discipline, working-class parents are consistently more likely to employphysical punishment, while middle-class families rely on reasoning, isolation,and appeals to guilt\" in raising children.10 Maccoby and Gibbs found that up-per lower-class parents employ physical punishment, deprivation of privileges,and ridicule as echniqes of controlling their children more commonly than doupper middle-class parents.\" Elder notes that physical discipline, such asspanking and slapping, is used more frequently by lower-class parents.12 Final-ly,Mc Kinleyreportsthatvr-rbiss parents are more rigid in theirre-lationships with children, resulting in higher frequency of punishment.\"In conceptualizing the child-rearing practices of lower-class parents, theword authoritarian is frequently employed.\" Indeed, several researchers have in-dicated that lower-class parents have a strong authoritarian orientation. Lipsetclaims, \"Many studies ...show a consistent association between author-itarianism and lower class status.'' Mckinnon and Centers note, \"The work- ing class contains a higher percentage of authoritarians than either the middle(lass or the upper class.\"\" The authoritarian is characteristically punitive andcondescending toward inferiors, less sensitive to interpersonal relationships,submissive toward authority, admiring of power and toughness, and rigidlyconventional and possesses a general insensitivity to the needs and motivationsof others.17The choice of any particular ideological system and social-behavioral ori-entation emerges out of extremely complex and multiple causes, but parentsand their offspring typically obtain positively correlated scores on most mea-sures of individual differences. Again and again, research findings show that so-cioeconomic status is highly associated with certain personal dispositions ofadults and that these personal-social characteristics are transmitted to their off-spring through the child-rearing practices. Both evidence and theory suggest 126 that given the tendency of lower-class parents to treat their children in more au- thoritarian ways, persons from lower-class backgrounds will exhibit and en- dorse authoritarian perspectives.Let us examine briefly the social-class background of athletic coaches.Several studies over the past fifty years have shown that public schOO1 teachers tend to tunic from rural and working-class families.'9.lt is likely that public school coaches are drawn from the same social-class pool. Loy and Sage report that a majority of collegiate football and basketball coaches are from working- class families. They say, \"... the majority of fathers worked at manual jobs.\"'9Given the tendency of lower-class parents to treat th6ir children in author- itarian ways, given the fact that parents and offspring typically obtain posi- tively correlated scores on most measures of individual differences, and given the fact that coaches tend to come from working-class social origins, our first prediction isthat as a group coaches will exhibit and endorse authoritarianperspectives in their personal attitudes and behaviors.PARENTAL VALUES AND CONSEQUENCESFew studies have focused directly upon the relationship of social class to 15a ten tal values, but those concerned with this topic are generally in agree- ment.2\" 2122 2321 These studies suggest that working-class parents value obe-dience, neatness, e leanliness, and conformity to external proscriptions to a larger extent than middle-class patents, who value self-control and self-directionmore highly. Pearl in and Kohn note: \"Middle-class parents value self-directionmore highly than do working class patents; working class parents emphasize,instead, conformity to external proscription. Self-control is the pivotal parentalvalue for the middle-class, obedience for the working class.\"29In addition to parental values emphasizing obedience and respectabilityamong lower classes, parents in this social stratum display values supportingauthoritarian conservatism. Several studies show that authoritarian conser- vatism is related to social class.'\" Kohn and is linearb related to . social orientationThe strongest cor- relation by a wide margin, is with authoritarian conservatism: the lower themen's so( eal class position, the more rigidly conservative their view of manand his social institutions and the less their tolerance of non-conformity....The lower the men's social claSs position, the more likely they are to feelthat znoralityis synom mous with obeying rhe letter of the law; the lesstrustful of their fellow man they are; and the more resistent [sic] they are toinnovation and chituge.27Socialisation theories consistently suggest that parental values are trans- mitted to their offspring and are then internalized to be retransmitted to theirown offspring and others with whom they interact. Given the value orien-tations prominent among working-class parents and assuming that they trans- mit these values to their offspring, it follows that persons who grew up in the working-class family will themselves tend to possess values stressing politicaland social conservatism and will show strong support for obedience to author- ity. Thus, our second prediction is that athletic coaches, as a group, will dis- play and endorse an authoritarian conservative value orientation.l''6 127 SPORTS PARTICIPATION AND CONSEQUENCESAn enormous amount of the social experiences of youth takes place outsidethe family, and for youth who participate in organized athletics the social envi-ronment has the potential to serve as a powerful source of socialization. Snyderhas suggested that the greatest likelihood of the inculcation of diffuse attitudesand values occurs when there is a high degree of involvement in an activity,when the activity is clone voluntarily, when there is an expressive relationshipamong participants, and when the socializing agent is prestigeful and powerfuland has great ability to dispense affective rewards and punishment.28 It is obvi-ous that all of these factors are present in the athletic setting, and therefore ath-letic experiences undoubtedly serve as an important source of socialization ofattitudes and values for participants.What are the core attitudes and values of athletics? Assuming some vari-ation from team to team due to the variation in participants and coaches, thereis nevertheless what harry Edwards calls a \"sports creed.\"29 In essence, thesports creed emphasizes competitiveness, obedience to authority, patriotism, loy-alty to the group, altruism, self-discipline, and religiosity. Typically, these pre-cepts arc forcefully transmitted to the athletes by their coaches and teammatesin a variety of ways. In an elegantly conceived study, Snyder shows quite nicelyhow locker room slogans are used as a means of socializing athletes to the atti-tudes zinc! values of the sports creed.\"To the extent that one has participated in organized sports and to the ex-tent that one has been exposed to the sports creed, there is a good chance thatonwill evidence attitudes and values endorsing and supporting the creed.Most current coaches were active participants in interschool and/or age-groupsports programs in their youth.31 32 33 34 35 Thus, they had ample exposure tothe sports creed. Therefore, our third prediction is that coaches, as a group, willevidence strong support for the precepts of the sports creediespecially such val-ues as obedience to authority and conformity to externally imposed proscrip-tions, which are core values in the creed.OCCUPATIONAL SOCIALIZATION AND CONSEQUENCESMost research into the process of socialization has been concerned with in-fancy, childhocxl, and adolescence, but there is a considerable amount of social-ization involved in learning and performing occupational roles.36 According toMoore, txcupational \"socialization involves acquiring the requisite knowledgeand skills and also the sense of occupational identity and internalization of oc-cupational norms typical of the fully qualified practitioner.\"37 It is clear thatfor an individiral to function in an occupation he must learn a variety of be-haviors, attitudes, and values. Numerous studies have demonstrated that oc-cupational affiliation or position in a work organization profoundly affectsone's views on various matters as well as one's actual behavior.An occupational ideology emerges and is sustained through both formaland informal channels of communication, and the person who learns thenorms, values, and behaviors will emerge not only with an internalized oc-cupational commitment but also with an identification with the collectivity,the brotherhoocl. Thus, the main consequence of the various occupational so-cializing agents and agencies is that there is a relative homogeneity in the em-ployee groupall persons having Ihaviors amid beliefs compatible with the de-mands of the cx-cupation. As Burlingame says, \"... the intent of socialization is127 128 to obViate personalist u ,idiosyncratic difference in Freshmen (persons new tothe occupation) and replace them in the universalistic, noon-governed behav-iors of seniors.''Also, Goode notes: \"Characteristic of each of the establishedprofessions, and a goal of each aspiring occupation, is the community of pro-fession. Each profession is a community without locus [but it] ... may never-thelesscalled it community by virtue of these characteristics.... Its membersshare values in common.\"'\"The sports creed described above provides a basic underlying philosophy inthe coaching profession. Coaching manuals, clinic speakers, and nationallyprominent coaches consistently propagate this creed. Its precepts are advancedso regularly and so persuasively and it is so universally endorsed in Americansports that it would be almost impossible for a coach not to subscribe to its dic-tates and accept them as his own.On the basis of socialization theory and research about an occupational ho-mogeneity of beliefs and behaviors, our fourth prediction is that athletic coach-es, as a group, will exhibit common value orientations. Since coaches are in-th)trinated to the sports creed through various agents and agencies within andexternal to the coaching occupation, our fifth prediction is that they will en-dorse the creed and strongly subscribe to values of obedience to authority andconformity to external proscriptions.EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR PREDICTIONSTo what extent ate the predictions generated through a review of the so-cialization literature sustained by empirical findings? The first thing that be-coms quite evident when seeking an answer to this question is that research onthe personal-social characteristics of coaches is quite scarce. The presently avail-able data cannot give definitive verification for the predictions, but there aresufficient studies to suggest that they tend to be fairly accurate.With respect to the prediction that coaches endorse authoritarian perspec-tives and support high authority structure the findings are incomplete but dosuggest support for the proposition. Locke found that a physical educationgroup scored significantly higher on an instrument that measured authoritarianattitudes than did a teacher group who were not physical educators.\u00b0 Althoughnot all physical educators are athletic coaches, a very high percentage of themare. Kenyon, who assessed several psychosocial and cultural characteristics ofaspiring physical educators, reports that the physical education majors weremore dogmatic and rigid than other prospective teachers.\" Again, physical edu-cation and coaching are not synonymous, but most aspiring coaches major inphysical education and most coaches majored in physical education.42 43Ogilvie and Tutko describe the personalities of 64 coaches representingbasketball, track, football, and baseball as being quite different in two traits:-The first was the very low tendency to be interested in the dependency needsof others ...in other words, to give a great deal of emotional support to oth-ers,... vl-he secondcharacteristic . ., w a s...inflexibility or rigidity in terms of utilization of new learning.\"44 In a second study of high school coaches,Ogilvie and Tutko suggest that support was found for their previous gener-alization, that is, that coaches are high in those traits that promote gettingahead and succeeding and that do not require personal involvement, but theyscore low on those personality traits that contribute most to being sensitive andsupport close interpersonal relationships.45 Albaugh assessed ressentiment ofcollege basketball coaches. One high in ressentiment demands obedience, denies128 129 imhvidual rights, demands that inflexible rules be kept, and commands docile,\u00abdmitting, and spiritless individuals as subjects. He reported that the coaches'mean score was approximately one standard deviation higher than theteac hers'.Scott, one of the most outspoken critics of athletic coaches, has suggestedthat the value orientations of coaches are so conservative as to be almost aber-rant.''Ogilvie, another frequenr critic of athletic coaches, also believes thatcoaches are \u00abmservative in value orientation: Traditionally you are going to find in the coaching profession men who are socially and txditically conser-vative.\"\" Even some coaches view their colleagues as possessing extremely con-servative values. David Nelson, athletic director at the University of Delawareand formerly the head football coach there, says, \"Having been a coach Iknow that most of us are almost Harding Republicans and three degrees to theright of Chengis Khan.\"'\u00b0 I.nfottunately, there is little research to supportthese impressionisticthservations alatut coaches, but what does exist tends tosupport these notions.Sage assessed the value orientations of collegiate football, basketball, andtrack mac hes and found that the three groups hold similar value orientations.\"Indeed, on twenty items of various dimensions of value difference there were nosignificant difleirn\u00ab.s on any of these items. In other words, collegiate athletic\u00absu hes limn several sports hold snnilar value orientations for a variety of fa-miliar dimensions of value difference, and there was no difference between thevalues of younger r oil( hes (age 40 and under) and older coaches (over age 40).With respect to the charge that coaches are conservative, only two studiesrelate to this question. In a 1969 survey by the Carnegie Commission on HigherEducation of the political opinions of over 60,000 full-time college facultymembers, physical education faculty (N=1,208) ranked second out of thirtyfields in percentage of respondents who characterize themselves as strongly con-servative and also second in percentage of those who characterize themselves asmoderately conservative. In apparently the only study specifically concernedwith the comprehensive value orientations of coaches, Sage summarizes hisfindings for collegiate coaches in this way: \" The total response profile of thecoaches showed them to possess. moderate- conservative values. ... Althoughconservatism is not extreme among coaches, it is more pronounced than it isamong college students.\"Sage also reports that coaches manifest greater support for \"authoritystria our,'that is, they place high value on obedience to authority and stan-dards of good conduct established by religious or societal norms: This high value for authoritystructure expressed by coaches will be evident in ex-pec taro les that their position culturally accords them the right to direct the ac-tions of their athletes and that the athletes under their jurisdiction agree to ac-cept as the premises of their behavior orders and instructions given to them bythe coach.\"\"On the whole, of course, the evidence presented here does not constitute adefinitive verification lot the predictions, nor does it permit a comprehensiveassessment of all of the alternative explanations for accounting for the re-lationship between socialization experiences and various kinds of coaches' atti-tudes. values, and behaviors. It is hoped, however, that this effort will help make the issue of what accounts for the relationship more salient than pre-viously published literature on this topic.129 130 REFERENCES1. J.

HARROLDUniversity of MinnesotaThis paper presents selected data iron' the two leisure studies conducted at theUniversity of Minnesota and Temple University, Philadelphia. The Minnesotastudy was conducted in 1971, and the Temple study, a slightly modified repli-cation of the Minnesota study, was conducted in 1974. Both studies were con-ducted in the spring (March-April) of their respective years.Studtmts' self-reported patterns of leisure-time dispersal and use for week-days and weekends are reported. Further, secondary and tertiary patterns ofsport involvement, reasons for attending sports events, and opinions giving therank ordering of factors affecting game am:Id:Ince reflecting student sportsspectator behavior and opinion are reported.Several papers and articles have been presented based on the Minnesotastudy. 12 3.15 6 One study has reported findings from the Temple study.? Thepresent paper is the first to make comparisons between the Minnesota findingsand the Temple results. The comparisons are of selected parts of the question-naire; yet this selection does not reflect a systematic search for high correlation.Both the University of Minnesota and Temple University in Philadelphia areurban commuter universities. It is possible that the urban commuter student isa particular breed, regardless of which large. city he inhabits, or, more likely,commuting forces upon the student an overall pattern of life that not only es-tablishes dispersal of leisure time but may have overriding behavioral effectsthat affect values, attitudes, and other judgmental behavior.SAMPLE COMPARISONSFor the Minnesota study conducted in the spring of 1971, the questionnairewas mailed out to a random sample of .1,000 of the 32,936 registered under-graduates, constituting approximately 3 percent of the total enrollments A veryslightly modified version of the questionnaire was mailed out to a randomly se- 132 133 lected sample of .510 of the 12,322 registered undergraduates attending Templein the spring of 1971: the 'Temple sample was approximately 4.5 pCrcent of thetotal undergraduate enrollment. Table Igives the descriptive dam for coin- .parisons of the samples, the rates of response, and the total populations, show-ing sample and response breakdowns by sex. It is generally agreed that a 70pr\u00abnt response rate for survey returns gives justification for results to be gen-eralized to the total r)opulation.TABLE1Comparisons of Samples, Respondents, and Total UndergraduatePopulations by Sex and by University leisure-time dispersal for both the Minnesota andthe Temple samples appear to lend support to the contention that the urbancommuter student is a particular type of person regardless of which large cityhe inhabits, Perhaps the most significant figure in Table 2 is the claim madethat approximately 0 percent of commuting students have little time for lei-sure..1'he commuting student most probably pays his own costs for transit,andto offset these costs (amongothers) he most probably holds down at least apart-time job. The question of whether the typical student should have a goodamount (average?) of time for leisure is discussed in texts on the philosophy ofeducatirm and is not entered here, but. the significance is somewhat embellishedby the data presented in Table 3.TABLE 2Amount of Leisure-Time Dispersal forStudent Populations by University innesota TempleLresur9.0 8.0 Average 52,6 50.5Little 38.4 41.5133 134 TABLE 3Patterns of Leisure-Time Use for Weekdays andWeekends by University (in Percent)Minne.solaTemple'Weekdio sVt'eekendsWeekdaysWeekendsStay on campus after (lass 15.915.219..18.0 Come back to 1imptis evenings 8.1 1.3-Stay at home 66.931.158.228.2 Go out locally 31.368.910.969.7 Go downtown 7.519.810.122.8Travel away for weekend-21.9 21.0Other I LI15.918.716.8As Table 3 shows, in spite of the commuting done during the week, nearly a quarter of each sample of students claimed they like to travel away for the weekend. Clearly the two kinds of travel are neither confused not related, and commuting for some students cannot be too demanding from a \"traveling\" standpoillt. Weekda!, evening leisure and cultural events do not attract many students: summing items \"Stay on campus after class\" and \"Come back to cam- pus evenings\" shows that at best 25 percent (for Minnesota).,and 20 percent (for Temple) of commuting students can be expected to support such events, This percentage must lx' qualified a little because both campuses do have students who are non\u00abimmutcrs. The stay-at-home student group might be larger than extiec led, but this figure also reflcc is the demanding nature of the life of a typi- cal commuting student.Sports SpectatingOn average, 30 percent of students claimed that spectating is their primaryinterest in sport; another 37 percent claimed that their interest in sport is di-vided equally between spectating and participating; another 27 percent claimedimrtic ipation as their primary interest; and yet another 6 percent claimed no in-terest in sport whatsoever. These figures are composite percentages taken as theaverage of the two samples, neither group's percentage being widely disparatefrom the other.TABLE 4Frequency of Sport Spectator Behavior for CameAttendance and Media by University (in Percent)Frequenilv0\u00ab11.110mulyNeverMumr.sola to radio 18.511.011.528.610.057:1 Read spoils magaiine 11.18.738.329.850.661.5\"The questionnaire design had two disparate set !ions entitled (Spectator)\" and\"Television\" item 2 un-der \"'Television\" was \"sports.\" These items were inserted as a cross-check for response validation.134 135 Sports-spectating behavior, inc hiding attendance at games and televisionviewing, is summarized in Table . As a cross-check for validation of responses to the questionnaire, watching sports on television was built into two parts ofthe questionnaire (see note, Table 4). There is a particularly high correlation ofresponse for each of the groups among those who watch sports on televisionfrequently, and the correlation becomes slightly weaker for those who watch oc- casionally or who never watch sports on television. Perhaps the most surprisingfigure, considering the amount of time and, publicity that television gives to sports, is that some 20 percent (or more) never watch sports on television. Thefigures for game attendance (Minnesota 19.8 percent and 51.0 percent; Temple 11.1 percent and 50.7 percent) must be taken with some reservation, for it is well known that game attendance fluctuates with the team record and the pop- ularity of the sport.TABLE 5Reasons for Attending Games by University (in Percent) MinnesotaTempleCrowd contact 10.622.0 Shared social experience (friend \"date) 43.143.3 Entertainment 'enjoyment 65.159.6 Rea LI ty (esthetics) of mov-ir.-mt 14.726.2 Emotional release, excitement 27.440.2 See aggressive behavior 11.9 Identify with players 16.3 Pass the lime 13.7Added to the questionnaire for the Temple study.In Table 5, data is presented giving the reasons why urban student com-muters attend games. The original questionnaire given to the Minnesota sam-ple contained only five alternative reasons for respondents to check. In prepara-tion for the Temple study, the original question dealing with reasons for sportsattendance was tested against the findings of Boles.9 This exercise substantiatedthe primary five and added three more of apparent significance. The most satis-fying result recorded here in Table 5 is reflected in the Temple results, whichvalidate the primary five reasons of the original questionnaire by virtue of theEvrcentage weight of support given. (The three added factors all appear of less-er significance than the primary Five reasons; yet Future researchers may wish toretain them for their apparent weight.) It is not surprising to find that the out-standing reason for attending a game is for the entertainment that it providesand the enjoyment gained from it.It was pointed out alxwe that the team record and the popularity of thesport are both factors influencing game attendance. The reader is referred to thearticle \"Factors Affecting Game Attendance\"' for a full account of the results ofthe Minnesota study and to \"Attendance and Price Setting\"\" for supportivedata taken from national sixms franchise statistics. Thus, for the results of theTemple study to have differed widely from the Minnesota results would havemeant close scrutiny, since they would also differ from national statistics.

Certainly, as far as students are concerned, the popularity of the sportis the most crtu ial factor for game attendance, and, contrary to the opinionheld by directors of athletics, promotional expenses for advertising arc of littlevalue. The team record is the better source of advertising, and winning drawsthe crowds.CONCLUSIONSThe data presented in this report demonstrate a close correspondence oflife-style and opinion between populations of students attending urban com-muter universities. Comparisons of data collected from a leisure and sports in-terest questionnaire administered to students at the University of Minnesota itt1971 and to students at Temple University in 1971 show that, regardless of thelocation of the large city, students who commute are very similar in the amountof leisure they have and how they spend it. If the use of some of their leisuretime is in attendance at sports events, watching sports on television, or other-wise showing an interest in sprt, their being urban commuter students is moresignificant than their living in any particular part of the country. At least forthe factors studied here, urban living is not regionally differentiated.REFERENCESI. Roger D.

FOUKEUniversity of HoustonWhen Dr. Pelton invited me to serve as a panelist on this program, I waspleased to accept.Ifelt that a frank discussion of a topic like this one wouldcertainly be interesting and personally informative with regard to how the otherorganizations actually feel about the liaison between physical education and in-tercollegiate athletics and the respective organizations that serve theirmemberships.Perhaps an overview of the. National Collegiate Athletic Association is inorder. The association is composed of over 900 collegiate institutions of varyingsizes, philosophies, purposes, and goals, located throughout the United States.Membership is institutional in nature and differs in that -respect from mem-bership in this organization, for example, and the AAHPER,'where the mem-bership is composed of individuals, not institutions. In a nutshell, the basicfunction of the-NC:AA is to formulate the policies and procedures governing in-tercollegiate athletic competition between its members in such a manner asdeemed fair and equitable by the individual members. The NCAA does not ex-ist by any Cod-given right; it began and continues because of the will of itsmembership. I ant always amused when I sometimes hear members of the ath-letic profession cuss or discuss the NCAA as if it were a giant corporation withcomplete autonomy in all matters related to athletics, In reality, when we talkabout the NCAA, we are talking about our own collegiate institutions and theirindividual delegates, Enough of this-1 could go on about its organizationalpatterns, its legislative powers to enact rules and regulations governing com-petition, and the enforcement procedures it has instituted to enforce these rules,but that in its entirety would take too long, be extremely boring, and add noth-ing to this program.137 138 Nly title asks whether the interrelationship of the AMIPEK, the NCAA, the NAIA, and the MAW is on firm or shaky ground. The honest and straight- forward answer is that the relationships are strained and close to the breaking There are a variety of reasons given by different peopledifferences in the philosophies of the organizations, in organizational administration, and in membetship qualificationsand Claims that one or more are power-hungry and want to dictate to all groups involved in amateur athletics. I know you have heard that alxml the NCAA; I have heard rumors that this would also apply to the AAIIPER.The real question is, DO we permit jurisdictional fights to irreparably damage the relationships between our various organizations? I submit to you that not onlv must we not allow this to occur but we cannot afford to if we are thinking about the welfare of physical education and athletics. Without attempting to oversimplify the approach to settling differences and joining hands, Isuggest that we put into practice what we have beenpreaching for some time, namely, that participation in sports is conducive to the development of an appreciation for the values derived from working togeth- er as tnembtrs of a team, not as spoiled, individual stars who think only of themselves, without concern for the well-being of the other members. I am firmly convinced that we are all members of the same team whether we want to be or not and whether at times we act like it. Nevertheless, we all have a com- mon concernto offer programs of physical activity for our young men and women that will satisfy their needs and interests and allow them to derive.bene- fits that will contribute to a more wholesotne way of life. The problems that we face today are very real and demand solutions. The problems of our or- ganizations are really extensions of the problems that exist on our individual campuses. You do not hear anything at the national level that you do not hear first at the local level. So ifwe want to solve problems at the national level, leteach of us first try to solve them at our own local level. None of the various segments of our profession is free of problems. Let me name just a few problems that come readily to mind. First, there exists today a group in our colleges who would eliminate or refuse credit for the activity courses in physical education on the basis that these are not academically repu- table and have no acceptable place in a college curriculum. There are even some in our own profession who feel that it is beneath their dignity or a waste of theft talents to be assigned to teach a skills course. I submit that, on the con- trary, the teaching of skills is the base of our whole program and that if we deny this, we deny everything that intercollegiate athletics and physical edu- cation stand for. If this program can be eliminated at the college level, it can be clitninated at the secondary level (we already have opponents) and subsequently at the lowel levels. \"I\" he people in athletics (intercollegiate and intramural) should lend their full support to the physical education associations for the re- tention and betterment of existing programs. In this area athletics needs your guidance and can use your leadership, with you being the quarterbacks and our people being the guards who do the blocking. We need to work together to support 01.11' programs.There is a constant problem involving the need for additional facilities; the teacher-training program, the instructional skills program, the intramural and recreation programs, and the intercollegiate athletic programs for men and women till put a heavy strain on existing facilities. The ultimate answer to this problem is not to bicker among ourselves about which group is going to use them and at what time, for how long, and in what order. In attempting to138 139 prove our own need, all we do is tear down the needs of other groups and in sodoing defeat the very things we set out to achieve for ourselves. Instead, let's get__to work jointly to show cause for new facilities that will alleviate the needs ofall groups.For exampk. If you do not need more tennis courts at your institution to-day, you are one of the favored few. The tennis boom has put a tremendousstrain on the availability of courts for-students and faculty. Add to that the ad-vent of a women's intercollegiate tennis program, and you do not have to bevery smart to sec that you have a problem. The real question lies in how yougo about solving it. If you take the short-sighted approach,- you propose cuttingavailable time for each group, thus ultimately providing mediocrity for allgroups and allowing the basic problem to remain for everybody. If you reallywant to solve the problem, you join hands in presenting the needs of eachgroup and cotnbining these needs to show just cause for additional courts thatcan be used by all groups. We can no longer justify the luxury of varsity courtsonly, men's courts only, women's courts only, or what-have-you. The im-ixirtant thing is to get more courts or court time (lighting) for people to playtennis, which playing is, in the final analysis, what all of us should be ex-pending our energies toward accomplishing. What can be said about tenniscourts can lie said afiout other facilities.Let us look at a few problems of intercollegiate athletics. You can startwith the problem of financing. Contrary to popular belief, there are only a fewintercollegiate athletic programs that are self-supporting. Most programs relyon monies other than gate receipts, whether derived directly or indirectly fromuniversity-community resources. The cost of operation has risen in the samemanner as the cost of living. There are only two approaches to facing up to theproblemeither reduce costs by reducing the scope of operation or increase in-come by acquiring additional funds from either present or new sources. It is assimple as that. The expense budget for a Division I team playing footballprobably ranges from SI.5 to $2.5 million annually. There are a few that areabove or below these figures, but most successful programs fall into that range.Steps, such as limitations of grants-in-aid, have been taken to curtail expenses,but more action can be expected in the near future probably with reductions inthe size of traveling and playing squads, number of coaches, and, perhaps,number of intercollegiate sports (I hope this would be a final, desperate step).It is imperative that we continue to have good intercollegiate athletic pro-grams. The benefits to a university are immeasurable. But if intercollegiate ath-letics goes down the drain, all other segments of the \"team\" will get caught inthe backwash. Therefore, it becomes a probleri not only of intercollegiate ath-letics but of the total field. Let's treat it as such and work together toward find-ing a solution for our present dilemma.I will mention just one more of our joint problemsthat of the role andscope of an expanding women's intercollegiate athletic program. The under-lying problem is where to obtain funds to finance the proposed activities. Ihave never heard an athletic director seriously oppose the philosophy support-ing a comprehensive program of intercollegiate athletics for women; I haveheard many athletic directors express genuine concern about funding, and, inlight of the previous problem discussed, you can understand why. I have lis-tened to many speeches by women, and most include a statement that the wom-en do not want to initiate and conduct their program at. the expense of a reduc-tion in the men's program, but I have not heard any concrete plans for securingnew and additional monies for the operation of women's programs. This is dis-turbing and needs solving. When the solution to financing is arrived at without139 140 seriously damaging present programs, whatever opposition that may exist willdisappear overnight. Thus, it is essential that the NCAA, the AIAW, the NAIA,and the AAHPER work together, not separately, because women's sports affectall groups.So in (-losing let me reiterate the case for cooperative action by our or-ganirations. The problems of one group are the problems of the other groups.us first get together with each other, rather than go our separate ways. Allwe need to come up with for solutibns are a prevailing spirit of cooperationand a respect on the part of each of us for the contributions and the roles thatthe other organizations play in providing a total program. There is no doubtthat we have the know-how in our memberships, if only we have the will andthe humility to ask for it. AIAW-NCAA-PHYSICAL EDUCATION:AN UNHAPPY TRIANGLE?L. LEOTUS MORRISONMadison CollegeThe title implies a triangle in the sense of three parts in conflict, workingagainst each other--one part perhaps struggling for supremacy over the othertwo or two parts pulling in one direction to the detriment of the third party. Atthe very least the implication is one of static quibbling, selfish protection ofprerogative and power, and lack of progress; this implication completely omitsthe element that should be our central focus: educational benefits that.shouldaccrue to our students.Of course, as a teacher, as a coach, as an athletic administrator, and as asports enthusiast 1 woukl hope that though these implications are possibilities,each of these groups will be willing and able to rise above personal priorityand see beyond immediate gain or loss to a greater gain for our students.So I would opt for another type of triangle. Not the eternal male-female-male or female-male-female one alluded to in much of our fiction or the trian-gle of conflict, but the mathematical triangle. We have often used geometricalfigures and diagrams in physical education and sports to portray relationshipsamong various programs and to depict graphically movement patterns and of-fensive and defensive strategies.In the diagram of my triangle, rather than name the sides Physical Edu-cation, NCAA, and AIAW, I prefer to think of them as physical education, in-tercollegiate competition opportunities for men, and intercollegiate competitionopportunities for women.With these three parts in mind, I would opt for eternal triangles of twotypes. First, the equilateral triangle, in which all three sides are equal, all an-gles are equal, and each side is equally essential to the formation of the con-cept. This triangle symbolizes to me a unity of purpose, an appreciation of thenecessity for three parts, a recognition of the worth of three sides, andcoop era tion.140 141 In this triangle, though Irepresent an area of athletics, I would placephysical education at the base in that all the motor, psychomotor, and cog-nitive attributes essential for fair and excellent competition can and should bedeveloped through instructional programs beginning in early childhoodeducat ion.The second triangle for which I would opt is the triangular pattern fre-quently used in offensive and defensive maneuvers in sports and physical edu-cation: the three-man pattern of teamwork in which the leading player with theball draws the defense and then passes off to one of the others who then thrustsforward through the space created or, ondefense, the three-man pattern, some-times a very peculiar-looking triangle, that resembles at times a piece of pie andat other times a line of three but always provides a two-deep or three-deep part-ner type of protection and initiation of offense.Both of these triangles call for teamwork, cooperation, and adjustment tothe pressures of time but faith in the role that each of the three parts plays.They necessitate shared joint responsibility and leadership turn-taking accord-ing to the needs of a particular situation or time.to the mid-1960s, opportunities for competition for women were ex-tremely limited on nonexistent. None of the conferences, leagues, or nationalathletic Assoc iations was providing leadership or competitive participation forwomen. I listorically, some of the blame for this neglect must be borne by wom-en and by women in physical education. But blame is not important here; whatis important is that at least half of our population was locked out of one largesegment of school life, a segment, if we are to believe the words of past athletesand writers, that provides unique opportunities to learn in action the give-and-take. the leadership and team cooperation, and the competitive strategy anddedication that help prepare young people for life and a career in a democraticsociety.CIAW and MAW were developed to provide leadership and opportunitiesfor college women. Memlxiship was opened to institutions in 1971, and wenow have grown to over 600 members including large universities, small col-leges, and community:junior colleges. Our development as an association wasgoing along rather smoothly. Many colleges and universities were beginning toimplement programs for women, and we had increased support from men andwomen in physical education and from women's groups who had found inwomen's athletics an arena of clear discrimination. And we anticipated deliber-ate, planned growth that would avoid the excesses and problems that plaguedsome Male athletic programs. Then came Title IX and our manner of growthwas a route that was no longer the calm pathway it had been.It's not the change that is so much of a difficulty but the pace of thatchange. We asked for it and we've got it. In my presentation prepared just overa week ago, I planned to discuss some of the problems within the women in-volved in athletic programsthe athletes, the coaches, the administratorsin-cluding the turmoils stemming from our entry into more of a pressure situationand surrounding decisions each woman and girl is experiencing as she exam-ines her expectations and her commitment. It is an emotional time and a per-sonal decision-making time for each of us.We'l2e been on the scene such a short time and one of the comments thathas been wade is that we can't expect too much too soon. \"It took a long timeto develop men's athletics\"; we should be patient. Many women might be will-ing to he patient, but that is a choice we are riot allowed.1 1 1 142 light of the events of the last week at the ..HAW Delegate Assembly andat the NCAA convention, I have changed my remarks. Now, I shall commenton our maturation and our aging in the short time since I left Virginia.Our association and our delegates learned a lot about itself and themselves,and the association survived and our cause is stronger today. I say \"cause isstronger,\" for we are supporting two principles: the principle of equity (fair-ness) and the principle of equality of opportunityfor our students first andforemost. We have made cooperative efforts in attempting to solve problems inthe past, and we are more than willing to continue to cooperate in the future,but on the basis of these two principles.So Ishall briefly examine our Delegate Assembly and highlight some ofthe major decisions we reached.The Delegate Assembly directed the executive board to undertake a majorrestructuring study to report to the executive board in May 1975 and to be pre-sented to the Delegate Assembly in 1976. As a hoard we established the prin-ciples of governance that must he included in this plan and the basic one isequalioy of representation of alI subgroups and institutional types. The Dele-gate Assembly approved adding community junior college representatives andsmall college representatives to the board from each of our regions. They wereselec ted or elected and met with us following the Delegate Assembly. They haveequal voice and vote. The restructuring committee has been directed to consideradding representation from sport committees and from student athletes.A second area of decisions (entered on relationships with other sportgroups and associations. The delegates approved the concept of cosponsorshipof national championships, and the executive board is empowered to considercosponsorship, provided certain criteria are met. The delegates took the standthat cosponsorship should be undertaken in exceptional and unique instances.We have almost reached agreement with the United States Field Hockey Associ-ation to cosponsor a national collegiate field hockey championship in fall 1975,and we will meet with two other groups related to cosponsorship.An additional point in relation to cooperative efforts: the Delegate Assem-blyin1973 directed the board to meet with existing men's governing or-gani/ations in order to work out mutual problems. We had met with NCAA,understood that work would continue, and had no notice of the direction theNCAA council recormnended. For the best interest of our metnbers and our stu-dents we are still committed to cooperative efforts in this area.The Delegate Assembly and the executive hoard considered a great manysuggestions with regard to national championships. We will sponsor a cross -c mntry c hampionship for the fall of 1975, and we are considering both softballand tennis c hampionships in 1976. We endorsed guidelines to be considered inadding championships that will allow divisional possibilities by membershiptype.Another area of decisions had to do with ethics and eligibility decisions,the study of our current limitations on grants-in-aid, and a restructuring ofpenalties so that' students do not suffer for decisions made by governing groupsor individuals.And we did a lot of housekeeping clarification. We have moved fast, con-,sidering the short period we have been in existence, but most of these decisionsgive us the ability to forge ahead more quickly.So I think decisions in each of these areas reflect our association's commit-ment to cooperation and to the principles of equity and equality for students,for different types of members, and for all voices within our association.142 143 Now a bit apart from the marathon of this past week. In cooperative ven-tures we learn from each other. We women in athletics have already learned agreat deal from physical education and from men's governing groups. I cannotoveremphasize the influence my experience in coaching has had on my abilityas a teacher. I have had to learn more highly developed skills and that has car-ried over into my teaching. I have also learned from coaching and from coedteaching that we have pampered the women in our classes and we have cheatedthem both in what they can do and in the expectations we encourage them toset for themselves.On the other hand, cooperative efforts will have benefits for coaching andathletics. The students are becoming more aware of space and movement pat-terns, which I consider crucial to strategy. Increased emphasis on early child-hood programs will prepare students better, hut, in addition, the approachesand techniques have implications for us in the coaching situation. These arejust two observations of the benefits in practical terms that I see in workingtogether.Thus, I see interesting years ahead and an opportunity to learn from eachaspect of this triangle, to work jointly for mutual benefit, not for power but forbenefits to our students and our athletesfemale and male. The opportunity isthere. To benefit our students in these ways we must be cooperative, we musthe creative, and we must be open to change and learning. MAW is committedto these possibilities. AIAW-NCAA-PHYSICAL EDUCATION:AN UNHAPPY TRIANGLE?LEONA title \"AIAW-NCAA-Physical Education: An Un-happy Triangle?\" and the words physical education profession. Are these threeorganizational functions a triangle at all, either happy or unhappy?There are several kinds of triangles and the dictionary defines that a trian-gle has three sides and three angles. Perhaps that is a good start when we donot attempt to determine the lengths of any of the sides, the name on any side,the name on the bottom, or the names on the sides that rise to the top. Also, weare not determining any of the angles. The proposition may become complex ifwe attempt to decide immediately if it is a happy or an unhappy triangle.Physical education as a proposed part of the triangle is presented to us as aprofession. Physical education is part of education in progress and in inter-pretation; physical education of itself and as education is part of life in processand in application. Physical education as part of education and life can be ex-amined. As part of education and life, physical education must be examined.Socrates wrote, 'The life which is unexamined is not worth living.\" The exam-ination of life, education, or a profession should be frequent and it should bealmost continuous. Examination should be through thought and by plan. Ex-amination should be of the process and for the results sought. 143 144 A life, an education, and a profession should be examined and tested too inthe ways now known, by methods presently in the stage of development, andthrough techniques yet to be discovered.There are exact measures of lifeyears, money, rooms in the house. Thereare certain measures of educationcorrect answers, grades, certificates on thewall, titles after the name. There are sure counts of one's physical educationprofessional background and conditionawards on the shelf, number of grants,quantities of papers written. Are these the only measures and are they the fullmeasure?In life, education, and the profession we must measure with metric formwhat can be counted in meters, we must_weigh what can be weighed, and wemust tabulate, filter, count, and chart and we must understand, interpret, relate,and apply.In our profession as in education and in life, we must measure with themind those matters of the mind; we must feel with the heart some matters ofthe full heart; and we must sense and understand with spirit the inherent qual-ity of biological and life spirit and give enhancement to the human condition.\"There are ambiguities in life, in education, and in our profession. In ourambiguities lie our individual challenges and our continuous opportunities forthe acts of exploration and for the joys of discovery. Our field is so broad, ourparticipants are so numerous, and their life routes are so long and varied thatwe may never be able to run all of the tests or to tally all of the scores that rep-resent the results of our leadership through our lives of personal and pro-fessional commitment.In our ambiguities may lie some of the great good we may do, and also inour abstractions and subjectivities lie some of our faults. We must examine; wemust appraise as well as we know how to do and as conscientiously as we can.AN UNHAPPY TRIANGLE?We have the triangle topic with which to deal. The triangle as proposedputs A IAW, NCAA, and physical education on three sides: The adjective unhappy suggests something of a vying relationship. We mightdeal with the triangle if we think of it as a YMCA or YWCA triangle in whichthere are some common or interrelated interests in which the three sides holdthe whole content or enterprise together. 114 145 The three sides of the AlAW-NCAA-phyical educ:ition triangle representthe specialized functioning of three groups. AlAW and NCAA have one-linefunctions, but they are not professions. I propose that physical education is aprofession and in this triangle is represented in but one function of its fullscope. The three groups will learn to function effectively and to solve problems,although in the process some of the situations may be unhappy. The triangle isnot a totally appropriate representation of the whole profession of physical ed-ucation. Let us not use this graphic form or the expression \"an unhappytriangle.\"THE TRIANGLEThere is another development of graphic imagery frequently employed thatplaces physical education at the base of the triangle with athletics at the apex.The middle slice represents intramurals. To match the title of this discussion, we will substitute MAW and NCAAat the apex. Physical EducationEach one of these two diagrams constitutes a faulty view of physical edu-cation for two major reasons: (1) the objective of physical education is not ath-letics; (2) the objective of athletics is to winif the game is lost the professionfails and incidentally so does athletics.The logic as suggested by the diagrams might propose that physical edu-cation has no end in itself, that it is not of humanistic or general-education val-ue. It might suggest that athletics is physical education that succeeds and con-versely that physical education is athletics that fails. Let us rid ourselves of thattriangle and clear our minds of that imagery.1 1 5 146 OTHER REPRESENTATIONSLet us try some other graphic representations and with clear thinking de- velop a form that represents the situation better. Physical EducationI work with this one, but the form is not set. Differ from it if you wish. Form some logicalprofessional conclusions and block them out repre- sentatively. Knowledge, judgment, and thinking should be the basis for pro- fessional philosophy arid conduct.Here physical education has an integrity and a completeness. From the base may arise intramurals, athletics, club sports, casual sport, vigorous and in- tense participation, activity for body form and fitness, and others. These out- growths from the program are all part of the professional intentions and the planned inclusions. These extensions may be classified or drawn according to the nature of the participation itself or according to the nature and the needs of the participant. The width and length of the peaks may be formulated to re- present one of several elements, such as time spent, number of persons in- volved, degree of skill, and effort or intensity.In such a diagram we maintain the integrity of a profession and allow for individual professional variations in leadership and for personal choice for in- dividuals based upon life interests and needs.PROFESSIONIn the first paragraph I employed the word profession. In past experiences and discussions we may have heard these questions: Do we think we are a pro- fession? Do we want to be? Is education itself a profession? What are the char- acteristics of a profession?Characteristics of a ProfessionThe characteristics of a profession, compiled from the experiences and ide- as of fellow workers in our field of educators and of persons in some other pro- fessions are:I. There is an organized body of knowledge with an organized body of persons engaged in the calling. 146 147 2. There exists a measure or standard for developed knowledge and tech-nical skill and competency of the members based upon scientific and philo-sophic facts premised on scholarly endeavor.3. A standard is set for the selection of the members based upon their qual-ifications to accomplish the objectives of theprofession.4. There is an established self-regulation of the members and of the body.5. There exists an identifiable and essential service and a commitment ofnew members motivated by social concern in working for some aspect of thegood of society.6. There is a responsibility and autonomy. A professional group as a bodymust be competent to set the terms for the nature and conduct of its services.7. There is a pattern or code of ethical conduct.The AAHPER is working on a statement that will represent the beliefs andexpressions of its members in regard to ethical practices and conduct. The affil-iated organizations within the alliance are encouraged to develop their ownstatements and commitments that will reflect the specific interests of their pro-fessional services.Are we characterized by those conditions explained as characteristics. Arethose characteristics qualifications? Do we qualify as a profession? Do we havea body of knowledge and a body of qualified persons upon which we can builda profession? If we have any shortcomings, can we make up for them? Do weneed to? Can we eliminate our shortcomings and qualify as a profession? Dowe have any unusual ways of functioning? Do we have unique contributions tomake to education and to life's purposes and action? Shall we argue these assubstitutes for our shortcomings, or shall these be added to the strengths andgraces of our lives and service?We Have Unique and Identifying Qualitiesin the Profession of Physical EducationI. We have a life concept. We have an interdisciplinary approach to lifeand living through educative preparation for health, productivity, action, andthe joy of being. We have human concern and fellowship.2. We set goals that are both objective and subjective. We embrace !earn-ings that are both concrete and abstract. We give emphasis to both the real andthe ideal.3. We take personal responsibility, and through enlightened wisdom andapplied judgment we work with individuals on matters of critical importancein their lives.4. We believe that pay or recognition may not be in fullmeasure for ourqualification, productivity, service, or influence.5. We seek for excellence in ourselves as persons and professionals, and weseek as earnestly for the ways to aid others to know and live and enjoy fully theessential and the true quality of life.This profession is unique. It aims for more in total human results to beapplied and enjoyed in human living. It may accomplish many real but per-hapsimmeasurable objectives that may become unidentified in many life spansof unnumbered human beings.Our professional work in education and in the lives of people is repre-sentative of the many disciplines of education. Our work is quantitative andqualitative. Our work is directed toward both short-term and long-term objec-tives. We must employ as well as we can the methods and the measures and117 148 evaluations of the scientific and the humanistic disciplines. We must evaluatethe quantitative and the qualitative. We must work for and look for the short-term results, and we must strive for, wait for, and attempt to identify the long-term realizations.We have no triangles. We have a profession to serve. We have professionalproblems to solve. The athletic programs of AIAW and NCAA are within theencompassment of our professional problems. They carefully become the com-mitted concern and the labor of some of us.Our work in physical education, our endeavors in education, and our ex-pressions in life conduct are evidence of what we know well to practice andwhat we believe thoroughly enough to live and apply.As physical educators, we are examined every day. To fulfill the qual-ifications for a profession that deals wiih education and life, we must know andbelieve in and examine the fullness of our every endeavor, for \"the life which isunexamined is not worth living.\" 118 PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION MULTISTAGE STRESS TESTINGWILLIAM J. STONEArizona State UniversityThe multistage stress test serves two basic purposes: (I) it represents the ulti-mate test of physical fitness or physical work capacity, and (2) it is one of themost effective means of determining suspected or latent coronary heart disease.The former purpose is one associated primarily with physical educators or exer-cise physiologists. The latter purpose is in the purview of medicine, althoughthere is considerable overlapping in the interests of the groups. A more detaileddescription of the interests and responsibilities of each group is presented else-where by the author.?There is increasing use of multistage stress tests for medical purposes aswell as for screening in exercise programs. The recognition that a functional orstress test yields more information about the state of the heart and arteries hasbeen rapidly building with cardiologists. A multistage test with ECG (electro-cardiogram) is the most sophistica7ed test, short of coronary angiogram, in di-agnosing coronary artery disease.Directors are frequently requiring a multistage stress test for admission toadult fitness programs. In addition to medical information, the screening testyields baseline fitness information that can be used in prescribing exercise in-tensity, duration, and frequency. In many cases such tests are now conducted inuniversity laboratories and YMCAs.TYPES OF TESTSThe three modalities for stress testing include the treadmill, the bicycle er-gometer, and the step test. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but allthree techniques can utilize a multistage approach. The treadmill speed and el-evation can be increased progressively, the pedal rate and load on the bicycle er-gometer can be increased, and both step rate and height can be increased in thestep test. The major advantage of the multistage test is that it allows any sub-ject to begin at a load that can be tolerated and proceeds to a maximal level of.-stress for that individual. Thus, the early low level of stress operates as a warm-up and familiarizes the subject with the task. Experience in our laboratory hasled us to select the treadmill test as the preferred technique of testing. The sub-ject is less likely to exhibit local muscular fatigue with a walking-running test,and the motivation is externally applied.A maximal test is likely to yield more definitive information about the sub-ject than a submaximal test. Obviously it is unwise because of age or diseasepotential to apply a maximal test to some patients. In such cases, testing is usu-ally restricted to a set HR (heart rate) or symptoms, silent or otherwise. As-'rand' and Hellerstein3 use FIR limits; many other cardiologists recommend amaximal such as used by Cooper2 and Bruce.3 The assumption underlying a 149149 150 maximal test is that ECG or other abnormalities will not appear in some cases until the cardiovascular system is under maximum stress. This has been themajor criticism of the resting test and its later successor, the Masters Step Test.PROCEDURESThere has been a great deal of effort in recent years to establish acceptablepractices related to exercise testing and prescription. 2 3 5 tiThe American Col-legeof Sports Medicine willshortly publish guidelines dealing with re- sponsibilities for the various professions. Although the most sophisticated oftesting facilities will vary slightly in procedures, there is some consistency inprotocol.Before testing, a recent medical examination and health history are usuallyrequired. We pay particular attention to the identification of high-risk factors,such as obesity, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, sedentary living, smoking,heredity, and psychic stress. In addition, a legal release, or the signing of an in-formed consent statement, is mandatory.The decision to have a physician in attendance is usually determined bythe Age, health status, and fitness of the subject. Below the age of 30 the like-lihood of uncovering latent disease is remote in low-risk subjects. Most middle-aged persons, however, do not fall into a low-risk profile. Many physicians willrequire a preliminary 12-lead resting ECG for middle-aged subjects. Resusci-tative equipment and a defibrillator should be on hand with the physician.Resting FIR and BP (blood pressure) are obtained from the subject and atarget FIR are established as a guideline to load. The target HR is an estimateof maximum FIR, and we have found the 220age formula to be extremelypredictive, i.e., 220-40(age)=180 PMHR (predicted maximum HR). During thetest the FIR is recorded minute by minute with constant ECG monitoring. BPis recorded at least every three minutes or at the end of each stage of the test.'he test we have selected is the Bruce Multi-Stage Test, which can usually elicita maximum FIR .in a period of eight to twelve minutes.3 The test begins withslow walking (1.7 mph at 10 percent) and continues through three-minutestages until the subject fatigues.Several parameters could signal a premature cessation of the test, the mostimportant of which would be subject symptoms. Chest pain, faintness, nausea,or other excess discomfort are signals to stop the test. Among the more com-mon ECG abnormalities that might trigger the end of the test are: excess STsegment depression on ECG, PVC (premature ventricular contractions) runs,unusual I IR response, and arrythmia (irregular beats). Abnormal BP responseis another cause for concluding the test.POST-TEST CONSIDERATIONSCompletion of the multistage stress test with above average fitness leveland no cardiovascular abnormalities is perhaps one of life's most satisfying mo-ments for the iddle-aged subject. An exercise prescription will be based on thepatient's fitness level, age, and ECG tracing during the peak stress period andshould include frequency, intensity, and duration of the training period.Among the guidelines usually followed are: (I) exercise does not meet the in-tensity required to produce the maximum HR attained during testing, and (2)cardiovascular training effects can be achieved in the range of 60-80 percent ofthe maximum HR. There are several excellent sources for devising exercise pro-grams suitable to the individual's interests and needs. While the multistage150 151 stress test need not Ix repeated at frequent intervals, neither should the resultshe considered permanent. Periodic testing and reevaluation are in order, es- pecially in the middle-aged or older subject.REFERENCESI. 1970).2.

Stone, \"Exercise Testing and Prescription: The Physicianand the Physical Educator,\" The Physical Educator 31 (May 1974): UTILIZATION OF SOCIAL-LEARNING THEORYIN PHYSICAL EDUCATION'RONALD R. COULSONRutgers UniversityIt is the purpose of this presentation to (1) question the traditional personalityassessment methods used by the physical education profession; (2) expose youto the fundamental assumptions, constructions, and formulations of social-learning theory (SLT); and (3) suggest its application to a variety of mo-tivational questions in the field.The explanation of why an individual participates in sports or physicalac-tivity is a matter of conjecture. Persons interested in sport psychology have en-deavored to investigate the personality attributes of the sport participantthrough the use of various standardized psychological instruments, but the ma-jority of these studies have yielded inconsistent and contradictory results.2 Inter-pretation is therefore difficult. The personality profiles of the athlete, casualparticipant, and nonathlete continue to be unclear. Why is this? Could it be thetools used for measurement are based upon questionable assumptions thatmake them inadequate for prediction and understanding?QUESTIONING THE METHODThe instruments used by physical education have been the traditional state(psychodynamic, projective) and trait (Cattell, Edwards) approaches to person-ality assessment. The utilization of these methods has been commendable, but151 152 many contemporary psychologists have been critical of their use. Most notable1ve been Nlische1,3 Wallace,' and Rotter.5 The state and trait approaches as-me that all individuals possess generalized and enduring personality charac-teristics that manifest themselves across all situations. If a person is high in thetrait or state of aggression, this characteristic is assumed to guide him and dem-onstrate itself in all situations. The overwhelming majority of empirical evi-dene using these two approaches refutes this assumption. Highly generalizedbehavioral consistencies that appear across varied situations have not been dem-onstrated;6 yet we continue to use state and trait methods, perhaps hoping forclarification and insight. It appears that the additional gathering of state andtrait data is not warranted at this time.?What is the cause of this inadequacy and resulting criticism? Traditionalapproaches pay little attention to environmental conditions that are significantvariates in the determination of behavior. They endeavor to assess general char-acteristics and, therefore, cannot predict behaviors in various and specific situ-ations. Behavior specific to the situation and determined by environmentalstimuli and personality attributes is the trend in psychological theory.' Thishas intuitive appeal. For example, some people are very aggressive and com-petitive on the court or field but quite docile and submissive in nonsport situ-ations. Also, some individuals behave differently depending upon the sport orlevel of competition in which they are engaged. The specific situation in whichthe individual finds or places himself will have a causal effect upon his behav-ior. This point dictates the following: if high prediction and understanding ofbehavior are desired, tests must Ix devised to predict motive strengths in speci-fied situations or classes of situations and not to assess abstract generalized per-sonality needs or traits.9In summary, the state and trait methods of personality assessment havebeen ineffective in the prediction of physical activity behavior because theyhavefailed to consider the effect of specific situational influences in sport. Individu-als have different physical activity motives due to differences in past sport ex-periences and their individual perceptions of these experiences. Traditional ap-proaches that have no explicit reference to sport situations have been used byphysical educators unsuccessfully. They assess generalized personality needs,which lack the specificity necessary for prediction.AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVEWhat theoretical and assessment alternatives are there? Social-learning the-ory is one that warrants consideration. Its strengths combine to make it unique-ly comprehensible, operationally measurable, and highly predictive.The assumptions of SLT are straightforward. First, it rejects behavioralconsistency across situations and, therefore, the state and trait approaches.'\u00b0 Sec-ond, SLT rejects the psychodynamic drive-reduction mechanism in favor of amore cognitive approach.\" Man is goal oriented; he is driven by his ownthoughts, not by his subconscious or physiological drives. Third, a strong situ-ational stance is taken, which seeks the determinants of behavior in both psy-chological and situational realms with particular concern given to their inter-action.12 Therefore, personality and situational influences combine to directbehavior, which is an orientation not taken by the traditional methods men-tioned before. Fourth, behavior is goal directed and may be predicted throughknowledge of the individual's past learning experience and the behavioral situ-ation. Past experiences and observation have determined the value given to re-152 153 inlorcemnts of goals available in a situation and have determined the ex-pectancy of attaining them through .sixcific.behavior.\" The individual willchoose behavior based upon his experience that will maximize his attainmentof positive reinforcements.Generally speaking, SUE emphasizes the person's interaction with his so-( ial environment and what 1w learns from itin terms of values and ex-pectations. SLT is a flexible, dynamic theory to explain behavior choice andjxrsonality changes due to experience.BASIC CONSTRUCTS AND FORMULATIONSSeveral interrelated constructs are utilized in SLT, namely, behavior poten-tial (BP), reinforcement value (RV), and expectancy (E). The situation in'whichbehavior cxcurs is the fourth construct and is implicit in its effect upon the pre-vious three. (I will not deal with the internal-external locus of control otherthan to acknowledge its existence in passing.) RV is the. degree of a person'spreference for a particular reinforcement from a set of potential reinforcements.Itis the value placed upon a particular goal or set of goals in comparison toothers. Over a period of time, people establish and revise these values based onexperience. Obviously people value the rewards of sports differently and par-tic ipate in varying degrees. The construct of RV certainly has intuitive appeal.Measurement of RV is accomplished by having .subjects rate or rank rein-forcements to indicate preference. A Likert scale may be used as a convenientinethcx.1.The probability perceived by an indvidual that a particular reinforcementwill occur as the result of a specific Ixhavior on his part in a specific situ-ation(s) is defined as E. Subjects may indicate their E for a reinforcement byprobability statements or betting techniques. The greater the probability state-ment or bet, the higher the E of attaining a reinforcement. Again, past experi-ence dictatesthesubjectiveprobability or expectationof attaining rein-forcements. Some people have a small expectancy of achieving or winning insports and, therefore, do not participate.BP is the potentiality of any behavior occurring in any given situation(s)and is a function of RV and E: BP = f(RV & E))' When high value is placedupon reinforcements and they are highly expected, BP will be high. Behaviorswith the highest potential for any given situation are more likely to occur andshow greater frequency. For example, the motivation or potential for par-ticipating in basketball is a function of the value a person places 'upon makinga field goal, winning, running, jumping, making a rebound, etc., and the ex-pectation he has of achieving these goals. A person will choose basketball if itsBP ishigher than that of other behavioral alternatives. In terms of mea------surement, the quantity of BP is arrived at by using either an additive (BP = RV+ E) or multiplicative model (BP = RV x E).15 RV is a preference or ranking ofavailable reinforcements, E is a subjective probability statement of attainingthem, and BP is the resultant predictor of behavior. Note the theoretical defini-tions of RV and E lend themselves to being operationalized; this is a strength of FUNDAMENTAL PROCEDURESThe assumptions and constructs of this theory necessitate that the first stepin its use lx a detailed and rigorous examination of the situation in which pre-diction is desired. The interview, questionnaire, or other assessment technique153 154 used must be 'eremite(' to the specific environment in which behavioral choice`is to occur. In this way, subjects are permitted increased knowledge of a specificsituation causing their self-predictions, hypotheses of behavior, or self-reportsto increase in utility116 In this manner, control for cross-situational variation isenhanced, which results in greater situational specificity and, therefore, in-creased I nedic tion and understanding.,A list of reinforcements available in the situation of interest must be enu-merated. This compilation should consist of concrete reinforcements and goalsthe subject may attain. Reinforcements within the physical activity realm couldfall within homogeneous groups of social, achievement, ascetic, vertigo, es-thetic, health, and cathartic goals. Assessment and comparison of these rein-forcement groups would then benefit estimates of reliability and validity for testconstruction and hypothesis testing. It cannot be overemphasized that the ef-fects of situational variation upon self-reports of behavior must be controlledfor by referencing our instruments to a specific sport, physical education class,or physical activity.A QUESTION OF MOTIVATIONSI:I may be applied to several questions of major interest to physical edu-cators. First, students who exhibit varying degrees of BP or motivation for classparticipation could be grouped for instructional purposes. Programs could betailored to enhance and raise the value of expectancy of reinforcements in lessermotivated students. A second question aligned with the previous one is the ef-fect of various teaching styles, teacher behaviors, and program types on BP.The objective would be to identify methods that increase the value held forphysical activity and also increase the expectancy of attaining such rein-forcements as success, skill attainment, and enjoyment. The result may be an el-evation of the potentiality (BP) of engaging in activities and the promotion oflifetime participation.Crandall and McGhee report five studies investigating the relationship ofcourse grades and achievement test scores to self-estimates of the same. Subjectswere asked to estimate the probability of their best and worst course grade andachievement test score. In this manner subjects indicated their expected gradeand score. In all five studies with elementary, college, junior high, and high.school subjects, significant correlations were found between expectancies andactual course grades and achievement test scores.'? Studies by Battle's andCrandall, Katkovsky, and Preston\" report similar findings. Expectations were highly predictive of actual grade and score outcomes. Two related inter-pretations of these studies have merit: (I) the self-fulfilling prophecy is affectingacademic performance, and (2) the subject's expectancy statement is based upon past experience and is, therefore, a valid indication of ability, interest, and mo-tivation in the course. Subjects with low estimates of achievement could be giv-en specialized help. This could be done in physical education. Also, changes ininitial assessments of motivation clue to gymnasium experiences would be in-valuable in testing the worth of traditional and innovative methods.orcurricula.Third, SLT could be utilized for testing and counseling 'in professionalpreparation. Young persons must be sought who value the rewards the pro-fession has to offer and expect to be successful in attaining them. We wish topredict which members of our entering students are highly motivated to becomea teacher. For example, reinforcements could be grouped into homogeneous ar-eas such as those from teaching and those from coaching. Students highly mo-154 155 Ovate(' to coach and not to teach could be advised to take a coaching minorrather than a physical education major.Fourth, the prediction and understanding of various sport behaviors arealso ofinterest. The motives of athletes, informal participants, and non-participants could be investigated through analysis of their values and ex-pectancies. In addition, the motives for attending or avoiding physical edu-cation class could be analyzed. Also, the question of why a person continues toengage in physical activity or becomes sedentary may be answerable.An exploratory study undertaken by this author indicates the solution tothese questions may be possible. Its purpose was to investigate the utility of BP,RV, and E in predicting participation in organized sport. Using the basic pro-tett u re S previously mentioned, reinforcements available through sports par-ticipation were enumerated. The list of 69 items was compiled through the useof theories in sport psychology and the insight of experienced participants.Some examples include \"occupy my free time and physical appearance.\" To assess RV the subject indicated hispreference using a Likert scale of (I) extremely important, (2) very important,(3) important, (1) slightly important, and (5) not important. The sentence stem,\"I participate in sports to ...\" was implied to precede each reinforcement forrating. Identical items were presented to assess E using the scale (1) always ex-pected, (2) often expected, (3) sometimes expected, (4) seldom expected, and (5)never expected. In this assessment the stern \"In my future sports participationand experiences I expect to .\" was used. Subjects were 550 male and female members of physical education classes at the University of Maryland during thespring of 1971. The sample also included members of the 1973-74 University ofMaryland football and lacrosse teams. All subjects completed the questionnaireto rate their RV and E and also a sports information form giving pertinent de-mographic data.The analysis is not complete at this time, but a partial presentation offindings utilizing the male sample is appropriate. (The completed findings willbe available at some future date.) BP was found using the multiplicative modelby multiplying the subject's mean RV score by his mean E score. A 4 x 4 con-tingency table was completed to analyze the relationship of BP to participationin organized sport (Table I). Subjects were classified according to the quartilein which theirBPscore fell and whether they were a nonparticipant, informal(or recreational) participant, college intramural player, or intercollegiate ath-lete. (Note the unequal marginal frequencies for BP were caused by estimatedquartile ranges using a grouped-data technique.) An obtained X2 value of17.285 was found to be significant well beyond the .001 level, but a tau y) of.01 indicated the strength of the relationship was weak. It must be emphasized,however, that tau is a very conservative statistic. 1. 5 156 TABLE IContingency Table Analysis of BP for Sports Participation andReported < .001, 9 df.) The frequencies in rows one and four of Table I show a trend in the ex-pected directions; specifically, a greater number of low BP scores for non-participants and a corresponding greater number of high BP scores for inter-collegiate athletes were found. A significant but weak relationship does existbetween BP to participate in organized sport and reported participation. Itshould be noted that the instrument is assessing general sports participationand, therefore, lacks a desired degree of specificity. Also, this instrument did notuse homogeneous item groups for the assessment of reinforcements. This wouldhave been desirable for an estimate of reliability. Eventually this item pool willbe factor analyzed to detect homogeneous groupings and item selection com-pleted. The goal isthe presentation of reinforcements or groups of rein-forcements that discriminate among subjects demonstrating varying sport be-haviors. These tentative conclusions are reserved but optimism is implied.CONCLUSIONPersonality research in the area of psychology of sport and physical activitydone to date has been commendable but the need for new theories and ap-proaches is indicated. Assumptions and empirical findings of SET suggest thatit is an alternative of great potential in comparison to state and trait methodsof motivational and personality research. Its dual emphasis on environmentaland personality factors affecting behavior has received much empirical, the-oretical, and intuitive support. Kenyon's work in conceptualizing the physicalactivity situation by investigating personal attitudes is a beginning.20 If true in-sightisto be attained, we must rigorously analyze, conceptualize, oper-ationalize, and test within our own movement situations. Let us take the ini-tiative and move in this direction. 156 157 REFERENCES1.

CHURCHUniversity of MarylandInstruments that measure stress as well as truth have been available for sometime. I lowever, it has only been recently that the science of \"truth verification\"and meastitement of stress has become a big business, in spite of some evidencethat has cast doubt on the validity of lie detectors, stress evaluators, and similardevices.The use of these instruments has greatly expanded since the time in which;their sole use was interrogation in criminal cases. In order to curtail increasesin the rising cost of their operations, some businesses are attempting to elimi-nate employee theftsa significant amount according to the officers of the Mar-riott Corporation and other large businesses. Lie-detecting devices are in-creasingly being used to alleviate this problem. This is currently a serious issuewith unions and civil rights groups opposing this means of offsetting shrink-age plaguing many corporations and companies.Two instruments in the news recently appear to have a valuable potentialfor use in several facets of education, including physical education. The two machines are the Psychological Stress Evaluator and the Zero Input TrackingAnalyzer. Both machines. measure stress, but they measure different types ofstress and use different methods. No attempt will be made, therefore, to com-pare one against the other in the form of a consumer-report diagnosis.PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS EVALUATORFirst, we will examine the PSE (Psychological Stress Evaluator). The devel-opment of this machine is attributed to three men: Allen Bell, Bill Ford, andCharles McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, former lieutenant colonels, retiredfrom Army intelligence several years ago and formed a company called DektorCounterintelligence and Security. This was a logical career for two men whowere experts in technology of espionage. McQuiston was a secret agent in thearmy for 26 years. serving on all continents except Africa, and, in addition, isone of the foremost polygraph experts in the country. Bell was also a secretagent in the army and served 20 years in that capacity. Bill Ford served in Viet-nam in related duties and is an electronic designer. 153 159 The PSE grew from an effort to improve the lie detector. The conventionalpolygraphs measure four physiological variables: pulse, blood pressure, respira-tion, and perspiration. Some also measure additional variables. The more vari-ables that are measured, the more valid are the results of the polygraph. In care-ful examination of the voice, Bell and McQuiston discovered that thefrequencies that compose it are not fixed; they shift eight to fourteen times ev-ery second. However, when an individual is under stress, this normal modu-lation frequency disappears. The remaining frequencies are the pure com-ponent frequencies of the voice, and when this occurs, there is a strongindication that the individual is lying or is holding back critical information.Thus, superimposed on the audible voice are inaudible frequency modulations.The FM (frequency modulation) quality of a voice is susceptible to the amountof stress that one may be under. In extreme cases of stage fright this is easilyapparent even in the quality of the audible voice of a speaker or singer. Howev-er, to the human ear, a person under interrogation may sound perfectly normaland at ease, free of tremors or stress-revealing voice variations, when in factthere is little or no truth in his statements.The human body has two nervous systemsthe central nervous system andthe autonomic nervous system (and their various subdivisions). In each of thesethere are the voluntary reactions (controlled by the brain) and the involuntary,or reflex, reactions (not controlled by the brain). The PSE is capable of de-tecting the inaudible effect of stress on the voice. Internal stress is reflected in achange in the inaudible variations of the voice; these differences cannot beheard, but they can be recorded and detected by the PSE.The PSE as shown here (Fig. I) comes conveniently built into a Samsonitebriefcase. Bell and McQuiston originally were going to incorporate a device tomeasure this voice phenomenon as an additional channel of the polygraph.When they discovered that the new variable was such a reliable and accuratemeasure of psychological stress, there was felt no need to measure the otherstandard drive speed 160 The PSE has several advantages over the polygraph, since the use of thepolygraph requires theindividualbe strapped to a chair, with a pneu-mographic tube placed around his chest, electrodes glued to his palms, and ablood-pressure cuff placed on his arm. On the other hand, the PSE can be usedfrom a telephone conversation, a tape recorder, a record, or a direct interview.The device is used in conjunction with a four-speed Uher tape recorder that canbe manually wound back to locate a specific spot on the tape. The testimony tobe evaluated is recorded at a tape speed of 7'h inches of tape per second and thenplayed back, stopping at the beginning of the question. The recorder is thenplaced on a speed of 15/16 inches per second and played. The voicea low,muffled rumbleis no longer recognizable as human. As the tape recorder reels,slowly turn, the stylus on the PSE dances lightly across the moving chart -pa --per, leaving behind a clearly marked ragged trail of the audible and inaudiblevoice modulations. When the recorder is stopped, the chart paper and markingstops. The interpretation of the squiggly lines is left to the investigator's dis-cerning eves and analytical brain. The unstressed voice gives the appearance ofsharp, jagged, and irregular icebergs. In contrast, the stylus recording of the in-audible modulations of a voice under stress is as smooth as a freshly trimmedhedge.Figure 2 provides an excellent example of changes in charted voice modu-lations. This PSE charting was made from a taped recording of the con-versation between a pilot and copilot prior to a fatal crash.'After its development, the PSE was examined not only for validity of theinstrument and chart interpretation criteria but also for the limits of its appli-cability. It was particularly rewarding to discover its ability to accept narrativeanswers as well as yes/no in order to discriminate between degress of stress. Theinventors also felt that the PSE was capable of determining stress level on anabsolute rather than a relative basis)The first test series performed used the TV program \"To Tell The Truth.\"Only the statement \"My name is. ...\" was used for evaluation. Thus, it re,quired a short interpretation on an absolute basis. Of the 75 subject evaluationsmade, 71 were correctly identifieda success of 94.7 percent.'A Maryland county police chief polygraph examiner used simultaneouslythe PSE and the polygraph. Twenty-six cases containing 162 relevant elementswere corroborated by confession or investigation. The PSE evaluation providedthe subsequently corroborated results in all elements for a 100 percent success)Another test series was structured to provide for comparison reaction topresumed emotion-producing words and presumed neutral words. The subjectsread audibly words from each group from randomly presented cards. Of 52 ele-ments in the seven tests, 52 were correctly identified as to word group, for a suc-cess of 98.4 percent.'Over a thousand actual examinations have been carried out using the PSEin various ways, from psychiatric evaluation to criminal lie detection, with re-sults equaling or exceeding the original validity checks on the PSE by its'in-ventors. Explicit uses of the PSE up to now include preemployment screening,determining theft, evaluating employee morale, and discovering criminal activ-ities; users include criminologists, psychiatrists, law enforcement officials, com-mercial organizations, and an airplane research corporation) 160 161 There appear to tx several excellent possibilities for the use of the PSE inour physical education major programs:I. Screening and counseling majors.2. Examining the relationship of the student teacher's and the cooperatingteacher's stress.3.Evaluating the change of stress in various segments of a lesson (lectureversus demonstrations versus individual assistance).4.Comparing stress levels in the learning of different skills by major stu-dent; in general...Comparing stress levels in the learning of different skills by an individ-ual student.6.Studying stress in different discipline problems.7.Studying stress in methods of handling disciplinethis could be a studyof the child or youth as well as the student teacher.8.Studying stress in the use of different teaching methodsteacher orient-ed, child oriented, or a combination of these.9.Studying stress on the student teacher in relation to size of the group be-ing taught.10.Studying stress on the student teacher as to age of the group beingtaughtelementary, junior high, high school, peer group.I I.Comparing stress levels as to teaching environmentfield, gymnasium,pool, weight, or small exercise area.12.Comparing teaching stress when facility is shared with another teacherof same sex with stress when facility is shared with another teacher ofthe opposite sex.It would appear that the exciting possibilities for use in physical educationare both interesting and challenging. If you, your department, or institution isinterestedin the PSE,it would be necessaryto consult Dektor Counter- intelligence and Security, Springfield, Virginia. The present cost of the ma-chine is $4,200, which includes a two-day training course at the company re-quired for all purchasers. Unless the purchaser has a background incriminology, investigation, or psychology, an additional two-day course, whichfollows the basic course, is offered and recommended; there is a $200 charge forthis postbasic course.ConclusionsIt is suggested that an antagonistic view of the PSE should be considered.Even though the validity checks by the inventors are excellent, there are otherswho have not had these outstanding results.According to William Raspberry, a Washington Post columnist, a reportcompleted for the Army Land Warfare Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Groundindicated that the PSE was significantly less accurate than the polygraph. Also,the report said the PSE was, in some ways, less reliable than judgments madeon the basis of simply observing a subject's behavior. Also, a Fordham Univer-sity professor, under contract with the army, tested students who were usingrole-playing techniques involving a criminal act. He found the polygraph gavean overall accuracy of 76 percent, but the PSE only produced an embarrassing33 percent accuracy.2Possibly the PSE is not as effective on an absolute basis as the inventorsbelieve, but given a relative base to refer to, the machine has consistently beensuccessful. It is obvious, though, that role playing and other trivia-type games161 No StressStatement:\"Up gear.\"Situation:Pilot orders landing gear raised to startroutine training exercise on missedapproach.

In attempting to correct the mal-function, the crew neglected to restore power to the idling engine. Because of the unequal thrust, the aircraft devel-oped an extreme yaw cross-coupled with a roll and crashed in an inverted attitude, killing all the crew.Figure 2.Sample Voice Analysis of Cockpit Recording during an Aircraft Accident 164 cannot appoac hsituations in developing stress. Countering some ofthese negative reports is a dc ision made September 1974 in a special hearing inFlorida; it was recommended to the Florida Department of State that the PSEbe used as an acceptable lie detection device.3ZITA /ADTNorman K. Walker, inventor of ZITA/ADT (Zero Input Tracing Analyzer/Auxiliary Distraction Task,) became interested in how poeple act under stresswhen he worked on guided missiles for the Royal Air Force in England in theearly 1950s. Walker accepted the ability of the missile, but he was concernedwith the performance of man in guiding the missile in combat and'even more,man's performance if the enemy is returning fire. Although there were graphson missile performance and none on man, there was evidence that performanceof even simple tasks deteriorated in combat conditions. His interest in the influ-ence of stress was further heightened when he visited the Gettysburg battlefieldand saw an exhibit of Confederate rifles that had been loaded as many as fivetimes without being fired. Even though the soldiers were seasoned infantrymen,they apparently panicked under the Union bombardment and habitually loadedtheir rifles without firing. This initiated Walker's investigation of bombingtel cards from World 'War II and the Korean conflict. He found there was a pat-tern of error under stress; the errors occurred in simple taskssetting a dial,pulling a lever, pushing a button, twisting a knob.'Prom this background of experience and increased interest, the devel-opmnt of /SEA began, with Walker deciding to measure man's performanceby using as a functional base the simplest things a man can do.4In the early 1900s, using an early model of ZITA, Walker tried to convinceGreat Britain and the United States that he could select better fighter pilots andhelicopter gunners. His efforts were rewarded with small contracts, but hecould not vindicate %HA for large-scale use.'Accidently, a physician friend found that the machine had attributes otherthan the ability to identify pilots who could perform successfully during com-bat; the instrument is equally good in spotting children with minimal braindamage. Even more valuable, ZITA has functioned successfully with a child asvoting as four and can determine those who will be hyperactive as a result ofbrain damage. This early diagnosis means that many of these children can besuccessfully treated prior to entering school. Needless to say, this is importantfor the curtailment of many psychological and social problems. The machinehas been able to identify correctly many minimally brain-damaged childrenabout whom the doctors were unaware. Walker and his IISSOCIaLCS now estimateapproximately 5 percent of the children have various degrees of hyperactivitydue to minimal brain damage; this is a much greater amount than anyonesuspectecl.4In fourteen years of evolution, the ziTA/ADT system has been developedfor the purpose of measuring human performance on a wide variety of tasksand under stress conditions. Originally developed and used for the selection offighter pilots, it is also being used to diagnose a variety of problems of childrenand youth, and it is used experimentally to identify suitability for certain jobs.%ITN, ADT is a very simple but accurate simulator that presents to thesubject a series of tasks. each of which represents the essential elements of somereal-world task, according to Walker. There are three basic tasks developed forthe device; these are arbitrarily identified as Task A, Task B, and Task D. The164 165 easiest task, 'Fask D, is said tc, lw equivalent to flying a stable plane or driving a car, probably on a bumpy road, because continuous oscillating movements ofthe control are necessary. Task A is the next most difficult task, and this is re- lated to landing a light airplane or controlling a car on ice. The most difficult is Task B; the subject must adjust for a 1.25-second delay a spot of light that is controlled by a lever. This task is equated to a difficulty similar to landing a Boeing 727 with one engine out or controlling a tractor trailerbyice. The Z1TA/ADT instrument that is presently being used by Walker Associ-ates weighs alx)ut 40 pounds and fits in two medium-sized suitcases (Fig. 3). By courtesy of the Washington Post. Figure 3.Norman Walker, Stress Tests, and ZITA/ADT. -4 166 The testing unit (tumults a small television screen that contains two horizontallines and two vertical lines 1)etween the hotizontal lines in the center of thescreen. Itis the task of the subject to keep a small moving dot of light betweenthese vein( al lines though manipulation of a lever. The lever is protrudingAmt. a small box placed in front of the subject. The lever moves only left ortight, and this is also true of the moving clot.In addition to this, the ADT produces an element that makes even themost simple task impossible for many hyperactive children. The ADT providestwo soundsa short high sound called a \"ping\" by Walker and a short lOwsound called a \"pong.\" \"lo the left of the stibject (if his right hand is domi-nant) is another small box with two buttons at ranged vertically. The top but-\u00abm is to be pressed with the left hand when the ping is heard, and the lowerbutton is pressed when the pong occurs. The ping or pong is given on a ran-dom basis, but the frequency in which any sound is produced may be regulatedfront 2 to 5ond.s. When Task B, which provides a 1.25-second delay of thereaction of the movement of the lighted spot, is added to the ADT task havinga 2-second frequency of the sounds, an extremely difficult task,-which requiresweal. concentration, is presented to the subject. The instrument panel has con-nols lot adjustment in selection of the desired difficulty.The ladout of the performance appears after 30 seconds in the other unit,whit Itis a digital panel meter. A permanent record of the trail is given on aRusnak pen recorder. Small flashes of light indicate errors on the digital scopeface.ConclusionsIhe testing tec !illicitly has been 'anted to such a level that it is now known how many practice trials should be given to establish the base per-formance; how many trials are best; and how best to order the presentation ofthe various tasks. ZITA ADT, according to Walker, is not an exclusive, self-suf-ficient test;itis a convenient means for summarizing all forms of psychomotorperformance as well as the effects of stress, but \"personality\" information isalso re\u00abnninended. Walker Associates, has records of subjects who failed or al-most failed in difficult occupational functionings despite excellent performanceon ZITA ADTpssibly these people are basically unreliable, reckless, or diffi-dent. Nevertheless, itis difficult to justify a prediction that anyone who hasproduced a less than average ZITA ADT score will do well in a stressful oc-cupation. In some cases, an individual older than average who has accumulatedonsiderable job experience can and does compensate for his other deficiencies.6Itis more difficult to determine as much application of this instrument asof the PSE in developing a superior physical education teacher. Possibly thegreatest potential, at the moment, would be its use to enhance those programsthat are directed to preparing majors for teaching of preschool children andthose in the elementary schools. Use, exposure, and additional application byWalker Assoc iates and others will, no doubt, add other possibilities in thefuture.REFERENCESI.

Sometimes, es-pecially with younger children, behavior patterns developed elsewhere gener-alize to a new physical education setting. If these generalized behavior patternsare supported in physical education, they will become stronger, and if they aredesisted, alternate patterns will begin to emerge as students discriminate the be-havioral roles expected of them in various educational settings. The majorpoint here is that behaviors contributing to effective classroom management, nomatter how one defines that concept, are learned. Likewise, teacher behaviorsand teacher skills that can be useful in helping students to learn self-manage-ment skills in physical education are themselves learned.Since both student and teacher behaviors relative to management are!earned. the question remains as to how they normally are learned. It has beenour experience that both student and teacher behavior relative to classroommanagement are learned in a haphazard, unsystematic fashion through the un-planned effects of teacher-student interactions and other equally unplanned andunanalysed environmental factors. The purpose of this paper is to outline stra-tegies for teaching students how to behave appropriately in physical educationsettings and teaching teachers how to arrange factors in these settings so thatlearning occurs in a systematic, positive manner.There are several recurring themes, throughout this paper. The first is thatof learned behavior; what we are talking about in classroom management arestudent and teacher behavior patterns that are learned and can be analyzed andtaught in a teacher education program. The second theme is that of stimuluscontrol, the antecedent events (cues, prompts, etc.) that a teacher provides tohelp students learn to discriminate appropriate role behavior. The third themeisthat of using teacher behavior in the form of teacher reactions as con-167 168 sequential events to provide teinforcementifeedback/punishment in the learn-ing sequence. A fourth theme is that of using artifical or extrinsic consequencesas reinforcement.:feeciback/punishment variables inteachingself-management.The third and fourth themes represent two variations of the same learning vari-able. Together with the student behaviors to be learned, the standard three-termed contingency for learning, i.e., an antecedent stimulus condition, a be-havior, and feedbackireinforcement, becomes apparent. There is a fifth themethat worked its way into this paper and that is the existence of a continuum oflearning approaches that range from highly systematic to less systematic andfrom highly formal to informal. The point on this continuum that is needed toteach effective classroom management skills to students depends on the currentbehavior cif the students and the degree to which they are amenable or resistantto some of the less formal approaches.DEFINITIONS OF BEHAVIORSIMPORTANT TO CLASSROOM MANAGEMENTWe divide management into two fairly distinct behavioral groupings. Inone sense ( lassroom management can be judged in terms of the amount of timedevoted to managerial endeavors, such as roll taking, switching stations, mov-ing from space to space, getting organized to start a game, and attending to in-struction once a signal for such attention has been given. The basic behaviorcategory that we use for this is the managerial episode,the amount of timefrom the onset of a managerial cue (usually issued by a teacher but not neces-sarily so) until students actually begin the next productive sequence, whichmay be listening ui teacher instruction or starting a game. The definition ofmanagerial episodes assumes that little if any productive learning goes on dur-ing this time and also that there are likely to be higher rates of disruptive be-haviorduringthis time. The goal is obviously to reduce the length of such epi-sodes. The measurement of a managerial episode is by duration of time andreflects a student-behavior or product measurement.A second behavioral category within this grouping is teacher managerialbehaviors,any prompts, cues, or other antecedent teacher behaviors that assiststudents. in discriminating roles in management. Notice that these are notteacher reactions. A teacher who tells a class to form four volleyball teams ofseven members so that they are in proper formation to begin a game has emitted one managerial behavior. The teacher who has to place each student in po-sition has emitted a great many more. The goal here is to reduce the number ofmanagerial behaviors per managerial episode. There is obviously a relationshipbetween the number of managerial behaviors emitted and the length of the epi-sode, and we operationally define student self-management as that condition inwhich students spend a minimum amount'of time in managerial activity withas few teacher prompts as possible.\"Pic second 1whavioral grouping relative to effective management is that ofappropriate student behavior, what is normally referred to as \"discipline.\" Weuse a three-tiered categorization of student behavior in this grouping. The baseof the categorization scheme is student behavior considered appropriate for thesetting and the specific situation within it. For example, it is appropriate forstudents to talk among themselves most of the time, but the same behavior isinappropriate if emitted while the teacher is giving instruction. The second lev-el is productive student behavior, defined generally as behavior that contributesto learning. Listening to a teacher is considered to be both appropriate and168 169 produc rive, while standing in line talking with a classmate is appropriate butnot pnxluctive. The third category is active learning and refers to actual phys-ical involvement with the activity-lesson. In this case, listening to a teacher,while both appropriate and productive, would not be considered to be activelearning. \"Fire goal, of course, is to have a high percentage of student behaviorthat is appropriate, productive, and active. The major method for measuringstudent. behavior in these categories is to count, at any given moment, the num-ber of students engaged in one or more of the defined categories. These fre-quency count data can be converted to a percentage figure that reflects the de-gree to which the class can be said to be \"well disciplined.\"The major teacher behavior categories that arc useful in assessing class-room management in this second sense are teacher reactions. The simplestinetlux1 hereisto dichotomize teacher behavior into (I) reactions to inap-propriate student behavior and (2) reactions to appropriate student behavior. Itcan then be seen that simple frequency counts of these reactions, when com-bined with an estimate of the percentage of students behaving appropriately,will provide a good measure of both the level of discipline (student behavior)and the means whereby that discipline is maintained (teacher behavior). Ourgoal is to have a high rate of discipline with an equally high rate of positiveter( her reactions, thus promoting positive classrootn discipline.LETTING STUDENTS KNOW THE RULES OF THE GAMEItis important to remember that the teacher's functional behaviors in re-lation to effective classroom management can be seen as those that precede stu-dent 1whavior and those that are reactions to student behavior. It is our con-tention that effective teacher preparatory activities and behaviors will serve toreduce management problems, both in terms of managerial episodes and rate ofappropriate behavior. An ancillary benefit of the proper use of antecedentevents is that it may allow for a substantial reduction in negative teacher reac-tions that so often characterize discipline.itis important that teachers learn how to prepare and utilize techniquesthat provide for students clear guidelines for organization and appropriate be-havior. The premise for this reflects one of our basic themes, so elementary infact that it too often escapes attention. Students cannot learn how to behave inthe physical education setting unless they are informed what appropriate be-havior means for that setting. In effect, the teacher must lay down some groundrules for organizing and behaving in the gym. These rules might include suchbehaviors as attending class, being on time, being dressed appropriately, andbeing in the appropriate place at.the start of class. As mundane as these behav-iors might appear to he, we all know how difficult it is for a teacher to accom-plish anything unless they occur with regular frequency. These behaviors arelearned and should not be taken for granted. Most important, they may need di-re( t teaching attention in order to boost their frequency of occurrence to the de-sired level.Guidelines for class organization and change of activity can be presented inseveral ways. Teachers may hand out guidelines with information about behav-iors that are of sufficient generality that they apply irrespective of the class ac-tivity. Specific guidelines for the day's activities may be posted conspicuously.Even more specific information may Ix' posted at different \"stations\" withguidelines for organization and use of equipment. For example, a technique wehave found useful is to post the clay's first activity and the organizational pat-tern necessary to get it started in a conspicuous place near where students enterthe gym. If the class has already been taught a concept of starting time, the169 170 teacher can expect that atthat. starting time the class will be in the or- ganizational pattern necessary to begin the first activity with the shortest possi-ble managerial episode.Guidelines for appropriate behavior can be similarly developed. They needto be spelled out clearly, posted conspicuously, and, at the outset, referred to of- ten so that students can be cued as to what behavioral roles are expected ofthem within the context of the activity environment.Teacher signals can also be 'earned. Students need to change activities. Some group feedback may need to be given. In order to accomplish this, the at- tention of the group needs to be engaged. A signal for attention should betaught with the goal of emitting it only once and having the shortest possible amount of time lapse between its emission and the accomplishment of the goal,be it the attention of the group or the changing of activities.It should be mentioned here, although it will be referred to in greater de- tail in the following sections, that we are always cognizant of the three-termedcontingency for learning. Rules, protnpts, and other antecedent variables willbe of little use if they are not tied specifically and contingently to student be- havior and if they are not followed by consequences that support or desist the behaviors according to the general plan. Don't expect to post class rules and suddenly turn chaos into order. The process of learning is seldom immediateand in any case will not occur unless the other aspects of the three-termed con- tingency are attended to.THE USE OF GAMES AND CONTRACTS FOR MANAGEMENTOften a class is so disruptive that it needs to be turned around quickly.Such a situation calls for the use of a formal, systematic program for teaching proper organization and appropriate behavior patterns. The following is a management game used in a study with student teachers at the junior high lev-el) Baseline observations indicated that an inordinate amount of time was be- ing spent in management, mean times as high as 2:30 per episode, with a mean of 4-6 managerial behaviors occurring in each episode. Game contingencieswere developed and variable amounts of \"free time\" could be earned by (1) allstudents being in assigned places and attentive by the class starting time, (2) allstudents being attentive to teacher within 5 seconds of the attention signal, and(3) all students completing organizational changes within 20 seconds of the go signal. This was a group contingency and all students had to be behaving ac- cordingly if the free time was to be earned. Free time was accumulated and usedonce per week for activities that the students had designated as reward activities(a minimum of three activities was always available during free time). With thisgame format, the mean time per managerial episode was reduced to less than 30seconds, and the managerial behaviors per episode were reduced to a mean of 1.5 per episode. The total savings in time per class ran as much as 12 minutes, which could then be used for instruction and/or activity.Another type of good - behavior game was used by McKenzie and Rushall inan age group swimming setting.2 This game was called \"disqualification.\"Each swimmer was assigned to a team. Any swimmer resting between work units could disqualify any other swimmer in the same lane. Swimmers could be disqualified for (1) unnecessary stopping, (2) not pushing off, (3) not swim- ming in, (l) changing stroke, or (5) not following the rules of the game, As you can see, this game was designed to promote appropriate workout behaviors. To170 171 disqualify a swimmer, another swimmer had to (I) see the behavior, (2) notifythe swimmer why he was disqualified, and (3) write a small din the swimmer's unit space on the training program board. The team with the fewest d's wonthe game each clay and earned the rewards, which were small and mostly hu-morous. The number of inappropriate target behaviors was reduced dra-matically through this game format.We have used a different type of behavior game with great success at theelementary leve1.3This is a far more standard behavior game in the sense thatall teams may win, competing against a behavioral standard rather than oneanother. In this game format the procedure is to (1) post rules and explainthem clearly (these are the appropriate and inappropriate behaviors), (2) dividethe class into teams, (3) set a criterion for winning the game, (4) program a cas- sette tape so that a loud noise occurs at a variable time interval, (5) check eachteam for the target behaviors whenever the sound occurs, (6) praise each teamthat earns a point and tell each team that does not why it did not, and (7) keepaccount of the points so that rewards may be administered. Rewards in this for-mat have always been extra gym time to engage in activities chosen by the stu-dents as favored activities, a simple application of what is now generally re-ferred to ati the \"Premack Principle.\"All research indicates that behavior games such as the one just outlinedcan be almost immediately effective in dramatically increasing rates of appro-priate behavior. The games can be a group contingency, small group con-tingency (teams), Or even individual student contingency, although the games get progressively more difficult to administer as one moves toward individualcontingencies. We have found that with four to six squads, small group con- tingencies can he administered with no more than 10 seconds spent each time apreprogrammed noise signal goes off. For those of you who remember your be-ginning psychology, you will have noticed that the variable timing feature is asimple variable interval schedule of reinforcement, well known for its ability toproduce persistent rates of response. We normally program four to six tapes,trying to reduce the number of noise-checks as the game progresses (stretchingthe interval on the variable interval schedule). We have also found withamazing regularity that students will usually behave in a manner so that thecriterion standard is met, i.e., if you raise or lower the criterion, students will raise or lower their behavior to meet that criterion.A good-behavior game can also be accomplished in the form of a behaviorcontract. A behavior contract lists, for the class or individual student, the be-haviors that are acceptable or unacceptable and the rewards to be earned for ful-filling the contract. The contract is jointly agreed to by the student and teacher(and occasionally by the parent and/or administrator) and signed by each party.Records of student behavior are kept and the contracted rewards (or pun-ishments) are administered according to the predetermined schedule.THE ['SE OF TEACHER REACTIONS FOR MANAGEMENTWe arc not trying to avoid the fact that teachers do react in negative man-ners to inappropriate behaviors and that this form of teaching, which we call adesist, is often necessary. The common scenario in the gym is for a student toemit a behavior that interferes with the learning objectives and the behavior isfollowed quickly by abe quiet,\" \"stop that,\" or sometimes just a good, hardglare. This daily drama puts many teachers into negative interactive roles vis -a-vis their students: they become hard-nosed disciplinarians. The desist is a useful171 172 management technique, but it should be used infrequently and dispassionately.Unfortunately, in most teaching situations we have found its use to be bothhighly frequent and too often accompanied by more than a bit of passion.There is no doubt that mean time per managerial episode and appropriate stu-dent behavior can be taught through coercion and punishment. That this canbe done does not mean that it should be clone.In order to reduce the tensions and antagonisms that coercion and pun-ishment generate, an alternative for the teacher is to utilize praise and approvalto encourage the frequency of effective organization and appropriate behaviorswhen they occur. Basically, we arc suggesting that teachers pay attention fre-quently to students who organize quickly and behave well and that converselythey reduce the frequency with which they attend to students who organizeslowly and misbehave.Praise and approval in the form of teacher verlial/nonverbal behavior hasbeen employed MOH' extensively than any other technique to improve class-room management. The effectiveness of positive teacher reactions for improvingappropriate student behavior seems to hold irrespective of most subject charac-teristics, such as age, sex, ability, and personality.5 6 Teacher approval con-tingent upon the emission of targeted managerial student behaviors willgradu-ally increase the frequency of these behaviors. The strategy will, in the longerrun, yield much greater dividends than emphasizing student misbehavior.Teacher approval, of course, can and should also be used for interacting withstudents contingent on a host of desirable school and nonschool factors.Praise should be given consistently and frequently at the outset. Thequickest way to increase a target behavior is to praise it consistently and fre-quently. The consistency should always be present; the frequency can be re-duced gradually so that intermittent and finally occasional praise will suffice tomaintain the behavior at desirable strength. Inconsistent teacher reactions willproduce inconsistent student behavior. This fact cannot be avoided.One of the most important variables affecting the reinforcement quality ofapproval is the perceived sincerity of that approval. To establish credibility ofapproval with students, it is wise to approve those behaviors that the studentwould consider important. One of the best ways to determine this is to watchstudents to see the kinds of activities in which they beSt like to engage. If a stu-dent likes to play basketball and his strength is rebounding, initially focus yourpraise on this 1.1-itivior, and you are on your way to having the student perceivethe approval as sincere. Another criterion for sincerity is to make sure that theapproval is commensurate with the performance of the student. An excellentguideline here is to specificity and timing of the feedback. The frequency of thedesired student behavior can be strengthened if the teacher's feedback is specificand immediate. This is not meant to imply that summary statements of praiseto students at the end of class have no positive effect. The more praise state-ymeats the better. But the efficacy of the specificity and immediacy implies thattheteacher really is attending to the specific behavior of the student and avoidswhat has been called the \"global good.\"Sincerity will be viewed with suspicion if praise statements are redundant.Variety is not only the spice of life but an excellent ingredient to improve theeffect of praise statements. Variety refers not only to the verbal content of thepraise statement but also to the actual flamboyance of the approval. -Studentswill be skeptical of approval that is gratuitous or extreme. Repeated use ofterms that imply that the student's performance is the very best you have ever seen eventually conveys the impression of carelessness and insincerity in thepraise.172 173 Recent research on student tea( hers? 8 e t\u00b0 \" suggests that rates of positiveteacher reactions are very low and that negative reactions are consistently high.These same studies indicate that these trends can be reversed by a number of in-tervention techniques: there is no longer any doubt that a teacher's basic inter-action style can be changed quickly and dramatically.A word or two needs to be said regarding negative teacher reactions.Tea( her verbal and nonverbal punishment seems to be almost a natural tool Forclassroom control. It is used often because it works quickly, and the fact that itworks quickly tends to reinforce its use by the teacher. Some evidence, however,indicates that teacher punishment reactions may have the tendency to increasethe frequency of student misbehavior.12 Regardless of the behavioral outcome,the frequent use of punishment usually results in an atmosphere of fear and co-ercion. This need not be. Punishment can be delivered usefully when the needarises without the unwanted side effects. If a negative reaction is used to desist abehavior, it must he used dispassionately, i.e., the student must know that it isthe behavior that is being desisted and that the punishment does not imply alack of worth in the student. Individual behavior contracts can build in aversiveconsequences as easily as positive ones. In this way the punishment is adminis-tered merely as a fulfillment of the agreed upon contract and accomplishes thedesist without the side effects of antagonism and fear.Another form of punishment that has shown to be effective is time-out, theremoval of the student from all potential sources of reinforcement for a speci-fied time period. It does not include sitting a student in a corner where he canbe ridiculed by other students. The time-out area should be apart from otherstudents visually and physically and devoid of potentially positive con-sequences. A caution is useful here. The concept of time-out assumes that theactivity from which the student is removed is more reinforcing than the time-out space. One sometimes finds a student for whom this is not true, who willmisbehave in physical education in order to escape to the time-out space.Another strategy for reducing misbehavior is for the teacher simply to ig-nore it. Behaviorally, this technique is referred to as extinction. Like most be-havioral techniques, extinction must be consistent if it is to be effective. If youset out to extinguish a behavior through ignoring it and then occasionally payattention to it, you are more likely to strengthen it than desist it.Some behavior cannot be ignored, nor is there time to write contractsnotwhen one student is about to do another in. A punishing desist should be givenquickly and strongly, and must indicate to the student what behavior has beendesisted. If this can be accomplished without getting angry, then it is a usefulmanagement. technique. One of the ways in which teachers can help themselvesis to list those student behaviors that they will ignore, those that they 'willpraise, and those that require an immediate desist. This list can act as a promptfor the teacher as he attempts to become consistent in interacting with students.For effective classroom management, a teacher has several Methods fromwhich to choose, but regardless of which methods or combination of methodschosen, the guidelines of consistency, specificity, sincerity, immediacy, and vari-ety of teacher reactions should be followed. Ideally, teacher behavior should beused as an informal and natural managerial technique. However, many times ateacher may start with the informal approach and then have to switch to a for-mal method, such as a behavior game, in order to accomplish goals quickly.Once behavior is learned, the goal should be to gradually move back to the in-formal techniques.173 174 Whatever management t CChilique is chosen will usually yield better resultsthan simply 'attending to student mistakes and reacting negatively until thepoint is reached where the teacher blows up. The less time we spend in manag-ing our students, the more time will be left for learning. Positive discipline isbetter than negative discipline. These techniques can be learned by preserviceteachers. The evidence is abundant that they work. They deserve to be includedas skills in professional preparation programs.REFERENCESI. Daryl Siedentop.

Albert Shanker, president of theAmerican Federation of Teachers, estimates that 250,000 persons trained asteachers cannot currently find teaching positions) In addition, Shanker believesthat the situation will grow worse. On NBC's hour-long commentary show\"Speaking Freely,\" he said, \"The way things are going now, by the end of thisdecade there may be one unemployed teacher for every one who's employed.\"2Since Shanker represents the largest labor union of teachers in the country, hisestimates on current and future unemployment for teachers might be suspect.However, a recent article in Time states, \"Around the country, there are farmore teachers than jobs; 107,000 teacher-graduates could not find academicposts last year.\"'Although the current unemployment estimates cited appear to be at vari-ance, the inclusion or exclusion of different subpopulations of the teachingcorps could bring these two estimates into closer harmony. In any event, it ap-pears safe to say that a large number of prepared teachers cannot currently findemployment. As far as future employment projections are concerned, the Centerfor Advanced Computation, based on an analysis of data supplied by the Unit-ed States Bureau of Labor Statistics, appears to be in substantial agreementwith Shanker's view, namely, that there will be a significant oversupply ofteachers in the years ahead.'At this point one might be tempted to ask, What has happened? Howcould the job picture for teachers have changed so radically, and what are theimplications for the profession of physical education? As with most difficultquestions, the answers are rarely simple or wholly satisfactory; however. ananalysis of recent societal trends might answer some of our questions and, moreimportant, suggest courses of action that might minimize the negative impactof the employment crisis on our profession.SOCIETAL TRENDSSince employment is a function of the social dynamics of a society, an ex-amination of socioeconomic trends of the United States appears to be a logicalstarting point in our attempt to come to grips with the dimensions and impli-cations of the current job crisis for teachers in general and physical educators inparticular. Specifically, it appears that the dynamics of population and eco-nomics have had the greatest effect on the employment picture of teachers in re-cent years. To a lesser degree political intervention has also had a differentialeffect on the problem of teacher employment.Population DynamicsMore than any other single factor the demographics operating in thiscountry over the last 25 years have affected the current job crisis in our pro-fession. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, this country experienced an unprece-dented rise in the birth rate. This \"baby boom\" had an immediate and progres-175 176 sive effect on the educational enterprise of this country, an effect that is stillbeing felt. But from the perspective of 1975, the dynamics set in motion at thetime of the baby boom are now seriously undermining the physical educator's(particularly the recent graduate's) chances of finding employment in teaching.More specifically, the baby boom produced an urgency on the part of theeducational establishment to build schools and to train and hire teachers. Dur-ing this frantic period, teacher-training institutions expanded enrollments tre-mendously, and even with all burners working, they were still hard pressed tomeet the demands for qualified teachers. It was during the early and mid-1960s,the period of peak demand, that the federal government began to take a moreactive part in helping teacher-training institutions prepare teachers. The Na-tional Teachers Corps probably represented the most overt example of federalinvolvement in attempting to close the gap between supply and demand forteachers during this period.Unfortunately about midway through this unprecedented growth periodthere was an ominous, yet largely ignored, turnaround in the population dy-namics of the country: the baby boom was over. The evidence also showed thatthe end of the boom was not to be followed by a normalization of the birthratebut suggested a rather precipitous reduction in the birthrate nationwide, a re-duction continuing up to the present day. According to a recent United Nationsreport. \"population growth in the United States is now below 1 percent a yearand approaching zero.\"5Figure I graphically represents the population dynamics referred to above.Based on live births per 1,000 population from 1944 to 1974 one can readilyverify the boom period followed by a relatively precipitous drop in live birthsper 1,000 population over the last seventeen years. Figure 2, on the other hand, 3028262422201816 14194,Figure 1.Live Birthsper 1,000 Population Projections based on1974 United Nations report Source of Data:Office of Population Research,Princeton University 464850525456586062646668707274 170 Birthrate177 Figure settled,tenured teachersRecent graduates,present school-agepopulation 194147505356596265687174Years suggests the effects the interaction of the birth curve has had and continues tohave on the employment picture of teachers, particularly tomorrow's teacher.Also implied in Figure 2 is the suggestion that the population dynamics set inmotion during recent decades will continue to depress the job market for teach-ers for the foreseeable future.Thus, to summarize the effects of population dynamics on the current jobcrisis in physical education, we see that supply has obviously run ahead of de-mand. Since supply-demand relationships govern job outlook, the job prospectsfor the physical educator are poor. Could this situation have been anticipated?The answer appears to be yes, for the evidence was there for all to see. Howev-er, for a host of reasons, some of them self-serving, the evidence was generallyignored.While the recent demographic changes in the United States are sufficient tocause a depressed job market for physical educators, there is yet another recentsocietal trend that has acted to compound the problem.EconomicsIt is obvious even to the most casual observer that job prospects and thegeneral health of the economy are interrelated. In times of strong economicgrowth the job prospects, particularly for the college educated, are bright.When there is an economic downturn jobs become scarce.As we all know, the current economic situation nationwide is bleak andgrowing worse. Fortunately, economic conditions are more cyclical over theshort term and responsive to a greater or lesser extent to external controls. Nev-177 178 ertheless, it appears that for the present and near future, we can expect the eco- nomic conditions of the nation to contiltite to exert a negative force on job prospects for teachers. Thus, if the population dynamics of recent decades are the principal factor contributing to the current depressed job market for the physical educator, then, most assuredly, the economic realities of the past few years are compounding the problem even further.For the purpose of clarification, the following examples suggest how eco- nomic conditions have influenced the current job market for teachers:I.Federal and local governments have cut hack on funds previously ear- marked for education.2. Local school boards have tightened their belts by reducing staff andservices.3. Potential retirees have tended to postpone retirement as a hedge against inflation.I.Potential attrition (other than retirements) out of teaching has slowed.5.In the struggle to balance family budgets, housewives who were once teachers have returned to the schools to resume their teaching careers. 6. Professionals (nonteachers) affected by the initial economic downturn of a few years ago have sought and gained employment as teachers.Undoubtedly, there exists a host of other factors also contributing to the urrent job crisis in teaching that could be examined under the rubric of soci-etal trends, but it appears that the two discussed above are of suffiCient import to account for the bulk of the problem, a problem that has been building and isjust now being felt roost severely.WHAT CAN BE DONEAt this point, one might naturally ask, What can be done? As was statedearlier, answers to complex questions are rarely simple or wholly satisfactory.Nevertheless, there are answers, and in this we should take heart. True, we can- not individually or collectively, as a profession, alter the socioeconomic realitiesof our times. However, within these realities there is much that might be doneto minimize the negative impact of the employment.crisis on today's young un-employed physical educator and the profession of physical education ingeneral.At the outset let us emphasize that there is no reason to believe or evidenceto support the position that the dearth of jobs in traditional physical educationsettings (teacher-coach, K-l2) is a cyclical condition, i.e., that within a few years conditions will reverse themselves and large numbers of young graduates willonce again find relatively easy access to traditional jobs in physical education.Although the cyclical view of things is comforting, the evidence strongly sug- gests that this type of reversal will not occur, if for no other reason than theimplications of the low birthrate referred to earlier.Yet, working within the realities of the socioeconomic trends outlined ear- lier,it appears that if an answer to the present employment dilemma exists, itwill be found in the direction of nontraditional preparation for nontraditionalcareers in physical education. In short, one will have to be nontraditional as tothe focus, specifics, and quality of his professional preparation. Obviously par- alleling this nontraditional profile of the young physical educator of the futurewould he corresponding nontraditional preparation offered by today's pro- fessiona I training institutions.Nontraditional is a relative concept, but for the purpose of clarity, it re-178 179 presents viable types of preparation that will increase one's chances of gainingsatisfying employment as a physical educator in the years ahead. In meeting theneed for alternative types of career preparation the profession of physical edu-cation will take a positive step toward insuring its own viability in the years tocome.Employment ProspectsIndustry,In a recent report given by T. Edward Hollander of the State Departmentof Education before the Executive Committee of the Association of Colleges andUniversities of New York, it was indicated that if institutions of higher edu-cation are to remain viable in the years ahead they will have to \"seek out newpopulations to serve.\"6 In short, they will have to become in some ways non-traditional. In the same sense, and for many of the same reasons, physical edu-cators will also have to seek out new populations to serve if they are to remainprofessionally solvent in the years to come.It would appear that industry comprises a population that can be servedand served well by young professionals who have the interest, motivation, andtraining to work in this setting. Many of us are already aware that physical ed-ucation specialists work in industrial settings, and we do not mean on the as-sembly line but rather in gymilasiums, physical fitness laboratories, and coun-,seling offices. Obviously, management, for a host of reasons, has made thedecision that such programs are good for employee health and morale andtherefore indirectly good for business.In a recent interview conducted with Lawrence Bjurstrom, \"an industryphysical educator\" currently working for the New York State Department ofEducation, he expressed a belief in a significant future for the physical educatorwho possesses the preparation and desire to work in the industrial setting. Healso indicated that many of the 138 major corporations represented at last year's2nd Annual Meeting on Fitness in Business and Industry (an annual eventsponsored by the President's Council on Physical Fitness) were having diffi-culty finding qualified people to fill existing positions.' The view that the in.-dustrial setting might serve as a significant target population for tomorrow'sphysical educator is also given additional credence by the report that BostonUniversity's Department of Physical Education has developed a special programfor majors desiring to work in an industrial setting as fitness specialists. Nodoubt, we will be hearing more about this and other similiar programs in thenear future.Thus, it would appear that the industrial setting holds some promise as aalternative source of future employment for a significant number of physicaleducators, in addition to providing the profession with an opportunity tomaintain its own vitality. While it is not the purpose of this paper to describein detail the alternative career discussed above, the following outline shouldprovide a _general idea of the type of professional preparation needed:FocusSpecificsQualityindustryexercise physiologyadvanced degreephysical fitnessappropriateheart disease interventioninternshipsindustrial recreationadministrationcounseling179 180 Health clubs and health spas, although presenting a somewhat differentcareer from that in industry, offer the physical educator another exciting possi-bility generally ignored heretofore. These businesses have been capitalizing onthe ground swell of interest in fitness and health as well as physical educationin general. Unfortunately, there has been a large amount of quackery and fast-buckisrn associated with these ventures. However, with the rise of the consumeradvocacy movement and resultant consumer protection legislation, the pressureis building for these businesses to legitimize themselves, particularly with re-spect to the hiring and retention of qualified personnel. The more legitimateclubs have already taken steps to correct earlier abuses, and the others will ei-ther have to conform or risk going out of business. Thus, it would appear thatthe health club offers yet another career opportunity for the qualified physicaleducator. It would seem that the type of prerequisite training needed to workeffectively in this career option would be very similar to that outlined above.Older AdultsOlder adults appear to be yet another potential target population for thephysical educator of tomorrow. Here again the population dynamics suggestthat the age of the American public is moving to the right on the age con-tinuum. In short, we now have seen and will continue to see the percentage ofolder people in this country increase. This reality, along with the political pres-sure that this significant portion of the American population will bring to bearon the various legislative bodies, suggests that all types of services will be in-creased to this group. Educational and recreational services and improved med-ical and custodial care will be part of the larger package of goods and servicesoffered to these individuals. Perhaps the type of prerequisite training thatmight prepare the physical educator to work with this important group wouldbe:Focusolder adults PrisonsSpecific;Qualityphysical fitnessbachelor's degreerecreational activitiesappropriatesport instructioninternship experiencesadaptive exercise The inmates' housed in the nation's federal, state, and local correctional in-stitutions represent still another potential target population that could beserved well by the physical educator with a nontraditional dimension to hispreparation. Not only is there a national effort under way to humanize penalreform, but the precedent for introducing educators into the prison system al-ready exists. Hollander specifically mentions this population as a potentialmarket for the educational services of the College and University System of theState of New York. Just possibly the type of training that would prepare thephysical educator to work in this special setting would be an interdisciplinarymajor (including physical education, psychology, criminology, and counseling)combined' with an internship working with the prison population. While itmight take some time before large numbers of physical educators would findthemselves working in this setting, the potential in terms of employment isgreat.180 181 Although it is possible to suggest additional careers that might furtherhelp minimize the negative impact of the employment crisis in physical edu-cation, the main point being made here is that potentially significant non-traditional careers do exist, but the potential must be recognized and developedby the leadership of the profession before we can hope to turn the current em-ployment picture around.Day care and continuing education, as well as community education andAlbert Shanker's \"educare,\" are other possibilities that come to mind that couldafford the physical educator of tomorrow opportunities for gainful employmentin the profession, but here again, the emphasis, as well as the preparation,would have to be nontraditional.K -12It would be remiss to conclude this paper without commenting on the em-ployment prospects for the K-12 specialists. for those who because of previousorientation strongly desire to work in the K-12 setting (it is assumed that alarge proportion of our current majors fall into this category) jobs will be diffi-cult to come by under any circumstances, again largely because of the lowbirthrate. Nevertheless, even though this career focus is in a general sense quitetraditional, there exist certain focuses within the K-12 setting that will enablesome physical educators to find meaningful employment. These individualswill be the ones who have that nontraditional dimension to their professionaltraining:Focusearly special educationblack belt Outward Boundnational certificationnational certificationsame as for elementary 182 As a footnote to the K-I2 focus, it must be underscored that one cannot al- low himself to be a cookie-mold replica of the thousands of past graduates who prepared themselves as good generalists (K-12, teacher-coach) capable of han- dling a wide variety of traditional activities courses. This comment is not meant to demean this conscientious professional group, but the fact remainsthat the profession is flooded with these traditionalists: as pointed out in Figure 2, these individuals are generally young, certified, and entrenched in the K-12 structure.SUMMARYIt has often been said that it is darkest before the dawn. In a real sense-the profession of physical education is in the early morning darkness with respect to the current employment situation, but perhaps the dawn is just about to emerge. Armed with a sense of urgency about the implications of the current employment crisis and willing to take a more global view of the potential role of the physical educator in modern society, physical education has the oppor- tunity to forge a new and perhaps more meaningful profession in the years- - ahead, one that has as its mandate a physically educated society. Thus, it is with optimism and a new understanding of Francis Bacon's \".., adversity is not without comforts and hopes\" that I offer the concept of nontraditional physical education as the sunrise for our profession's future.REFERENCES1.

MANDOhio State UniversityTwo major reasons exist for extending college and university efforts for in- service education to public school teachers. One of these reasons is financial and the other programmatic. It is painfully obvious that zero population182 183 growth will not support educational institutions in the style to which they havebeen accustomed since World War 11. Zero population means that education isnot a growth industry, and fewer people mean fewer students, fewer teachingequivalencies, fewer or smaller schools, and eventually fewer faculty. That is athreat to some, but to others an opportunity for innovation and a call for achanging role for universities and faculty. It is not too much different fromwhat occurred to theater owners and the motion picture industry with the ad-vent of television. Initially, many theaters closed, studios shut down, and thedeath of an industry was predicted. Within a decade, however, theaters hadchanged their locations and repackaged the product, and the industry hasmoved to new and improved markets, including markets in television. Al-though we have no X-rating system to assist our transition, we must find newoutlets for our services.Fortunately, although inadvertently, we have created new markets as a re-sult of planned program changes in teacher preparation. A few years ago, twocolleagues and I presented to this same group a paper entitled \"The PublicSchool: A Partner in Teacher Preparation.\"' This paper emphasized the abso-lute need to provide more and earlier field experience for students and to usethe talents of the teacher in the school to help prepare prospective teachers.This effort reflected a nationwide move to restructure teacher preparation in thelight of an experimental base. Certainly, teacher preparation has moved to theschools for training purposes. We are involved with the teachers in thoseschools, their problems, and the issues in the school itself. We cannot escape aresponsibility to respond to the needs of college students in the schools, the co-operating teachers, and in some respects the issues of schools themselves. Ifpublic education represents a continuum including schools and universities, apartnership in responsibility exists also.Some may suggest that the graduate courses and programs at universitiesprovide the necessary assistance school teachers need to improve job per-formance. This is not necessarily the case. Frequently, master's programs areminipreparations for doctoral programs. The courses are often research orientedand generally represent a preparation for some future goal rather than a solu-tion to the here and now of classroom problems. In addition, traditional gradu-ate progratns are exclusive and do not include or provide for all the teachersworking in schools. In effect, we say to many teachers, \"You are good enoughto teach my child, but not good enough for graduate work.\" Typical concernsof teachers in Ohio, as determined by the state Department of Education, areshown in Table1.2TABLE IConcerns of Teachers for Additional TrainingElementaryMiddleHighSchoolSchoolSchool All Subject Areas(percent of response) Individualized instruction 695648Differentiated staffing 264618Use of media materials 454436Child development 252414183 184 abuse 222927Human sexuality 162122Since there are many thousands of teachers in the state, these percentagesrepresent a substantial clientele. The teachers prefer that these subjects be of-fered at the school site or at least in a location morece tral than the universityand be presented in short-course or workshop fo , emphasizingevening,weekend, and vacation periods of time. Several methods are available to attractteachers to university offerings inclusive of these subjects. One model in oper-ation is shown in Figure I.Figure 1.Inservice Education Model.Freshman 15-18 Teachers-1 University Faculty3-Credit Graduate Course184 185 This model involves freshman students and their cooperating teachers whoas part of the early experience program must register for a seminar to discussthis experience with all other teachers and students in the specific school en-gaged in the process. In a given academic quarter many different schools wereinvolved in early experience and the seminar. Students registered for three un-dergraduate credits; the cooperating teacher, three graduate credits. The univer-sity supervisor travelled from school to school conducting the seminars. A spin-off from this model is that many teachers in separate schools identify a com-mon problem. The supervisor then organizes an additional course to meet thisneed.Figure 2.Inservice Education ModelProblem-Program-Proof Regional Area SchoolDistrict CollegeDetermineProblem ProgramDevelopment8Collegee185 186 The second model as it is emitted involves a faculty member working withseveral physical education teachers in a variety of schools helping them to iden-tify pertinent problems. The second experience involves bringing the teacherswith a common problem together to develop solutions for their schools imple-menting the newly found solutions and assist in evaluating these efforts. It doesnot seem possible for professors to survive by waiting for students to come totheir class and, if you will, sit at their feet. It is necessary to move into the fieldand attract people to necessary services.In conclusion, inservice education not only provides financial salvation butalso represents a progressive step in the preparation of teachers.REFERENCESI.

AMERICAN HUMANICS AND THE IMLAYUniversity of the PacificAmerican Humanics is a privately financed organization that has as its purposethe college-level preparation of young people for professional careers withyouth organizations. American Humanics, seeks to answer the need for theunique preparation in human engineering skills required by professionalsworking in youth agencies. Its focus is on preparing professionals to work inthe YMCA, YWCA, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, and Boys' Clubsand Girls' Clubs. Other potential employers of graduates of the program in-chide Junior Achievement, the Catholic Youth Organization, Jewish Commu-nity Centers, and the youth program of the 4-H.IL Roe Bartle, who in 1948 was an executive with the Kansas City AreaCouncil of the Boy Scouts, is recognized as the organization's founder. Mr. Bar-tle later became mayor of Kansas City.American Humanics achieves its goals by entering into partnerships withselected colleges and universities for the training of young people for the youthagency field, The institution offers the academic preparation, and AmericanI lumanics provides and finances the ccxurricular aspects of the prOgram.In its first 25 years of operation, American Humanics affiliated with foursmall, private liberal. arts institutions: Mission Valley College, Marshall, Mis-souri (1948); Salem College, Salem, West Virginia (1953); High Point College,I ligh Point, North Carolina (1960); and Indiana Central College, Indianapolis,Indiana (1965). 186 187 A survey of youth amen( ies in 1971 revealed that graduates of the programwere making significant contributions, but the number of graduates was notcommensurate with the need for trained professionals. Thus, in the fall of 1971,after consultation with the partner institutions, the American Humanics boardof trustees adopted an aggressive plan of geographic expansion that also in-cluded assigning a resident administrator to each campus.Believing in the value of the individual attention given students at privateschools of small to medium size, the board of trustees established new partner-ships with two West Coast institutions in the fall of 1974: University of the Pa-cific, Stockton, California, and Pepperdine University, Malibu, California.The American Humanics resident administrator, assigned to each campus ischarged with a two-fold responsibility: administration of cocurricular en-richment activities for students in the program and student recruitment. En-richment activities include field trips, workshops, retreats, counseling, andplacement services. Student recruitment involves visiting high schools to ac-quaint students with the American Humanics program at the resident adminis-trator's institution in hopes of influencing them to enroll. In effect, the residentadministrator becomes a member of the institution's admissions staff.The curriculum for majors in youth agency administration combines themajor in recreation with selected course work in business administration andcommunication arts. Recommended courses include Community Organizationand Recreation Services, Recreation in Contemporary Society, Outdoor Recre-ation, Leadership in Recreation, Administration in Recreation, Practicum inRecreation, Social Psychology, Introduction to Research, Finance, PersonnelManagement, Composition, Public Speaking, and Group Dynamics. Suggestedelectives are Prejudice and Racism, Implementation for Social Change, Intro-duction to Statistics, Introduction to Computer Science, Social Services in theModern Community, Principles of Economics, and Population Problems.In addition to the curriculum, a working internship has been discussed. Ifthe working internship is developed, it would allow majors to alternate a workexperience at a youth agency with academic training in a five-year course ofstudy.Professionals and lay volunteers from the youth agency field visit the cam-pus [or biweekly workshops. Workshop topics are selected to acquaint the par-ticipants with the varied aspects of youth agency work. Ample time is allowedfor discussion and questioning of the speakers.Field trips to youth agencies for the freshmen and sophomores are designedto provide a broad view of, the various types of youth agencies. Juniors and se-niors select the agencies they wish to visit. Often special conferences or trainingsessions are a part of the field trip experiences of juniors and seniors. The up-per-class students can concentrate on particular programs and priorities of se-lected agencies and spend time with the individuals responsible for imple-menting them.Student services include club activities, counseling, a loan fund, andplacement.Each affiliated campus Offers some type of club activities. The HumanicsExecutives' Club provides an opportunity for idea and experience exchangeamong students from various agency backgrounds and geographic sections ofthe country. It also becomes a leadership laboratory as students serve as chair-persons or event directors of various projects. T1 club is a vehicle for student input for the workshop and field trip programs. Student reception and re-cruitment are other functions of the dub.1d 7 188 The resident administrator provides personal and career counseling to stu- dents who are interested in youth work or to others within the department,American llumanics provides a loan fund for needy students, These stu- dents may borrow up to full tuition at a 4 percent interest rate; repayment doesnot begin until six months after graduation.Over the past 2F years, American Flumanics has been successful in placingnearly 800 students in youth agency programs.- Since there are nearly 1,800 new career opportunities each year in the youth agency field, there is still ample op-portunity to expand through programs with other schools. Further expansionwill no doubt be based on geographic location and an ability for universities and colleges to provide individual attention to students.

HENSCHENUniversity of Utah\"Hie general public has recently been buried by an avalanche of spas, fitnessparlors. health clubs, etc. This phenomena has caused some institutions ofhigher learning, and the University of Utah in particular, to examine the re-lationship of the fitness industry to the discipline of education.Since we in education are currently engrossed in the accountability and rel-evance of programs, it seems highly appropriate that educational institutionsattempt to supplement industries that cater to the needs or whims of our soci-ety. The health spa industry is just such an example. We at the University ofUtah arc' thoroughly convinced that health spas, or their equivalent, are a per-manent fixture in our society. This industry's structure may be altered, but thecommodity it is marketing, fitness, is a definite contemporary need.The health spa industry is in want of the knowledge of the academic com-munity for a variety of reasons.I.In the past health spas have suffered from an image of charlatanism.Many individuals have felt that the companies were solely interested inmonetary profit and not even remotely concerned with health or fitness.2. The industry lacks up-to-date research findings in the areas of equip-ment, programming, and even business principles.3. There has been insufficient training of both the managerial and in-structional staffs of many of these businesses.4. There has been a general, overall lack of knowledge concerning thecommodity being marketed by both the employees of the industry andthe lay public.For these reasons, the University of Utah's College of Health has institutedwithin its undergraduate curriculum a commercial physical education track, afour-year program with a minor in business and a major in physical education.189 190 This trat k offers courses from business, health, physical therapy, leisure studies,and physical education.In the business minor, courses totaling 30 hours of credit are selected' from:Elementary Accounting, Automated Business InformationSystems,Pro- gramming, Business Finance, Risk and Insurance, Introduction to Business,Principles of Management, Small Business Management, Business Law, Busi-ness Society and the Individual, Principles of Marketing, Introduction to Adver-tising, Sales Management Decisions, and Sales Management Problems.In the physical education major, 19 hours are selected from: Human Re-lations and Group Development, Personal Health Problems, Health Care in theUS, Fundamentals of Nutrition, Physical Therapy Procedures, and Funda-mentals of Speaking; 6 hours from: Commercial Recreation, Commercial Recre-ation Concepts and Dynamics, and Seminar in Commercial Recreation Prob-lems; and T9 hours from: Basic Physical Fitness, Weight Training, PostureConditioning, Exercise for Fitness, Movement Fundamentals, Teaching Exer-cise and Body Mechanics, Water Safety, Swimming Activities, and Pool Man-agement, Adult Fitness, Training Room Procedures, Supervised Laboratory Ex-perience, Physical Education for the Handicapped, Tests and Measurements,Individual Study, Scientific Surveys of Athletic Injuries, Adult Fitness Work-shop, and Psychology of Motor Learning.Upon finishing the track, a student will receive a BS from the College ofHealth, thus being recognized as a knowledgeable fitness instructor who can of-fer professional skills to the people served by. the health spa industry.In conjunction with the four-year commercial physical education track, theUniversity of Utah also offers a certification program for individuals who arealready employed in the health spa industry. The certification program has twophases: 'Phase I.correspondence course and Phase IIworkshop. The cor-respondence course is offered through the Division of Continuing Education atthe University of Utah. and contains ten lessons based on Adult Physical Fitnessby Butler and l-fenschen (1974). The course includes chapters concerning anat-omy, exercise physiology, cardiovascular disease, kinesiology, posture, diet andnutrition, therapeutic exercise, first aid, and fitness testing and programming.Coupled with the correspondence course, to complete the certification re-quirements, is a workshop on adult fitness. This workshop is offered at theUniversity of Utah once per year and then is offered approximately four times ayear at various locations in the United States. The staff for these workshops areUniversity of Utah faculty members who are experts in tests and measurements,kinesiology, physical therapy, exercise and conditioning, and diet and nutri-tion. During these worksho4s, the staff attempts to introduce the latest inequipment, theory, and research associated with adult fitness. The informationdisseminated allows health spa industry employees the opportunity to stayabreast of the current knowledge held by the academic community.In summary, by offering both a four-year curriculum and a certificationprogram, the University of Utah has formulated a package. of education that isinnovative and services a need of the society. Upon completion of either of theprograms, a person will be equipped to provide expert instruction in adultfitness. 190 191PREPARATION OF WOMAN COACHESDOROTHY F. DEACHArizona State UniversityThe realistic or practical approach to professional preparation may seem to befocused on the development of courses designed for the specific training of theathlete in the various skills and strategies of the sport. In this day and time,however, when literally the whole world is watching the caliber of sport per-formance of women, learning the art of coaching by women assumes tremen-dous significance.The future of women in sport will depend upon the emphasis of thosewho develop the guidelines serving as the basis of courses and experiences thatwill provide the framework for knowledges and skills needed by coaches. It willbehoove those who are building a specialized curriculum also to build into itthe best of the past value system, together with the relevant standards of thehere and now, for this new breed of competition for girls and women. The pur-pose of professional preparation programs in coaching will be focused primari-ly on the preparation of the high school and college coach. It would be er-roneous not to assume that some coaches will move to the professional ranksand/or to coaching selected teams for national and international levels of com-petition. The basic value system and wholesome competition and the scientifictraining of the coaches of the future thus will largely determine the quality ofcompetitive programs, be they public school, college, or those outside of edu-cational institutions.The purpose of this paper is to suggest areas of concentration that mightbe woven into the institutional curricular model to insure preparation of qual-ified personnel.Personal PreparationWhile personal preparation may be considered as the all-encompassinggoal, this is meant to refer to knowledge and skills gained as a student athleteprior to and during the college years. It is unfortunate that to date many youngwomen who have skills and interest in sport have had limited opportunities forparticipation in highly competitive situations. To be lacking in such experi-ences leaves a real void that must be filled if the coach is to understand the trueessence of sport.Technical CoreBuilding on the personal skills the athlete acquired in prior competitivesituations, a college program should provide ample opportunity to develop andtest abilities against one's own peers and in events with competitors from otherinstitutions. Various levels of instruction in the skills and strategies of sportfrom beginning through advanced need to be offered. It may be argued that thepotential coach of a sport does not necessarily need to be a truly outstandingperformer, but she surely must have enough skill to demonstrate fundamentalsand to be able to teach athletes who perform at an advanced level ofcompetence.191. 192 Professional PreparationAs important as it is for the potential coach to have a background of per-formance in her selected areas of interest, her eventual success will probably de-pend upon her ability to analyze performance, to motivate participants, and tobe able to mold individual players into a team. In addition, she must have aknowledge of the conditioning and training techniques and of the skills ofmanagement and organization. Each of these areas may constitute modules ofspecific' course content in physiology of exercise, kinesiology, psychology ofcoaching, athletic training, and administration of athletic programs. It is notenough to use the lecture and discussion methods, for there should be laborato-ry experiences associated with all courses. Such opportunities would be foundin serving as an assistant to the coach of a high school or college team or involunteering to coach a team for a Y, church, or playground league. Other ex-periences may be found in recreational' clubs, such as tennis or swimming, orsport camps. In most of these situations, supervision may be by an experiencedcoach or as an extension of the student teaching experience. It is to be hopedthat the beginning coach will also have the opportunity to develop some under-standing of how sport has come to play such a significant role in our culture.tindividual also needs to recognize the responsibilities that must be as-sumed by leaders in the sport world if participation in sport is to be physicallyand psychologically beneficial to the player.Career OpportunitiesItis to be expec ted that with the ever increasing chances for competitiveexperiences, careers in coaching will become more attractive for young women,Itis important, however, to realize that every athlete will not be interested norwill every athlete be a gocxl coach; also, physical education majors constitutemill, one source of potential coaches. Young women with majors in fields otherthan physical education who have experience, interest in a sport, and the desireto develop a second specialiration may have the potential for becoming goodmac hes in their chosen sport. A guidance program to be effective will assist thestudent to assess her capabilities, experiences as a sportswoman, and interest inpreparing herself for a career that will be rigorous in its demands andpressures.The degree of specialization in a sport or sports will depend upon the op-tions mailable at each institution. Curriculum planners will need to be awareof the plaiemerit oppmtunities in their particular locale. Some coaches seekinghigh sc hool positions most likely will find that they would be responsible foronly one sport; others, !mak ularly in smaller schools, would be expected tomac h two or three teams. At the college level, the situation is somewhat differ-ent. .Since a variety of organizational patterns for intercollegiate athletics forwomen are evolving, woman teachers of physical education are rather suddenlyfaml with air added or changed responsibility for coaching; on the other hand,spot tspecialists are being hired cm a part-time basis to coach only in theirsport. Coaches ids\u00b0 find numerous positions with various kinds of sport clubs,health spas, sport c amps, and recreation programs. 192 193EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN ATHLETIC TRAININGGARY DELFORGEUniversity of ArizonaDuring the past few years concern about the high incidence of interschool ath-letic injuries in the United States has grown considerably. Although a standard-ized, nationwide athletic injury reporting system is yet to be implemented, pro-vincial injury studies conducted in various geographical areas of the countryappear to lend credence to this concern. While discrepancies exist in the report-ed number of interschool athletic injuries per year, most reports place the inci-dence occurring on a national level in the hundreds of thousands. An averageof approximately twenty deaths per year resulting from interschool footballalone is reported.Currently available injury data and a high suspicion that many athletic in-juries are unrecognized and thus not reported have led to several significant de-velopments throughout the United States. A recent ABC national televisionshow suggested that parents have become more critical of their high schoolmac Ices' qualifications to render proper health care to their sons and daughters.hocil administrators are becoming more aware of their moral and legal re-sponsibilities to provide good health care for their school's athletes. Perhapsmost significantisthe factthat legislation has been introduced that dra-matically involves the federal government in efforts to improve the health careof our nation's athletes. In 1972, Congressman Ronald Dellums of Californiaauthored and sponsored a bill that would have required all educational institu-tions engaged in interschool athletic competition to employ qualified athletictrainers. Known as the Athletic Care Act, this bill was proposed as an amend-ment to the Elementary and Secondary Education -Act of 1965. An amendmentto the Higher Education Act of 1965 would have made employment of qualifiedathletic trainers mandatory at the college and university level.Partially due to a lack of reliable injury data, the Dellums bill gave way toa measure projx3sed by Congressman Edwin Forsyth of New Jersey. The For-syth, amendment directed the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare toundertake a nationwide study to determine the exact incidence of injuries anddeaths occurring in our nation's interschool athletic programs during a twelve-month period. As a result, a National Athletic Injury/Illness Reporting System(HAIRS) was proposed to the United States Office of Education of the De-partment of Health, Education, and Welfare. This reporting system is currentlybeing implemented in various geographical areas throughout the United States.In addition to this legislation, the Occupational Safety and Health Act,which has previously been concerned primarily with safety in industry, isdirecting greater attention to safety in athletics. The National Consumer. Prod-uct Safety Commission has expanded its concern to include establishment ofstandards for the manufacturing of quality protective equipment in athletics.Numerous professional organizations and national committees have greatly ex-panded their efforts to enhance the health care of interschool athletes. Amongthese are the American Medical Association's Committee on Medical Aspects ofSports; the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons; the NCAA Committeeon Competitive Safeguardsand Medical Aspects of Sports; the American Alli-ance for Health, PhysicalEducation, and Recreation; and the National Sport-ing Goods Association.1.93 194 ROLE OF THE NATIONAL ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOCIATIONAt a time when concern for the health and safety of interschool athletics isso great, the National Athletic Trainers Association is setting standards for theeducation and professional preparation of personnel to work in the areas of athletic injury prevention, emergency care, and rehabilitation. Since 1969, theNATA has provided standards and criteria for the development of under-graduate- and graduate-level educational programs in athletic training. To date,a total of thirty undergraduate curricula and two master's-level curricula in col-leges and universities throughout the United States have received NATA ap- proval. The number of approved athletic training curricula is increasing stead-ily as more and more colleges and universities are implementing areas of specialization in athletic training. As a further step toward insuring the pro- fessional qualifications of athletic trainers, the NATA instituted certificationprocedures in 1970. An individual who meets the educational and clinical ex- perience requirements set forth by the NATA is now officially recognized as a Certified Athletic Trainer upon successful completion of a national certification examination.Undergraduate ProgramAt the heart of the professional preparation of athletic trainers is theNATA-approved undergraduate curriculum. Although students may major inacademic areas of their choice, most athletic training curricula are housed indepartments or colleges of health or physical education. Specific undergraduatecourse work and clinical experience requirements include the following:I. Anatomy (I course)2. Physiology (I course)3.Physiology of exercise (I course)4. Applied anatomy and kinesiology (I course)5. Psychology (2 courses)6.First aid and safety (I course)7.Nutrition (I course)8. Remedial exercise (I course)9.Personal, community, and school health (I course)10,Basic athletic training (I course)II. Advanced athletic training (I course)12. Laboratory or practical experience in athletic training to include a minimum of 600 total clock hours under the direct supervision of a trainer certified by NATAIn order to be certified as an athletic trainer, graduates of NATA-approvedcurricula must complete, in addition to the above course work and clinical ex-perience, all academic requirements leading to a secondary-level teaching certif-icate. Emphasis is thus placed on the preparation of Certified Athletic Trainerswho are equally qualified to teach in their major or minor academic areas.Graduate Certificate ProgramRecognizing the responsibility of the National Athletic Trainers Associ-ation to give encouragement and guidance to the development of graduate-leveleducational programs in athletic training, the NATA board of directors createda committee on graduate education in June 1972. This group, functioning as a 195 subcommittee of the Professional Education Committee, was charged with theresponsibility of developing curriculum guidelines that would give direction tocolleges and universities interested in developing master's-level programs inathletic training. As a result of the committee's efforts during the first year ofexistence, curriculum guidelines specifying NATA-required course work andclinical experience were developed.Graduate-level requirements have been incorporated into what has beenidentified as the Graduate Certificate Program. Upon completion of this pro-gram, students may be awarded a Graduate Certificate in Athletic Training bythe National Athletic Trainers Association in recognition of their advanced ed-ucational achievements. Awarding of the certificate does not require actualcompletion of the master's degree or attainment of a secondary school teachingcertificate, provided all NATA-required course work and clinical experience arecompleted. Completion of requirements for both the master's degree and ateaching certificate is, of course, strongly recommended.Encouragement for the development of graduate-level programs in athletictraining is based on the realization that an opportunity should be provided foradvanced, in-depth, and concentrated study beyond the baccalaureate level. TheGraduate Certificate Program is predicated on sound undergraduate, prepara-tion in athletic training and should be considered an extension of professionalpreparation for those who have completed NATA undergraduate course workand clinical experience requirements. The Graduate Certificate Program is alsodesigned to lead to NATA recognition as a Certified Athletic Trainer for thosestudents who have not yet completed academic requirements at the under-graduate level.Students accepted into a Graduate Certificate Program must have earned abachelor's degree from an accredited four-year undergraduate college or univer-sity and must satisfy all undergraduate course work and clinical experience re-quirements. Specific graduate-level course work and clinical experience require-ments include the following:I.Advanced athletic training (2 courses)2.At least one course from among:a.Advanced anatomyb.Advanced physiologyc.Advanced physiology of exercised.Advanced kinesiology or applied anatomy3.Laboratory or practical experience in athletic training to include aminimum of 300 total clock hours under the supervision of a trainercertified by NATASuggested graduate-level courses to complete the area of specialization inathletic training include:I.Corrective or therapeutic exercise2.Adapted physical education3.Therapeutic modalities1.School law5.Tests and measurements in physical education6.Pharmacology 195 196 University of Arizona Graduate ProgramCurrently, the University of Arizona is one of two universities in the Unit-ed States that have an NATA-approved Graduate Certificate Program in Athlet-ic Training. Opportunity for specialization in athletic training exists in theMaster of Science program in physical education and the Master of Educationprograms in physical education and health education. The following requiredcourses represent the core of the area of specialization and are embedded in allmaster's degree programs:I.Anatomical Basis of Sports Injuries2.Recognition of Athletic Injuries3.Reconditioning. of Athletic Injuries4.Advanced Physiology of Exerciseor Advanced KinesiologyTo complete the fifteen-unit area of specialization, the student may electthe remainder of his course work from among the following:I.Nutritional Basis for Sports Performance2.Laboratory Techniques in Physical Education3.Assessment of Human Performance4.Application of Exercise Theory to Sports Performance5.Research Design in Physical Education6.Individual Studies in Athletic Training7.Contemporary Problems in Athletic Training8.Physical Education and the LawIn addition to the listed course work, graduate students in athletic trainingat the University of Arizona complete their required 300 hours of clinical ex-perience by working in local high schools. Since 1969, the university has par-ticipated in a cooperative program in which graduate students specializing inathletic training are employed as head athletic trainers by local Tucson highschools. Currently twelve of fifteen Tucson high schools are participating inthe program. Students are thus provided with a unique opportunity to earn amaster's degree with academic specialization in athletic training while gainingvaluable experience in a responsible athletic training position. It is felt that theprogram represents an academically effective blend of pertinent course workand practical experience. To date, 36 students have graduated from the Univer-sity of Arizona athletic training program: 17 have been placed as head athletictrainers or assistant athletic trainers in colleges and universities, 11 are employ-ed as secondary-level teacher-athletic trainers, and 2 have accepted jobsas assis-tant athletic trainers with professional football teams.SUMMARYIf the current concern about and emphasis on improved health care of ournation's interschool athletes continue, the future need for more undergraduateand graduate educational programs in athletic training is clearly evident. TheCertified Athletic Trainer has become a truly indispensable member of the ma-jor college athletic staff. Indications are that the Certified Athletic Trainer israpidly becoming looked upon as a necessity rather than a luxury by highschool and junior college administrators and coaches. 196 197 EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS AS EXPRESSEDIN A PHYSICAL EDUCATION LABORATORY SCHOOLAT THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONTROBERT GOBINUniversity of VermontThe physical education professional program at the University of Vermont en-rolls approximately 175 students in three program options. A student may electa 30-credit concentration to prepare for teaching at the elementary school level(K-6) or a 30-credit junior-senior high school (7-12) teaching concentration. Ineither instance the student is required to elect an 18-credit minor field also. Thethird option is a 48-credit broad field major that prepares physical educationteachers for work in grades K -12 and includes two courses each in health andrecreation. Students will riot elect a minor with this option.Students opting for either the secondary or broad field concentrations arerequired to enroll in a methods course for junior-senior high school teachers. Itis here, as juniors in the program, that they will become deeply involved in theSaturday Morning Physical Education Laboratory School program. The courseand lab school are offered each semester.Panic ipants in the program each semester number over 300 and comemostly from the local area, although 39 percent travel a distance of seven to fif-ty miles each week. In the fall of 1971 we drew enrollments from thirteen differ-ent communities. The students are composed chiefly of boys and girls in grades7-12. A year ago We opened the enrollment to adults and their number nowmakes up over 20 percent of the total and is growing each semester. Par-ticipants are charged a registration fee of $3, which covers the entire family.Each registrant may select and enroll in from one to four elective courses.The lab school curriculum each semester includes approximately 25 differ-ent activities with classes offered at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.The program runs for approximately eight Saturdays. with each session begin-ning at 8 a.m. and scheduled into four 40-minute periods that conclude at 11.The physical education majors enrolled in the methods course are responsiblefor all program organizational and administrative details including publicity,application processing, staff assignments, student sectioning, facility and equip-ment checks, opening day plans, etc. Each major will also assume sole re-sponsibility for organizing and teaching two to three different activity classesfor the length of the program.The lalxmitory school at the University of Vermont is, no doubt, similar inmany ways to the organization and administration used at many other institu-tions. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to share our experiences in trans-lating contemporary educational philosophy into action within the laboratoryschool setting.THE OPEN CLASSROOMFor a number of years now educators have acknowledged the fact that eachlearner is unique. Ideally, every student enrolled in a physical education activ-ity class is recognized by the teacher as having a unique entry ability, mo-tivation, rate of learning, and learning potential.197 198 We are however painfully aware that this recognition is seldom reflected ineither program design or mulling method. Physical educators still design pro- grams in which every student must participate in each activity of the prescribedcurriculum. The teaching method will traditionally dictate that all students si-multaneously perform the same drill where performance goals are frequcudyundefined for either the group or individuals.SchedulingWe decided to design a program that would provide our majors with theopportunity to recognize and respond to individual differences in a manner thatwould contrast with the traditional program and class noted earlier. The ap- proach has been an elective program that deliberately accents the differencesthat exist among individuals within each class. Heterogeneity is assured by en- rolling students from all grades (7-12), mixing the sexes for coeducational class-es,including adult inert and women as participants, and absorbing hand-icapped students where appropriate. The students in any given class will haveonly one thing in common a desire to learn that particular sport or activity. The purpose behind this type of scheduling is to create a setting wherein in- still( tors will be for\u00ab.d to experiment with new teaching methodologies as theyrecognize and respond to the wide range of individual differences within the( lass. Incidentally, the elective' physical education programs now being insti-tuted in many of the public schools tend to produce a similar heterogeneitybased upon mixed grade levels and sexes.ObjectivesThe most pressing problem that initially confronts the instructors is identi-fication of what they want their students to learn. A related problem is learninghow to express these goals in individualized performance or behavioral terms.We believe that helping our instructors acquire skill in defining performancegoals serves both their immediate and long-range needs. Each instructor is im-mediately faced with a multiplicity of goal-related tasks that include surveyingthe range of student entry status and need, developing realistic performancegoals in response to the diverse needs, devising appropriate measures for achiev-ing these ends while at the same time providing for individual rates of learn-ing, and establishing a means for evaluating the outcomes that makes sense tothe student., his parents, and the administration. In the long run, we believethat the art of defining individualized performance goals will be required ofour graduates not only to facilitate the learning of their students but also todemonstrate accountability for their teacher performance. Communities and ad-ministrators are increasingly interested in evaluating teaching performance.The wise teacher will take the lead in defining the criteria by means of whichhe is evaluated rather than submitting to criteria designed by others.A technique that we have found useful is to ask that instructors post theirlesson plan goals for each class in a place where their students might read andbe guided by them, The instructors have been amazed at the interest studentstake in this information, especially when they see goals for themselves or theirgroup defined. 193 199 Teaching MethodologiesWhen confronted with a widely diverse class enrollment, the first thingthat our instructors learn is that traditional methods of teaching are largely in-adequate. This is a traumatic experience for them since their natural inclina-tion is to teach classes as they themselves have been taught.The techniques found most useful to instructors include establishment ofgroupings within classes, development and use of sequential skill checklists, ex-tensive use of audio-visual aids, and development of student leadership andpeer-correction techniques. We maintain a focus on individualized techniquesby requiring that no more than half of the class period be devoted to instructor-led large group activities. As instructors gain experience and confidence, wefind they tend to make greater and better use of the unstructured time in eachperiod. Experimentation with a variety of techniques demonstrates to the in-structor that students are most motivated and productively engaged during freeactivities when they have realistic goals, meaningful performance feedback, andreinforcement that comes from a measure of success. The instructors also findou; something else, occasionally to their sorrow. Since the program is electiveand participation is optional, students may react to an uninteresting class eitherby transferring to another class or by simply not attending future class sessions.This is not an altogether bad situation, since it impresses upon the instructorthe need to become responsive to student needs and interests.Methods of teaching must ultimately be evaluated by measuring the out-comes against the goals. Certainly student interest is one of these goals. We be-lieve however that the ultimate goal for all teachers should be to produce stu-dents who are highly motivated, self-directed, problem-solving, lifetimelearners. Our guiding efforts with instructors in the Saturday Morning PhysicalEducation Laboratory School are focused toward providing experiences inwhich their students not only learn activity skills but also learn how to be self-directed lifetime learners.LEARNING FOR A LIFETIMEPerhaps at no time in our history has there been such a concerned effort toprovide educational opportunities for all age groups. Preschool and postschooleducational opportunities now abound. An increasing number of adults arenow returning to school for a variety of reasons. They may be seeking to im-prove or eNange their vocational skills or to broaden their educational horizonsmore generally. Perhaps they simply have an innate love for learning.Our challenge was to find a way to impress our laboratory school in-structors with these needs. As noted earlier, our hope is to go beyond the single-minded task of training them as teachers. We intend to equip them with thetools and motivation required for a lifetime of learning.Learning on the JobBefore assigning the student instructors to their two to three different activ-ities as a staffing assignment, we solicit information that identifies their prefer-encesusually based upon personal skill or mastery. The actual assignmentwill include some activities of their choice and, in every case, one sport activity199 unfamiliar to them (this might include a course in roller skating, BB marks-manship, yoga, roller hockey, bowling, etc.). The purpose behind the latter as-signment is to illustrate that if their later public school program is to grow, theinstructors must first be willing to research, experiment, and learn with theclass.Inservice EducationA second approach to continuing education involves an opportunity forinservice training. On the Saturday preceding the opening of the lab school weconduct an inservice training program. A select number of student instructorsfrom the previous semester are invited to return for a seminar in one of the ac-tivities they had taught. The seminars are generally of a participation typewherein new instructors have the opportunity.to try out new sports they will beasked to teach or to get new ideas for instruction in areas already familiar tothem. Clinic instructors are asked to share copies of their course plans withthose who attend the sessions. We find this an excellent way to identify peer re-source personnel for the new instructors. Recently a number of full-time phys-ical. education teachers in the area have expressed a desire to participate in aprogram of this type. Plans are currently under way to expand the inservice dayprogram to include students, university staff, and public school physical edu-cators in the clink program scheduled for spring 1975.Learning ContinuumThe third major effort to focus attention on learning for a lifetime has ledto the inclusion of adults in the Saturday Morning Physical Education Labora-tory School. Adults now make up 1/5 of our enrollment, and the number isgrowing. I personally subscribe to the concept that we should be preparing ed-ucators who conceive their role to be the facilitation of learning for all individ-uals, from cradle to grave. We have added adults to the program for three rea-sons: (I) to demonstrate to our majors that adults are motivated to learn newskills for many of the same reasons that college students have (improved fitness,recreation, emotional release, etc.), (2) to demonstrate that adults are no moredifficult to teach than teenagers (in fact easier), and (3) to impress our students,and future teachers, with the many advantages that come from involving mem-bers of the community in the school program.Our experience with the adults has been fantastic. The instructors havefound them to be patient with their mistakes in teaching techniques. Theadults have been eager to learn and have volunteered to assist in teaching othersin class who are less skilled. Student participants accept their presence quitereadily. We have many families that are now taking lessons as a group. It is in-teresting to note that we initially set aside special classes for adults only. Wewere complimented when the adult group requested approval for enrollment inany of the classes. They expressed a desire for a greater range of activity optionsand indicated that the individualized instruction in most classes would not in-hibit their enjoyment of a class taken with the younger folks. After the intitialclasses, most of our instructors feel quite at ease with the adults but are on theirtoes in preparation and presentation, more so than they may be when the classcomprises seventh and eighth graders. (The ultimate compliment came to oneof our yoga instructors when a 50-year-old physician called her at the dorm toapologize for missing class and to request the practice assignment for the nextweek.)2 0 201 DIFFERENTIAL STAFFINGAs the Saturday Morning Physical Education Laboratory School developedfrom year to year with more participants, instructors, and activity options, wewere forced to reconsider the appropriateness of the existing program adminis-tration. It has long been our belief that the effectiveness of learning is directlyinfluenced by the immediacy, the quality, and the regularity of feedback provid-ed to the learner after each trial. The lab school director found it increasinglydifficult to review and suggest improvements on three lesson plans, postclassevaluations, and teacher journal notes for each of the 25 student instructorsweek after week. Similarly, as the program expanded the amount of time thathe could spend actually observing the teaching of each student instructor be-came drastically reduced. What could he do? The answer was the developmentof a student supervisor program.SupervisorsEach semester we now have approximately four student supervisors. Theseare usually seniors who have previously completed the methods course and whohave lxen personally invited to serve. They receive credit through a course ti-tled Practicum in Field Experience. The supervisors' duties, outlined in a jobdescription, generally revolve around responsibility for working with approxi-mately five to six student instructors each. Supervisors receive and respond toall written teaching pretxtrations including block plan, lesson plans, lessonplan evaluations, teacher journal notes, etc. (The lab school director makes spotchecks of student work and critiques the evaluations of the supervisors.) Theyobserve and critique the teaching performance of their instructors and generallyserve to reinforce and assist'the student instructor wherever and whenever possi-ble. The supervisors also alert the director of the program when one of theirstaff is having unusual difficulty or is not responding well to assignments andsuggestions. The supervisory group meets twice a week with the director to dis-cuss instructor performance and program administration. Supervisors also havean assigned time for meeting with their instructors on either an individual or agroup basis. The addition of supervisors has proven to be a successful meansfor individualizing the work of our student instructors. It also has provided theimmediate, qualitative, and frequent feedback so necessary to their learning.Teacher AidesThe thought then cx:curred to us that the student instructors also neededhelp in dealing with the extremely diverse class enrollments. What could we doto help them? The response was the development of a teacher aide program. Aswith the supervisors, we developed a job description for the teacher aides. Theseare volunteer physical education majors from the freshman and sophmore class-es. We have worked out a mechanism for: them to receive program recognitionfor their participation as an aide. Each aide is assigned to an instructor and as-sists him in the two to three activity classes taught by that instructor. (We em-phasize that the instructor is ultimately responsible for everything that goes onin class, including lesson planning, records, etc.) The aide assists the instructorin correcting student performance, in compiling student records, and frequentlyin working with one or more subgroups within the class.231 202 The teacher aide program has provided an invaluable service to the in-structor and the students in the classes. The aides also reap many benefits oftheir own. The exploratory, nonpressure teaching experience in the first yearsof their major program provides them with an opportunity to resolve manyquestions relative to continuing in this field. By the time they move into the ju-nior year, we have found the teacher aides to be highly motivated, experienced,and familiar with the laboratory school program. The resultant effect has beena laboratory school program that continues to improve with each semester.LOOKING DOWN THE ROADIn the nine years since the inception of the Saturday Morning Physical Ed-ucation Laboratory School we have continued to examine options for im-proving the quality of learning for both our practicing teachers and the par-ticipants. Each semester has seen modifications in the program. These havefocused in the past and will focus in the future upon student experimentationwith contemporary educational concepts and identified program needs. Whatwill we tackle next? A brief outline of our goals follows.Special EducationTraditional physical education programs and teachers have not been no-tably successful in identifying and responding to the needs of children whomust overcome physical, mental, emotional or social obstacles to learning. Theopen classroom approach used in our laboratory school provides an excellentvehicle for returning these folks to the mainstream of education. We have al-ready begun to seek out and include handicapped teenagers and adults for par-ticipation in the laboratory school program. In the months to come every effortwill be made to both increase their number and improve the quality of thelearning experience provided for them.Student EvaluationEducators have long desired a means of recording student achievement without resorting to the relatively meaningless letter grades of A to F. We feelthat the traditional marking system can ultimately be replaced with a system ofreporting that identifies more clearly the actual performances of students. Ourefforts in the future will be to develop and reinforce those sequential learningtasks currently being used to individualize and monitor student achievement.RecordsOver half of our laboratory school students each semester have previouslyparticipated in the program for one or more semesters. We are chagrined tonote that we have no record of their earlier participation or of the courses se-lected or achievement levels attained by each student. New instructors receivethese returning students in subsequent semesters as though the students wereenrolling for the first time. A third major effort for the future will be to devel-op a record system that will serve to monitor student achievement from semes-ter to semester. We hope that the outcome of this effort will lead to less repeti-tion for the students. A byproduct should be instructors who are moreknowledgeable about both their students and the creative use of student records. 2 ;) 2 203 Course of StudyLet us review the dimensions of the task encountered by the typical labora-tory school instructor during the first weeks after he enrolls in the methodscourse. Each student instructor must quickly become familiar with the or-ganizational format of the program in order to play his role. This involves suchtasks as preparing publicity; distributing, picking up, and processing applica-tions; assigning students to sections; assigning staff; and checking facilities andequipment. Simultaneous to the work on program administration, each in-structor is also expected to block out two to three activity courses for the eight-week period, including one sports activity totally foreign to him. Next, the in-structor must prepare lesson plans for each class (his first ever) and meet theclasses on the first day.with full responsibility for both the class and the teacheraide. All this roust be accomplished within a titnespan of 214 to 3 weeks.These instructors obviously need all the help they can get. The supervisorshave provided much of that help to date. The next step in the future is to pre- pare a two-part course of study for the laboratory school program. The firstpart, d description of the organization and administration of the school, is al-ready well tinder way. Part two of the document will include course plans foreach sport o activity in the program. We hope that the completed course de-sc ription will serve not only to clarify and ease the adjustment for our in-structors but also to provide them with a meaningful reference document thateach can take into his student teaching experience and first year on the job.CONCLUSIONThe Saturday Morning Physical Education Laboratory School has been de-signed to pfovide an opportunity for students to synthesize and experimentwith philosophies of education that have been up to this point only theory.The open classroom concept of individualizing instruction, concepts of learn-ing for a lifetime, and the utilization of differentiated staffing techniques are all encountered on a very personal learn-by-doing basis. We note that there are many educational theories and practices that remain to be tested. This indeed iswhat makes our field so vibrant and educationally stimulating. The avowedgoal of the student instructors and their teacher aides, supervisors, and studentshas, been identified as follows: To develop individuals who are highly mo-tivated, self-directed, and problem-solving lifetime learners.I close with this observation. Each semester I stand in awe of the per-formance that students are capable of when they are given a meaningful chal-lenge and opportunity. Their initiative, creativity, and productivity are a con-stant source of renewal for me. 2 i3 REPORTS PRESIDENT'S REPORTSheldon L. FordhamThe following activities were performed by the president during 1974:Appointment of CommitteesI. Standing CommitteesAppointments were made to fill expired terms and vacancies on all stand-ing committees. Chairmen were appointed and when acceptances were receivedfrom identified nominees, the chairman was notified of the composition of thecommittee.

MailedProceedings from Chicago to the membership in September.RecommendationsIt is recommended that the association:1.Make every effort to mail Proceedings to the membership at the earliestpossible date after the annual meeting.2.Create a special committee to investigate the possibility of closer articu-lation between the senior colleges and the community/junior colleges in an ef-fort to share mutual concerns and increase membership.3.Create a joint NCPEAM-NAPECW task force to make recommen-dations to the Resolutions Committee for taking a stand on critical issues fac-ing the profession.4.Request that the NCPEAM-NAPECW Conferences and Projects Com-mittee be continued. One charge to this committee would be to address itself tothe recommendations made last year by President Sprague.5.Create a special joint NCPEAM-NAPECW committee to be called theCommittee on Professional Information. The report of the Committee to Re-view the'Purposes of NCPEAM might prove useful in developing a plan of ac-tion. It is hoped that the committee would publicize the two associations with agoal of increasing membership.235 206 Many of the members have provided expertise and counsel in carrying onthe affairs of the association. Special thanks are extended to Burris Husman,Wayne Brumbach, and the section officers in planning and developing the con-vention program. Leo Gedvilas and Bill Fleming prepared the Proceedingsand,Vewsletterswith efficiency and dispatch. Thanks are extended to Pat Muellerfor his continued and dedicated efforts as your secretary-treasurer.It has been a distinct pleasure to serve as your president during the pastyear. Please accept my sincere thanks and appreciation for making it a chal-lenging and rewarding experience. SECRETARY-TREASURER'S REPORTC.E. MuellerThe secretary-treasurer served the NCPEAM membership through conductingthe routine affairs of the office, such as collecting dues, maintaining financialrecords, paying invoices, processing memberships, answering correspondence,providing mailing labels to professional groups, and distributing copies of theProceedings, Quest,and theNewsletter.The responsibility for editing the Newsletterhas been transferred to Bill Fleming, and theProceedingsis now edited by Leo Gedvilas, for which the secretary-treasurer is very grateful. In addition, the operating manual has beenprinted and distributed.Paul Huber, certified public accountant, issued an auditor's report, identi-fying financial accountability and reflecting income of $15,340, expenses of$15,939, and a bank balance of $873. The special projects account shows re-ceipts of $4,763, expenditures of $1,069, and a balance of $3,724.In 1974, 1,062 memberships were processed, 211 fewer than the previousyear and 220 fewer than the 1971 all-time record high of 1,282. This reductionis undoubtedly related to the increase in dues and other economic factors. (As ofthis moment, the current totals are 105 emeritus members, 71 new members,and 732 renewed members, for a total of 908 members.)On the lighter side, your secretary-treasurer was invited to participate inthe World Scientific Congress in Moscow at the expense of NCPEAM. In theinterest of conserving association funds and saving paper, the invitation was de-clined by placing same in the recyclable paper file. Subsequent mimeographedcorrespondence from the University of Moscow requested the title of my pre-sentation to the World Scientific Congress. Energy was again conserved by recy-cling the letter. On November 15, 1974, the organizing committee in Moscowsent the following cable: \"Urgent: cable day, flight of arrival for us to meet youat the airport.\" It too was recycled.Appreciation is expressed to the officers and members of NCPEAM fortheir cooperation and understanding as the affairs of the association areresolved.Membership Summary19731974Emeritus members 97103New members 13265Active MANAGER'S REPORT:78th ANNUAL MEETINGJames E. OdenkirkThe following report is a summary of the 78th meeting of the National CollegePhysical Education Association for Men held at Del Webb's Towne House,Phoenix, Arizona, January 9-12, 1975.FacilitiesThe contract for use of the Towne House was made one year prior to theconvention dates. The meeting rooms were contiguous to each other, facili-tating the movement of participants from one meeting to the next meeting.Room sizes were adjustable, seating arrangements were comfortable, and ade-quate room was available for displays. The large lobby area adjacent to meetingrooms was attractive for informal sessions, social hours, and small meetings.Recreational activities were available at nearby facilities.The meeting was held with a special invitation to members of the NAP-ECW. A large group of women attended the meeting and several members par-ticipated in the meeting.ProgramBurris Husman was responsible for an outstanding program involving ses-sions on Sport and Leisure, Professional Preparation, and Body of Knowledge.These programs were chaired by the division chairmen, James A. Peterson,James Ewers, and Dale Hanson.An open forum was chaired by Vernon Sprague, past president ofNCPEAM. Two sessions of special interest groups were held and, in conjunc-tion with the Western College Men's Physical Education Society, the secondgeneral session featured a speech by Edward Scannell, Arizona State University.The convention luncheon featured a presidential address by President Shel-don Fordham.Several outstanding persons from related disciplines presented papers.Convention OrganizationSpecial congratulations are extended to Pat Mueller, Liz Heise, and theValley of the Sun Convention Bureau for registration, selling of tickets, andsecretarial responsibilities and to the men's physical education faculty andsecretaries for management of the convention. Valuable assistance in the con-vention program and the trip to Pinnacle Peak was provided by the ExtensionDivision, Arizona State University. Pictures and publicity displayed for eachmeeting held facilitated the smooth running of the convention. An added fea-ture of the convention was two wives' tours to points of interest in Arizona.SummaryDespite the economic climate and the noncentral location of the meeting,182 regular members and 64 guests attended the convention. Many favorablecomments were expressed about the outstanding setting for the convention andthe quality of the programs presented. The officers of the association are to becommended for an excellent convention.237 MINUTES, EXECUTIVE COUNCIL Troy Hendricks, JesseParks, Chalmer Hixson, Art Kraft, Don JonesI.

MuellerSecretary-Treasurer 2 8 STANDING COMMITTEES CONSTITUTION COMMITTEECommunication was initiated between the Constitution Committee and theCommittee to Review the Purposes of NCPEAM and the Operating CodesCommittee in order to reconcile and correct a current and possible future prob-lem, to wit: the recently adopted constitution contains an aim and objectives;the operating manual contains a differing set; the Committee to Review thePurposes of NCPEAM suggests a third set.It is the understanding that the president's committee intends to move forthe adoption of its set. Comparison of the aim and objectives in the consti-tution with the proposed set is clearly indicated before final action is taken.If a new aim and new objectives are adopted as a committee report withthe intent that they shall replace those of the constitution, it is mandated thatthe new set cannot be voted on by the membership until the annual meeting af- . ter it has been presented to the membership. The constitution does allow for amail vote but this is not the recommendation of the Committee to Review thePurposes of NCPEAM or the Constitution Committee.The Operating Giles Committee is mandated to revise its codes by substi-tuting the set that appears in the constitution for the one that has been pub-lished in the operating code.Some comments relative to the report of the Committee to Review the Pur-poses of NCPEAM (January 1974 revision) are appended to this report.The members of the Constitution Committee were requested to scrutinizeand review the constitution in order to determine if there were imperfections,inconsistencies, omissions, etc. Some observations follow:Article IIIMembership. Section 2 affirms that the NCPEAM is restrictedto men. Section 6 indicates that individual members of affiliated societies maybecome members of the NCPEAM. The interpretation is that only individualmale members of affiliated societies are eligible to join the NCPEAM.Article IVGovernance and Duties of Officers. In Section 2, in order to beconsistent with Section 4, the division chairmen and vice chairmen should belisted in alphabetical order as follows:e. The chairman of the Division of Body of Knowledgef.The first vice chairman of the Division of Body of Knowledgeg. The second vice chairman of the Division of Body of Knowledgeh. The chairman of the Division of Professional Preparationi. The first vice chairman of the Division of Professional Preparationj. The second vice chairman of the Division of Professional Preparationk. The chairman of the Division of Sport and LeisureI. The first vice chairman of the Division of Sport and Leisuretn.The second vice chairman of the Division of Sport and LeisureThis change merely represents an editorial correction and does not consti-tute a constitutional change.Article IV, Section 4h, states, \"Under unusual circumstances (e.g., the lackof a quorum at the designated meeting for elections) the incumbent officers and 2192 ' 9 Executive Council members shall remain in their respective positions for theensuing year.\" It was suggested that it would seem more appropriate to havethe officers elected at past meetings move up, but leave the second vice chair-man position open or provide for a temporary appointment by the presidentand/or the Executive Council. This suggestion was received too late to be con-sidered by the committee. Perhaps the Executive Council may wish to ask the1975 Constitution Committee to direct some attention to this suggestion.President Fordham suggested that the Constitution Committee considertwo changes: (I) that the past president be made an official member of the Ex-ecutive Council and (2) that the term of office of the secretary-treasurer be fortwo years.A poll of the Constitution Committee resulted in a rejection of the firstproposal for the following reasons: (1) it had been considered and rejected bythe original Restructure Committee of two to three years ago; (2) it was consid-ered and rejected by the Executive Council when it adopted the RestructureCommittee's report and again when the revised constitution was adopted; (3) itwas considered and rejected by the Constitution Committee when it was draft-ing the revised constitution. Further, no new rationale was presented to justifya change.A poll resulted in an approval of the second proposal. Therefore the Con-stitution Committee proposes a constitutional amendment: that Article IV, Sec-tion 4g, be amended by inserting after the word \"officers\" and before the word\"and\" the phrase \"with the exception of the secretary-treasurer\" (first line).Also, a new sentence is to be added: \"The secretary-treasurer shall be elected toa two-year term of office that shall extend from the close of the annual meetingat which he is elected to the close of the annual meeting held during the secondyear of 1 is term.\"It is to be noted that even a three-year term of office might be acceptable inorder that the secretary-treasurer serve throughout the period of time (threeyears) that an incoming second vice president would be in office. There may bemerit in accepting such a proposal.The chairman of the Constitution Committee extends his appreciation tothe members of the committee, the chairmen of the Operating Codes Commit-tee and the Committee to Review the Purposes of NCPEAM, and PresidentSheldon Fordham for their assistance and cooperation during the past year.Respectfully submitted,Robert KorsgaardChairmanAddendum: Comments Relative to the Report of the Committee to Review thePurposes of the NCPEAM (January 1979 Revision)Note: Where section designations in the 1974 revision differ from those in the1975 revisionincluded in the report of the Committee to Review the Purposesof NCPEAMthe designations in the 1975 revision are given parenthetically.Aim of NCPEAMThe present constitution states the aim is \"to further the achievement ofphysical education and sports in institutions of higher education.\" The presi- 220 221 dent's committee claims the aim is \"to assist with the advancement of physicaleducation at all levels.\" There is a fundamental question that the associationmust ask itself: do we exist to promote physical education and sports in the col-legiate setting or do we exist to use the academic setting as a vehicle to promotephysical education at all levels? It does make a difference in the way we focusour attention.Objectives of NCPEAM1. Should objective 3 be so specific as to identify the means by which theobjective is to be achieved or should this be relegated to the subsequent sectionrelated to \"achieving association objectives\"?2. Should objective 5 be clarified by revising it to read, \"To review theprofessional recommendations of the association periodically for reaffirmation,change, or abolition\"?3. Does objective 8 say all that we expect it to say? The present consti-tutional statements appear to say something stronger and a little different, e.g.,\"develop interdisciplinary relationships with kindred fields of knowledge ... anthropology, history, philosophy, physiology, psychology, sociology, sportsmedicine, and other disciplines.\" If the cormnittee report intends somethinglike this, it doesn't appear to say so. The committee report appears to refer tosister organizations, such as the AAHPER, NAPECW, and Society of StateDirectors.Achieving Association ObjectivesI.Is it necessary or desirable to place items A2, A3, and possibly A4 (lb,lc, and Id) in this report? Isn't this a function of the operating codes?2. Regarding item CI (3a), unification is much dependent on the NAP-ECW aim and objectives and raises the same question with regard to the aim ofNCPEAM. Note that the title of the women's group is National Association forPhysical Education of College Women. It is to be noted that the membershiphas not mandated a merger with NAPECW and until it does, perhaps item C(3) needs to be tempered or modified.,3.If item Dc (4c) is prescriptive, is it possible to call upon all school and college administrators, despite the desirability of such an effort? If it becomesincumbent upon someone or some group in the association to achieve this pur-pose, is it possible?Finally, the Constitution Committee suggests a careful review, consid-eration, and reconciliation of the subject before final action is taken on thematter. Our aim and objectives are not to be taken lightly or underestimatedand demand careful attention. This is not intended to imply that the president'scommittee has done anything but a great piece of work but only that there re-main final thought and action before ratification. CONVENTION PROGRAM COMMITTEEActivitiesI. The chairtnan received and studied the operating code for the Con-vention Program Committee.2. The program format for the Phoenix meeting was approved by thecommittee.221 222 3. Recommendations lot program content, which were based on the openforum in Kansas City, were mailed to the division first vice chairmen.4. In early February, after consultation with the convention manager, aproposed convention budget was submitted to the president and secretary-treasurer.5, The Executive Council approved the recommendation that the WesternCollege Men's Physical Education Society be responsible for the second generalsession. Further contact was made with Robert Bergstrom, who secured the gen-eral session speaker.6. Program information and audio-visual request sheets were developed.These were used for reporting the program and for requesting audio-visualequipment. respectively.7. Program content was discussed with the division officers iri Anaheim.The final program was received in September, at which time it was collatedand sent to the convention manager for the assignment of facilities.8. The program was finalized for the Newsletter in October. and the finaldraft was sent to the secretary-treasurer in November.9. The chairman met with President Fordham concerning the conventionprogram on Thursday, October 31. and Friday, November I.Guidelines for Special Interest Group SessionsThe special interest group sessions were originated by NCPEAM to im-prove the value of its annual meeting to its members. The original concept ofthe sessions was that they would be formally scheduled times during whichmembers could rather informally meet and discuss specific professional prob-lems, share experiences. or try out some new and perhaps radical thoughts. Toassist in implementing this concept, the following guidelines are suggested:1. The number of sessions and their location in the program will be decid-ed by the first vice president in consultation with the president and second vicepresident.2. The scheduling of topics and discussion leaders will be a part of the du-ties of the second vice president.3. The second vice president will be responsible for preparing a short no-tice for the spring edition of the Newsletter reminding members of the specialinterest groups and inviting them to send suggestions to him as soon as possi-ble for the next annual meeting.4. The second vice president will receive suggestions until midsummer andthen\" develop a program for each of the sessions allowed in the convention pro-gram. In developing the program the second vice president will be guided bythe following:a.If several topics appear to be equal value cr interest and if thereare more suggested topics than can be presented in the program, toppriority will he given to the first suggestions received.b.In the event two or more members suggest the same topic, theone suggesting it first will he invited to serve as the discussion leader forthat meeting.c.No more than eight topics will be scheduled for each session.d.A balanced program will be sought for each of the sessions inan effort to offer topics of interest to as many of the members aspossible.2 '9 223 5. Only in exceptional circumstances, which must be agreed upon by thepresident and first vice president, will formal groups associated with NCPEAMbe allowed to use these times for their meetings.6. No formal papers are to be presented in these meetings, which are to bedevoted entirely to discussions related to the topic listed in the program.7. There should be no direct relationship between meetings scheduled bythe divisions and this part of the program.8. The second vice president will have the program established with firmcommitments from all discussion leaders in order to meet any program dead-lines established by the first vice president.9. The second vice president will request all discussion leaders to give himany special requests for room arrangement and/or audio-visual equipment thatwill beneededfor the meeting. He will pass on any requests to the conventionmanager through the first vice president.Recommendations1. A convention budget should be submitted and approved at the Execu-tive Council meeting held in conjunction with the AAHPER convention.2. Support funds should be given each division to develop an outstandingprogram. These funds should not be allotted to NCPEAM members who ap-pear on the program.

Estimated balance,August 30, 1976 500635500Pat Mueller, as you know, prepared this report and as usual was promptand efficient in getting it to me. Comments in the following section were writ- ten by the secretary-treasurer.Items of Information and Perhaps ActionIn Item 12, the total listed under 1974 receipts and expenditures, $635, isdifferent from the fund balance at the end of the fiscal year because it includessome members who have already paid their dues for the subsequent year. Pleasedo not be concerned about this inconsistency.In item II, approximately $900 more was spent than budgeted, primarilydue to the officers' travel expenses during the summer months to take care ofassociation business. I suspect that in the past, some of the travel expenses wereabsorbed by college and university budgets, but this is no longer the case be-cause of the economic squeeze. Perhaps we need to take a look at this item, be-cause to my knowledge only the secretary-treasurer's fee of $1,000 and officers'travel to the annual meeting in the amount of $600 have been officially ap-proved by the membership. These additional expenditures have usually beenapproved by the Executive Council.Note in item 10 that I have discontinued the president's contingency fundand.in essence have added it to the officers' expenses and fees.In item 9, the general operations have increased because of inflationary in-creases in supplies and expenses, secretarial and clerical wages, addressographand mailing fees, and the auditors' fees. At one time the association did not payfor long-distance telephone calls of the officers, but since college budgets havebeen tightened, all of the officers now have association credit cards. Also, wespent $250 on the AAHPER booth and I seriously question the advisability ofcontinuing this project.In item 8, the annual meeting exceeded the amount budgeted. Conventioncosts vary from year to year, depending on the locale and the manager of theconvention. In some situations, the costs are absorbed by the local physical edu-cation department, but this too has been affected by tight budgets.In item 7, the cost of printing the Newsletter has increased because of theexpansion and improvement of the Newsletter. 2 2, -I 225 In item 5, theProceedingscost about half of what was budgeted, because acommittee recommended reducing the size of the publication, and this resultedin a considerable savings. However, in talking to Leo Gedvilas, I believe thecosts of this year'sProceedingswill be in the neighborhood of $4,000.In item 4, $5,000 has been set aside for special projects and by sending acopy of this letter to Dave Bischoff, 1 am suggesting that he may want to sub-mit a 1976 budget for special projects.There is some question as to whether we want to continue to operate onsuch a close relationship between revenue andexpenditures. However, if wecould consider the possibility of transferring limited funds from the specialprojects account, in case we get into financial difficulty, perhaps the dues canremain at the present rate.

HISTORICAL RECORDS COMMITTEERecommendations and Action itemsAs chairman of the Historical Records Committee, I have had the oppor- tunity to read correspondence of the past chairmen since 1968. The operating code is sound and, hopefully, will result in the preservation of all those docu- ments that are the historical building blocks of the organization. I can only re- peat several things that have been said in the past and propose several small ideas of My own:1.Henry .F. Dunbar's thesis (PhD, Columbia, 1950), \"A Brief History of the CPEA,\" should be part of the-archives at the University of Illinois, if it is not there already.2.Everyone seems in agreement that a new history of the organization should he done. Logically, a graduate student from the University of Illinois should be the one to do it. If NCPEAM members feel strongly about it, a $500 scholarship-endowment could be established for a deserving student or physical educator to write such a history.3.A committee of six seems too large; we don't need that many for the work needed by this group; possibly you might consider a constitutional atnendment.4.A small item should be included in the next Newsletter urging all NCPEAM members, especially former officers, to donate to the permanent ar- chivist-historian, \"Ace\" Moore, all documents that might be of value to our organization.Respectfully submitted,John A. Lucas,Chairman226 227 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEEActivitiesI.Defining the role of the International Relations Committee within thepresent organization of NCPEAM.2.Coordinating with the NAPECW International Relations Committeeregarding future joint projects.

It was humorously stated that Flack's dissertation, bound in two volumes and weighing some twenty pounds, may have been the longest ever produced at Ohio State Univer-sity. It eventually served as a basis for his excellent book; The History of Phys- ical Education (flamer and Row, 1966).It is to his credit and reflects the quality of the man that lie was most pro- ductive during a time when others of less courage might have lost hope, and that his efforts in history were highly regarded by those in his field and in gen- eral history as well.Ile was a recipient of the Southern District AAHPER Award and was granted AAIIPER emeritus status in 1971.

Changes that had been recom-mended were reviewed in reference to their proper inclusion in the revision ofthe operating manual.During the year, correspondence was carried on with various officers of theassociation in an attempt to help finalize the status of our organization's oper-ating codes. Committee members were consulted in reference to suggested codechanges.Copies of the report of the Committee to Review the Purposes ofNCPEAM were received from Chairman Jim Ewers. These were sent to allmembers of the Operating Codes Committee for review. Implication forChanges in the codes as indicated by this report were studied. These will be in-corporated in codes at a later date. The Operating Codes Committee had nonegative reactions on suggested changes for this report.RecommendationsI.Items that have been suggested for code revision be integrated into theoperating manual.2.Operating manuals be made available for all members who need them.The possibility of changing the tenure of the secretary-treasurer from anannual to a two-year term is being considered but has not yet been acted upon.The foregoing deals with primary changes in the NCPEAM operatingcodes as of the present time. Obviously, other changes must be made. All of themembers of the association who have been involved in the many recent changesand revisions are to be congratulated on a job well done. It is through such co-operative and dedicated work that we can continue to grow and develop as anoutstanding organization. POLICIES COMMITTEE ActivitiesRespectfully submitted,John A. FriedrichChairman The chairman reviewed the minutes of the meetings of the ExecutiveCouncil held at Kansas City, as printed in the 1974 Proceedings. In his opin-,232 233 ion, there were no items in the minutes that indicated that new policies shouldbe recommended as a result of actions taken by the Executive Council. Nominutes of the meeting of the Executive Council held at Anaheim were avail-able to the Policies Committee chairman. It was concluded that no new policieswere necessary since there was no notification of such by the Executive Council.RecommendationsI.It is recommended that the chairman of the Policies Committee receivecopies of the minutes of the winter and spring meetings of the Executive Coun-cil prior to their appearance in the Proceedings.The latter is received by mem-bers so late in the year that it makes thorough review and action by the PoliciesCoMmittee almost impossible. A further complication results from the fact thatthe spring meeting minutes do not even appear in that year's Proceedings.Thisserves to make the Policies Committee almost wholly dependent upon the Exec-utive Council for specific items for consideration.2.The following members of the Policies Committee have served threeyears and must be replaced according to the constitution: Perry Johnson, Uni-versity of Toledo, and Chairman Richard A. Swanson, Wayne State University. Respectfully submitted,Richard A. SwansonChairman PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMITTEE In the absence of a report for 1973, the committee had no guidelines from pre-vious endeavors in continuing programs to follow. A letter was sent to eachcommittee member early in the fall 1974 semester requesting any ideas theymight have relative to the promotion of the organization. They were urged tocompose a letter to distribute to male college physical educators in their areawith an appeal to attend the national convention in Phoenix. Their opinionswere sought relative to the inclusion of community/junior college people. Fourof the committee members responded to this request. In November a subsequentletter was sent to each member of the committee with an outline of the annualmeeting and a designation of areas to cover relative to promotion of attendanceat the convention.No activities other than the promotion of the organization were engaged inby the committee as a whole. However, Peter W. Everett, Florida State Univer-sity, suggested that members of NCPEAM become involved with public affairsteams that are being organized in each state by HPER for the purpose of get-ting their message across to the public and state legislatures. This seems to havea great deal of merit and deserves serious investigation. It is a project thatwould seem to benefit the entire organization.The question of community/junior college involvement might be consid-ered by the total membership. There are those who feel that the commitment233 234 and purpose of that phase of education and the. four-year schools are not in harmony. Perhaps this should be clarified. RESEARCH COMMITTEE ActivitiesRespectfully submitted,Arthur J. GallonChairman 1.Most of the questions entertained by the committee in correspondencedealt with the delineation of the role of the Research Committee under the newstructure of the NCPEAM. Individual members expressed frustration that therewas no followup by members of the Executive Council with respect to the com-mittee's recommendations in the 1973 report. Thus, no time allocations weremade for scheduling research meetings in the convention program, nor did thecommittee receive specific tasks or projects.2.By correspondence, the committee discussed the current operating codeas suggested in the third recommendation of the 1973 report. There was consid-erable uneasiness about the status of the Research Committee under the newstructure of the association. It was proposed that the existing operating code bescrutinized by members of the committee and other interested members of theNC;PEANI. (See 3.)3.The committee presented to the Executive Council the proposal to con-duct a research symposium at the Phoenix convention. Individual members ofthe committee outlined topics and possible speakers for such a symposium.Upon investigation, it appeared that a separate research meeting could only beconducted as an interest group during the evening. Thereupon, the committeethought it wise to use this time for an extensive discussion of the role of re-search within the NCPEAM structure in general and of the Research Commit-tee in particular. Several persons, familiar with the operations of the commit-tee, have been invited to prepare position papers on this topic. The interestgroup is scheduled for Friday, January 10, from 8 to 10 p.m. The committeewishes to refrain from making specific recommendations until after the January10 discussions. Respectfully submitted,Jan BroekhoffChairman 234 235 RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE The NCPEANI Resolutions Committee submits the following resolutions forconsideration by the membership of the association:Resolved, by the National College Physical Education Association in con-vention assembled in Phoenix, Arizona, January, 1975, that the ExecutiveCouncil of the organization continue to investigate the viability of NCPEAMcombining with NAPECW into one professional organization ,and report backto the membership at the next annual meeting.Resolved, that NCPEAM urge the American Association of University Pres-idents to recommend to the National Collegiate Athletic Association and to theAssociation for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women to offer financial aid re- ceived by student-athletes on the same admission and retention standards as for all students and any aid received not be primarily dependent upon athletic skillor involvement. Respectfully submitted,Cedric DempseyChairman TIME AND SITE COMMITTEE The purpose of this committee was to identify and recommend the time andsite for the 1977 meeting of the National. College Physical Education Associ-ation for Men.According to the rotation plan, the Southeast Area is eligible for the 1977convention. This area includes: Delaware, Maryland, the District of Columbia,Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.In addition to recommendations of members of the NCPEAM, major hotelorganizations with hotels in the Southeast Area were informed of our interest ina site for the 1977 convention. Hotels indicating an interest in this conventionwere telephoned for an explanation of details. After knowing the details, thosehotels continuing to show an interest were asked to send eight packets of mate-rials including a letter explaining the more important aspects of theirinvitations.Upon receipt, the packets from the hotels were distributed to members ofthe committee. Each member of the committee was asked to rank the hotels inorder of preference and send his rankings to the chairman.The Time and Site Committee recommends the following sites, in the or-der listed, for the 1977 convention of the National College Physical Education235 Association for Men: (I) Orlando Hyatt House, Orlando, Florida; (2) Sheraton- Biltmore Hotel, Atlanta, Georgia; (3) Marco Polo Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida;(4) Fairmont Hotel, Atlanta, Georgia. Respectfully submitted,Troy HendricksChairman 2361 PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR MINORITY MEMBERS COMMITTEE PurposesI.To recruit ethnic-minority professionals into the association fromschools with predominantly minority faculty or student composition.2.To increase membership of ethnic-minority professionals in theorganization.3. To increase minority participation that will enhance the total programand help NCPEAM become more representative of its membership.ActivitiesThe committee chairman secured enough programs of the 77th conventionfrom the secretary-treasurer to use as follows:1.Sent to each committee member (affirmative action) and, also, to eachblack member of NCPEAM who failed to attend the 77th annual meeting aprogram along with a personal letter, as a followup, urging renewal of mem-bership and increased attendance and participation at convention meetings. Inaddition, each leader was encouraged to continue to attract significant minoritymembership into the NCPEAM.2.Sent a special letter, plus a convention program, to professionals inblack schools, emphasizing the value and nature of the program and the mar-velous job done by the program committee in including blacks as speakers andpanelists, etc., on the program at the 77th convention.RecommendationsAction Items 1.That the information collected in the president's questionnaire be usedto select persons on the basis of merit, contributions, and educational qual-ifications, instead of race or color.2.If and when black members are selected for programs or committees,etc., that they be involved in specific assignments calling for special work andattendance at the conventions.3.That the duties and obligations undertaken by this committee be ab-sorbed and taken over by the Membership Committee.4.That ethnic-minority professionals be secured, as are other members,by the Membership Committee.

The next meeting was tentatively scheduled for theNCAA convention in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 1975.I. The operating code of the committee (see below) was revised to reflectrecent social changes Alec ting physical education and athletics and to facilitate the potential broadening of the committee to incorporate women'sorganizations.2.

MalanChairman2.4 2 243 NCPEAM-NAPECW CONFERENCES AND PROJECTS COMMITTEE ActivitiesThe primary function of the committee over this past year was to insurethe creation of an interim Project Advisory Board to oversee the projects pro-posed by the Scholarly Directions Committee and the Professional DirectionsCommittee during 1975 and to continue interaction with the officers of NAP-ECW. The chairperson has met on two separate occasions with the members ofthe NAPECW Executive Committee. On October 4, President Fordham and Itraveled to Athens, Georgia, to discuss matters of mutual concern with AnnJewett, NAPECW president, and Jean Marsh, NAPECW joint committee chair-person. On October 12, the chairperson attended an NAPECW meeting inChicopee, Massachusetts, and met for several hours with Ann Jewett and JeanMarsh, plus Betty Spears, NAPECW president-elect.The principal result of the meetings was the determination that thereshould he an opportunity for the two organizations to meet at the AAHPERmeeting in Atlantic City to discuss areas of mutual concern (including possi-bilities of bringing the two organizations closer together). Such an interactioncould begin with a scheduled open forum to which all members of each or-ganization would be invited. On the following morning, a combined ExecutiveBoard meeting would be scheduled to discuss mutual concerns in some detailwith regard to possible action responses to appropriate issues and then finallythe hoard would split and meet separately for further ')usiness. The major prob-lem with this proposal (assuming board approval) is convincing the AAHPERhierarchy that such a meeting is appropriate and should be noted in the con-vention program. President-Elect Husman and Jean Marsh are presently work-ing with George Anderson on this matter.In my interactions with Professor Marsh, both of us have come to dieagreement that a joint committee that does not meet together at any time dur-ing the year has very little chance to be of real use to either organization. Afterstime consideration, it appears that a more formal step must be taken to insurecontinued meaningful interface between NCPEAM and NAPECW.RecommendationsI propose that NCPEAM add one member to the Executive Council whowould be our formal liaison member with NAPECW. I would suggest that theelection be for a three-year term (to provide continuity) and would further sug-gest that NCPEAM pay our liaison representative's travel expenses to the annu-al NAPECW meeting, where he would attend NAPECW Executive Board meet-ings as a nonvoting member and participate in other NAPECW affairs asinvited. Itis hoped that NAPECW will propose a similar officer as a memberof their board.I firmly believe this proposal is the appropriate mechanism to encouragefurther cooperation and to foster a deeper understanding of each organizationby the other.Respectfully submitted,David C. BischoffChairperson4)La4 3 244 NCPEAM-NAPECW PROJECT ADVISORY BOARD ActivitiesAt the 77th Annual Meeting of the NCPEAM in December 1973, the report of the Committee to Review and Develop Special Programs was adopted, and both a Professional Directions Committee and a Scholarly Directions Commit- tee were appointed.
