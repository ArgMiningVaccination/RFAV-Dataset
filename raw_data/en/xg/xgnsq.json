We wanted to get in touch simply to ask: How are we doing? We asked a random sample of alumni to give us a few minutes. We offered them no silly gewgaw or other reward. And to those of you who replied, either online or by mail, thank you\u2014truly. So what'd we learn? Many who responded said they're picking up the magazine every time it arrives or most of the time; one-third said they read most of each issue and 60 percent said they read some. One-third said they'd shared an article or an issue with someone else. Three-quarters of those surveyed told us that the magazine strengthens their connection to the university, and it has spurred 22 percent to attend an event and 15 percent to contact a classmate or friend. In the written feedback there were pats on the back (\"Keep up the great work!\") as well as some tough love. One survey-taker said that \"for the most part ... the magazine is a complete bore.\" And that's good to hear (well, sorta)\u2014honest answers are, of course, the reason we asked. In every issue we make adjustments, big or small, course corrections aimed at making the magazine fun and informative and relevant in your life. If we can do that better, we'd like to know. Some of that feedback has led to tangible changes: Survey respondents across all age groups said they prefer to receive the magazine in print, but we've also heard from people who prefer it online. So last year we began sending an email with every new issue, alerting you to new content online. We've also heard from people, in the survey and elsewhere, who said they'd like to know more about upcoming alumni events. Starting this issue, we've added a calendar (P. 63) with a taste of coming events in locales from D.C. to Sacramento, and a link to details about those and other events worldwide. The survey is closed, but our inbox is open. If you have thoughts or ideas about the magazine, write us at magazine@gwu.edu or on Twitter at @TheGWMagazine . Still no gewgaws to offer, though; just gratitude.

Perhaps we should have been more specific in our description. This is part of an evolving conversation nationwide, and we appreciate the feedback. \u2014Eds. Honey Nashman for President 2016 I would love to add my accolades to Honey Nashman (\"The Sweet Life,\" winter 2016). I graduated in 1977 and have had a successful, wonderful career as a learning disabilities teacher. I will never forget the day that Dr. Nashman stood up for me when an administrator ripped into me during a student-teaching site visit. I had asked this principal how often he observed his special education teaching staff, or some such innocent question. The administrator was unbelievably defensive and offensive and attempted to embarrass me because, I presume, he was uncomfortable answering my question. No one else had the verve or wherewithal to come to my defense! I believe her exact words were, \" That was a perfectly logical question. Well? \" So thank you, Dr. Nashman!

Today was for them to never forget that.\" ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DANIELE PODINI (P. 16)WILLIAM ATKINS[religion] Found in Translation In the decade that it took a renowned Islamic scholar to produce an English-language Quran thick with commentary, he became less of a tourist and more of a local inside the pages of the holy book. // By Menachem Wecker, MA '09Caption teekay When Seyyed Hossein Nasr's longtime publisher, HarperOne, contacted him some 11 years ago asking him to oversee a \"study Quran,\" in the style of its successful, 1993 Study Bible, the Tehran-born Islamic philosopher initially balked. \"I'm not a Quranic scholar,\" he told the publisher. It wasn't that Dr. Nasr\u2014a devout Muslim and one of just a handful of faculty members holding the title \"university 8 / gw magazine / Summer 2016 GW NEWS BOTH PAGES: WILLIAM ATKINSprofessor\"\u2014didn't know the holy book backwards and forwards. He has translated Quranic passages for his more than 50 books and 500 scholarly articles, and he recites Quranic verses by heart in his daily prayers. But to him, reading the Quran extensively for years didn't an expert translator make. \"I'm not really competent to do this,\" he recalls telling the publisher. When his editor said the book would be his or no one's, Dr. Nasr eventually caved, following a period of introspection, prayer, and frankly, a \"sense of guilt,\" Dr. Nasr says. \"I decided God will help me.\" Indeed, Dr. Nasr would subsequently endure open heart surgery, recover fully and preside over The Study Quran: A New Translation and Commentary, published in November 2015. The new book\u2014a whopping 2,048 pages, including maps and timelines\u2014adds a unique depth of context to the Quran, often from commentaries that previously hadn't been translated to English. \"These 10 years caused me to have a lot more familiarity, more intimacy,\" he says of the Quran. He compared it to visiting a place each year, as opposed to experiencing it as a local. One thinks one knows the place, and then suddenly \"you see it in a much more intimate way,\" he says. \"That's what happened to me.\" Dr. Nasr did have one condition for his editor, which HarperOne accepted: that the entire team be composed of Muslims rather than scholars who would study the Quran from either a secular or a purely academic perspective. \"The Quran should be seen as what the Torah is for Orthodox Jews, not for Reform Jews, Protestants or even Catholics,\" Dr. Nasr says. \"For Catholicism, even, the Latin Vulgate is not the same thing as the Hebrew Torah. The Hebrew Torah\u2014the very object is sacred. The Quran is like that.\" (The Vulgate, St. Jerome's fourth-century translation into Latin of the Old and New Testaments, isn't held to be penned in a sacred language to the extent that many gwmagazine.com / 9 \"IT NEEDS A KIND OF DIVINE HELP,\" HE SAYS. \"WE DIDN'T DEAL WITH THIS CASUALLY, AS IF WE WERE TRANSLATING THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV .\" practicing Muslims and Jews consider their own scripture.) To help in the project, Dr. Nasr enlisted three leading Western-born scholars, who he says are \"among the best of the young generation of Islamicists\": Caner Dagli (College of the Holy Cross), Maria Dakake (George Mason University) and Joseph Lumbard (American University of Sharjah). Later, he also brought on Mohammed Rustom (Carleton University). The team, he says, was very close knit. \"There was a lot of cooperation, and also a lot of bickering and debate, like Jewish rabbis debating a text in yeshiva, \" he says, referring to rabbinical academies, whose curricula are often typified by intense intellectual debate. That Dr. Nasr knew the other team members and all five shared a similar worldview helped preserve the text's unity, he says. The response to the book, Dr. Nasr says, has been overwhelmingly positive, with the exception of occasional criticism from Salafis and Wahabis, who favor strict interpretations of the Quran. Some professors have criticized the work because \"Orientalism doesn't dominate over the scene completely anymore,\" he says of the more secular-minded scholarship. Among the nearly three dozen scholars offering praise on the publisher's website, the book seems to conjure words like \"extraordinary\" and \"monumental\"\u2014\"a monumental milestone,\" \"a monumental accomplishment,\" \"a monument of religious literature.\" Quran expert Walid Saleh, an associate professor at the University of Toronto who specializes in Quranic history and exegesis, told GW Magazine that The Study Quran represents a turning point in English study of the text. \"You have in one book an attempt to present the Quran for the educated reader,\" he says. \"The Quran is now presented in the same format as the Bible, and as such, makes it more accessible to non-Muslim readers.\" And in its religious point of view, The Study Quran preserves the holy book's relevance to devout Muslim readers, he says. \"It is not presented as literature, or an archaic work, but as revelation and scripture that has significance to people.\" That's just what Dr. Nasr had in mind. \"I'm a believing Muslim. I believe the Quran is the word of God, and only God really permits his word to be understood. It needs a kind of divine help,\" he says. \"We didn't deal with this casually, as if we were translating The Brothers Karamazov .\" Understanding a sacred text, such as the Quran, Dr. Nasr says, requires faith. And then context is also vital. \"There are people who have read the Quran for 20 years, and they think they know the Quran, yet they're chopping off heads in Syria,\" Dr. Nasr says. The book, in part, was meant to offer a counterpoint to some of the ways the Quran has been interpreted to destructive ends, he says. In an article titled \"Could this Quran curb extremism?\" CNN's Religion Editor Daniel Burke notes that prior English translations of the Quran often had been \"ill-suited to foiling extremist ideology or introducing Americans to Islam,\" lacking scholarly context and accessible language. \"The commentaries don't try to delete or hide the verses that refer to violence. We have to be faithful to the text,\" Mr. Burke quotes Dr. Nasr as saying. \"But they can explain that war and violence were always understood as a painful part of the human condition.\" Part of the problem, Dr. Nasr feels, is that modern readers, particularly those who spend the bulk of their time on social networks, can be easily misled. The abundance of commentary and context in the new translation\u2014walls of text that sometimes dwarf Quranic verse on the page\u2014was in part an attempt \"to avoid the soundbyte habit, which the young people have gained so much on Twitter, the Internet and TV,\" he says. \"Fortunately, this has not disappeared completely. The great novels of [Leo] Tolstoy, [Honor\u00e9 de] Balzac, [Marcel] Proust or [Herman] Melville, which are hundreds of pages, are still read. There are still people who like to read.\" And while that same digitally connected world means that perhaps more non-Muslims than ever are reading the Quran\u2014when Peter the Venerable had the Quran translated into Latin in the 12th century, for example, Dr. Nasr asks, \"How many people read it?\"\u2014access isn't the only obstacle. \"You can read the beautiful psalms and still be misguided,\" he says. \"The Quran has many levels of meaning.\" The Study Quran, uniquely, attempts to capture as many of those levels as possible, relying upon the \"complete Islamic tradition,\" both Sunni and Shiite, as well as theological, philosophical, grammatical, linguistic, historical and mystical insights. \"We made use of all of them,\" Dr. Nasr says. From the latter\u2014the mystical tradition\u2014 he notes the Quranic verse, rendered in his translation as, \"Wheresoever you turn, There is the Face of God\" (2:115). \"You can't solve that by legal means,\" he says. Among the context that The Study Quran provides on the verse is the Sufi mystical doctrine of wahdat al-wujd, or a \"oneness of being.\" While the braiding of all these threads into a single translation is something many scholars have been willing to call historic, Dr. Nasr's own view seems hewn by numerous Quranic passages that preach humility. \"This is the first time in history, perhaps, that this has been done,\" he says. GW NEWS 10 / gw magazine / Summer 2016On a bright and unseasonably chilly May morning following weeks of rain, U.S. Sen. Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.) and members of the GW community gathered to celebrate the end of the university's 195th academic year. Facing a sun-splashed National Mall, and with an estimated 25,000 people in attendance, Mr. Booker channeled life lessons from his parents as well as personal triumphs and tragedies in an emphatic speech that urged graduates to fight for a better, less cynical future by taking control of their lives. \"[My father] would say you can't control the world, but you can control your reactions,\" Mr. Booker said. \"Don't give in to cynicism. It is a toxic spiritual state. You've got to be one that, wherever you are, like a flower, you've got to blossom where you're planted. You cannot eliminate darkness. You cannot banish it by cursing darkness. The only way to get rid of darkness is light and to be the light yourself.\" In addition to Mr. Booker, honorary degrees also were conferred upon Baroness and Parliamentarian Joanna Shields, MBA '87, and philanthropist and Southern Engineering Corporation President Albert H. Small. GW President Steven Knapp, student speaker Julia Haigney, BA '11, JD '16, and Provost Forrest Maltzman also offered remarks during the Sunday-morning ceremony, which was shortened due to high winds. It was one of more than a dozen events held during GW's commencement week, including individual school celebrations, a doctoral hooding ceremony, senior class toast, Phi Beta Kappa induction and the Interfaith Baccalaureate. On the Mall, Dr. Maltzman welcomed the more than 6,400 graduates, highlighting the \"one-of-a-[Celebrations] Cory Booker: 'The only way to get rid of darkness is light and to be the light yourself.'

Dr. Knapp will continue to serve as president through the next academic year, during which the university will conduct a national search for his successor. In a June 7 letter to the GW community, Dr. Knapp gave thanks to the many people with whom he has worked to advance the university's academic mission. \"I cannot overstate my gratitude to the countless groups and individuals who, these past nine years, have done so much to ensure our collective success,\" Dr. Knapp said. Dr. Knapp recalled that when he was offered the job, the Board of Trustees asked how long he would expect to serve in the role. Ten years seemed right, he told the board. \"A shorter tenure,\" he wrote, \"would make it hard to carry important projects through to their conclusion; a longer one would deprive the institution of an opportunity to consider fresh ideas and approaches, which are especially valuable in an era of rapid change like the one we are now experiencing across the whole landscape of higher education.\" Dr. Knapp became the 16th president of the university in August 2007. His priorities included enhancing the university's partnerships with neighboring institutions, expanding the scope of its research, strengthening its worldwide community of alumni, enlarging its students' opportunities for public service and leading its transformation into a model of urban sustainability. \"The work of my final year as president is clearly defined,\" Dr. Knapp wrote. \"I will concentrate on supporting the deans as we rapidly approach the conclusion of our $1 billion 'Making History' campaign. I will continue to focus on building our worldwide and lifelong community of GW alumni. And I will seek new ways to make good on the university's promise to ensure that every student we enroll has the fullest possible opportunity to succeed so that he or she can go forth from the university fully prepared to change the world.\" Board of Trustees Chair Nelson Carbonell, BS '85, praised Dr. Knapp's contributions and emphasized that the next president will build on a strong foundation. \"Steve's commitment to growing research, academic excellence and diversity has made GW a vastly different and better place than when I was a student,\" Mr. Carbonell says. \"As we prepare for the beginning of the university's third century in 2021, Steve has set us on the right course\u2014upward.\" kind\" opportunity to celebrate commencement on the National Mall. GW is the only university that holds its graduation ceremony there, a tradition that started in 2006 after commencement moved from the Ellipse. Mr. Booker is the first political figure to speak at GW's commencement since 2011 when the ceremony featured then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke last year. Mr. Booker filled his speech with anecdotes, advice, jokes and confessions. He spoke of his parents having their first date at the Jefferson Memorial\u2014\"my dad got lucky to meet my mom, and my mom had the charity to allow him to marry her\"\u2014and delivered droll one-liners that sparked laughter in the crowd. \"My mom has a saying: Behind every successful child is an astonished parent,\" Mr. Booker said. He implored those in attendance to heed the wisdom of their parents and to raise the level of respect and civility in America, starting with their own daily actions. \"I'm tired of this call in our country for this idea of tolerance\u2014that is not the aspiration,\" Mr. Booker said. \"We have a nation right now that seems to think the greatest and highest achievement is for us to be a tolerant nation, but I say no. We're not called to be a tolerant nation. We're called to be a nation of love. What we need to do is understand that we have to love each other, that we have to see each other have worth and dignity and value.\" Dr. Knapp thanked the parents, families and friends of the graduates and conferred degrees, pausing to offer a final charge to the graduates. \"Go out, be the light, remain faithful and change our world,\" he said. \"Congratulations to you all.\" \u2014James Irwin Read the full text of Dr. Knapp's letter and highlights of his tenure at gwtoday.gwu.edu/letter- university-community- president-steven-knappJESSICA MCCONNELL BURTThe Corcoran School of the Arts and Design's Flagg building was so packed with visitors for the April 6 opening of its annual senior thesis exhibition, NEXT, that it took Director Sanjit Sethi several minutes to quiet people down to introduce GW President Steven Knapp at the kickoff reception. \"I don't think I've seen a crowd this large here in the Corcoran in all of the years I've lived right up the street,\" Dr. Knapp told an audience of more than 800 people. \"The students display an incredible diligence, talent, ingenuity and creativity in everything we are seeing here.\" NEXT, which started in 2011, this year included 49 undergraduates who earned their degrees in art studies, digital media design, fine art, graphic design, interior design, photography and photojournalism, and 43 graduate students who got master's degrees in art education, art and the book, exhibition design, interior design, new media photojournalism and teaching master's programs. The exhibition made use of all 11 first-floor traditional galleries as well as the museum's stairway, rotunda and atrium and featured a wide range of art, from paintings to essays to photography to typography to sculpture to art installation. The show closed May 15. \"Their work offers insight into a world of diverse perspectives and disparate systems, which are in fact intricately connected,\" Mr. Sethi said. \"The displayed work is the result of a tremendous degree of creative investment and is the culmination of a curriculum that prepares students to be engaged artists, designers, critical thinkers and community builders.\" Through a yearlong interactive class project, \"Design Lab,\" the students also conceived the show's publicity materials and its branding. [archives] Thousands of Boxes of Corcoran History Return to View The archives of the Corcoran Gallery and the Corcoran College of Art and Design were donated to GW in June, opening them to researchers for the first time in almost a decade. The archives, donated by the Corcoran board of trustees, were closed in 2007 due to a lack of funding and put in long-term storage. The materials comprise nearly 2,000 boxes of historical documents and hundreds of thousands of architectural drawings, exhibition posters, photographs and oversize ledgers. The Corcoran opened in 1869 and, as part of a 2014 agreement, became what is now GW's Corcoran School of the Arts and Design. The Corcoran archives offer insight into nearly 150 years of American art museums and art education, including journals from the gallery's first curator and the architectural drawings for the institution's Flagg building. The archives are available to the public at the Special Collections Research Center in Gelman Library.

Her mother died of an overdose in 2010. At the age of 15, she dropped out of high school to earn enough money to survive. For Ms. Pool, MA '16\u2014who this spring completed a master's degree in speech- language pathology\u2014continuing her education had been an uphill battle. And yet, while at GW she did a clinical externship at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where she helped patients regain the ability to speak and swallow; she volunteered at a homeless shelter; and in September, she starts a job at a Seattle veterans' hospital. Her journey, in short, has not been easy. \"Do I pay to rent my textbook, or do I buy groceries?\" Ms. Pool remembered asking herself. But, as she told more than 400 people in April at the annual Power & Promise Scholarships and Fellowships Dinner, that changed when she received the Lambert Graduate Stipend in Arts and Sciences. Funded by Janet Lambert and her late husband Eugene Lambert, BA '57, the award goes to a continuing graduate student who is at risk of leaving GW due to financial hardship. \"I don't have to make those choices anymore,\" Ms. Pool said, blinking back tears. From the podium, she looked directly at the woman who had made that possible. \"Behind all of this, it's you, Mrs. Lambert,\" she said. \"Your generosity amazes me.\" Donor-funded scholarships, like those feted at the event, are one prong of the university's financial aid commitment, along with university funds and grants from outside entities, such as the federal government. During the 2015-16 school year, donors contributed more than $13 million to Power & Promise. What makes Power & Promise unique is that it is entirely funded through philanthropic dollars. During the 2014-15 school year\u2014the most recent year for which figures are available\u2014GW provided $174 million in financial aid to undergraduates. Full-time undergrads received an average of $29,917 in need-based aid and an average of $18,756 in non-need-based aid. More than 70 percent of GW's full-time undergrads receive financial aid. GW has about 11,000 undergraduates and 14,500 graduate students. The annual Power & Promise Dinner brings together scholarship recipients with their benefactors, and the meeting often shows that the relationship is not one-sided.

Rather than the wide sky and ranging fields of the bucolic imagination, HomeGrown exists\u2014like a leafy, high-tech Narnia\u2014inside a 320-square-foot shipping container in New Jersey. Kale, spinach, arugula, fresh herbs and other greens grow year-round under LED lights in baths of nutrient-rich water. All this results in a farming model that uses 90 percent less water and 80 percent less fertilizer than traditional farms, says Parth Chauhan, BA '13, founder and CEO of HomeGrown, which won big at GW's New Venture Competition finals in April. And since it is a closed system, safe from insects and contaminants, HomeGrown uses no herbicides or pesticides and produces no environmentally harmful runoff, Mr. Chauhan says. \"What would normally take a football- field-sized area to [yield], we can actually do in a space smaller than this stage,\" he said during the competition, standing at the helm of the Jack Morton Auditorium. Mr. Chauhan grew up in the New Jersey community where HomeGrown now is based and has known teammates and fellow farmers Raghav Garg and Zeel Patel since middle school. GW senior Pranav Kaul, the fourth founder, met Mr. Chauhan at the university. The company, which has been in operation since last year, took first place overall in the competition and won nine supplemental cash and in-kind prizes\u2014a total winnings value of more than $74,000, including $60,000 in cash. \"[HomeGrown] has the great combination of meeting a need, resonating with people and they've worked out the technology.

The findings were published in May in the journal Nature Communications . Optogenetics has been used in neuroscience for a decade, but is relatively new in cardiac research. Traditionally, the most reliable method of measuring cell response to a drug is by sticking probes into the cell. While high-throughput technologies have been developed to speed up the process, until now no high-throughput systems have been available for work with heart cells, the researchers say. Co-author Aleks Klimas, a PhD student in Dr. Entcheva's lab, said the new system not only allows for faster testing but also provides a safer way to do measurements when using hazardous materials. \"The benefit of optical stimulation and optical recording is that it provides a way to dynamically control millions of cells simultaneously without needing to come into contact with the sample,\" Ms. Klimas says. 1,500 16 / gw magazine / Summer 2016 GW NEWS WILLIAM ATKINS-Assistant Professor of Geography Michael Mann , whose new study found that human activity\u2014from building homes to tossing lit cigarettes\u2014explains as much about the frequency and location of California wildfires as does climate change, although it's often unaccounted for in models.

Ami Zota, a professor who led the research team from the Milken Institute School of Public Health, says the findings \"raise concerns because phthalates have been linked to a number of serious health problems in children and adults.\" The research, one of the first studies to look at fast-food consumption and exposure to these chemicals, appeared in April in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives . Phthalates belong to a class of industrial chemicals used to make food-packaging materials, tubing for dairy products and other items used in the production of fast food. Other research suggests these chemicals can leach out of plastic food packaging and can contaminate highly processed food. Studies of exposure to these chemicals indicate they can damage the reproductive system and may lead to infertility. The team looked at data on 8,877 participants who had answered detailed questions about their diets over the previous 24 hours, including consumption of fast food. The participants also gave a urine sample that could be tested for the breakdown products of two specific phthalates: DEHP and DiNP. Dr. Zota and her colleagues found that the more fast food the participants ate, the higher the exposure to phthalates. People in the study with the highest consumption of fast food had 23.8 percent higher levels of the breakdown product for DEHP in their urine. And those same diners had nearly 40 percent higher levels of DiNP metabolites in their urine compared to people who reported no fast food in the 24 hours prior to the testing. \"Individuals don't have much control over how climate change will affect wildfires in the future.

I can relate to this idea that a museum can and should be a living, breathing place. Your choreography has tackled a range of topics. How does your approach change depending on the subject? No matter what, I'm interested in the human condition and human stories. When I was focusing on the cosmos with a recent NASA collaboration, I was approaching it by examining personal stories of inspiration from astronauts or individuals whose families had worked for NASA. When I approach a topic, the goal is for the audience to feel sympathetic and identified. Maybe they'll say, \"Oh my God, that could be me dealing with this.\" I want the idea that maybe we're not so different\u2014 maybe the human experience is the same all over the world\u2014to resonate. What can non-dancers glean from dance? I think people can really take away a sense of generosity of communication and grace. When the body is informed through dance, there is an ability to sense how people are feeling and to better understand situations you're moving in\u2014from walking through the Metro and not bumping into people, to having a conversation in the office and understanding people's posture and what they're not saying verbally. I was on a tour a few years ago and we went from Israel to Egypt to the West Bank, and the handshake from country to country was completely different. The pressure of a handshake could suggest if a person felt like an American was being aggressive or open to conversation. That sensitivity is important to communication not just between individuals, but across borders. It's important to note that as the first- ever choreographer-in-residence, you're making dance history, too. This is a historic movement for the Smithsonian\u2014they are saying, \"Yes, dance can be represented as part of the history of America.\" I guess we just had to prove ourselves first and show that if we performed in the galleries, we weren't going to kick someone or knock down a piece of artwork. \u2014 Julyssa LopezDana Tai Soon Burgess, MFA '94 , has explored everything from identity to the cosmos through his choreography. His eponymous 24-year-old dance company has performed at the request of the Obamas and globally as a cultural envoy of the U.S. State Department. In May, he was named the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery's first-ever choreographer-in-residence. Mr. Burgess, who also heads the GW Theatre and Dance Department, spoke with GW Magazine about the new role and what it means to bring dance to an audience of museumgoers. What can you tell us about this new role? I'm looking at the role as a way to represent America in motion, and as a way to enliven the exhibitions that are at the National Portrait Gallery. I get to create dances around exhibitions, both permanent and traveling. The first exhibition I have chosen to work on is called The Outwin , and it is contemporary portraiture that deals with major themes of race, immigration, gender and socioeconomic disparity in America. My company will rehearse in gallery spaces, and then we'll hold a public performance at the portrait gallery courtyard this October. Your company performed \"Dancing the Dream\" in 2013-14, the National Portrait Gallery's first exhibition on American dance. How does showcasing dance in a museum setting affect people's relationship to your work? Being closer to the audience changes the way the rehearsal process goes, because there's extra concentration\u2014we have to stay focused because it's not just us in the dance room; there's a whole audience around us.

Steel also made America a world power.\" Mr. Stoddard's narrative ventures into the mills and the ships and beside the workers. Combined with the historical and modern contexts for steel, the result is a deep dive that remains accessible and relatable to the casual reader. It humanizes the subject. \"I love my job,\" the general foreman of a blast furnace tells him, recalling how he entered the industry as a new dad after leaving the Navy. \"The guy who interviewed me asked, 'Are you afraid no, and he said, 'You've got a job in the blast furnace department.'\" Another man, with a \"Santa Claus nose and steel- rimmed glasses,\" whose \"genes were a Scandinavian smorgasbord,\" has fingers that are \"stubby from a life's work on engines, but the rest of him was trim.\" Even the machinery lurches to life. In a room that's two football fields long and 10 stories high, hollow drums turn with \"malevolent slowness at about the speed of a slow roll of the eyes; bolts protruded from their cylindrical inside walls like spikes.\" What's revealed is something far more complex than cold, dead steel. \"When you say the word 'technology' nowadays, everyone assumes you're talking about something that has to do with digital information,\" Mr. Stoddard says. \"What I was trying to say in the book is that steelmaking's a very sophisticated technology.\" But instead of manifesting as chips or wafers, he says, it's skylines. Steel: From Mine to Mill, the Metal that Made America (Zenith Press, 2015) By Brooke C. Stoddard, MA '73 Newspaper headlines in the mid-1980s centered on the U.S. steel industry's challenges with trade, unions and productivity. But while the rest of the country worried about steel's future, Brooke C. Stoddard, MA '73, was curious about much more basic questions: What is steel, and how is it made? \"I thought there was a big gap in the discussion,\" he says. \"A lot of people, including me, didn't know what was going on in mills.\" Mr. Stoddard, who lives in Alexandria, Va., contacted the nearest integrated steel mill\u2014the type that converts iron ore to steel\u2014located near Baltimore. The mill agreed to host him, but couldn't right away. So he headed to the Library of Congress for research.

ATHLETICS COMMUNICATIONSIn 2015, the Colonials (10-8-0 overall, 6-2-0 in the A-10) gave up 23 goals, third fewest in the 13-team A-10, and its seven shutouts were tied with Fordham, La Salle and Saint Louis for second most behind VCU's eight. George Mason and Saint Louis led the league in fewest goals allowed with 21 each. In the A-10 tournament, GW lost in the quarterfinals to VCU, the eventual tourney runner-up. The problem, though, is that when Mr. Jones took over, he didn't have the personnel to play the possession-oriented style he prefers. He still needed big, fast guys; he just needed them to be more skilled with the ball. He also needed them to run more. And it took three years to get enough of these players and to build chemistry among them. \"We have a lot more technical players,\" says senior midfielder Garrett Heine, GW's leading scorer in 2015 (nine goals, 22 points) and a first-team All-A-10 pick. \"We've recruited a lot more players that are physically fit, that are able to play 90 minutes without having to use too many subs, which makes us stronger all around.\" Mr. Heine, like Tobi Adewole\u2014a senior defender, second- team All-A-10 selection and an anchor of GW's heart-and-soul back line\u2014is a product of a youth-soccer academy. Essentially a farm system for college and pro teams, the academy model was set up in 2007 by the U.S. Soccer Federation to bring the American system more in line with the world model and to shift the focus of youth soccer from games to instruction. Now, there are thousands of academies, also called clubs. U.S. Soccer has its own academy, as do each of MLS' 20 teams. \"I think the academy is the best way moving forward for youth soccer,\" says Mr. Heine, who played for the San Diego Surf Club. Mr. Jones says academies, which are sanctioned and monitored by U.S. Soccer, produce players that are more technically sound and more of them\u2014making it easier to find the sort of players he needed for his roster reshaping. This season, three of Mr. Jones' eight incoming freshmen played academy soccer\u2014one of them, Reese Moore, played in the system of the Columbus Crew, an MLS team\u2014to help replenish a team that lost four starters. \"We don't want to be the team that goes out and wins the regular season and then doesn't do anything the next year,\" Mr. Adewole says. \"We want to build off that because we were seen as the underdogs last year, but [this] year, we're not going to be seen as underdogs.

It gave up 11 goals, and the Colonials\u2014who scored just twice in that span\u2014started 1-4. \"When I walked out of the office,\" Mr. Jones says, \"I had to look like I was 100 percent still behind it, and there were days where I walked out of the office where I wasn't\u2014but I had to sell it to my guys. They never once thought I didn't think it wasn't going to work, even though in my mind, when I'd get in here ... and look at my stuff and I'd be like, 'We gotta think about, I don't know, changing some of this up.'\" Mr. Jones resisted, and GW\u2014committed to its aggressive, pressure-up-high defense\u2014turned it around and, led by an imposing back line, went 9-4 the rest of the season to win the 2015 Atlantic 10 regular-season title. Seven of those nine wins were by shutout.Genius, right?\"I wouldn't go that far,\" says Mr. Jones, laughing. It's the culmination of a four-year rebuilding project during which Mr. Jones has rewritten program philosophy and overhauled the roster. Taking over for longtime coach George Lidster\u2014for whom Mr. Jones, a native of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, played defender/midfielder from 1995 to 1998\u2014Mr. Jones made GW's playing style more possession- oriented, moving from the more direct, kick-it-long approach of his predecessor. Mr. Jones turned the offense-defense relationship more symbiotic by pushing up the defense and shortening the field. This is based on the simple axiom that it's easier to score when the ball's closer to the net. To paraphrase a basketball term: Mr. Jones likes to full- pitch press.\"We've recruited a lot more players that are physically fit, that are able to play 90 minutes ... which makes us stronger all around.\" GARRETT HEINESENIOR MIDFIELDER gwmagazine.com / 25 ATHLETICS COMMUNICATIONS26 / magazine / Summer 2016 GW NEWS 2015-16. The A-10 ranked seventh out of 32 D-I conferences last season, according to Real Time RPI. The America East was 16th. \"One of the things I've wanted to do [at Hartford] that I couldn't was go to a Sweet 16,\" Ms. Rizzotti says. \"... I'm not saying it'll ever be easy because it's hard to be one of the last teams playing. ... I've got to do a great coaching job, but I have the players [at GW] that can get to that level, and that's what I've told the team.\" At UConn, Ms. Rizzotti led the Huskies in 1995 to their first national title. That year, she was named The Associated Press National Player of the Year on a team that also featured women's hoops great Rebecca Lobo. Ms. Rizzotti left UConn as its all-time assists leader. Not surprisingly, Ms. Rizzotti says she gets the UConn question a lot. But she understands why. As women's basketball aristocracy and a member of the UConn team that started it all, she's a logical person to ask. And unlike a lot of people, she's qualified to answer. \"It's funny because I feel like the people that sometimes comment on whether or not UConn is good or bad\u2014and most of the time, they say it's bad\u2014are people who would never watch women's basketball otherwise,\" says Ms. Rizzotti, who won WNBA championships in 1999 and 2000 as a member of the now-defunct Houston Comets. \"So any time you have somebody who isn't typically talking about women's basketball in the media that, all of a sudden, wants to start talking about how UConn is bad for women's basketball or Geno is whatever, now you've got another set of people paying attention to our game. \"Whether [the debate is] good or bad, I don't know. I just feel like we're always fighting for publicity; we're always fighting for recognition, and people don't like that they're the team that gets it more than everybody else. But they're getting it. And if they weren't good, people might not be paying attention at all.\" The criticism of UConn's juggernaut\u2014the Huskies have gone undefeated six times and once won a record 90 games in a row\u2014is that it hurts competitive balance, which has long been a problem in women's basketball. Since the women's NCAA tournament started in 1982, UConn and fellow traditional power Tennessee combined have won 19 of 35 national championships. No other school has won more than two. \"I think that women's basketball fans would like to see there be more parity,\" Ms. Rizzotti says. \"But if you're talking about transcending sports fans and having people actually pay attention to women's basketball, [UConn is] the only one who has gotten people to do that.\" There is more parity now, Ms. Rizzotti says, because of better coaching at youth levels and increased athletic opportunities for women. And while brand-name teams still monopolize star recruits, there are more good and, sometimes, even great players available for everyone else. Jonquel Jones, now a member of the WNBA's Connecticut Sun, was a first-round draft pick out of GW. In 2016-17, the Colonials return two of their top three scorers\u20146-2 forward Caira Washington (13.2 points per game) and 5-9 guard Hannah Schaible (10.4 ppg)\u2014but lost five seniors off the 2015-16 team, and over the next two seasons, will lose 11 more. Ms. Rizzotti, who rotates as many as 10 players and, at the time of the interview had seen her new team only on film, says she'll be recruiting every position, looking for balanced players who can do a little bit of everything. \"They're coming to us as better athletes,\" Ms. Rizzotti says of high school players. \"And so there are just more possibilities that you can get, like the men do. There are so many studs that fall through the cracks and go to a smaller school and then they grow into their game.\" [Women's Basketball] New Coach Answers the Big Question Former UConn, WNBA standout discusses the state of women's hoops // By Matthew Stoss New GW coach Jennifer Rizzotti can answer\u2014or at least address with authority\u2014the biggest ongoing debate in women's college basketball: Is the University of Connecticut's dominance good for the sport? Ms. Rizzotti, a former UConn point guard and one of the founding members of the WNBA, says definitively that, yes, the Huskies, 11-0 in national championship games since 1995 under coach Geno Auriemma, are good for women's hoops, which has historically been top-heavy and upset-starved. \"I think they're great for women's basketball because they play the way you're supposed to play,\" says Ms. Rizzotti, who arrived this spring to replace Jonathan Tsipis, who left to coach the University of Wisconsin. \"Any coach that watches them\u2014it's a chance to learn; it's a chance to get better. So how is that not better for the rest of us? And Geno opens his practices. Any coach can go up there and watch their workouts, watch how they do things. He doesn't hide it. He's not secretive. He doesn't have a magic formula. He is willing to share. So how is that not good for the game, if you're trying to get better as a coach?\" The 42-year-old Ms. Rizzotti is a 17- year coaching veteran, influenced by Mr. Auriemma, who, she says, she consults more on the handling of players than anything related to running her franken-version of the Princeton offense. She took the University of Hartford to six NCAA tournaments\u2014its only trips in program history\u2014where she won two games out of the America East Conference, a lower-tier Division I league that hasn't ever sent more than two teams to the NCAAs. It's sent just one every season since 2009-10 when Ms. Rizzotti's Hartford squad received an at-large bid. At GW, Ms. Rizzotti says, she's better positioned to make a run in the NCAA tournament thanks to membership in a stronger league.

He's spent his life doing everything you always wanted to do, and now that he's getting older ... absolutely nothing's changed. STORY BY MATTHEW STOSS PHOTOS BY MICHAEL ZAGARIS Michael Zagaris in London in October 2013SONYA JASINSKI30 / gw magazine / Summer 2016made friends with Keith Moon, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Peter Frampton. \"He said, 'Have you been to San Francis - co before?'\" says Mr. Frampton, who met Mr. Zagaris in San Francisco in 1969 while on tour with Humble Pie. \"And we said, 'No,' so the next thing you know, we sort of drifted off into sightseeing and we went all over. He was basically my first true friend that I made in the United States.\" Years later, Mr. Zagaris, as he often does with his celebrity friends, took Mr. Frampton to work with him, inviting the rock star to a 49ers-Buccaneers game in Tampa Bay in 1986. \"I realized that I wasn't going to be sitting in the stands,\" says Mr. Frampton, who was living in Fort Lauderdale at the time. \"I was his lens roadie.\" It was not lost on those in attendance that below them was Peter Frampton, running up and down the sideline, carrying some dude's camera bag. \"People are shouting at me from the stands\u2014'Hey, Peter!' It was funny.\" Mr. Zagaris is 71 years old, but except for his face, you wouldn't know it. In the back of the dark bar, he chats up a waitress about community college, her ambition and her physics major before smoothing onto his soapbox\u2014as essential to him as keys, phone and wallet\u2014to tell her and everyone what's become of the Haight, San Francisco and the human race. These are his floating verses, his maverick stanzas. \"It's why our species is endangered now,\" Mr. Zagaris says, \"because we've consumed\u2014we're all about consumption and we're all about pillaging and taking what we want. So we've plundered most of the resources. There aren't many spots left on the planet to invade, kill the natives that live there and take what we want, whether it's oil from the ground or gold. So now we're turning on each other, and I'm fighting that, too.\" Mr. Zagaris\u2014Z-Man\u2014has presence in his black leather jacket. He's engaging, endear - ing, infuriating. He asks questions. He'll talk to anyone. He'll challenge anyone. He's wiry, dense of form and with hands like they've done nothing but handle rope. He dyes his hair back to black. He has a commanding voice that flares during rants and, during sto - ries, moves fluid between the English accents he perfected over decades of photographing and befriending the little island's rock stars. Z-Man is both a vestige of The Movement and a soldier for it. He's always looking for the guy ruining it for the rest of us, and from his enemy, he draws sustenance and might. \"There's always going to be something to be unhappy about,\" Mr. Zagaris says. The leather jacket creaks when he moves. \"I think Mick Jagger performs with the Rolling Stones at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in June 1972.MICHAEL ZAGARIS IS SPRY FOR A RELIC. After hours in April, he moves through the Haight-Ashbury to a dark bar, equal parts fury and rock 'n' roll. He's lived in this neighborhood\u2014the once and future heart of free love and fighting The Man\u2014since 1973. It's where he's celebrated and suffered psychedelia, onwarded and pho - tographed the revolution, then watched the Winterland Ballroom shutter and the Grate - ful Dead move away. Mr. Zagaris\u2014photojournalist, romantic, polemicist\u2014believes in magic, in an Eastern way, that it can be metabolized, misdirected and blocked but never destroyed. Right now, he says, it's diminished, trampled under a Google bus and disrespected by the \"tech yuppies\" who gesso desecration over the city that he mourns and loves: San Francisco. A grunt for Bobby Kennedy in '68 and the official photographer for the 49ers since 1973 and the Oakland A's since 1981, Mr. Zagaris, BA '67, has spent his adulthood in San Fran - cisco. He made himself and his old Nikon F fixtures in The Scene by haunting the city's music venues\u2014Winterland, the Boarding House, the Old Waldorf, the Family Dog, the Fillmore and Fillmore West. He photographed Led Zeppelin's last show in America and the Sex Pistols' last show ever. He was a regular contributor for CREEM and Rolling Stone by the mid '70s. He toured with The Who and the Rolling Stones and 32 / gw magazine / Summer 2016gwmagazine.com / 33most revolutionaries are like that. And what - ever they're fighting against, whatever they're rebelling against, that is just grist for their mill. There's always a deeper dissatisfaction and I'm not sure I know what that is but I know it's there. And now the tech people, boy, they're perfect for that. They're all about what they have and they're blind to everything else.\" He's lived hard and slipped death twice but he's rallied since 1983 and his last brush with the underworld. The Oakland A's team doctor says he's in great shape now, thanks in part to daily workouts at the JCC. Mr. Zagaris was raised Catholic. It's all part of a life spent in search of the sweet spot between death and boredom. Continues on P. 37\"At some point, I'm going to fly too close to the sun and my wings will melt and it's going to be a hard landing,\" Mr. Zagaris says. \"But you know what? Honestly? I don't care. If that happened 10 seconds from now, I had a great ... run and a great time and I wouldn't do any - thing differently.\" Z-MAN , METHOD PHOTOGRAPHER Beneath the Oakland Coliseum, in the Oak - land A's clubhouse\u2014basically a giant closet with a snack bar\u2014Michael Zagaris and Sean Manaea are the only people around. They're both at Mr. Manaea's locker before an April night game. A 6-foot-5, 245-pound affable slab of a left-hander, Mr. Manaea is in a swivel chair, half-uniformed and about two hours from making his major league debut. Mr. Zagaris, wearing an A's hat and an A's T-shirt, is squatting in front of the slab, which laughs frequently, and taking pictures. Nei - ther of them gives even a half-damn about the camera. When Mr. Zagaris is done with his photos, he stands up, pulls out his iPhone and shows Mr. Manaea a picture. They both laugh. Then Mr. Zagaris leaves Mr. Manaea to prepare, and Mr. Zagaris goes off to mingle with anyone else who might be breathing that night at the Coliseum\u2014the clubhouse atten - dants, the security guard, A's Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Billy Beane, the other players, the opposing team. When Mr. Zagaris takes a picture, he might as well be scratching his nose. Photog - raphy, at heart, is voyeurism, but his camera is less a peephole and more a barn door. \"The camera was an entr\u00e9e into the scenes I wanted to live,\" Mr. Zagaris says while driv - ing around San Francisco one afternoon. He has a Kia that if it were an Autobot, would just transform into another Kia. \"The camera allows you to do that, much like an actor can use the character or the role he's playing to do that, to become that for a while.\" left This Sports Illustrated cover features A's pitcher Dallas Braden celebrating his perfect game on May 9, 2010. above Bill Walsh and Joe Montana chat during the fourth quarter of the 1985 NFC title game at Candlestick Park. 34 / gw magazine / Summer 2016gwmagazine.com / 3536 / gw magazine / Summer 2016gwmagazine.com / 37 Meet Z-Man, method photographer. This fall, Mr. Zagaris will release the first of three coffee-table books, which collect pictures and tales from his nearly 50 years as a professional photographer. During his career, he's shot 38 Super Bowls and 12 World Series. He's had Sports Illustrated covers, and NFL Films made a documentary about him in 2004. He's done fashion, culture, life and\u2014his favorite\u2014music. The first book, Total Excess (Reel Art Press, October 2016), features his rock 'n' roll work and the stories that, unless you've ever talked to him for more than 37 seconds, will be untold\u2014like the time he says he tried to romance Nico in a famous Greenwich Village bar. In the spring of 1967, Mr. Zagaris sat alone in Cafe Wha. Mr. Zagaris, then 21 and a senior at GW, was into The Velvet Underground and Nico , the album with the Andy Warhol banana on the cover and a striking picture of Nico, the German singer-songwriter and model, on the back. \"That picture\u2014I was just transfixed,\" Mr. Zagaris says. \"I loved the way she looked and I wanted to meet her.\" He set out from D.C. in late March or early April. \"I would take the train from Union Sta - tion to Penn Station, and then I'd take the subway to Cafe Wha. And I'd sit at a table and star and showered with the 49ers and routinely goes full Stanislavsky, wearing cleats to photo - graph games\u2014it made him a character. \"They brought him into their circle and allowed him to photo - graph them and hang out with them and party with them,\" says David Talbot, the founder of Salon.com and a friend of Mr. Zagaris. \"He was part of this revolution, this cultural revolution, and he was taking part in it and he was chronicling it at the same time. He was one of the fortunate few because it was a pretty rarefied circle to be hanging out with these amazing artists who were changing history, and he was allowed into their inner circle because, I'd say, of his large personality, because of his large heart and because of his intelligence and because of his creativity.\" Mr. Zagaris, of course, got the glamor - ous stage shots that make good dorm-room wallpaper and now sell for $1,000 a print on Wolfgang's Vault and Rock Paper Photo, but his best stuff\u2014his signature stuff\u2014takes us backstage and into hotel rooms, to the spaces reserved for bands, roadies and favored groupies. A photo of Pete Townshend\u2014The Who guitarist is seated with his back turned, meditating over a Les Paul and a Hiwatt I was writing poetry and I also remember I had a Turgenev book and I was also reading Hermann Hesse. And I'd wait and I must have done it five or six times\u2014where you're taking the train up to New York\u2014and I'd sometimes sit there for three or four hours, and she didn't come.\" But the last time ... \"I was there for maybe an hour and, you know, I'd write a little and you'd have some coffee, maybe some tea, you're reading, and all of a sudden, she walked in. I remember she went up and she sat down and she sat about three tables away and I sat for ... half an hour, and then she got up and walked out. And I remember even at one point thinking should I get up and follow her and say, 'Hey, excuse me, did you drop this?' But I never did.\" Coward.\"I know.\"It was perhaps the last time Mr. Zagaris didn't open his mouth. The reason Mr. Zagaris' work stands apart from that of other photographers of his time and genre is his ability to become whatever he was shooting and be accepted by his subjects. That made him more than the documenter of a story\u2014he partied like a rock left Etta James performs at the Boarding House in San Francisco in July 1985. above Pete Townshend tunes up before a Who show at the Oakland Coliseum in October 1976.38 / gw magazine / Summer 2016 gwmagazine.com / 39 amp\u2014shows a quiet moment that no soul in an arena of 60,000 would have ever seen or stopped to think existed. Mr. Zagaris pries for the moments that pass unobserved so he can show everyone else what he sees: rock stars and athletes as mortals. He proposes that we reassess our deifications and makes his argument with mood, atmosphere and the evincing use of natural light. \"He's got great behind-the-scenes shots of me in the dressing room, tuning up and all that sort of stuff,\" says Peter Frampton, who used a Zagaris photo for the Frampton Comes Alive! album cover. \"That was his forte. He loved, of course, great live shots on stage, but he was always in the corner, and because he's so personable and such a likeable person, he becomes part of the band for that night. So you don't mind him being there. ... You forget he's got a camera and that is his secret and that's why he got so many great shots. It is because it wasn't like, 'Oh God, there's a pho - tographer in the room.' It wasn't that at all. Never was. It was like, 'We've got our friend, Mike, here.'\" Mr. Frampton has used Mr. Zagaris' stuff since the early 1970s. Chris Isaak has used it since the early '80s. \"I know a lot of guys who were photogra - phers and hung around the rock scene and all they did is party and chase girls and stuff like that,\" says Mr. Isaak, who's also carried Mr. Zagaris' camera bag. \"And I have to say, Zagaris, for as much as it seems like he's a partier and a wild man and all that stuff, I never saw him really do that. That wasn't his thing. He wasn't, like, trying to pick up girls with his camera. He wasn't trying to party and get high. To me, it seemed like he really enjoyed the ballgame; he really enjoyed the music. He enjoyed the people\u2014that was the number one thing. That shouldn't seem odd but it made him stand out.\" Mr. Zagaris started hanging at rock shows in the late '60s, conning and hustling to go where he wanted. As a teenager, he would drive (or get a ride, before he had his license) the 230 miles from his parents' house in Redding, Calif., to San Francisco and flim - flam his way onto the sidelines of old Kezar Stadium to shoot 49ers games, cozening the cops and posing as a press photographer. Mr. Zagaris sold the ruse with homemade counterfeit credentials, often spray-paint - ed, that he modeled off the discarded press passes he found on the field after a game while he and his younger brother, Bruce Zagaris, BA '69, JD '72, LLM '73, were collecting souvenir chinstraps. The cops didn't check the credentials up close. \"They would have seen that it was the wrong date or the wrong game,\" says Bruce, now a partner and international law attorney at Berliner Corcoran & Rowe in Washington, D.C. \"The ones that were spray-painted\u2014they didn't even have anything on them. They didn't have any print on them. We would have been screwed if they had actually looked at them. But after a while, they kind of just look at the people, and once you're on a couple of times and they see you, they just think you belong. They tend to look at the new people.\" One time when a cop challenged him, Michael Zagaris says, he told the officer that he was doing a book for the NFL\u2014the com - pletely-made-up-but-plausibly-named Sunday Gladiators \u2014and stressed the importance of featuring in the book those who kept safe the field from hooligan raiders. The cops, he says, posed for a group photo and never hassled him again. \"What he's always had is the ability to get access, partly because he's extremely bold,\" Bruce Zagaris says of his brother. \"He will try things that nobody would even think of and succeed.\" At rock shows years later, Mr. Zagaris says, he'd sweet-talk his way backstage or feign legitimacy by telling whoever he needed to convince that he was writing a book about the influence of American blues on British musi - cians. Which he was. Detoured by photog - raphy, he never wrote it. The claim, though, apparently went unchallenged in an era of unbelievable access. \"He said to us that he was going to write a book, and so he said, 'Could I interview you?'\" Mr. Frampton says. \"I hadn't been inter - viewed that much as a member of Humble Pie at that point, so I said, 'Yeah, why not? That's fantastic. Let's do it.' ... I didn't think it was strange at all, to be honest.\" NPR rock 'n' roll historian Ed Ward wrote for CREEM and Rolling Stone during the 1970s while he lived in Marin County, across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. He says scoring freelance assignments was easy then. Editors were amenable to new talent because there weren't so many people vying for bylines. \"Once you had a name, people knew it,\" Mr. Ward says. \"So you could say, 'Hi, I'd like to write about such and such, here's a couple of clips,' and they'd actually pay attention. Also, there were a lot more magazines, so if one turned you down, there were three or four more.\" Some were more stable than others.\"A lot of the rock magazines back then were real fly-by-night,\" says Mr. Ward, the author of History of Rock & Roll Vol. 1 (Flatiron Books, November 2016). \"They'd get going for a while, and then all of sudden, they wouldn't pay people. And then all of a sudden, their phone would be disconnected. That happened a lot.\" Mr. Zagaris, working as an up-and-coming freelancer while paying his bills by teach - ing middle school in East Palo Alto, would approach the artists backstage and ambush them in the lobbies of their hotels. He says it was Eric Clapton, whom he met backstage in 1968 or '69, who encouraged him to pursue photography as a career one night while hanging out in a San Francisco hotel room. After a few years, Mr. Zagaris became a known entity, getting close to Winterland owner Bill Graham, the impresario and promoter who is widely considered to have invented the modern rock show. Never shy and inspired by the musi - cians he spent so much time around, Mr. Zagaris hustled well. To make it on the West Coast leg of the now-infamous 1972 Roll - ing Stones tour\u2014it was in support of Exile On Main St. \u2014he says he lied about being a Vogue photographer, impersonating Leo Lerman, the magazine's legendary editor, in a phone call to the Stones' lead flack. Scamming, Mr. Zagaris says, was the industry standard and everyone got ripped off. One famous band, he says, didn't like to pay anyone\u2014caterer, limo driver, photogra - pher\u2014because they believed the experience of working for them was more valuable than money. \"These people, they're all predatory,\" Mr. Zagaris says. \"So I don't feel bad about any of this. I was hustling to get on to do something. I loved the way they were hustling to establish themselves and their career.\" Mr. Isaak, who met Mr. Zagaris shortly after moving to San Francisco from Stockton, Calif., in the late 1970s, says he did similar things while trying to establish himself, years before he broke out with the song \"Wicked Game\" in 1989. \"I used to go into shows when I was broke,\" says Mr. Isaak, who babysat Mr. Zagaris' son, Ari, BA '00. \"And I'd walk in dressed to the nines in my stage clothes, with my guitar in a case, and I'd just walk in and people would just go, 'Well, he's obviously a musician. He's got his hair all combed, he's wearing a suit and he's got a guitar in a case,' and I'd stand for the whole damn show with my guitar and listen to the music 'cause I didn't have five bucks. I think if you love it, you find a way in.\" Mr. Zagaris used amiable guile and the Nikon F. By strict definition, Mr. Zagaris is not a rock star. He hasn't mastered any com - bination of three chords and, at this point, probably couldn't pull off a Freddie Mercury unitard, but being a rock star isn't just about left above Chris Isaak hangs out in New York City in July 1985. left below Blondie poses during a shoot at the Conservatory of Flowers in San Francisco in April 1977. 40 / gw magazine / Summer 2016repurposed blues riffs, 4-4 time and a Bedaz - zled onesie. It's about attitude and aura and maybe a camera, and that, with proper inspi - ration, is sometimes all you need. IDOLWILD Michael Zagaris, again in the black leather jacket and matching baseball cap, is snug into the couch of his roomy three-bedroom, two-bath Haight-Ashbury apartment. The rent is about half of what it should be, which is the reason Mr. Zagaris, admittedly not a busi - nessman, can afford to live there. He won't leave the Haight until he's out of last resorts. Photographing rock and roll, he says, isn't a road to a Tesla, beachfront real estate and a golden toilet seat. On tour with The Who in 1973, Mr. Zagaris says, he subsisted mostly by scavenging room service trays in hotels while his net worth hovered around $47. The photo archive that fills two rooms in his apartment might be worth... something. Too bad it's a buyer's market. Steady employment by the 49ers and later the A's bankrolled Mr. Zagaris' rock habit, and it still bankrolls him today, years after he's retired to his equivalent of a rusticating life that's paid for month-to-month. Across a coffee table and among ceiling-high book - shelves in an open-concept living room is the flatscreen TV. CNN is going hot and the pun - ditry is pits deep in the Republican primary. Mr. Zagaris, noticing, stops a soliloquy on capitalism, Vietnam and how Allen Dulles, LLB '26, killed JFK to charge punk-rock seething into a not-unrelated tangent about the state of U.S. politics. \"The real gods in this country? It's celebrities, and that's as empty as it gets,\" Mr. Zagaris says. \"That's why we're where we're at and we're kind of lost as a nation, and these are our choices? And nothing against Bernie [Sanders], but all the others, I'm think - ing for the supposed most powerful country in the world... I mean, talk about the clown car. This is actually an affront to the clown car.\" And the buyer's market? That stinks, he says, but it's not about that. \"I think any artist, whether you're a writer or you're a painter or you're a filmmaker or you're a dancer, you're trying to express yourself in the culture,\" Mr. Zagaris says. \"And that becomes paramount to you rather than just, 'I have a job to make money.' I'm not putting anybody down that does that. I mean, most of the world has to do it. I'm not saying that's wrong\u2014it would be wrong for me, and you try to follow your calling.\" Classic Z-Man.The apartment he shares with his longtime girlfriend, model Kristin Sundbom, is as much a shrine to his idols as it is a residence. Prints of his photos are on the walls\u2014Patti Smith in one bathroom, Rick James and Lou Reed in another, Jimmy Page outside the kitch - en\u2014and rock star action figures decorate the bookshelves, which house a rather large personal library, of which Chris Isaak read liberally during his early San Francisco days. Mr. Zagaris has always been drawn to rebels, iconoclasts and those keen to fight the misfeasance of our overlords. First, these were movie stars like Marlon Brando and James Dean and musicians like Chuck Berry, whom Mr. Zagaris, attending his first concert, saw live at the Stockton Civic Auditorium in 1956. It was anyone dynamic, flamboyant and cool\u2014anyone with energy and magic. That later included political figures, specifically John F. Kennedy, and Mr. Zagaris shifted the focus of his idol worship to those in tradition - al channels. In college, Mr. Zagaris worked as a \"glori - fied page\" for California Sen. Pierre Salinger, for whom Mr. Zagaris' father, a progressive Democrat and the son of Greek immigrants, had done fundraising in Northern Califor - nia. By 1965, with the help of Mr. Salinger, Mr. Zagaris got a job on Robert Kennedy's staff, answering mail and clipping newspaper articles, and once, Mr. Zagaris says, loaning the then-New York senator a few dollars for a cab ride. \"Bobby never had any money,\" Mr. Zagaris says. By February 1968, Mr. Zagaris was travel - ing with Mr. Kennedy as part of the senator's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's how Mr. Zagaris ended up in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968. It was crowded and equatorially hot. He thought someone set off firecrackers. \"He's been shaped by a lot of different things,\" says Ari Zagaris, Mr. Zagaris' 39-year-old son, an actor and former minor league pitcher who had a small role in Mon - eyball . \"Before he was at GW... he was a much different person. He wanted to be an NFL football player, he wanted to be a senator and then he wanted to be president. Then he was probably a couple hundred feet behind Bobby when he [got shot], and that blew his mind.\" On June 6, Mr. Zagaris flew to San Fran - cisco from Los Angeles. While he was driving home to San Jose, he heard on the radio that Bobby Kennedy had died. \"I had to pull over,\" Mr. Zagaris says,\" and I started crying.\" That was it, the moment he abandoned traditional leaders and sought his idols else - where. Frustrated and furious at America's habit of murdering its leaders\u2014Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated that April, preceded by Malcolm X in '65 and JFK in '63\u2014he ran to the counterculture. \"All this stuff I had been taught by par - ents,\" Mr. Zagaris says, \"by the Jesuits, all this well-meaning stuff\u2014basically 'be good, do the right thing, study hard to get good grades, make your parents and family and community proud, marry a beautiful girl, have a nice house and a big car and be a suc - cess...' When you kill the ideals of your child - hood, you're in deep, deep trouble.\" He flunked out of law school at Santa Clara University in nuclear fashion, screeding through several Bluebooks during a contracts final with aggressively impolite language on how and why America was totally hosed. A month later, he was classified 1A by the draft board. (A childhood illness, he says, later got that changed to 1Y, and he never went to Vietnam.) Finally, Mr. Zagaris, disillusioned, moved to San Francisco. THE CITY HE MOURNS AND LOVES Down a hill from Chris Isaak's house on a ridge and spread before a Golden Gate Bridge vista is a girl dancing on the beach. She's been to school for dancing and so have her friends, who have their smartphones aimed dead red at her while she makes art from motion. It's late afternoon, the sky is one big lens flare and an intrigued Michael Zagaris stops to ask her questions. They agree that it's hard to be an artist in San Francisco right now. All parties, of course, blame the techies\u2014those new Visig - oths, the invaders who stand heretical to all that is good and holy here\u2014for pushing rent for a studio to $3,000 a month and driving out bohemia at the blunted tip of a tablet stylus. And yet, Mr. Zagaris and the beach danc - ers have hope. \"San Francisco, like New Orleans or like Paris or Amsterdam, has its own energy,\" Mr. Zagaris says. \"You might hear about it, but when you get there, you can sense it. You can feel it.\" To Mr. Zagaris, San Francisco sits on ley lines that are out of use and decommissioned everywhere but a few cities. It's a nexus, a point of energy convergence\u2014although the reason why has less to do with mysticism and more to do with the outlaws, outcasts and misfits who settled the city, starting with the gold rush in the 1840s. \"There was this feeling that you couldn't go any further,\" says David Talbot, who authored a history of San Francisco called Season of the Witch and has lived in the city since 1981. \"A gwmagazine.com / 41lot of people who went for the gold rush were there because they were losers, they were on the run from the law and this was their last chance to strike it rich, and [the city] still has that sensibility, certainly with the tech revo - lution. People have made that comparison\u2014that there are still people coming out west to San Francisco and Silicon Valley to try to get their payday.\" Traditionalists have periodically chal - lenged San Francisco's entrenched libertine attitudes but they've won little or nothing, and today, Mr. Talbot says, the city remains an \"open and tolerant society.\" It's a fact that helps the city assimilate the waves of outsiders who inevitably immigrate here. San Francisco is still working, albeit with a certain hostility, to absorb the techies.In the early part of the 20th century, Catholic immigrants fought the anything- goes-as-long-as-you-don't-set-anything-on-fire mentality. Later, they fought the arrivals of the Beats, hippies and gays. But even those Catho - lics and other traditionalists, Mr. Talbot says, were politically progressive, which made com - promise easier and victory possible for all the weird people. Mr. Talbot says San Francisco is, in many ways, the \"first liberated city,\" and in that is the allure that drew Mr. Zagaris, one among those weird, in 1973 and created and sustained an arts-and-culture singularity that went supermassive after the summer of '67. Peter Frampton chose to record Frampton Comes Alive! there, at the Winterland Ball - room, because of San Francisco's \"open and uninhibited\" audience. Chris Isaak just says that San Francisco is the place you go to \"do your art.\" L.A., that's for business. All of it\u2014the history, the politics, the people\u2014coalesced to create a place like no other, one Mr. Zagaris\u2014Z-Man\u2014rages to protect and maintain. He is a phantom from an elapsed epoch, too limber to be a fossil and too vital to fade away. Despite ungodly prices and those despised interlopers, he stays in the Haight, where he won't change and he contin - ues to fight those who aren't keeping it hip for the rest of us. It's obvious to Z-Man that he isn't winning, but this isn't about winning. It's about the fight. \"Unlike a lot of people who stayed for a while, lost their hair, got a job and got it together,\" Ari Zagaris says, \"he continued to ... hold the torch and let his flag fly and still live in the Haight and hasn't written a check since 1968, so there's no paper trail. \"He's always fought and he continues to fight, and I think as long as he keeps his sword up\u2014that keeps him young and that keeps him who he is. A lot of other people, as they get older, I think they get more conservative and they start to pull back a little, and I think he's very reticent about letting that happen to him. ...

There are planners and servers and engineers who will be pulling off each party's pageant this summer. Orbiting all the fuss is the band of reporters and photographers and camera operators who document the circuitous march that, for someone, will end at the White House.

Steve Israel (D-NY), BA '81, who has attended every Democratic National Convention since 1996 [My first convention] reminded me of the first time I walked into Shea Stadium for a real live baseball game. I was 4 years old and I was sort of struck by how bright the lights were, how noisy the crowd was and how energizing the entire scene was. When I walked onto the floor of my first convention, I had a flashback to Shea Stadium. Luckily, we had a better outcome coming out of the convention than the Mets did for their early history. ... I spoke at the convention [in 2012] as chair of the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]. ... My assumption was that I'd walk into a packed hall with tens of thousands of people sitting at the edge of their seats ready to devour every word, and beyond that, that there'd be a national primetime audience glued to their seats waiting to hear what Chairman Israel had to say. First, I may have been chairman of the DCCC, but they still slotted me into a speaking opportunity that probably vied with the Home Shopping Network for the most viewers. Second, given the opportunity of hearing the chairman of the DCCC speak or going souvenir shopping, 80 percent of the delegates chose souvenir shopping. So it was sort of like addressing the House of Representatives\u2014lots of empty seats. Still, it was an amazing experience. ... My favorite moment of all the conventions I went to was Bill Clinton's speech in 2012, when he actually went off teleprompter and engaged in one of the most dramatic WHAT IT' S LIKE ... to moderate a presidential debate CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, BA '93, who has served as a questioner for six primary debates in this election cycle [Debate prep] is similar to cramming for a final, it is very intense. [You're] sitting in a room with some of the smartest and most creative people preparing for anything. We have tremendous research teams, and they put together information about the many topics that we're thinking of focusing on. After we settle for the most part on the topics, we focus in on the wording of the questions and the order, and you get down to the nitty gritty, and that kind of preparation is important to ensure you're as ready as possible. The most important part of the debate prep for us were the mock debates. We would sit there for hours and go through things over and over again. We have people playing the roles of the candidates, and that helps more than you would think. We do it to figure out whether a question isn't working, or we need to sharpen this or we need to move this around. That particular preparation was helpful at the Democratic presidential primary debate in Brooklyn, N.Y. It is our job to ask tough questions that make the candidates accountable. I felt like we equally stayed on both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to ensure they answered our questions comprehensively. This election has been unique, and every day has proven to be more exciting. This is my seventh presidential election cycle at CNN, and I have never seen anything quite like this. It is an honor to serve as a debate questioner, and it is something I take very seriously. I always feel a sense of responsibility and pressure to get the answers for our CNN viewers.[It] reminded me of the first time I walked into Shea Stadium. - reP . steve israel and passionate conversations about the Affordable Care Act that I had ever heard.

I could not find an Uber ... so I called a cab company, and they told me it would be an hour. Then, a cab pulled over and asked if I was David. I said yes and got in the cab. \"I feel bad for David,\" he says, \"but I needed to get there.\" Mr. Miller made the interview and went on to serve as communications director from February 2015 until Mr. Bush dropped out of the race after the South Carolina primary. Over the course of the year, Mr. Miller oversaw the campaign's media outreach, managed the campaign's speechwriters and aided Mr. Bush with speech prep as well as traveling the country with the candidate. \"It's all-consuming, and that's why you do it,\" says Mr. Miller, who earlier helped co-found America Rising, a top GOP opposition research firm. Since Mr. Bush dropped out, Mr. Miller has been a vocal member of the \"Never Trump\" campaign and says he's taking time to assess his next step. \"As a professional doing campaigns, you always get attached to candidates,\" he says. \"But I don't know that I've ever felt as emotionally invested in a campaign\u2014both for Jeb and against Trump\u2014as I have before now.

Her favorite photo from her time in the Hawkeye State came in the final days before the caucus, at a rally for Hillary Clinton in Iowa City, where Ms. Clinton had just hosted an event with singer Demi Lovato. The candidate \"was working the ropeline and was just taking so many selfies, and it was really interesting because, instead of signing autographs, she would just take selfies,\" Ms. Demczuk says. \"I've never seen someone take so many selfies with people.\" From a terrace above she \"had a bird's-eye view of her, and just seeing her with this massive amount of people trying to get into the photo, it was a very funny scene.\" Capturing moments like that, some of which have appeared on the front page of The Times, is one of the best parts of the job, she says. \"When you see someone reading The Times and your photo is there on the front page, it's such a great feeling,\" Ms. Demczuk says. \"It's also a very different feeling than having your photo on the homepage.

As a senior adviser to Marco Rubio's rapid response operation, Mr. Pounder had to be aware of what his candidate's 16 GOP primary opponents were saying on the trail\u2014and be ready to act on comments that could either damage or boost Mr. Rubio's campaign. \"I was constantly watching TV and social media,\" says Mr. Pounder, who joined the campaign in November 2015 and stayed until the candidate dropped out of the race in March. \"This cycle, there was a real proliferation of the amount of town halls, on-air prime-time interviews and so forth, so you always had to be on. And for all the debates, you could easily leave the office at 1 a.m. and be back at the office by 7:15.\" Since Mr. Rubio exited the race, Mr. Pounder went back to his job as president of America Rising, the Republican opposition research firm founded by fellow alumni Tim Miller, BA '04, and Matt Rhoades, MA '99, who was the campaign manager for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid and the communications director for his 2008 campaign.

It was for the general election, for [Walter] Mondale and [Geraldine] Ferraro. I had been trying desperately to get a political job and wasn't having any success, and a friend of mine called me and said, 'Do you want to go out to Iowa and be a press secretary?' I had never even been inside a campaign office, but I was like, 'Sure!' I kind of knew what a press secretary was. ... So I go to the campaign office, and I'm so nervous because I'm thinking, 'How long before these people realize I don't know what the heck I'm doing?' But they were very nice. Most were from Iowa or Minnesota, and they took me to lunch so I could meet the other senior people. It was the first time in my life I saw adults drink milk. I worked for a wonderful team and I just learned.The next cycle, I got calls from the campaigns about being the Iowa press secretary during the caucus, which was a much bigger deal. I wasn't sure who I wanted to work for, but I talked to someone and, knowing my politics, he said, 'You should go work for the most progressive candidate who has funding.' So that's what I did. And I went to work for Gary Hart\u2014from May 1 to May 7 in 1987, because he dropped out of the race. I had quit my job, I had sublet my apartment and my trunk hadn't even arrived. (In those days, I shipped a trunk of stuff.) I didn't know what I was going to do. It's like a grieving process you go through, because everything you expected abruptly ends ... I was planning to be in Iowa for 18 months. As a staffer, you start talking to the other campaigns, and a lot of us decided to go to the [Michael] Dukakis campaign. From 1984 to 2008, I had worked in big and small ways in every presidential campaign, but there was nothing like that first Iowa caucus. You learn so much about politics. And in those days before cell phones, you had to make decisions yourself; you didn't have to check in with six or seven people. If you screwed it up, you owned it.

David Holt, Marco Rubio's presidential campaign represented the future of the Republican Party. \"He speaks to my generation probably more than anyone else that was in the field,\" says Mr. Holt, who was elected in 2010. Seeking to help Mr. Rubio win the primary in the Sooner State, Mr. Holt signed on as the candidate's Oklahoma campaign chair, an unpaid and often ceremonial title that presidential candidates dole out to elected officials across the country. But Mr. Holt viewed the position as more than an endorsement, spending his time helping to organize and mobilize supporters of Mr. Rubio in his state. \"I spent my time gathering endorsements, trying to find excuses to get his name out there as part of the story at a state level,\" Mr. Holt says\u2014efforts that ranged from lobbying other state legislators to buying campaign signs out of his own pocket to give to supporters. He saw his role akin to that of a state director in a state where Mr. Rubio had devoted few resources. With his candidate now out of the running, Mr. Holt finds himself on unfamiliar turf. \"I still miss him in the race today,\" he says. \"I'm very disappointed and opposed to the person that the party has nominated, which is a first for me.\" PROFILE ERIN BIGGS, BA '03, Colorado delegate to the democratic national convention If you're friends with Erin Biggs, you've likely heard a fundraising appeal or two for her trip to Philadelphia in July, where, as a delegate, she was slated to cast a vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders on the floor of the Democratic National Convention. The party doesn't pay for delegates' travel or lodging, so Ms. Biggs launched a fundraising campaign for her trip\u2014hosting yard sales, selling baked goods and soliciting contributions via an online fundraising site\u2014to raise the $5,000 she'd need. All this, of course, is after she successfully campaigned for the spot\u2014a sort of micro election within the big one. She sent campaign literature to prospective voters, created a Facebook page to lobby for her bid and spoke with hundreds of people who showed up to her congressional district convention, where she ultimately was elected among four delegates from her district for Mr. Sanders. \"In the beginning, I was curious about how someone becomes a delegate.

And if you're one of the 4,800 delegates or alternates, 15,000 members of the media or among the thousands of others who were planning to attend an event at the convention, she's got you covered. As the event manager for the RNC, Ms. Packer was overseeing all five convention complex venues\u2014including Quicken Loans Arena, home of the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2014that the GOP rented for their big nominating event. In the run up to the show, she was busy working with the convention's 12 caterers and six florists to transform the basketball arena and conference spaces into meeting rooms and event locales for the numerous groups hosting events over the four-day convention. She is one of a handful of GW alumni working on the convention, including Ninio Fetalvo, BA '14, who works in media affairs for the convention and is the Republican National Committee's press secretary for Asian-Pacific American engagement; Audrey Scagnelli, BA '13, the convention's national press secretary; and Zach Quinn, BA '13, the deputy director of official proceedings.

And she relies on the team Rob Russo leads to keep her informed on everything from the logistics of her travel to the issues faced by the people she'll be meeting at each stop on the trail. \"It's a lot like publishing a newspaper that has a circulation of one,\" Mr. Russo says of the briefing book he helps compile, which takes hours of work by multiple people to pull together. Aside from ensuring the former secretary of state is well-briefed, Mr. Russo is also in charge of the vast amount of her correspondence\u2014from replying to letters and emails from the electorate to keeping in touch with the candidate's friends, elected officials and donors. Handling all that (mail and email messages stream in at a pace of 5,000-10,000 daily, he says), as well as keeping up with the 24-hour news cycle, makes for a grueling schedule for Mr. Russo and his team; one member of the group is always awake to ensure nothing is missed that may need to be in the next day's briefing. But when the schedule gets tough, Mr. Russo says the letters from supporters can be a boost. \"If we're ever having a day on our team when we're tired or we're exhausted or don't want to keep going or are overwhelmed,\" he says, \"it's humbling to take the time to read some of the stories that remind you why we're doing this.\" PROFILE ALEX HORNBROOK, BA '07 director of scheduling and advance for hillary clinton As the head of the team that scouts and schedules the dozens of campaign rallies and events Hillary Clinton holds each month, Mr. Hornbrook often needs to find the perfect venue at nearly a moment's notice. And it's trickier than just walking into any diner or auditorium. For starters, every space needs a green light from the Secret Service, which will need to secure the area; the location needs to be able to hold the number of supporters expected to show up, without too much slack or squeeze; and, to avoid a spectacle, event spaces should have owners that share the values of the campaign. All of that vetting must be completed in a matter of days, or sometimes hours, in a fast-paced campaign that's constantly reacting to the world around it. \"We lean a lot on our teams in the states, who are amazing and really integrate into the communities they are working in, so they usually have a lot of great recommendations,\" Mr. Hornbrook says. For Mr. Hornbrook, who is on his second tour of duty with the candidate, a boon of the job is how all this orchestration bridges far-flung departments, like communications and the budget office. \"We really get exposed to every corner of the campaign,\" he says.

Tasked with making the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia camera-ready for the Democratic National Convention in July, Ms. Chiou worked with Democratic operatives and television producers to ensure a cascade of details fell into place for the made-for-TV event. That meant everything from the carpet being the proper hue of blue to maintaining enough bandwidth for thousands of reporters to broadcast and file and tweet news from the convention. \"We're building the infrastructure from where we will change history,\" Ms. Chiou said ahead of the event. In part, that's meant pulling off an extravaganza alongside some of the best in politics and media. \"There aren't many jobs where you get to work with an executive producer who does the Oscars and Super Bowl halftime shows, or work with people who have been staffing presidential candidates for decades,\" Ms. Chiou says. \"It's a really rich environment.\"to continue as a political event planner after the show is over. \"Being an event manager for the convention has been amazing,\" she says. \"I couldn't have dreamt up a better first job after college.\" PACKER, CHIOU, RUSSO, HORNBROOK: COURTESY OF SUBJECTS gwmagazine.com / 49 WHAT IT' S LIKE ... to cover Donald Trump CNN Political Reporter Jeremy Diamond, BA '14 I've been covering Donald Trump since before he actually announced his candidacy, [and] it's gone from covering a candidate who we didn't expect to go very far to covering a candidate leading in the polls, to covering the presumptive nominee for president. So it's been a pretty wild ride. ... There are typically thousands of people at all of these rallies, and it's been that way from the beginning. A lot of the power players in Washington took months to realize that the Trump phenomenon was a real thing. But I've seen that from the beginning\u2014a lot of really passionate people attending his rallies from the moment he launched his campaign in June of 2015. ... When Jeb Bush started getting a couple hundred people at his events, it was like, 'Oh my goodness, Jeb Bush is getting large crowds.' But when Trump was getting 200 people, we were like, 'What's going on?' I haven't been covering a traditional campaign, and that's been apparent from the beginning. One of the things that I was glad to be in a position to witness and to film was [at a campaign event] in the fall of 2015, where a Black Lives Matter protester got punched, kicked and dragged by Trump supporters. ... That was the only video of that incident, which we've seen replicated in a lot of ways. ... That's part of my job, and I take it pretty seriously, to make sure that I'm able to witness when violence does boil over. People are always asking me, 'Is Donald Trump the same when you see him in private settings?' Certainly you have the same guy in interviews, as far as how he talks about the issues he's passionate about and the brashness with which he lays out his policy ideas. But there's also a certain charm, in the sense that he tries to make you feel like you're important, and he has this quality of being able to be personable when he needs to and when he wants to. PROFILE SALLY BRADSHAW, BA '87 senior adviser to jeb bush Sally Bradshaw was the architect of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's presidential campaign team. As senior adviser, she was tasked with helping launch Mr. Bush's campaign, building his staff roster from the bottom up and guiding those staffers on everything from debate prep to policy rollouts. \"I was blessed to have a view of every aspect of the campaign,\" Ms. Bradshaw (n\u00e9e Salmon) says. Described by The New York Times as Mr. Bush's \"closest adviser,\" Ms. Bradshaw often was a sounding board for Mr. Bush, a position she rose to from a long career with the Bush family that began in 1988. She was working for the presidential campaign of George H.W. Bush, and it was then that she met his son Jeb and sparked an alliance that has lasted more than two decades, including serving as Jeb Bush's chief of staff during his tenure as governor of Florida. \"I really believed that he would make a great president,\" she says of Jeb Bush, \"and, for me, when he made the decision to run, there was no question whether or not I would commit to be a part of the team.\" Although she's disappointed that Mr. Bush didn't win the GOP nomination, Ms. Bradshaw says she is proud of the campaign he ran. \"What you see is what you get with Jeb,\" she says. \"He is very committed to public service and has always cared about problem- solving.\" BRADSHAW: COURTESY OF SALLY BRADSHAW / DIAMOND: COURTESY CNN / TRUMP: DOMINIC N.

IN A BASEMENT BELOW A BASEMENT, inside a room with its own electromagnetic field, 6-inch-thick steel walls and a concrete floor that runs 3 feet deep, electrons are blasting nerve cells from a mouse. Cross-sectional slices measuring 10 bil - lionths of a meter slowly populate a moni - tor beside the microscope. \"Pretty much what you do is you sit down and you build Google Maps,\" says Anastas Popratiloff, the director of the GW Nanofabrication and Imaging COURTESY MICHAEL BUKRINSKYCenter, as he putters with the incoming data. And it's an apt analogy. The new imaging lab deals in richly detailed molecular landscapes, at times on the level of individual atoms. A flick of the controls might zoom you inside, say, a tuft of neurons, for a 360-degree gander. There are microscopes that build 3-D maps of the concentrations of various atoms in a sample, and those that analyze individual pixels across every wavelength of light, giving materials\u2014from paint pigments to body tissues\u2014an identifiable signature. They're the kinds of machines that bore into the infinitesimal and turn out gigabytes by the dozen. The microscope that's pummeling mouse nerve cells with electrons on Friday afternoon will likely produce, by Monday morning, some 35 gigabytes of data. (The 2015 Encyclopaedia Britannica, images and all, can be had for 5 gigabytes.) At the time, in March, the facility in Science and Engineering Hall had been online about only a month and, for the moment, it's quiet. White noise presses down on the space. Still, the microscopes are cranking out images as quickly as researchers can be trained on them. As one group of seven leaves an afternoon training, Dr. Popratiloff says another seven will be following soon behind. The center occupies a brightly lit and white-walled 4,000-square-foot space beside a nanofabrication suite with an even larger footprint. Both were built into bedrock to dampen vibrations from subway trains, which roll through the station a block away. gwmagazine.com / 53In some rooms, specially constructed shielding protects experiments from the electromagnetic fields produced by the passing trains. \"The space is unique,\" Dr. Popratiloff says. \"There's nothing like it, probably, at another private institution on the East Coast.\" The center's five new microscopes\u2014 obtained through partnerships with manufacturers including FEI, Leica and Raith\u2014offer researchers a leap in resolution, sensitivity and speed. They augment an older fleet of three high-powered microscopes in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The new tools mean that \"with the same effort, [researchers] can gather 10 times more data, and much-better-quality data,\" Dr. Popratiloff says. The bump in microscopes also means simply more machine hours. And several of the microscopes can be programmed to run autonomously day and night. (\"If you buy a $2.5 million thing, it has to work nonstop,\" Dr. Popratiloff says.) He's hoping the lab's capacity and location\u2014close to federal and international agencies and other institutions\u2014also will draw outside users. The new suite is \"going to make a huge difference in productivity\u2014night-and-day difference,\" says Michael Wagner, a GW materials scientist and chemistry professor, who runs one of the dozens of GW labs that have cued up for training on the electron microscopes alone. Until recently, he had to travel to the University of Maryland to do this kind of work. \"It's hard to be a carpenter if you don't have a hammer,\" he says. Closing the door on a room where the vending-machine-sized white cube of a transmission electron microscope sits off to AXONS: COURTESY MARY ANN STEPP / BISMUTH TELLURIDE: AHMED EL DESOUKY / SPERM: COURTESY MELISSA PERRYthe side, Dr. Popratiloff walks down the hall, opens another door and flicks on the light. \"Now,\" he says, \"the important thing is discovery, right?\" He awakens one of two 50-odd-inch Sony HD monitors in the image analysis room and pulls up a portrait of a nerve cell. Blown up on the screen, deep microscopy seems to close the gap between the natural world's smallest and its grandest layers; it is one frontier. The storm-cloud-gray surface of the nerve cell is a lunar-like expanse, scarred and pocked with craters. In another image, vibrantly hued HIV cells, with flecks of cholesterol on their surfaces, aren't so unlike ethereal nebulae wafting by the Hubble's lens. Seeing so intensely at such a tiny scale requires a new way of asking questions, a \"new dimension\" in thought, Dr. Popratiloff says. \"You could spend easily 15 years in your career and you don't know what's going on,\" he says. \"And then one single image shows you what the outcome is. It's amazing.\" For more on the GW Nanofabrication and Imaging Center, visit nic.gwu.edu opposite Spurred by HIV infection, immune cells have fused into a single, giant cell in this image from microbiologist Michael Bukrinsky's lab. above left Long, conductive arms\u2014or axons\u2014of nerve cells branch and swirl across a mouse cornea.

She would dress in all her finery and then ready her prayer plate (this is a beautiful plate filled with flowers, special desserts, a small terra cotta lamp and other things used during the prayers). We would all head over to a friend's home for the prayers. There, all the married women in their gold and diamonds would sing prayers and exchange plates. All the little girls, like me, would look on in reverence and respect. To my childhood eyes, the women resem - bled movie stars. How romantic it was that they prayed for their husbands in this way. Once the prayer was over, we would head home for the final ritual. First, my father would drive around, for hours sometimes, trying to find a perfect sighting of the moon so that my mother could eat again. He'd smile at my mother and tell her that he was so grateful to her and happy that she could break her fast soon. My mother would observe the (almost always hidden) moon through a sieve and then touch my father's feet in respect. He would then feed her freshly squeezed orange juice to break her fast. And in his own BY MONICA BHIDE, MS '93 IMAGES BY LOGAN WERLINGER It was the intention that counted. Karva Chauth, an Indian fasting custom that takes place in October or November, has always fascinated me. Each year as I was growing up, I would wait for it so that I could watch my mother perform all its rituals. As a child, I would hide behind the door and observe her as she got ready for the occa - sion. Each year on Karva Chauth, she would get up early. I could hear her and my father cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Around 4:30 in the morning, she would eat puri (fried bread) and aloo (potatoes) and drink a cup of tea. While my father went off to work, my mother began her fast. The fast would last all day and required complete abstinence from eating or drinking. In the Hindu religion, this was a day for her to pray for her husband's long life. I loved the evenings, when it was time for personal tradition, he would always have a gift for her as a thank you. Mom would smile and open the box, her eyes twinkling, and Dad would hold her. Afterward, we would all sit down to dinner. Ah, true love, I thought.As I grew older, I began to notice the cus - tom's prevalence in north Indian movies. I dreamed of the day I would be able to practice this with my husband. It seemed to be one of those things that would complete my transi - tion to true womanhood. I began planning weeks in advance. Since both my in-laws and parents lived in a differ - ent country, I knew there would be no one to help me decipher the customs here in the U.S. I was determined not to let that be an imped - iment to my perfect day, though. I researched as much as I could and called my mother many times to ensure that I had all the things that I needed. The night before the big day, I prepared the puri dough. It was ready to be rolled out and fried the next morning. Ghee (clarified butter) scented with cumin became my base for making the aloo . Finally the morning arrived. I awoke at 4 a.m. Before my husband could say good morning, all four burners were going on the stove. Tea was simmering on one, aloo on the other, hot fried puris on another and warm kheer (rice pudding) on the last one. I sat down at 4:30 and ate my meal with great pride. I was sure I was entering some secret of womanhood that had long eluded me. My husband merely smiled as he drank his tea. Off to work he went.I had taken the day off work, as I had heard I was supposed to do. In the morning, I got my 56 / gw magazine / Summer 2016 KARVA CHAUTH WAS ABOUT WANTING TO FEEL THAT LOVING BOND THAT I HAD SEEN BETWEEN MY P ARENTS. IT WAS ABOUT BELONGING TO THAT GORGEOUS GROUP OF INDIAN WOMEN WHO COULD DO NO WRONG IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE. hair and nails done. The afternoon was spent meticulously applying henna to my hands and feet. As I waited for the henna to dry, I remembered the days my mother would do the same. Around 5 p.m., I decided to get \"properly\" dressed. I had researched and found that on festive days women should wear solah singar, or 16 adornments, on their body, and I now had all 16 of them. I wore my wedding lehnga (gown) to mark the occasion. Since we were new to the area, I did not know other Indian families nearby and so had decided to do the prayer at home. I began with reading Sanskrit scriptures. Then the wait began for the moon. It hid until almost 9. Finally, I caught sight of it. I ran inside and got my prayer plate along with the sieve and orange juice. It was time. I looked at the wondrous moon through the sieve, dipped my hand in the glass of water on the plate, just as my mother had, and sprin - kled the water at the moon. I closed my eyes in prayer and then bowed to my husband in a scene reminiscent of an Indian movie. Then, as if to mark a milestone, I took a sip of the orange juice. Ah, I thought, this is what a true married woman feels like. I had done it. I had fasted on this very auspicious day to pray for my husband's long life. I was truly a devoted wife at age 24. Just then, as if on cue, the phone rang. My husband answered. As he talked, his expres - sions changed from a smile to giggles and then to laughter. \"It's your mother,\" he said turning to me. \"She wants to know if you are all set for the Karva Chauth fast tomorrow.\" I cried. Having prayed for his long life on the wrong day, would I cause my husband's early demise? I calmed myself down, eventually, but kept a special eye on my husband for months. The following year, I rolled the bread, made the potatoes. I laid out my clothes for the night. But then a strange sense came to me of the old failure, and I suddenly felt unworthy\u2014 not good enough to defeat the god of death. I cried again. It's a simple thing to not eat for a day, but I was carrying with it the burden of gwmagazine.com / 57 58 / gw magazine / Summer 2016 gwmagazine.com / 59tradition and the past, and I felt myself crum - bling under my own expectations. I had failed at it once, and the magic that I had grown up under seemed broken. I didn't go through with the fast and ate solemnly. After that year, on the day of Karva Chauth I could never shake that feeling. How could I even try? Would the fast even mean anything? I was young, an idealist\u2014and an idealist doesn't easily accept failing. When my friends would ask me if I observed Karva Chauth, I'd dodge the question. I avoided calling my mother on the fast day. I skipped invitations to end-of-day prayers, ashamed. But as the years went by, I noticed that my husband did not love me any less. \"I don't understand how not eating for a day makes anyone a better anything, let alone a wife,\" he said one day as I lamented yet again at being unable to bring myself to fast. It was then that I began to wonder about Karva Chauth . I asked friends why they fasted, and leaving aside insistent mothers-in-law and gifts at the end of the day, the answers boiled down to \"It's how it is; why change tra - dition?\" For me, I realized that Karva Chauth was about wanting to feel that loving bond that I had seen between my parents. It was about belonging to that gorgeous group of Indian women who could do no wrong in their IT'S A SIMPLE THING TO NOT EAT FOR A DAY, BUT I WAS CARRYING WITH IT THE BURDEN OF TRADITION AND THE P AST, AND I FELT MYSELF CRUMBLING UNDER MY OWN EXPECT ATIONS. married life. It was about wanting to be the perfect wife. Could I only have those things brought to me by tradition? One day, at the urging of my husband, I finally called my mother in India and con - fessed. The disappointment in her voice was piercing. \"So, you are telling me that you eat on that day?\" she asked quietly. She's called me every year since to remind me when the fast is. But it was after that day that I decided to start a new tradition: Each year, instead of a day of fasting and sacrifice, I turn the day of Karva Chauth into a day of nurturing. I begin preparations early in the morning as well, but instead of preparing for a fast, I prepare for a feast. I cook my husband's favorite dishes, like lamb with green chiles and curry leaves, chile chicken with garlic and peanuts, rice layered with buttered sage and paneer . \"Mom, I am going to lay out the red plates so that everything looks like Christmas,\" my older child says. The house becomes festive, we fill vases with flowers, we dress in our best. But before we eat, we still wait for the moon to show itself. We drive around, as I have seen my father do for so many years, until we find it. I no longer shy away in shame from the Karva Chauth moon; instead, I smile confidently. I look up at it, with hands folded in prayer, and pray that my husband's dreams will always be touched with magic. After the moon sighting, my husband and I hold one another and my kids giggle at the scene. I am not sure they fully understand my tradition, but I know this: They feel what I felt years ago when I saw my mother and father embrace under the Karva Chauth moon.

I feel that people don't appreciate what they have and they're not as happy as they should be, given their circumstances. ... When I think of what things cost here, I go crazy. It just drives me nuts. I just think what I can do with this in Nepal, I can actually save lives for a few dollars.

The narrative of NASA biochemist Iwao \"Vance\" Oyama\u2014who received a master's degree from GW in 1960\u2014and his wider family is captured by his daughter Denise Oyama Miller in a quilt called \"Connecting Threads,\" part of a GW Museum and The Textile Museum exhibition, Stories of Migration: Contemporary Artists Interpret Diaspora (through Sept. 4). The Fremont, Calif.-based artist's work, in the shape of a kimono, tells the Oyama family's diasporic story, beginning with Ms. Miller's grandparents, Zengoro and Chiyo, who met and married in Honolulu after emigrating separately from Yokohama, Japan, in 1907 and 1911, respectively. The two settled in Los Angeles, and after Zengoro's death in his early 50s, Chiyo raised their four children and ran the family's storefront, a \"little mom-and-pop dime store,\" Ms. Oyama says. The family would lose the store, and its home, after the attack on Pearl Harbor and President Franklin Roosevelt's 1942 order to relocate some 117,000 people of Japanese descent into camps. The Oyama family was sent to Arkansas, but Vance went to work in 64 / gw magazine / Summer 2016Alumni news ClAss nOT esalso has authored Friendly Casualties (Glenn Publishing, September 2012), No- Accounts (Apprentice House, February 2014) and The Trion Syndrome (Apprentice House, November 2015), which received a Somerset Awards honorable mention in 2015.

The book provides a modern alternative to the fortress approach to security\u2014one that is more distributed and has no need for passwords or accounts. David Estey, MS '76, will have a 65-year retrospective exhibition of paintings and drawings Aug. 30-Oct. 9 at Studio 53 Fine Art Gallery in Boothbay Harbor, Maine. The show of over 50 pieces will cover his development from youth through Rhode Island School of Design, studying in Italy, illustrating for the Army, a public affairs career with the Internal Revenue Service, studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and current career as an improvisational painter in his native Belfast, Maine.Montana under Quaker sponsorship. Vance's younger brother Jiro, MS '56, PhD '60, was drafted in 1944 and assigned to Japan in the reconstruction period. After stints at the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Jiro spent 28 years at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, where, among other things, he studied the physiological effects of altered gravity. Vance Oyama met Ms. Miller's mother at an Ohio munitions plant, and in 1945, the two married in Kentucky, Ms. Miller says. Further details surrounding the marriage\u2014including whether they had left to escape anti-miscegenation laws or sentiment\u2014are hazy, she and Jiro say. \"It is somewhat painful to recall,\" Jiro says. Vance, who died in 1998, notably was involved in NASA's search for life in lunar soil samples returned by Apollo 11 and, later, as part of the Viking probes that landed on Mars in 1976. Ms. Miller realized that she wanted to pursue her family's story in art after family members seven years ago began gathering regularly to discuss the history. How to capture all that, though, didn't become clear until she saw a call for art from the Studio Art Quilt Associates for the GW museum show. \"It just sort of hit me, like, 'Yes! Our story is about a diaspora.' And we are not the only ones who went through it,\" she says. The more difficult parts of the family history, pertaining to the camps, required some extra research. \"My dad's generation didn't like to talk about that. I think that's pretty universal,\" Ms. Miller says. \"They were so mortified, I think, from being imprisoned and having their rights taken away for no reason that they were ashamed of it.\" The chronological family story\u2014which reads, like Japanese, from right to left along the work\u2014represents a melding of Japanese and American art-making traditions. \"Japan has such a rich textile-fabric history. [And] we have a very strong quilting fiber history in the United States,\" she says. \"I thought there was definitely a way to be able to combine them to find a way to have the feel of Japan but the influence of the United States as well.\" For the kimono, Ms. Miller began with a white cotton fabric that she dyed using a traditional Japanese technique called shibori, then used Thermofax screens to remove some of the dye to reach a specific shade of blue. Hand stitching was done using the Japanese sashiko style, a machine was used for the quilting and photos were applied using Transfer Artist Paper. Ms. Miller, who attended her father's GW graduation as a child, appreciates how things have come full circle with her work on view at GW. \"I thought, 'Oh my god, it's all coming together,'\" she says. And the intense focus on her family has led to another planned work that will center on her mother and her decision to marry a Japanese man in 1945. \"That was a pretty amazing time for an Indiana farm girl to marry a Japanese man. I don't think either family was really thrilled about the event,\" she says. \"I think she would have been a great women's libber, but she was born in the wrong time period.\" gwmagazine.com / 65Alumni news BEN MCKEOWN [ORAL HISTORY] War Stories For nearly two decades, Ken Samuelson, BA '53, has interviewed vets about combat, life and loss // By Matthew Stoss Ken Samuelson, BA ' 53, sits in front of a painting he did of the Memphis Belle , the famous World War II bomber.

Steven Gartner, BBA '87, was appointed SOMEWHERE AROUND her senior year of high school, Sue Meredith set her hair on fire with a gas stove. Trying to light a cigarette in secret\u2014her parents still didn't know she'd discovered smoking at summer camp\u2014she leaned too far over the burner, imperiling hairdo, life and the continued habitability of the family home. Fire out, she made a \"smart-aleck comment\" about how burnt hair smells. Her father, a Navy man and Silver Star recipient, did not care for that comment. \"He said, 'There's nothing funny about that smell,'\" Ms. Meredith says. \"And of course I realized his destroyer helped save men on a destroyer that took a kamikaze.\" Her father, Duncan P. Dixon Jr., earned a Bronze Star for valor and men saved as the commanding officer of the destroyer USS Richard P. Leary on April 6, 1945. Mr. Dixon kept his ship alongside a damaged destroyer near Okinawa, fighting fires, darkness, the enemy and high seas to rescue and take aboard wounded. He also saved that destroyer. Mr. Dixon, stationed at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, would finish his 30-year Navy career with two Bronze Stars and a Legion of Merit to go with that Silver Star. So forgive Ms. Meredith her slip. Her hair had been on fire, and she just didn't know. \"That,\" she says, \"was the closest thing to ever hearing a story from him.\" Capt. Duncan Dixon was a private man, serious and austere, but certainly not un- warm. Ms. Meredith remembers him as calm and loving and so handsome in his uniform. Adored by his two girls, Sue and her younger sister, Maggie Blum, they still call him \"Daddy,\" even though they're in their 70s and he died in 1997. Combat veterans rarely talk about war. It's more common that they don't at all, and if they do, it's to men who, too, have seen war or to psychiatrists for \"narrative medicine\" if the memories canker and break toxic. Ms. Meredith, a retired middle school math teacher who lives in suburban Atlanta, says her father didn't have demons or post-traumatic stress disorder. He just didn't like to answer questions about the war\u2014not from his wife, not from his daughters and not from kids on the occasion of a school project to mark the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Even seemingly benign questions about Japanese strategy\u2014\"Daddy, why didn't they blow up the fuel?\"\u2014drew short answers. \"He said, 'Boy, you're worse than a newspaper reporter,'\" Ms. Meredith says. On that one, Mr. Dixon eventually relented when his oldest daughter pushed\u2014\"'Because,'\" Ms. Meredith remembers he told her, \"'they thought replacing the boats would be much harder than replacing fuel'\"\u2014but she didn't like to push. \"Some of the questions annoyed him,\" she says. \"And I didn't like annoying him.\" It's not that Mr. Dixon was opposed to talking about what happened to him in World War II. He needed to talk to the right person, and that's how Ken Samuelson, BA '53, introduced Sue and Maggie to a part of their father they never knew. IN 1996, when Sion Harrington started looking for volunteers to interview veterans for an oral history project at the State Archives of North Carolina, he had a feeling that not everyone would turn out to be Edward R. Murrow. He wasn't wrong.\"It would drive me crazy sometimes to get an interview in and the question would be, 'Where were you standing when Pearl Harbor was bombed?'\" Mr. Harrington says by phone from his home in Erwin, N.C. \"'Well, I was right on the deck of the USS Arizona ,' which is the battleship that just got blown completely up. And I'm thinking, oh great, this is going to be fantastic, and their next question was, 'Well, what kind of uniforms did you wear?'\" Mr. Harrington retired in 2010 after 17 years as the military collections archivist. In that time, he accepted that whiffs were inevitable and that it would be impossible to train interviewers on the history he, a 38-year Army vet (12 years active duty), had spent his life studying. But Mr. Harrington did his best, creating a list of example questions\u2014what branch of service, why did you join, were you drafted, et cetera\u2014to guide the less-initiated while he adopted the resigned philosophy that a bad interview was better than no interview. Today, the Veterans Oral History Program includes more than 1,150 interviews, all stored on an environment-controlled upper floor of a foreboding building in downtown Raleigh. The quality of the interviews, Mr. Harrington says, varies. Some are good, some less so, and some are by Ken Samuelson. \"I would love to have had 100 like him out doing interviews,\" Mr. Harrington says. gwmagazine.com / 67Alumni newsalUmni news Mr. Samuelson volunteered for the archives in 1997, practicing his interviewing on a friend who marched into Germany with Patton's Third Army. Since then, Mr. Samuelson has become one of the program's most prolific and proficient contributors, accounting at one point for more than 40 percent of the collection's interviews and averaging 10 a year. About 90 percent of his, roughly, 100 interviews are with World War II veterans. \"If the guy was telling a really good war story,\" Mr. Harrington says of Mr. Samuelson, \"he let him talk, and then he'd come back and ask him the more mundane stuff. He just had a knack for conducting a really good interview.\" Mr. Samuelson is an 85-year-old Navy vet with a crisp memory and a sonorous voice. He sings tenor (and sometimes solos) in the church choir and he still plays tennis three days a week, propping up a worn-out shoulder with a daring net game and topspin. He has friends who knew Betty Grable and Leni Riefenstahl, and his wife, Mickey, who also attended GW, is a descendent of James K. Polk's wife, Sarah Childress Polk. After retiring as the general credit manager for Fieldcrest Cannon, a now-defunct textile manufacturer, Mr. Samuelson was looking for something to do that would feed his lifetime interest in the military. The veterans oral history project fit. Nineteen years later, after seeing an advertising insert in the Eden Daily News , he's invested more than 1,000 hours and something like 250 cassette tapes for his Marantz PMD201 recorder to preserve the stories of those who lived and those who didn't. He has sat and seen old men cry as they remembered lost friends and described what they saw in Europe, in Africa, in the charnel jungles of the South Pacific. The 25th man Mr. Samuelson interviewed, Conrad Alberty, survived the Bataan Death March and three years in Japanese captivity, during which he saw the corpses of fellow POWs paved over to hurry the construction of airfields. Mr. Alberty ate bugs for protein and for iron drank water flavored with a rusty nail. Other veterans, men in their 80s and 90s, said it was too soon to talk about what happened to them. Mr. Samuelson never forced it. One of those vets survived the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in the Indian Ocean, where 900 sailors waited almost five days for rescue as they were picked off and slaughtered by sharks. \"He said, 'I had nightmares for 30 years,'\" Mr. Samuelson says of the man, who slept in separate beds from his wife for three decades because he'd wake up thinking she was a shark. \"... And he said, 'I'm afraid that if I talk about it, it's going to bring it all back.'\" Neuropsychiatrist James Griffith, who specializes in PTSD, says pushing someone who's had a traumatic experience to talk about it can be re-traumatizing. \"It's a little bit like that old thing that if you fall off a horse, for most people, put them back on the horse so they don't develop a phobia,\" says Dr. Griffith, the chair of GW's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. \"... But there are a few people who simply should not get back on the horse.\" About half of the veterans Mr. Samuelson interviewed have died now. He's been to 10 funerals and given one eulogy. That was for Duncan Dixon in 1997. 68 / gw magazine / Summer 2016Alumni newsalUmni i STOCK.COM/TILLSONBURGmanaging director of retail for the greater Pennsylvania region by CBRE Group, Inc. Nadja Y.

Carl LeVan, BA '92, was promoted to associate professor, with tenure, in the School of International Service at American University.AS AN 11-YEAR-OLD in Moline, Ill., Ken Samuelson says, he saw only the glamour of war. It was guns and planes, battle tactics and heroes. It was Captain Midnight and nothing to do with hell and loss. These were the ideas Mr. Samuelson had during the time he spent school nights playing football in the street with the rolled frisbee lid of a large snuff can. In the early 1940s, he says, it was easier to find snuff than real footballs. A lot of people chewed it, even the old ladies. Mr. Samuelson still remembers a few grannies smiling on porch fronts, tobacco gunk in the cracks of their rotted teeth. The football games involved the 10 or so neighborhood kids, including the House brothers. They lived in an old, gray, two-story frame house across the street. There were four of them. \"Rough\" boys, but good kids. Mr. Samuelson remembers Ray the best. Ray was five or six years older, black-haired and athletic, always happy to play with the younger kids and teach them about sports. \"I guess he was 19 or so at the time he was killed,\" Mr. Samuelson says. \"At the Battle of the Bulge. And then that gold star appeared in the window and it all brought everything home to me.\" War was still guns and planes, battle tactics and heroes. After Ray House, it just stopped being glamorous. Ray's death cemented inside Mr. Samuelson a respect for war and those who fight it. The bookshelves in his Fearrington Village home\u2014a rustic retirement community 10 miles south of Chapel Hill\u2014favor history over fiction, with sections of C.S. Lewis theology and models of the fighter planes his minor color-blindness kept him from flying. He and his late brother, Fred, BA '53, had 20/20 vision and wanted to be pilots but the color-blindness left them ineligible. Still, after graduating from GW\u2014where the brothers played football\u2014Ken joined the Navy, going to Officer Candidate School during the final months of the Korean War and then serving as an aviation supply officer. Fred enlisted in the Army in 1947 after graduating from high school and served 18 months before going to GW. Neither brother saw combat. Mr. Samuelson keeps World War II memorabilia most places in the house, in the living room among his dozen or so clocks, in the garage where he painted the Memphis Belle on a far wall. Mr. Samuelson interviewed the famed B-17's pilot, Bob Morgan, for the State Archives in 1999. He keeps all his interview tapes in a dresser in the guest room. Mr. Samuelson isn't a professional historian but he's more than an amateur. His interviews aren't overtly emotional but that doesn't undercut the heart. There is humanity and awe in Mr. Samuelson's knowledge, sincerity and the breadth and depth of his questions: \"What did you think of your superior officers?\" \"What did you eat?\" \"What did you talk about with the guys?\" \"What was it like on the troop train?\" \"Was anything funny?\" \"Were you scared?\" He establishes trust. He listens. He never pushes for more when someone can't or won't give it. He affirms service and action and pain. \"I could take what they're telling me and kind of internalize it,\" Mr. Samuelson says. \"So I became, in a way, a part of their story because it's like talking to your best friend. That's the way I tried to approach every interview I had.\" Veterans are altruistic people, says Maria Llorente, a psychiatrist who has worked with more than 1,000 geriatric veterans during a 21-year career at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans, she says, don't want to shovel their burdens on other people, not on their friends, not their spouses, not on their children. Sue Meredith and Maggie Blum knew that about their late father. He never wanted to talk about what happened, until Mr. Samuelson asked. \"I'm sure it was Ken,\" Ms. Blum says. gwmagazine.com / 69 alUmni news As an alumnus of George Washington University, you could receive exclusive savings on auto and home insurance from Liberty Mutual.1 Discounted R ates\u2014You could save up to $519.52 a year3 on au to insurance and receive addit ional discount s on hom e insurance.

Glacier offers astronomy programs several nights a week during the summer. Favorite NPS Spot: Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in Baltimore is a tremendously stirring place. At the end of the day, after hearing the story of how the words of our national anthem were inspired by the defense of the fort, visitors are invited to help take down and fold the fort's flag. It's probably the most moving program I've participated in at a park. gwmagazine.com / 71Alumni news 72 / gw magazine / Spring 2016 WE MAKE FUTURES Your gift funds scholarships, internships, and world-class experiences.

It's also on track to be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in U.S. history. When the nation's first bullet train speeds out of the station for its scheduled 2029 debut, travelers will be whisked from Los Angeles to the Bay Area at a zippy top speed of 220 mph. A one-way trip will take less than three hours, roughly half the time it takes to drive. And as California continues to lay a path for the $64 billion project, Jeff Morales, BS '83, knows its potential and its divisiveness perhaps better than anyone. Mr. Morales, CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, is both its biggest booster and the one trying to allay critics who question the rail's necessity and its growing price tag. Detractors, he says, should look no further than the iconic span over San Francisco Bay. \"The Golden Gate Bridge, which in many ways is the symbol of the state, was hugely controversial when it was proposed and built,\" he says. \"There were over 2,000 lawsuits filed against it, which is hard to conceive of today. Even Ansel Adams opposed it. \"I absolutely believe that 50 years from now people are going to say, 'What the heck was all of the fuss about?'\" The high-speed rail project has elicited a dozen lawsuits to date, including litigation over contract disputes and tussles about property acquisition. And the public mandate is solid but not overwhelming: High-speed rail was approved by 52.6 percent of the state's voters in 2008; eight years later, support hovers around 50 percent, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Mr. Morales, though, is unbowed by public and political disputes over the effort. The railway will connect 38 million Californians and the economies of the state's three distinct population centers, including the agriculturally rich Central Valley. The system will include more than 800 miles of track and 24 stations, extending first from San Francisco to Anaheim, and ultimately north to Sacramento and south to San Diego. California's 170,000 miles of roadway are the busiest in the nation, and auto congestion drains $18.7 billion in lost time and wasted fuel from the state's economy each year, according to the rail authority. The trains\u2014which will travel faster, in part, because of rails that are relatively straight, mostly unshared and routed above or below road crossings\u2014are expected to provide an \"effective transportation system\" for a state that, by some projections, could reach 60 million inhabitants by mid-century. \"You don't get opportunities very often to do something that is going to shape the state for a 100 to 150 years to come,\" Mr. Morales says. \"To be a part of that is what makes it exciting and worth all of the day-to-day angst.\" That Mr. Morales is leading that charge is due, improbably, to an interest in biology. He had majored in biology and, after college, took a job as an environmental policy aid to U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), a role that morphed into transportation policy when the senator became chairman of the transit appropriations subcommittee. \"I ended up getting hooked on transportation issues,\" Mr. Morales says. It was with Mr. Lautenberg's office that Mr. Morales later helped write legislation that in 1988 banned smoking on domestic flights lasting less than two hours. (\"I smile a little bit every time I fly,\" he says.) He'd go on to serve the Clinton-Gore administration, first in the Department of Transportation, then at the White House, working on the National Partnership for Reinventing Government. In 1998, he became executive vice president of the Chicago Transit Authority, where he required agency executives to turn in their company cars and take public transit An artistic rendering of California's bullet train, which would halve the travel time between Los Angeles and the Bay Area when it debuts in 2029. 74 / gw magazine / Summer 2016Alumni news ClAss nOT esMareesa Fredericks, JD '02, was promoted Dunner LLP.

Mr. Morales also headed the California Department of Transportation for 3 \u00bd years before becoming a senior vice president at international transportation consulting firm Parsons Brinckerhoff. High-speed rail could be his most formidable challenge. Funding to develop the infrastructure is coming from Congress and the state legislature, and planners say they also will tap private coffers. But some congressional leaders have proposed defunding the plan, saying California can't afford it. And Mr. Morales was hired in 2012, after his predecessor resigned amidst increasing attacks from critics and former project supporters alike. Those who know Mr. Morales, though, say he is well-suited to surmount obstacles. \"Jeff is really good at setting a goal and then being flexible about how to achieve that goal,\" says Mort Downey, who was the U.S. deputy secretary of transportation from 1993 to 2001. \"When things are tough, he doubles down and figures out how to make the next positive step.\" Some of that mettle, Mr. Morales says, comes from his time on the GW crew team. He developed close friendships\u2014including meeting his wife, Lori Cafiero, BA '83, MBA '87, who was on the women's team\u2014and says that \"everything about competing definitely shaped me.\" Teammate Ted Bristol, BA '79, says rowing is an apt metaphor for Mr. Morales' work on the bullet train. \"Crew is about pushing yourself beyond where you think you can go, and doing it as part of a team,\" says Mr. Bristol, a principal with FaegreBD Consulting in Washington, where he works in part on transportation issues. \"In all candor, we didn't win a lot of races, but we put in a lot of work and kept pushing to get better and overcome challenges. Jeff was a great teammate.\" The rail project, Mr. Morales says, is \"like building the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington. That's the scale of what we're doing, and we're doing it in an age in which everybody gets to monitor our progress on an hour-by-hour basis. \"Anyone who has been to Europe or Japan or China and ridden high-speed rail comes back and says, 'I love it,'\" he says. \"Unfortunately, you can't get 38 million people to go on a field trip to ride the trains. We're trying to show people what can be done.\" JEFF MORALES' three siblings are alums\u2014 Kevin Morales, BA '77 (who died in 1998); Maureen Taft-Morales, BA '79; and Christopher Morales, BA '83, MS '86, MA '89 \u2014as was his late mother, Martha Morales Sebera (n\u00e9e Rivers), BA '75.

She'd been on planes with electrical problems, fuel leaks and engine failure. One Baltimore-bound flight was so turbulent that, when it landed temporarily in Washington, Ms. Osher, MFA '72, deplaned and took the subway home. \"I thought it was going to be the end,\" she remembers. But it was the Sept. 11 return flight from Amsterdam that sent her over the edge. The pilot announced that weather had shuttered East Coast airports, but when she and her husband saw the Halifax runways lined with jets, they knew something was wrong. They were kept on the plane for 10 hours, then spent four days under the graces of Canadian volunteers, the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. Ms. Osher wouldn't fly again for three years; she once even took a train to Colorado. But when her son moved to Montana and her daughter to San Francisco, Ms. Osher knew she needed to wrestle her fear. She did so through her art. She booked window seats, where her fascination with the clouds and the landscapes was so diverting that she could, essentially, forget to be afraid. And different seasons brought all sorts of textures, colors and shapes. The result of that aesthetic immersion will be on view in an exhibition at GW's Virginia Science and Technology Campus (Sept. 12 through Jan. 4) titled Fearless Flying in 2016! The show includes 17 colorful mixed- media paintings and wall hangings, which hover between abstraction and realism. The works are not only bold artistic statements, they've proven therapeutic. Ms. Osher has kicked her fear, flying as far away as Africa, Australia and South America. \"Although I am no longer afraid to fly,\" she says, \"when I land, I always say, out loud.\" \u2014Menachem Wecker, MA '09 Ms. Osher will be giving a gallery talk on the exhibition Sept. 15.

I couldn't go through the emotions that parents went through. I identified with those in their 20s, early 30s who were dying. I was immersed in death from Day One.\" She says many of her NIH colleagues at the time had trouble speaking plainly about not only death but anything taboo. It bothered her. It still bothers her.[Mortality] About Death Retiring professor Pamela Woodruff addresses the inevitability that's not taxes Oblivion makes Pamela Woodruff, BA '76, MPhil '92, uncomfortable. It's may be the only thing that unnerves the just-retired GW psychology professor about death, a subject she taught for 36 years in a popular class, \"Attitudes Toward Death and Dying.\" \"I want to have the hope that there is something more,\" Ms. Woodruff says of an afterlife. \"I don't believe in it absolutely. I simply hope that it's there.\" A month after the 74-year-old Ms. Woodruff called it a career in May, she talked with GW Magazine about mortality, mankind and how she wants to die. \"I would like to know it's about to happen.\" Brave.\"Well, I say this now. I don't think so, but of course, at the moment, you could panic.\" But if there's nothing on the other side of the darkness, she'll adjust. \"I don't want to, but we're not gonna have a choice, are we?\" Ms. Woodruff, at age 22, became interested in death and how we die while at the National Institutes of Health. For 12 years, she worked with cancer patients, many terminal, who were participating in clinical trials. \"I was seeing how many young adults near my age died and people would say\u2014because there was a whole ward of children with cancer\u2014'Doesn't it bother you about the little children?' And I'd say, 'No, not really.' \"I wanted to be out there being a converter, not to a religion but to being more accepting about death and talking about it directly.\" There is a George Carlin bit about \"soft language.\" Ms. Woodruff does similar material, lamenting humanity's euphemism dependency. She wants people to say what they mean because she believes that brand of ultimate honesty makes us more open and sensitive and less inured, less afraid. She wants people to be stronger, to confront what's hard, what's hardest, because it will make us better. \"We say, 'I lost my mother.' Is she wandering the aisles of Bloomingdales? You haven't lost her. She's dead.\" Ms. Woodruff, who plans to spend her retirement volunteering at a hospice, is blunt. She speaks freely about dying and death in all its forms\u2014suicide, euthanasia, abortion, public execution, murder. \"I like\u2014more than like\u2014shocking people. I guess they don't expect it coming out of a short, morbidly obese old lady. ... I look very docile.\" There's more to it than shock value. That's just her being (endearingly) contrarian. She insists that she doesn't have wisdom to give, preferring a professorial approach predicated on asking questions rather than answering them because death, after all, is a personal experience. So she asks things like, \"Who are you? Are you your physical body or are you your thoughts?\" Ms. Woodruff makes you think about death in a way that's comfortably uncomfortable, in a way that's new\u2014a way that's even fun\u2014but reminding you always that dying comes before death.\u2014Matthew Stoss Wisdom and ho W-to s from experts in the g W community INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGEGW ALUMNI WEEKEND 2016 OCTOBER 27-30, 2016 go.gwu.edu/alumniweekend2016REGISTER NOWpollstersvolunteer coordinator media eventmanager advisers digitaldirector delegate state campaignchair senior adviser staff director schedulerThe George Washington University Washington, D.C. 20052Change Service Requested FSC Kasey Packer, BA '15 (Page '87 (Page Bash, BA "}
