In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks its own healthy tissue, including joints. In severe cases, it attacks internal organs. Rheumatoid arthritis affects joint linings, causing swelling that is painful. Over time, the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can cause joint deformity and bone erosion. Cartilage is a hard slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they connect to form a joint. It gives shape and support to other body parts, such as your ears, nose, and windpipe.
