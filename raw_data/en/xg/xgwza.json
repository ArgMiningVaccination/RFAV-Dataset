But statistics and science must take their place among other importantdeterminants of whether programsdeserve government endorsement.The list of supporters of InspireHealthincludes Prince Charles, a longtimeproponent of complementary medi-cine, who visited the clinic in 2009. 6 The take-home message for doc- tors is not encouraging. We live in atime when government is determinedthat physicians continue to provideevidence-based care in a flat-line fis-cal environment. Indeed, governmenthas suggested that on-call services besupplied for free. And what of thepatients who suffer for want of un -funded, but truly effective services?Perhaps they can take a tip from theInspireHealth website: \"Prayer canbenefit patients even if they are un -aware that they are being prayed for.\" With scarce public funds being spent on integrative medicine, prayermight be the only thing we can offerthose who will suffer the resultingshortfall of needed services. \u2014Lloyd Oppel, MD, Chair, Allied Health Practices Committee References 1.

In-House Research: This article is the opinion of the Council on Health Promotion and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.Of the many things that patients fear being told by their doc-tor, a diagnosis of cancer ranks near the top. Doctors have long recognized that patients with cancer, as with any seri-ous disease, are not always able ormotivated to sort the wheat from thechaff when it comes to claims of treat-ment or cure of dreaded diseases. 1 Good doctors have always taken careto deliver the best scientific medicinein a compassionate way, and we knowthat even in desperate circumstancesit is important to give patients a senseof hope and control. This is not alwayseasy because doctors are also boundby a covenant of truthfulness. Offer-ing false hope or profiting from thefears of patients by offering ineffec-tive therapies is not only consideredunprofessional, but also flies in the faceof basic tenets of consumer protection. Every day, family doctors and spe- cialists work hard to steer their pa -tients into the best treatments, even insituations where limited resourcesmake it difficult to provide optimalcare. Compounding the difficultiesfaced by cancer patients are the innu-merable array of nostrums and legionsof purveyors of questionable therapiesall willing to offer (false) hope\u2014at aprice\u2014to people in desperate circum-stances. One would think that stewards of the health care system would recog-nize such a situation and celebratethose who deliver valid care. But re -sources are scarce, and those of us toil-ing in the trenches are left to assumethat when funds become available,they will be directed to where they candeliver proven benefits.The recent government announce- ment of $5 million for InspireHealth's\"Integrative Medicine\" 2(alternative medicine treatments offered along-side purportedly conventional thera-pies) has understandably raised eye-brows in the medical community. 3 Claiming that their patients have \"sig-nificantly better survival,\" 4Inspire- Health's website delineates what cancer support programs. These\"healing modalities\" 5include: Naturopathic medicine (whose scope of practice, we are told, \"includes allaspects of family and primary care\"). Acupuncture (\"to restore the normal and smooth flow of energy in thebody\"). Lymph massage. Counseling from a \"facilitator of body energy and meridian therapies.\" The InspireHealth Integrated Can- cer Care Guide adds a long list of her -bal remedies, supplements, and oth ermodalities for cancer patients includ-ing mistletoe, homeopathic remedies,\"714X,\" chelation, ozone, colonics, andintravenous hydrogen peroxide. Doubters of the utility of the above value-added offerings at Inspire-Health might wonder how patientsattending such a program might have\"significantly better survival\" thanpatients deprived of what the govern-ment presumably sees as truly effec-tive therapies. The answer may be nomore complicated than the simple factthat healthy and motivated people ableto participate in and comply with anyprogram\u2014be it effective or not\u2014aremore likely to come from the upperpart of the health bell curve no matterwhat their disease.

Briggs, Roger K. Freeman, Sumner J. Yaffe (2011) and Medication safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding by Gideon Koren (2007). These texts,available from the College Library,are standouts among a substantialnumber of print publications on thetopic. Offerings for mobile applica-tions are much fewer in number buttwo are particularly worthy of consid-eration. Regarding drugs in lactation,the US National Institutes of Healthmaintains a publicly available, peer-reviewed database, LactMed, availableboth on the web and as a free app foriPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and An -droid. LactMed provides information on adverse effects in nursing in fantsand suggests therapeutic alternatives.For assessing drugs in pregnancy,credible and detailed mobile apps arevery few and far between.
