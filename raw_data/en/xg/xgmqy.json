Participants wereeither newly appointed faculty in research universities or senior postdoctoral fellows looking for faculty positions. The idea for the course grew out of feedback that BWF and HHMI staff had solicit- ed over the years from the talented young biomedical scientists who had receivedresearch training or career development grants from the organizations.These begin- ning investigators described the challenges they faced in having to fulfill theirresearch, teaching, administrative, and clinical responsibilities while simultaneously being expected to obtain grant support, publish, hire staff, and keep their labs runningsmoothly\u2014all without formal management training.Their comments suggested thatthe grantees might have avoided costly mistakes and made better progress if they hadlearned to be managers as well as researchers before establishing their own laborato-ries. Because BWF and HHMI have similar missions\u2014to advance medical science by funding scientific research and education\u2014and have grant programs that supportbeginning biomedical investigators, a collaboration to establish this course seemedappropriate.The two organizations were already involved in the joint funding anddevelopment of the Career Development Center, which focuses on issues facing thebeginning academic investigator. It is located at Science 's Next Wave Web site and operated by staff of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It took about two years for the course to take shape.T o determine what specific information should be included, BWI and HHMI staff conducted surveys and focusgroups with current and former grantees and senior scientists affiliated with both organizations.The final program covered a range of topics, from laboratory leadershipand mentoring skills to getting published and time management.The course, whichincluded a lively combination of plenary sessions, workshops, panel discussions, andopportunities for networking, received an exceptionally enthusiastic response. In the postcourse focus groups and surveys, participants said that a manual based on the course would be a valuable reference for them, for colleagues who could notattend the course, and for those wanting to develop their own courses on scientificmanagement.This manual responds to their request. This manual is intended for laboratory-based biomedical scientists just starting out\u2014 advanced postdoctoral fellows ready to enter the academic job market and new facul-ty members in research universities and medical schools. Much of the material, how-ever, is also relevant to scientists pursuing nonacademic career paths.The purpose of the manual is to alert beginning scientists to the importance of the managerial aspectsof their new (or soon-to-be-acquired) jobs and to give them practical informationthat will help them succeed as planners and managers of research programs.viii BWF/rhombus6HHMIPreface The manual is also intended to encourage universities, professional societies, postdoc- toral associations, and other organizations to develop similar courses in scientific man-agement and to provide these organizations with an example of how such coursesmight be designed. BWF and HHMI believe that training in scientific managementshould be made available to all researchers early in their careers. Not only will theresearchers benefit, but the scientific enterprise will benefit as well. Enriqueta C. Bond, Ph.D. President Burroughs Wellcome FundThomas R.

Maryrose Franko (HHMI) and Martin Ionescu-Pioggia (BWF) advo-cated for both projects, guided their development, and brought them to completion.Laura Bonetta, science writer and course coordinator, and Pat Davenport (HHMI)were crucial to shaping the content of the manual and managing the editorial process. Jim Austin (American Association for the Advancement of Science),VictoriaMcGovern (BWF), Rolly L. Simpson (BWF), and Andrea L. Stith (formerly HHMIand now at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology) organ-ized many of the course sessions and reviewed the relevant chapters for the manual. A number of BWF and HHMI grant recipients and senior scientists participated in precourse focus groups and interview sessions, providing invaluable suggestions fordesigning the course. Some of them, along with other professionals, served as coursefaculty and contributed to the content of the manual by responding generously to requests for interviews and additional information and by reviewing chapter drafts. Management consultants Christine Harris and Joan C. King developed a workshop inbasic laboratory leadership skills for the course and allowed us to include in the man-ual material they had used to develop that workshop. Krystyna R. Isaacs, evaluationconsultant, analyzed the data from the course evaluations. Milton W . Datta (Medical College of Wisconsin) and T om Misteli (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health) deserve special acknowledgment. Both tookthe time on several occasions to be interviewed, and they provided detailed informa-tion on a variety of topics.Thanks also to Joan E. Dubinsky, Heidi E. Henning, andCarl Rhodes of HHMI for their careful review of the chapters. Writers Joan Guberman, Barbara Shapiro, and Marion T orchia synthesized informa- tion presented during the course and conducted additional research to draft chaptersof the manual. HHMI librarian Cathy Harbert suggested and obtained additionalresources for the writers and course organizers. HHMI's Dean Trackman managed the production process; Cay Butler, Linda Harteker, and Kathleen Savory providedadditional editorial support; and Mary E. Coe created the index. Cathy Newton,Adam Newton, and T om Wood (Raw Sienna Digital) designed the manual.BWF/rhombus6HHMI xiContributors David J.

But as you establish your own laboratory and build your research program, you are becoming aware that research skills are only part\u2014albeit a critical part\u2014of what youneed to succeed. In your first few years as a tenure-track faculty scientist, you will beasked to balance multiple new demands on top of your research, including teaching,administrative tasks, and perhaps clinical responsibilities.At the same time, you will beexpected to hire staff and establish a laboratory, plan a coherent research program,obtain grant funding, and publish in the top journals. Meanwhile, your tenure clockwill be ticking, placing you under enormous pressure to produce.Y ou need specialskills to meet all these expectations\u2014a mixed bag of competencies that can beloosely characterized as \"scientific management\" skills. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you have received explicit instruction in any of these skills in graduate or medical school or during your postdoctoral studies. Likemost beginning investigators, you probably were only able to learn a bit throughtrial and error or by watching your teachers and talking to your advisers, mentors,and fello w students.Why do we need something like a lab management course? Biomedical research today is a complex enterprise that spansmultiple biological levels, requires a variety of equipment and staff, and demands success with limited funds. Each one of youis really an entrepreneur running your own new small business. \u2014Enriqueta Bond, Burroughs Wellcome Fund ''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 2BWF/rhombus6HHMIThis manual provides an outline for filling this educational gap.The content is based on the \"Course in Scientific Management for the Beginning Academic Investigator,\"held at Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) headquarters in July 2002.Thecourse was developed and sponsored by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF) andHHMI for selected BWF and HHMI grantees. BWF and HHMI staff developed thecourse out of a conviction that scientific management is a teachable subject\u2014that itis possible for beginning scientists to learn how successful scientists manage theirresearch programs.The course covered basic topics in scientific management, includ- ing laboratory leadership, getting funded, time management, and collaborations, togive participants a head start in achieving research independence. (Chapter 13 pre- sents detailed information on the development and content of the course.) Althoughthe manual is directed to laboratory-based academic scientists, much of the materialwould also be of use to beginning investigators in government and industry labs. The chapters in this manual were developed from the course presentations and panel discussions, handouts from presenters, the question-and-answer (Q&A) sessions, feed-back from course participants, and subsequent interviews with the presenters andother scientists. Content was also drawn from many of the resources listed at the endof each chapter.Additional information was obtained from transcripts of interviewswith \"model laboratory leaders\" that had been conducted by executive coachesChristine Harris, Ed.D., and Joan C. King, Ph.D., when they were designing a work-shop on basic laboratory leadership skills that they conducted as part of the course. The first chapter,\"Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure,\"offers tips on finding and negotiating terms for a faculty position, outlines the expectations of a faculty job, and offers a timeline to help you plan for tenure.The next chapter, entitled \"The Scientific Investigator Within the UniversityStructure,\" takes a look at the typical decision-making hierarchy of a research univer-sity and an academic health center, discusses your professional responsibilities outsidethe laboratory, and introduces some of the academic offices with which you willinteract and the resources available to support your research. Two chapters deal with people skills.\"Defining and Implementing Y our Mission\" offers guidance in developing a mission statement for your lab and suggests ways tomotivate and manage the people in your lab.\"Mentoring and Being Mentored\"explores what it means to be a mentor, particularly as a strategy for facilitating learn-ing and training new scientists. It includes approaches to help you be an effectivementor and offers advice on how to obtain the mentoring you need. \"Staffing Y our Laboratory\" provides pointers on recruiting a team of people who will contribute to the success of your lab. It also discusses what to do if you have to letsomeone go. (The course did not cover this subject, but its importance emerged dur-ing the Q&A sessions, as grantees asked for guidance on difficult personnel issuesthey were facing.) Several chapters offer tips about time management, project management, and data management.\"Getting Funded\" and \"Getting Published and Increasing Y ourVisibility\" discuss these challenging tasks in the competitive environment of biomed-ical research.\"Setting Up Collaborations\" and \"Understanding T echnology Transfer\"are particularly relevant at a time when research projects often involve scientists indifferent departments and different universities and when research findings are oftenIntroduction BWF/rhombus6HHMI 3shared with industry and government.The final chapter provides a summary of the course, including an abstract of each session, a summary of the postcourse evaluationand lessons learned, and speakers' biographies. Several sessions of the course were not developed into separate chapters in the manual, but some of the information from these sessions is included in various chapters. For example, information from the session on budgets is found in the chapter \"GettingFunded,\" in the context of preparing a grant application. Given time and space con-straints, some topics, such as lab safety, scientific writing, public speaking, communicat-ing science to the public, and science policy, were not covered in either the course orthe manual.This information is typically taught at most universities or is available fromother sources (e.g., HHMI has published several videos on laboratory safety, available atno charge from HHMI's online catalog at http://www.hhmi.org/catalog ). Each chapter was reviewed by the session speaker(s), course developers, and other BWF and HHMI staff.The manual is not meant to be a comprehensive referencetext. It is designed to highlight key points about scientific management that are notreadily available in print elsewhere.The manual is likewise not meant to be prescrip- tive. It is a collection of opinions, experiences, and tips from established scientists andprofessionals.Y ou are encouraged to supplement this information with resources frompostdoctoral or professional associations and Web resources, as well as the books andarticles mentioned in each chapter.Y ou are also encouraged to discuss ideas in thebook with colleagues, mentors, and advisers. It is hoped that these discussions willspark ideas for developing a scientific management style that suits your personalityand professional situation.The manual can also serve as a resource for organizationsthat are developing their own courses in scientific management.BWF/rhombus6HHMI 5Chapter 1 OBTAINING AND NEGOTIATING A FACULTY POSITION AND PLANNING FOR TENURE As you complete your postdoctoral training, you are probably starting to think about the next step in your research career. Forsome of you, this may mean a position as an investigator in anindustry or government laboratory. For others, this may mean afaculty position at a university or medical center. If you pursue the latter, you will have to decide whether a tenured or nontenuredposition is better suited to your personal goals and ambitions.Although all these career options are rewarding, this chapter fo-cuses on the tenure-track faculty appointment. As you embark on your search, you will face a series of challenging questions: /rhombus6 What do I want and need from my job? /rhombus6 How do I go about finding a job? /rhombus6 How can I ensure that my achievements and capabilities will be recognized? /rhombus6 How will I choose among the offers I receive? /rhombus6 How can I ensure that the resources I need to launch my career are included in the job package? /rhombus6 How can I increase my chances of getting promoted and obtaining tenure? There are no universally right answers to these questions, but there are well-tested strategies for finding and obtaining the right academ-ic appointment and for obtaining tenure.This chapter discusses someof them.This chapter is based on the ses- sion \"Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position\" that was held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management.The ses- sion was organized by Rolly L. Simpson, Burroughs Wellcome Fund, with presentations by Chris M. Golde, Ph.D., Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of T eaching; Johannes Walter, Ph.D., Harvard Medical School; and Christopher Wylie, Ph.D., Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation.Additional information was obtained from Peter J. Bruns, Ph.D., Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); Milton W. Datta, M.D., Medical College of Wisconsin;T odd R. Golub, M.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (also investigator); Carl ony G.Waldrop, Ph.D., University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill; and some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 6BWF/rhombus6HHMIOBTAINING A FACULTY POSITION The Job Search Once you decide to launch your search, make it a concentrated effort. Ideally, doing so will bring multiple offers your way at about the same time. Making the job hunt aflat-out effort also makes the labor-intensive process of gathering credentials and ref-erences much more worthwhile. Keep in mind that most academic positions areadvertised in the fall, with the assumption that the job will start in summer or fall ofthe following year. Knowing what you want. Your chances of finding the right job will be greater if you have your own needs and wants firmly in mind. For example, consider the fol- lowing questions: /rhombus6 Do you need to be working at a top-rated institution, or would a less-intense atmosphere be acceptable or even preferable, given your talents and ambitions? /rhombus6 Do you want to devote yourself exclusively to research, or would you prefer some combination of research and teaching or clinical practice? /rhombus6 Do you want or need to be in a particular area of the country? Do you pre- fer an urban, rural, or suburban location? /rhombus6 Will personal responsibilities, or your spouse's or partner's professional needs, set limits on your search? In addition, if you are a physician-scientist, you will have to decide whether you want to be more of a researcher or more of a clinician. Learning what is out there. Use all avail- able formal and informal sources of informa-tion. Formal sources of information includethe following: /rhombus6 Job announcement letters sent to your department /rhombus6 Announcements (print and online) in major scientific journals such as Cell, Science ,and Nature and in publications devoted to your subspecialty /rhombus6 Web sites of academic institutions /rhombus6 Employment bulletins published by pro- fessional associations Informal sources can be even more valuable\u2014 for example, the supervisor of your postdoctoralresearch; other scientists with whom you have a relationship, especially those with whom you have collaborated; and your peers. So, get theword out that you are looking.A Few Career-Related Web Sites for Scientists Science magazine's Next Wave Web site contains a Career Development Center for postdocs andbeginning faculty ( http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/cdc/ ). The Chronicle of Higher Education 's online newsletter Career Network has career news and advice and publishes new scientific faculty and research jobs every day ( http://chronicle.com/jobs ). The University of Washington's Re-envisioning the Ph.D. provides Web resources related to job hunting for doctoral students, postdocs, and academics (http://www.grad.washington.edu/envision/phd/ employment_index.html ).Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 7Narrowing your search. Measure each job opportunity against your list of priori- ties. Find out about /rhombus6 The institution's mission, values, political and social climate, and quality (e.g., national or regional ranking) /rhombus6 The department's mission, research activities, curriculum, and collegial atmosphere /rhombus6 The parameters and expectations of the position, including whether it is tenure track There's no easy way to tell how many positions to apply for. Remember, though, job hunting is not wasted time; the process has valuable spin-offs. For example, you willget a chance to make presentations about your work.Y our ideas are sharpened in theprocess, and the research itself benefits.Y ou are practicing skills you will use through-out your career.Y ou also get better at the job-hunting process as you go along.Y ourself-confidence builds, and your sense of what you want develops as you are intro-duced to various research environments. However, don't apply for a job that you are clearly not qualified for or that really does not interest you.Y ou don't want to waste people's time and perhaps damageyour own credibility. The Job Application Once you have found one or several positions that you would like to apply for, you want your application to stand out sufficiently so that you will be invited for an interview. Here are some guidelines. First impressions. Your application is likely to be one of hundreds that an over- worked search committee must sift through. Follow the application instructions, and make sure your application is concise and free of factual, grammatical, and spellingerrors.Y ou don't want it eliminated at the outset because it makes a bad impression. Get your application in on time. However, if you learn about the position after the application deadline has passed, still send in your application; many departments arewilling to consider late applications. While a nicely prepared application will obviously not get you a job, a poorly prepared one makes a bad impression no matterhow many papers you have published. \u2014Johannes Walter, Harvard Medical School '' ''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 8BWF/rhombus6HHMIThe cover letter. This letter, which should be limited to one page, is extremely important and should be written with great care. It should give the search committeea quick but informative picture of your background and interests relevant to the job.Include the following items in your letter: /rhombus6 Brief self-introduction /rhombus6 Statement specifying the position for which you are applying /rhombus6 Statement about your research accomplishments, indicating why the work is novel and interesting /rhombus6 Brief description of your research plans, indicating what is important or cre- ative about what you propose /rhombus6 Brief description of your teaching (or clinical) experience, if the position emphasizes these activities /rhombus6 Any special circumstances you believe the committee should know about up front The last item may be a difficult judgment call. It is hard to know whether to revealinformation that could eliminate you as acandidate before you've even had an inter-view but that will need to be addressedshould you receive an offer.The classic ex-ample of such a situation is that your spouseis also a scientist looking for a facultyappointment. If you decide not to mentionsuch a circumstance in your cover letter,inform the search committee of your specialneeds early in the interview process.

If you are listed as an equal author on a paper, use an asterisk next to your name and all other authors whoare equal and note \" *equal authorship\" immediately below the relevant reference. Do not rearrange the published order of authors to show that you have equal first authorship. List manuscripts in preparation under a separate category. Indicate accompanying News & Views articles or other reviews of your publications. Do not include posters exhibited at scientific meetings. The research proposal. This is the core of your application. It will describe your research plans to a search committee composed of people from several scientific areas outside your subspecialty. Many successful applicants write two (or possibly three) research proposals, the first of which is closely related to their current postdoctoral work.The second and third pro-posals show the applicant's ability to think beyond his or her current work.Theseproposals are typically more creative and demonstrate a bit more risk. Include the fol-lowing items in your proposals: /rhombus6 A statement about the problem you intend to work on, indicating the key unanswered questions you will tackle. State how this research is expected to contribute to your general area. /rhombus6 A description of your research plans.This section should comprise 50 to 70 percent of the proposal. Put forward three or four specific aims that address a range of fundamental questions within your discipline. Demonstrate that youhave the necessary background to achieve what you propose. Be both cre-ative and realistic. /rhombus6 A few figures (perhaps one per proposal).These can help make your proposal more interesting to the search committee, which will be wading through per- haps hundreds of proposals from the other applicants. Remember, figures aremost useful when they're embedded in the text and not tacked on at the end. /rhombus6 A detailed description of your postdoctoral research, with an emphasis on what is novel and important and how it is the basis for your research propos- al. Describe your predoctoral graduate research only if it is critical to yourcurrent interests. /rhombus6 A list of references that includes your publications and manuscripts submitted or in press, as well as pertinent publications by others. Reprints. Follow the directions for each application. Send along any important papers that are not yet published; otherwise, the committee will not have access to them. Statement of teaching. If the job has a teaching component, add a separate section describing your interest in and approach to teaching and your experience. Letters of recommendation. Depending on the application instructions, letters of recommendation can be included in the application package or submitted subse- quently to the search committee.T ypically, these letters are written by your graduateand postdoctoral advisers. It is also perfectly acceptable to submit one or two morereferences than the number asked for in the application.When you approach some- one other than an adviser for a letter of recommendation, use the conversation as anopportunity to get a sense of how they judge your work. If you encounter any Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 10BWF/rhombus6HHMIhesitation at all, or an indication that the per- son does not have time to write a letter ordoes not know you well enough to do so, askothers.Y ou should ask someone who reallyknows you and your work, not just someonewith an important title. Give those who are writing you a letter of recommendation plenty of time to prepare the letter. Give them your application package. Ifthey suggest, prepare a draft of the letter ofrecommendation for them. Point out strengths you have that they may not be fully aware of. But be careful\u2014do not appear to be dictatingyour letter to them. Provide them with stamped, addressed envelopes.T ell them wheneach letter to each of your potential employerswill be needed, and then remind them untilthey send your letters. Check to verify thateach letter has been received. The Job Interview A formal interview for a faculty position typically takes the form of a daylong or overnight visit to the campus. Normally, the institution inviting you for an interview pays your expenses for travel and accommodations.Y ou can expect to meet with sev-eral faculty members, as well as others who may be asked to provide feedback aboutyou to the search committee, and to give talks about your research. It will be your task to do the following: /rhombus6 Convince the department that your work is exciting and that you will be a leader in your field. /rhombus6 Convince each member of the department that you will be a good colleague. /rhombus6 Find out if the institution and the department are right for you. Be prepared for a demanding and exhausting experience.Y ou will be on display at all stages of the visit, from the moment you are picked up at the airport until you aresent on your way again. Advance preparation. Come well prepared by doing the following before your visit: /rhombus6 Organize the logistics of your trip, including travel tickets, hotel accommoda- tions, arrangements for pick up, and the schedule of events on interview day. Be conservative about your estimates of travel time:Y ou don't need the addedstress of missing a connection and being late. /rhombus6 Find out about the academic interests of the people you are likely to meet. Read a few of their papers or at least skim the abstracts. Be ready to ask them about their work.Y ou can probably find this information on thedepartment's Web site.Question: What if I don't get along with my adviser? Answer: If you do not have a good relationship with your adviser and cannot ask for a letter ofrecommendation, make sure you explain whyin your cover letter. Be completely candid about the situation. Not having a recommendationfrom your adviser is a red flag to the searchcommittee and will not be ignored.The commit-tee may even contact your adviser anyway. Aletter from another faculty member from thesame institution may be critical in this case.Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 11/rhombus6 Learn as much as possible about the institution and the surrounding area. Knowing something about the city or town will give you a starting point for small talk. Dress code. Dress neatly and in keeping with scientific custom as you know it.Avoid dressing at a level of formality that will make you and your hosts uncomfortable. Preparing your job talk. During your interview visit, you will be asked to give a \"job talk\"\u2014a formal presentation on your current research.A job talk generally lastsabout an hour, including 10 to 15 minutes for questions.Y ou have probably given thiskind of talk before, and you know what works for you, but here are a few guidelineson how to prepare your talk. First, write out the entire talk, thinking of your audience as you write. Remember, a talk is not presented in the same way as a scientific paper.Y ou must get your mainideas across to listeners who have had little opportunity to study the details, as well asto those whose research interests and backgrounds are very different from yours.Y oucan assume that your audience will be composed of intelligent people who are unin-formed about your chosen scientific field.T o help your audience follow your talk,divide it into several clear and concise sections, and give an overview of the talk atthe beginning.At the end, restate your conclusions and offer an outline of yourfuture research plans.At the outset or at the conclusion of your talk, include a briefstatement acknowledging those who helped you in your research. Next, translate your talk into a slide presentation. Most researchers use PowerPoint presentations to deliver their talks. Remember, however, to bring along a backupdisk. Be sure to inform your hosts ahead of time about your audiovisual needs.Try tovary the design of your slides, alternating between text and figures. Resist the tempta- tion to use only bulleted points, but also avoid long sentences. Be sure that your slidesare readable and that the order of your slides matches your written presentation. (TheAmerican Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and other professionalsocieties publish guidelines for preparing these presentations.) Finally, practice your talk in front of a mirror. Doing so allows you to time your presen- tation while getting used to the sound of your own voice. Keep repeating the talk untilyou can deliver it easily, using your slides as your only memory aid. If necessary, edit the talk down until it can be delivered comfortably within 50 minutes. Remember that atalk that is slightly too short is much better than one that is too long. It may be betterto focus on only one aspect of your research, so you can give sufficient detail withinthe time you have. Save the rest for the question-and-answer session. When you feel comfortable giving your talk, enlist your adviser, your postdoctoral col- leagues, and any graduate students you work with as an audience for a practice talk.Encourage them to ask questions and offer frank criticism.Ask them for suggestions toimprove your PowerPoint slides, and leave enough time to edit your slides accordingly. Delivering the talk. Experienced speakers resort to a variety of techniques to con- trol nervousness. Here are a few of them: /rhombus6 Arrive early enough to set up equipment and become comfortable with the room.Y ou may have to ask your host to get you to the room with enough time to prepare.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 12BWF/rhombus6HHMI/rhombus6 Plant your feet firmly on the floor. Feeling balanced is important to your self-confidence. /rhombus6 Know what you intend to do with your hands.A computer mouse and a pointer may be enough to keep you from fidgeting\u2014but be careful not to play with either of them. /rhombus6 Greet your audience and tell them you are glad to be with them. Make eye contact with a few audience members who seem eager to hear what you have to say.Then plunge in. /rhombus6 Don't worry if some people nod off or seem uninterested; just continue to give your talk as you practiced it, making eye contact with those who are lis- tening closely. /rhombus6 Let it show that you are excited about your work. Demonstrate confidence by using \"I\" wherever it seems appropriate to do so. Answering questions during a talk can be especially difficult. Several ways for han- dling this are noted here: /rhombus6 Repeat the question for the audience.Then take your time answering. If you need to, buy some more time by asking for a restatement of the question. In a pinch, give an interpretation of what you think the questioner wants to know.Then give your best answer and stop. Rambling on only conveys uncertainty. /rhombus6 If questions are slow in coming, take the initiative by pointing out some aspect of your work that you passed over quickly but that you believe war- rants the audience's attention.This gives you a chance to use some of thematerial you edited out of your talk.Y ou may generate a whole new line ofquestioning. In case you need to go back through your slides to a particularone in order to clarify a point, arrange to have your computer presentationaccessible during the discussion period. /rhombus6 If challenged, listen to the criticism and give a judicious response. Don't become defensive. If the criticism seems unfair, stand your ground politely. You might suggest a follow-up discussion later. Giving a chalk talk. During your interview visit, you will likely have an opportu- nity to give a less formal presentation\u2014a chalk talk\u2014during which you can offerdetailed information about the direction of your future research. It should not be apolished slide presentation, but it should be prepared carefully.Some fraction of the audience is always asleep during any talk, no matter how exciting the subject. Find a few people who arelistening attentively and give your talk to them. \u2014Johannes Walter, Harvard Medical School'' ''Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 13Give a brief overview of your research agenda, including your short- and long-term objectives.Then state several specific problems you want to work on, and explain indetail how you plan to proceed. Bring along an overhead or two of preliminary datathat will demonstrate the feasibility of your plan. Show that you are familiar with thedetails of any new techniques you may need to master. Expect to be interrupted.The chalk talk is a chance to show that you can think on your feet and that you will be an interactive research colleague. Meeting other faculty members. Typically, part of the interview process will include one-on-one conversations with members of the department. It is importantto show interest in their work and ask lots of questions. In addition, assume that youwill be taken out to dinner by some of the faculty.This is a chance for them to eval-uate you as a future colleague and for you to determine whether you would enjoyworking with them.Afterward, they will probably share their impressions of you among themselves. Meeting with students, postdocs, residents, or other trainees. This is essential for someone who expects to conduct research in any department.A candidate shouldbe concerned if a department doesn't offer ample opportunities (over lunch or in thelab) to meet with students and postdocs in the absence of faculty. Concluding your visit and following up. Typically, your visit will conclude with a conversation with the chair of the search committee, in which you might expect tolearn when a decision will be reached.As soon as you return home, write a formalletter addressed to the chair of the committee, thanking everyone for their hospitalityand reiterating your interest in the position. If during your one-on-one interviews,you have promised to share data, be sure to follow up on your commitment. Now it's time to play the waiting game because the committee will undoubtedly be chargedwith arranging interviews for several candidates. Be sure to inform the search committee chair if you decide to take another job before the committee extends an offer to you or if for some other reason you decideto withdraw your candidacy.When you're talking to the faculty, it's important to appear interested in everybody's work.You don't have to be an experton the topic. If you know something about it, it's good tochime in with a suggestion or a question. If you're clueless, it's fine to say,\"This is really fascinating, but could you give me abit more background?\" It's also very important to give adynamite seminar so that the people who didn't get a chance to meet with you privately will have a chance to hear aboutyour work, how you express yourself, and what kind of a con- text you put your research in. \u2014 Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 14BWF/rhombus6HHMINEGOTIATING YOUR POSITION The chair of the search committee or the department chair has given you a tentative offer or at least let you know that you are the top candidate.Y ou are nowin a position of maximum strength for obtaining what you want.The search com-mittee has invested time and effort in choosing you, and the last thing its memberswant is to come up empty or to have to start over.They have decided they want you and will be disappointed if you don't come, and they want you to be happy onceyou are on board. Evaluating the Offer Before making a decision, you will need to find out as much information as possible about the position. If you are not satisfied with some aspects of the offer, try to nego-tiate better terms.Y ou will have to do the following: /rhombus6 Learn the details of the offer. /rhombus6 Reread the list of priorities you made at the outset of your search to evaluate how the job stacks up against that list. /rhombus6 Calculate precisely what you are worth in salary and other benefits to deter- mine whether the offer measures up. For example, can you afford to live inthe community? Does the institution provide housing allowances or low-interest loans to help? /rhombus6 Enumerate in detail the other resources you believe you need to succeed in your scientific career (decide what is absolutely necessary and what you can live without). In some cases, it may be satisfactory for the department toguarantee you access to shared equipment, rather than buying you your own. /rhombus6 Make your wishes known to the institution representatives and engage them in the process of negotiating with you. /rhombus6 Get everything spelled out in writing. The search committee is your natural source for basic information about the terms of the appointment and about university-wide benefits and policies.Ask for a copyof the university's faculty handbook and any other personnel policy manuals. Readthem over thoroughly, check them against the recommended standards of theAmerican Association of University Professors (AAUP), and prepare a list of ques-tions for the committee. You may need to do some homework to rule out problems that may not be revealed in response to direct questions or that you simply cannot ask the search committeeabout. For example, it would be helpful to know whether the department has experi-In theory, everything is negotiable.That said, every department and institution has constraints. \u2014Chris M. Golde, from \"Be Honorable and Strategic,\" Science 's Next Wave (November 2001) '' ''Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 15enced internal personal conflicts recently, whether the university has financial prob- lems, whether the chair is retiring or stepping down soon, and whether key facultymembers are about to leave or retire.Y ou also want to know whether people whohave worked in the department have been happy, well supported, and successful. Usethe grapevine: Call people you met during your interview visit, and talk with post-docs or others recently affiliated with your potential department and institution. Bediscreet, but be straightforward.Y ou don't want to be surprised. When you are contacted with an offer, you might be asked for a second interview. This time, you will be able to ask more detailed questions about the position.Y oumight also visit the human resources office, talk with key people in your prospectivedepartment, and have a preliminary look at available housing.A second interview visitis an excellent time to start the discussion about what you will need in terms of labo-ratory space, materials and equipment, and staff. What Y ou Need to Find Out Here are some of the details that you will need to ask about. The appointment. You need to know the following: /rhombus6 Your job title and what it means /rhombus6 The length of your initial contract /rhombus6 The terms under which the contract will be renewed Verify that you are indeed being offered a full- time tenure-track position. For example, sever-al California schools have offered positionsthat appear to be full time yet are only halftime or less than full time as far as a state-sponsored faculty position is concerned. Inthese cases, a faculty member is expected torely on other funds for a significant part of salary and other support.Y ou also need to findout about the process for obtaining tenure (see\"Planning for Promotion and T enure,\" page20). Research faculty appointments are oftenQuestion: What if I'm offered an appointment to more than one department? Answer: Insist on clarification in writing of where your \"tenure home\" will be, what theperformance criteria for tenure will be, who willbe making the tenure decision, the percentage ofyour salary paid by each department, where your office will be located, what your teaching responsibilities will be, and who will serve as your mentor. Seek advice from others who have worked in similar situations. For example, one experienced academic scientist cautions againstaccepting an appointment that is split 50-50between departments. If you have a dual appointment, it's important to clarify which department will be paying the bulk of your salary, because thatdepartment will have the biggest right to your time. For ex-ample, if your secondary department wants you to increaseyour teaching load, you could request that they negotiate with your primary department to reduce the teaching load there in exchange for picking up more of your salary. \u2014Milton Datta, Medical College of Wisconsin''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 16BWF/rhombus6HHMI\"at-will\" appointments, offering no tenure protection if, for example, the position is eliminated or grant funding is lost. The salary. You need to pin down the following: /rhombus6 The amount of your base pay (this will determine the level of other benefits and future raises). /rhombus6 Whether the salary is guaranteed, and if so, for how long\u2014in other words, you need to know whether part of your salary and other support must even- tually be obtained from research grants or other nondepartmental or institu-tional sources. /rhombus6 The department's history of salary increases. /rhombus6 Whether you will be paid on a 9-month or 12-month basis (if you are paid on a 9-month basis, find out whether yourpaychecks can be prorated over 12months). /rhombus6 If paid on a 9-month basis, does the insti- tution allow you to pay yourself a sum- mer salary from a research grant? Is therean institutional pool of money that willprovide a summer salary for a year or twountil you can obtain grant funding? /rhombus6 Your institution's policies on outside consulting, including how much consult- ing is permitted, what approvals are required, and what limitations apply. Knowing what you are worth. There are many sources of information that you can useto evaluate your starting salary. Salaries differ widely depending on degree, geographical location, type of institution (public versusprivate), and scientific discipline.T o evaluate the salary offered, you need comparativeinformation on starting faculty salaries at the institution offering you the job and inyour field elsewhere as well as on costs of living.Try the following resources: /rhombus6 The AAUP publishes an annual salary survey in the March-April issue of Academe (http://www.aaup.org ). /rhombus6 The American Chemical Society publishes a detailed annual salary survey, with data broken down by employment sector, geographic region, and pro- fessional specialty, in the magazine Chemical and Engineering News (http://pubs.acs.org ). /rhombus6 The Association of American Medical Colleges publishes an annual salary survey that contains data for professors at U.S. medical schools (http://www.aamc.org ).Hard Money Versus Soft Money \"Hard money\" refers to any guaranteed funds that you receive from the university where youare employed.When you are offered a facultyposition, you typically receive salary and start-up funds\u2014hard money\u2014to cover the costs ofstarting your laboratory during the first one ortwo years of your employment.After the start-up period ends, you may continue to receivehard money support for at least a portion ofyour salary and perhaps for a technician's salary. However, you will also need to obtaingrant support (i.e.,\"soft money\") to pay foryour research and, at some universities, all or part of your salary as well. Soft money there-fore refers to funds that you receive from grants\u2014for which you will most likely have tocompete.Figure 1.1 gives starting salaries for BWF Career Award recipients who began faculty positions in 2002 and 2003.These individuals had about 42 months of postdoctoralexperience at the time they began their appointments. Other forms of compensation. Get the details of the following: /rhombus6 Health coverage, life insurance, disability insurance, and retirement benefits /rhombus6 Other family-related benefits, such as tuition support for family members and access to university recreational facilities /rhombus6 Whether moving expenses will be paid /rhombus6 Availability of a housing subsidy or at least assistance in obtaining housing Start-up package. Find out what resources the university will make available to support your research until you can obtain grant support. Specifically, ask about officeand lab space, equipment, computers and software, a technician and other supportstaff, the principal investigator's contributions to graduate student stipends, help inobtaining grants, and support for travel to conferences and meetings. Service within the university. Ask how many committees and other projects you will be expected to become involved with.Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 17Faculty Appointments, 2002-2003* Ph.D.s (n = ($60,000-$100,000) salary ($200,000-$1,075,000) Median start-up package (less salary) $470,000 Physician-Scientists Average salary $119,000 ($93,000-$150,000) salary ($90,00-$600,00) Median start-up package (less salary) $336,000 *Data are for CABS awardees who advanced from postdoctoral to faculty positions.The posi- tions ranged across the basic biomedical sciences, public and private institutions, and U.S. geo-graphic areas.Although sample sizes are small, data are consistent with cost-corrected data forthe 110 CABS recipients who received faculty positions between 1998 and 2001.

Although rewarding, teaching can be the most time- consuming activity for new faculty.Y ou will want a clear statement about the following: /rhombus6 Your teaching load (the number of classes each term, typical enrollments, and levels and types of students) /rhombus6 Teaching-related responsibilities (office hours, direction of student theses, advising students) /rhombus6 Teaching-related responsibilities if you have an appointment in two different departments or if you will be a member of one or more departmental gradu- ate faculty groups or of an interdepartmental graduate program Ask for a reduction in teaching responsibilities if your appointment involves heavy service responsibilities or if the position entails an appointment in two departments. Protected research time. Now is your best chance to maximize and codify in writing how much protected time you will have for research.Y ou need to clarify asmuch as possible expectations and decrease, if necessary, the number of other obliga- tions you have (also see box \"The Challenge for Physician-Scientists,\" page 25).Remember, your research time is protected to the extent that youtake steps to pro- tect it. Once you have signed a contract it will be hard to make changes. Getting What Y ou Need and Want How to negotiate. Present your requests clearly. Give the institution's negotiator a complete list of things you need.Then give the department time to respond.Thenegotiator must present a coherent proposal to whoever holds the resources youwant, so avoid making numerous requests. When the institution responds and you begin to discuss the terms of employment, be prepared to make trade-offs. Knowing what is essential to you is crucial at this time. The offer letter. The fruits of your negotiations should be reflected in an official letter from the institution offering you a job.Work with the institution to craft ascomprehensive a letter as possible.The letter is usually your contract, so take it seri-ously. In addition to the basics (e.g., title, salary, and research support), the lettershould detail the timing, schedule, process, and requirements for tenure.The issue of protected research time\u2014not the compensation package and lab space\u2014is the single most important negotiat-ing point for junior faculty. If the institution is not willing tospecify a time split in writing, you should worry. \u2014T odd Golub, HHMI and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute''''Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 19Handling Multiple Offers Multiple offers are gratifying, but they make life complicated.The important thing is to deal honorably.The following rules apply: /rhombus6 Keep all parties informed of the status of your other applications. /rhombus6 Use your leverage to ask an institution to match an offer but only if you intend to accept the offer. /rhombus6 Be prompt to refuse, so that other candidates may be considered for a job you don't want. Keep in mind, however, that it can be risky to decline all your other offers before you've accepted your first choice in writing.There have been cases when firm verbal offers have been withdrawn because of auniversity-wide hiring freeze. /rhombus6 Ask for an extension of a deadline if you need to, but don't miss a deadline. Making Y our Decision Discuss all the pros and cons with those you trust. Sleep on your decision. Once you make it, don't look back.Memories are long in academia, and dealing badly once will haunt you throughout your career. \u2014Chris Golde, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of T eaching''''I tell all of my postdocs who are negotiating for faculty posi- tions: Once you sign on the dotted line, don't count on gettinganything you haven't already been promised, no matter howreasonable it might seem. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 20BWF/rhombus6HHMIPLANNING FOR PROMOTION AND TENURE You have accepted the job. In six years' time, your research program must be well under way.Y ou must have solid grant support, several substantial papers published in high-quality peer-reviewed journals, a reputation among your colleagues as a sci-entist headed for success, a good track record in teaching and advising students andtrainees, and relationships within the university that mark you as a desirable colleague. You are more likely to succeed if you understand from the start how the decision regarding tenure and promotion is made at the institution you are joining.Y ou can then start planning your strategy accordingly. The Varieties of T enure-Track Faculty Careers A tenure-track position is one that leads to a permanent professorial appointment. In most institutions, tenure confers virtual lifetime job security because a tenured profes-sor cannot be fired except for certain limited causes, such as gross misconduct orneglect of duty. There are several subcategories of tenured professorship.The standard tenured posi- tion at a university combines research, teaching, and service to the university and theprofession. Clinical professorships in a medical school may include responsibility forpatient care in addition to the standard responsibilities. Time Frame for Progress Along the T enure Track The exact time frame for tenure and promotion has been established by your institu- tion. In general, if you are appointed as an assistant professor, you can expect to beconsidered for advancement within about six years. Criteria for T enure The official criteria for tenure form a \"three-legged stool.\"Y ou will be judged on your research; teaching; and service to the university, your profession, and the public. Whether or not these criteria have been spelled out in detail, the following expecta-tions are typical. Research. Your research must be of a quality and quantity that contribute substan- tially to your scientific discipline. Publication in peer-reviewed journals in your spe-cialty and statements from individuals in your field who can testify to the quality ofyour research are the principal pieces of evidence showing that you meet this stan- dard. Publications in scientific magazines that reach a wider audience give you addi-tional credit. Substantial, ongoing research grant support is required; for example,some institutions require that you have at least one NIH R01 grant.Additional evi-dence includes prizes and other recognitions of your work as well as invitations topresent your work at conferences. Teaching. You must have evidence that you are a competent teacher and that you fulfill your responsibilities to your students in a conscientious manner.T eaching isnotoriously difficult to evaluate, but your department should have mechanisms to doso. Colleagues in your department may be assigned to supervise your teaching andoffer guidance. Students' evaluations are another piece of evidence of your compe-tence and rapport with your students.Y ou may also be asked to report on your ownteaching activities.Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 21Service. You must demonstrate that you are willing to work for the betterment of the university, your profession, and the public at large. Service on departmental andother campus committees, on research ethics boards, on editorial boards of journals,and on grant study sections demonstrates your willingness to assume your share ofresponsibility.Work for professional associations and work as a consultant to govern- ment and industry also count as service. The weight that will be given to each area by your tenure committee will depend on the mission of your institution and your department. In a premier research depart-ment or institution, research is primary, and it is the progress of your particular pro-gram that counts the most.Medical Center Career Tracks In general, a faculty member in a basic science department in a medical center holds a tenure-track appointment, with responsibilities for research, teaching, and service. Such appointments are re- garded as the most desirable and stable types of academic appointments because the institutionassumes some obligation for salary and other types of support. However, in some departments,there may be faculty appointments that are not on the tenure track. For these individuals, the pri-mary responsibility is research, with limited responsibilities in teaching and service. In this case, thefaculty member may be entirely responsible for raising funds for his or her salary and for all otherexpenses needed for scientific research. Such appointments are generally given for a limited period,subject to renewal at the discretion of the department chair. Types of faculty appointments in clinical departments, such as medicine, pediatrics, or pathology, have evolved during the past few years.These are now commonly divided into three types ofappointments: (traditional) tenure track, medical-clinical track, and clinician-educator track.The lat- ter two types of appointments generally are not tenure based. Most senior, established faculty in aclinical department will hold tenure-track appointments that include research responsibilities inaddition to patient care and teaching.These are regarded as the most desirable because they offerthe greatest protected time for research (often 70 percent or more). Medical-clinical and clinician-educator appointments are being made in increasing numbers.Their main benefit is job flexibility, but it's at the expense of tenure. Clinical departments that provideextensive and high-volume clinical services may appoint faculty to a medical-clinical position thatincludes both patient care and research in various proportions. Research time is often limited to 30to 50 percent, and the remaining time is dedicated to clinical service.Typically, the research isexpected to be translational in focus, either through administering core laboratories or managingresearch activities as a component of larger collaborative grants awarded to tenure-track investiga- tors.Advancement is based on research or clinical productivity. If extramural research funding isnot available, there is often room to negotiate increases in clinical service work in lieu of research.The clinician-educator track focuses on the teaching of medical students and residents and per-forming clinical care.As such, there is little expectation of research activity. Salaries and benefits for both medical-clinical and clinician-educator appointments are generally provided by the departmentthrough income from clinical services. Pure research-based nontenured appointments may also be made in clinical departments for faculty who are engaged in basic or clinical research.The expectation is that these individuals will be ableto raise their own salary and laboratory support through research grant or contract funding.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 22BWF/rhombus6HHMIThe Review Process The review processes for promotion from assistant to associate professor and tenure are intertwined.T enure review entails a series of yes-or-no decisions by committeesestablished at the department, school, college, and campus or university levels.Thedecision of the university-wide committee must be ratified by the president orprovost of the university and governing board of the institution. Universities vary as to whether the tenure process is open or closed\u2014that is, whether you and anyone else will have access to the file containing the evidence for tenure and the record of the committees' deliberations. Regardless, a candidate usually has anopportunity to appeal a negative decision. The process unfolds roughly as follows: /rhombus6 During your second or third year of employment, your department chair cre- ates your promotion and tenure dossier (see below for details about what it should contain). /rhombus6 Before the end of your third year, the tenured faculty within your department vote on whether to recommend your reappointment for another three years. /rhombus6 After the vote, your department chair meets with you to discuss any prob- lems that may hinder your future prospects. /rhombus6 During your fifth and sixth years, letters are solicited from both internal and external experts in your area and comments are solicited from your current and former trainees. /rhombus6 The tenured faculty in your department review the materials and vote on whether you should receive tenure. /rhombus6 If the department votes in your favor, your tenure dossier goes forward to the college's or university's appointments and promotions committee.Y our department chair goes before this committee to discuss your qualifications. /rhombus6 If this committee's decision is favorable, the package is sent to a university- level ad hoc or standing committee.The package is then sent to the provost and university president (or chancellor) and then on to the governing boardfor final approval.You build a research group by being in the lab as much as pos- sible.The assistant professors who don't get tenure are the oneswho spend all of their time in the office instead of in the lab. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 23Your T enure Dossier You should have the opportunity to contribute to your dossier. It should include the following: /rhombus6 Your personal and professional history\u2014essentially an extended CV detailing your education; academic positions and other professional employment; hon- ors, prizes, and achievements; invited lectures and conference presentations;offices in professional societies; editorships of journals and other learned pub-lications; grants received; and service on study sections /rhombus6 A list of your publications and other creative works /rhombus6 A summary of your teaching activities, including courses you have taught, other contributions to the university's instructional program, the results of stu-dents' evaluations, and your own report of your teaching activities /rhombus6 Details about the work and subsequent placement of graduate students supervised /rhombus6 A description of your internal and external service to the university, your profession, and the public /rhombus6 A statement of your research goals and accomplishments, expressed so that members of a campuswide tenure and promotion committee can appreciate the importance of your work /rhombus6 Letters from outside reviewers, who should be leading experts in your field and aware of your work (you may be asked to suggest several of these scientists) Planning for T enure: What Y ou Can Do Set specific, achievable objectives right at the outset of your career, with timelines that tellyou what you need to accomplish each year. The whole process will seem more manage-able, and you will be able to make realisticcareer decisions based on your progress.Nothing is too trivial. If you were recognized in some way, make sure it appears in your dossier. \u2014T ony Waldrop, University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill'''' Question: What do I need to do every year to help me attain tenure? Answer: Update your CV, network with pro- fessional colleagues, and keep in close touch with your department chair and your mentorsto evaluate your progress. In addition to theseongoing tasks, review your objectives andupdate them if necessary.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 24BWF/rhombus6HHMIYear 1. You should /rhombus6 Set up your lab as soon as possible.Try to remodel your lab space, order equip- ment, and hire technicians before youarrive. If, after you arrive, you encounterproblems, you may need to revise yourtenure schedule. /rhombus6 Learn your institution's ground rules for tenure. /rhombus6 Ask for a faculty mentor if you are not automatically matched with one.Y ou need someone who is effective in helping youwade through department politics and protocol.Y ou may need an unofficialmentor if the official one disappoints you.In this case, be tactful. /rhombus6 Get to work. If appropriate, write up your postdoctoral research and submit it to a journal. /rhombus6 Accept committee responsibilities, but avoid becoming bogged down.Think carefully about the workload of anycommittee you are asked to join.Y oualso need to consider the nature of thework. Some committees may be too politically sensitive to be of much use soearly in your career. (See chapter 6,\"Time Management.\") /rhombus6 Enter the \"grantsmanship\" game.Y ou may want to start by applying for small grants ($5,000 to $25,000) from your own institution or from other sources to test the waters as you begin work onyour major R01 grant submission. Year 2. You should /rhombus6 Try to publish the research you did in your first year. /rhombus6 Apply to NIH or the National Science Foundation for a basic research grant. (See chapter 9,\"Getting Funded.\") Ask your mentor and other colleagues to review your proposal. /rhombus6 Teach with the tenure review process in mind. Have your chair, mentor, and other colleagues observe your teaching. Be sure your students fill out the evaluation forms at the end of each course.Y ou may want to create your own simple essay-type evaluation form for your students as well as the trainees andother personnel who work in your lab.Y ou want their feedback.Designing and Equipping Your New Lab You probably discussed your space and equip- ment needs during your interview and thenegotiation process. Before you move intoyour new laboratory, create a detailed plan for how you intend to work within the space allot-ted to you.This will help you hit the groundrunning once you start your position.The fol-lowing is a list of things you should do: /rhombus6Envision the relationships between the various workstations, preparation areas,and offices. /rhombus6Arrange for and help supervise any renovations. /rhombus6Order equipment and supervise its installation. /rhombus6Acquire any licenses required by regula- tory agencies. /rhombus6Put in place data management systems both for control of laboratory orderingand expenditures and for the documen-tation of your research. A series of online articles,\"The Art of Laboratory Feng Shui,\" at Science 's Next Wave (http://nextwave.sciencemag.org ), will take you through these decisions. Another resource is a series of videos on laboratory safety, pro-duced by the Howard Hughes Medical Instituteand available at no charge from the Institute'sonline catalog ( http://www.hhmi.org ).Chapter 1 Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning for Tenure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 25Year 3. This is the year the tenured faculty will vote on your reappointment.Y ou should have been meeting regularly with your department chair to discuss yourprogress, so you should have a tenure file that will support your reappointment. /rhombus6 Ask if you are on track for tenure. If not, take stock and consider adjusting your career goals at this point. If you are not doing well in a tenure-track position, and if you are a physician and want to stay in academia, this may bethe time to think about moving into a research or clinical track. /rhombus6 Ask your department chair for a checklist of the information to be included in the file. /rhombus6 If your R01 was not funded, resubmit it and have a plan for backup funding. (See chapter 9, \"Getting Funded.\") Years 4, 5, and 6. You should begin to be recognized in your field for your research.The invitations that come your way to participate on panels or to serve on review committees are indications of success. If these opportunities are not occurring, take steps to gain exposure, perhaps by suggesting a session on your subspecialty at anational meeting. (See chapter 10,\"Getting Published and Increasing Y our Visibility.\") You need to address any issues that may hinder your bid for tenure. If you have not obtained funding, this should be your number one priority. Keep up your research,and continue your efforts to get the results into print. Clearly, the road to a tenured faculty position is not an easy one. But if you think strategically\u2014know what you want and need from your job, present yourself andyour research to best advantage to obtain that job, and do what you should do each year to document your productivity\u2014you will be well on your way to achieving your goal.The Challenge for Physician-Scientists If you are a physician, you will probably be expected to spend some time in income-generating patient care. Be sure this requirement does not engulf your research time. If you are serious aboutdoing research, you should negotiate a written promise of a fixed percentage of \"protected researchtime.\" Often, physician-scientists will have 20 to 30 percent of their time for patient care and 70 to80 percent for research. Make sure you understand the true amount of protected research timeyou will receive, because your defined clinical time will not include time for teaching or for adminis- trative duties. There's a positive side to your situation.Y our clinical responsibilities give you an advantage at tenure time because they count as an extra dimension of professional achievement.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 26BWF/rhombus6HHMIRESOURCES Austin, Jim.\"Y ou've Worked Hard to Get This Far.\" Science 's Next Wave (November 22, 2002), http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2002/11/20/3 .

But now, as a tenure-track faculty member, you are entering into a new set of relation-ships with your professional colleagues. Perhaps for the first time,you will have to deal with many of the university's administrative offices to fulfill professional responsibilities apart from those associ-ated with your laboratory research. This chapter provides an overview of the \"typical\" structure of a research university and an academic health center, as well as the resources available to a beginning investigator. It also discusses the professional responsibilities of academic faculty outside the labora-tory, including teaching and service and, in the case of physician-scientists, patient care. ORGANIZATION OF A \"TYPICAL\" UNIVERSITY Although the major goal of U.S. universities is the advance- ment and dissemination of knowledge, universities also need fundingto support their activities.A university must seek revenue from avariety of sources (see figure 2.1), and more and more, faculty mem- bers are encouraged to generate income.Y ou will need to make yourresearch program either self-supporting or demonstrably worth its cost in some other way. Most U.S. research universities have roughly similar organizational and reporting structures.The titles of the executive officials may vary, but their functions are generally the same.The organization of a university'sadministrative staff and its methods of operation reflect a strong tradi-tion of faculty dominance.This chapter is based on a keynote presentation by T ony G. Waldrop, Ph.D., University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management.Additional information was obtained from W. Emmett Barkley, Ph.D., Howard Hughes Medical R.Alta Wisconsin M.D., Medical College of Wisconsin;William R. Galey, Ph.D., HHMI; Carl Rhodes, Ph.D., HHMI; and some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 28BWF/rhombus6HHMIUniversity-Wide Responsibility /rhombus6 Board of trustees or board of regents.The university's highest authority, this governing board is composed of academic, business, and community leaderswho hold appointed or elected positions with specific terms.The board meetsregularly to review all major policy, financial, and management decisions, including decisions about faculty appointments, promotions, and tenure. /rhombus6 President or chancellor.1The university's chief executive officer, this individ- ual has general oversight of the university's academic programs and financial health. He or she is also the university's public spokesperson, dealing with\"big-picture\" issues such as relationships with the legislature and other fund-ing bodies, alumni relations, and fund-raising. /rhombus6 Provost or vice president for academic affairs.As the university's chief academic officer, the provost has programmatic and budgetary oversight over all academicactivities.The provost reviews the appointment papers of new faculty membersand receives reports from the promotion and tenure committee.The deans ofthe various colleges report to the provost for academic-related matters. In someuniversities, vice presidents who are involved with academic affairs (e.g.,research, student affairs) also report to the provost. /rhombus6 Vice president for administration and finance.The university's chief financial officer, this individual is in charge of the fiscal affairs of the university andoften also oversees diverse functions such as facilities planning and construc-tion, human resources, and campus services (e.g., parking, public safety, main-tenance, and mail service). /rhombus6 Vice president for research.The university's chief research officer, this individ- ual oversees grants and contracts, research funding, research centers and insti-tutes, issues relating to technology transfer (patenting and licensing), andresearch-related committees such as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) for human subjects research and institutional animal care and use committees.Figure 2.1. Annual revenue sources at a typical universityGrants and contracts (30%) State appropriations (27%)Sales and services (23%)Tuition fees (10%) (10%) *Includes individual and corporate T ony G. Waldrop, University ofNorth Carolina-Chapel Hill 1. For this discussion,\"president\" is interchangeable with \"chancellor.\" In some state university systems, the president oversees and coordinates the activities of the member universities, and a chancellor headseach university within that system.Chapter 2 The Scientific Investigator Within the University Structure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 29Other vice presidents have responsibility for other areas that may affect the life of a faculty scientist directly or indirectly.These include the following: /rhombus6 Vice president for information technology. This individual oversees the university'scomputer facilities and telephone systems. /rhombus6 Vice president for health sciences.This individual is responsible for the univer-sity's health-related institutions, includingthe medical center and the other healthprofessions schools. (See \"Organization ofa 'T ypical'Academic Health Center,\"page 30.) /rhombus6 Vice president for student affairs.This individual oversees dormitories, recre- ational facilities, and other necessities of student life and is concerned withissues of student well-being. /rhombus6 Vice president for development.This individual manages fund-raising, alumni networks, and university relations. School- or College-Level Responsibility /rhombus6 Dean.All department chairs report to the dean, who is responsible for the administration of a school or college.A university may have several schools orcolleges. Each college may also have an associate or assistant dean or both. /rhombus6 Department chair. Each college is likely to have several departments, and in the sciences, separate scientific programs within each department.The deantypically appoints the department chair, with input from the tenured faculty,for a limited time period.Within that time frame, however, the departmentchair exercises considerable control over the allocation of resources withinthe department, including space, use of support staff, and purchases of equip-ment and supplies.The department chair makes teaching assignments andoversees the evaluation of faculty performance.The departmental promotion and tenure committee makes its recommendations to the department chair,who then presents the recommendation to the university-wide promotionand tenure committee. As a principal investigator, you report to your department chair. If you have an appointment in more than one department, or in a department and in one of theuniversity's separate research centers or institutes, you may have to report to morethan one individual. Each department's interest in your efforts should be spelled outin your offer letter. Usually, the reporting relationship is a matter of \"following themoney\"\u2014where your salary comes from is where your reporting responsibilities lie.(See chapter 1,\"Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position and Planning forTe nu re.\" )Consult the Faculty Handbook Your university's faculty handbook (often avail- able online) is an invaluable resource for learn-ing about the institution's organization andreporting structure, policies and procedures, and resources to support your research.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 30BWF/rhombus6HHMIORGANIZATION OF A \"TYPICAL\" ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTER An academic health center within a university is a complex set of institutions, typically a medical school and hospitals; outpatient centers; and, in many cases,schools of nursing, pharmacy, and other allied health professions. Because much of theteaching conducted under the auspices of the medical school actually takes place inthe hospitals and clinics, these organizations should have agreements or understand-ings in place that allow the faculty to appropriately carry out activities, from teachingto research to the provision of clinical care. Key academic health center officials include the following: /rhombus6 Vice president for health sciences.This individual oversees the entire complex and reports to the president of the university. /rhombus6 Chief executive officer(s) of the hospital(s) and clinics.These individuals are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the hospitals and clinics and report to the vice president for health sciences. Administrative Structure of the School of Medicine The administrative structure of a medical school parallels that of the university in many respects. However, one distinctive feature is that the school is composed ofclinical and basic science departments. Medical school officials include the following: /rhombus6 Dean.The dean's functions are similar to those of the dean of any other uni- versity college; the only exception is that he or she may also serve as vice president for health sciences. On administrative matters (e.g., procurement),the dean of the medical school may report to the vice president for healthsciences. On academic and faculty matters, the dean reports to the provost.The medical school often also has associate and assistant deans with specificareas of responsibility. /rhombus6 Department chairs.As elsewhere in the university, the chair is the administra- tive head of the department. /rhombus6 Division chiefs. Frequently, large clinical departments in a medical school are grouped into divisions. In such cases, a scientist may be a division chief who, in turn, reports to a department chair. If your appointment is in a basic science department, you report to the department chair; if your appointment is in a large clinical department, you usually report to thedivision chief. It is not uncommon for an investigator to hold a primary appointmentin a clinical department and a secondary appointment in a basic science departmentor vice versa. In this case, the investigator reports to the department in which the pri-mary appointment resides.Chapter 2 The Scientific Investigator Within the University Structure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 31PEOPLE YOU SHOULD GET TO KNOW As a beginning investigator, you will want to quickly learn which individuals can affect your career progress.Y ou will want to find out which department chairsand division chiefs should be aware of your work because it is relevant to their ownresearch agendas.Y ou will certainly want to meet the full professors within your own department or division. If you are a clinical investigator, you should also get to knowthe influential senior physicians; if they like you and appreciate your contributions,they may support your research aspirations. It's also a good idea to get acquainted with faculty in your own department and in other departments whose research interests are complementary to your own.Y ou mayfind colleagues with whom a research collaboration is possible.T eaming up withother faculty scientists in a research project of mutual interest can pay all sorts of divi-dends for you and your laboratory group.These faculty members will have a goodunderstanding of any health and safety risks associated with your research, and theycan advise you about the policies of the university and safe procedures for controllingresearch risks. You should also be sure to get to know your departmental business manager and the other administrators in your department or division.These individuals are generallyvery experienced in dealing with matters such as requesting maintenance, purchasing, tracking grant expenditures, and a host of other matters that you will not have timeto deal with in detail. Creating an effective working relationship with your depart-mental administrators will pay off many times over.These individuals will also bevaluable in preserving stability when inevitable changes such as the retirement of a chair or division chief take place. FACULTY GOVERNING BODIES AND COMMITTEES Faculty Senate A representative body of faculty members, sometimes called the faculty senate, serves as the principal channel of communication between faculty and university adminis-tration.The faculty senate may elect a smaller executive committee to implement itsactions. It can make policy recommendations to the university president and appointfaculty to serve on university committees as well as faculty senate committees.The senate weighs in on the appointment of academic officials and on performancereviews of these officials. It meets regularly during the year. University Committees The faculty accomplishes its work through an array of standing and ad hoc commit- tees.The names of committees and their mandates vary among universities, but repre-sentative types of standing committees include the following: /rhombus6 Promotion and T enure. Reviews recommendations for faculty promotion and tenure as well as policies and procedures in these areas. /rhombus6 Admissions. Establishes admissions requirements./rhombus6 Academic Requirements. Establishes grading systems and graduation requirements. /rhombus6 Curricula.Approves new curricula and reviews existing ones. /rhombus6 Information T echnology. Makes recommendations regarding faculty comput- ing needs and concerns. /rhombus6 Faculty and Staff Benefits. Makes recommendations on health and life insur- ance, leave, and retirement. /rhombus6 Ethics. Establishes guidelines for appropriate conduct of research. Reviews cases of unethical conduct by faculty. /rhombus6 Human Subjects Research. Establishes policies for the ethical treatment of human research subjects and ensures compliance with federal regulations. /rhombus6 Long-Range Planning. Develops a long-range plan for the university. /rhombus6 Research. Establishes policies to promote research and distributes university research funds. /rhombus6 Radiation, Biological, and Chemical Safety. Establishes procedures to carry out institutional policies for complying with regulations governing the use of hazardous materials in research. /rhombus6 Use and Care of Animals. Establishes policies for the humane treatment of animals used in research and ensures compliance with federal regulations. The meeting schedules and workloads of these committees vary considerably. Generally speaking, committees that have responsibility for case-by-case review ofindividual applications or projects are the most labor-intensive. However, the work-load of a policy committee may suddenly expand when it finds itself dealing with a\"hot\" issue. (Further discussion of a principal investigator's priorities with respect tocommittee work can be found in the section \"Responsibilities Beyond theLaboratory,\" page 35.) Departmental committees can include standing committees (such as those responsible for departmental courses and curricula, admission of graduate students, and selectionof residents and fellows) as well as committees created in response to a particular need(such as the recruitment of a new faculty member). SUPPORT FACILITIES AND SERVICES Universities provide considerable support to aid faculty in their research, teach- ing, and public service. Support includes traditional campuswide resources such aslibraries and media centers, scientific or technical services commonly referred to as\"core facilities,\" and administrative offices established to help faculty complete grantapplications and comply with regulatory requirements.As a scientist, you must knowwhat centralized facilities exist to support you. You are probably already familiar with the traditional campuswide resources and core facilities at your institution but may have never dealt with administrative support services. Listed below are several offices that may prove essential to you as you getyour lab off the ground.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 32BWF/rhombus6HHMIChapter 2 The Scientific Investigator Within the University Structure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 33Regulatory Compliance Office Regulatory compliance may be handled by the university-wide office of research or a similar office in your college or by several offices devoted to specific regulatoryissues. Regulatory compliance officers keep track of the licenses and approvals youwill need to comply with federal and state regulations for research.Visit them early tofind out about the following: /rhombus6 Requirements for radiation safety if you intend to use radioactive materials.Y ou may need to attend a training session.Y ou will need to obtain authorization of the Radiation Safety Committee to procure and possess radioactive materials. /rhombus6 Requirements for the possession and use of bloodborne pathogens and other infectious materials and for recombinant DNA research.Y ou may have to register your research with the Institutional Biological Safety Committee or have it approve your research. /rhombus6 Licenses needed for the use of proprietary reagents and materials and approvals for stem cell research. /rhombus6 Approvals for human subjects research.Y our research protocols will need to be reviewed by an IRB. Because these boards typically meet monthly and the review process can be long, find out about the requirements early. /rhombus6 Requirements for carrying out studies on animals.Y ou will need to have any research protocols that involve animals reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. /rhombus6 Requirements for using lasers and chemicals that have a high degree of acute toxicity and for disposing of hazardous chemical waste.Y our institution will have specific protocols and practices to follow for using lasers and handlinghazardous chemicals. Environmental Health and Safety Office Beginning investigators share a responsibility for laboratory safety. It is important that you participate in the health and safety program of your institution by being familiar with the health and safety guidelines that apply to your research.Y ou should makesure the members of your research group know the hazards that may be present inyour laboratory, are trained in safe work habits, and know how to deal with any emergency that may arise.Y our institution's environmental health and safety officeprovides services that can help you with this responsibility.The office typically offerssafety training programs, technical assistance, regulatory compliance assistance, riskassessments, and services to test the integrity of safety equipment. Grants and Contracts Office Staff of this office can tell you about available university financial support and help you apply for it.The grants office is also likely to have a wealth of information about outsidefunding opportunities. In addition, this office can help you ensure that your grant appli-cation is in compliance with university policies and government regulatory requirementsand that it has the necessary institutional approvals.The office can also help you prepareyour proposed budget and provide information about indirect costs the university will claim.

(See chapter 11,\"Understanding T echnologyTransfer.\") Visit the technology transfer office early in your career, keep the staff informed of your research, and let them help you determine whether any discoveriesyou make are worth licensing for commercial development. Procurement Office This office manages purchasing for the university, and you may be required to use it to buy equipment and supplies.The office can negotiate group or bulk discounts. Itsstaff is familiar with the full range of vendors and products and can help you arrangecustom purchases. Staff members are also knowledgeable about regulatory require-ments related to the products they buy.They also keep track of payments and receiptof goods, thereby providing a valuable accounting function for your lab. Human Resources Office The human resources office can answer your questions about your own employee benefits and can help you function well as a supervisor. Before you hire your firsttechnician or other support staff, visit this office to find out your university's rulesand policies concerning employing and terminating staff, on-the-job discrimination,sexual harassment, and performance evaluation of staff. It is very important that youfollow these rules and policies, because they involve matters of federal and state law.In addition, find out whether there is a union at your institution and whether anycollective-bargaining agreements or union-related rules affect your interactions withuniversity staff or students. (See chapter 4,\"Staffing Y our Laboratory.\") Public Relations Office The public relations office keeps the world outside informed of the achievements of the university and its scholars. Its staff maintains contact with the news media and canhelp you prepare for an interview, translate your findings into \"sound bites,\" and learnhow to field questions comfortably. RESPONSIBILITIES BEYOND THE LABORATORY Your roles as a faculty member form a triad of research, teaching, and service. As a scientist at a major university, you will focus principally on research. However,teaching and directing the research of students and postdocs will also be importantand gratifying aspects of your activities.Y our service responsibility to the universitywill occur mostly through service on committees.This, too, can be personally andprofessionally rewarding. If you are a physician, you may also serve the universitythrough your patient-care activities. Teaching As a new faculty member, you may find juggling your teaching and research responsi- bilities to be a bit overwhelming at first. It's a good idea to remind yourself of the valueof what you are doing\u2014conveying knowledge and an appreciation of science to youngpeople and possibly inspiring some of your stu- dents to pursue their own science careers. To have time to get your laboratory opera- tions under way, you may wish to negotiate alighter teaching load during your first year asa faculty member. Other circumstances mayalso make it necessary to reduce your teachingload, for example, if your department hasgiven you a heavy responsibility in another area or if you have family or personal prob-lems.Talk to your department head about theoptions that may be available to you. No matter when your teaching duties begin, take the time to prepare for them.Work up your lectures, take any \"how to teach\" courses that are offered on campus, and, ifyou can, sit in on your colleagues' lectures. Also bear in mind that teaching gives you an opportunity to meet students who in the long run may be interested in research in your laboratory.At many schools,younger faculty members often vie with senior faculty for the opportunity to teach courses to \"undeclared\" graduate students. Learning how to teach effectively meansthat you may have more opportunities to interact with undergraduate or graduatestudents in your department and in others. (For a discussion of balancing teachingand research responsibilities, see chapter 6,\"Time Management.\") Committee Work You will be expected to participate in one or more committees, and your contribu- tions will be evaluated as a component of your service requirement for tenure.Although you should take this responsibility seriously, you also need to be judiciousin your choice of assignments. Some committees\u2014especially those that review indi-vidual research protocols or applications (e.g., IRBs for human subjects research orMaking the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 36BWF/rhombus6HHMIResources: How to T each Brinkley,Alan, et al.

At the same time I was building my research group, I was also teaching. It took about 10 years before I found real joyin teaching. But even in the very early years, I noticed thatteaching was a tremendous stabilizing feature for my life\u2014very unlike research, which can be discouraging.With research, there are times when you feel as though you've lost groundand you know less than you did the week before.Whereasteaching is much more steady\u2014you put in a certain numberof hours of work and something good comes of it. So, I thinkthe combination of a teaching and a research career is a niceone in that teaching can fill out the dips that are the normalpart of doing research. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Chapter 2 The Scientific Investigator Within the University Structure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 37admissions committees)\u2014are very labor-intensive. Others may deal with politically sensitive matters that may be difficult for a new professor. For example, you mightnot want to be on a curriculum committee if a controversial restructuring is underway and your department has a stake in the outcome. Such an assignment would be best left to a more senior colleague. Other committees may deal with matters irrelevant to your concerns as a scientist. So, before you accept a committee assignment, ask for a detailed description of whatwill be expected of you in terms of time commitment and the nature of the deci-sions to be made. Many committees, however, do give you a decent return on your time investment.Serving on a faculty search committee maygive you a voice in deciding who a new col- league will be.Y ou might also want to be on acommittee that puts together a seminar pro-gram or scientific meeting.This will give you a chance to invite your former colleagues,leaders in your field, and new people withwhom you may want to network.Work on anadmissions committee for graduate students might be worthwhile because it will introduce you to graduate students who couldwork in your lab. However, work on committees responsible for the admission of medical students can be intensive and time-consuming, and the chances of significantfuture interactions with medical students (except M.D./Ph.D. students) are less. A good strategy is to try to get on a committee where your expertise will be useful but where you will not be overburdened. Many department chairs are interested in having junior faculty (especially women or members of groups underrepresented inscience) serve on committees, and they can help you evaluate opportunities to add toyour committee portfolio.At the assistant professor level, you are expected to be setting up your research program and keeping your head down. Beingon a high-profile committee can bring you quick visibility, butit can also make you powerful enemies. \u2014Milton Datta, Medical College of Wisconsin '''' Resource: Committee Work Smelser, Neil.

Some of them are discussed here. Straddling the Worlds of Research and Patient Care As a physician-scientist, you can be active in defining your role by pointing out the value you bring to the department beyond billable hours, such as a scientific perspec- tive on patient care and important training and mentorship opportunities for studentsand residents. In fact, the federal funding agencies consider physician-scientists to becrucial to the translational science involved in moving from the map of the humangenome to strategies for diagnosis and treatment of disease. You can increase your visibility and security by doing the following: /rhombus6 Creating allies who will stand up and protect you. Cultivate a few people in your field who think you're terrific. /rhombus6 Making yourself essential by providing an important clinical skill or filling a crucial clinical need. Other clinicians who know your worth can become your advocates and help protect your interests.Advocates need not be in your owndepartment, but they should rely on you and your expertise. /rhombus6 Getting the word out that you're doing something.Actively communicate progress on your research with people who matter in your department or division. Complying with Guidelines for Human Subjects Protection If your research makes use of human subjects, you must meet the requirements of the IRB with respect to protection of patients' rights and well-being.Y our research mustbe designed to be compatible with the IRB guidelines. In addition, you must obtainand document patient consent, comply with rules for protecting the privacy ofpatient information, and obtain the IRB's approval before you begin your research.On the clinical side, it comes down to billable time\u2014the clini- cal hours you work.The physician-scientist must find a depart-ment chair who's supportive of his research and communicatesthis to others in the department and institution. \u2014Milton Datta, Medical College of Wisconsin'''' 38BWF/rhombus6HHMIYou may be required to maintain data on your research processes and outcomes for the IRB's inspection.All of this may slow your progress, but failure to comply can shutdown your research program. Because obtaining IRB approval can take a long time,find out whether it is possible to apply before you begin your faculty appointment. THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD As a university-based scientist, you owe allegiance to several constituencies: to the university that supports you, to your profession, and to the general public thatstands to benefit from your research. It is absolutely necessary, and possible, to keepthese loyalties in harmony. To keep your outside activities appropriate, you need to be aware of the university's rules and expectations with regard to /rhombus6 Service in professional associations /rhombus6 Conflict of interest and conflict of commitment, including limits on consult- ing activities /rhombus6 Relationships with the news media and with government and political agencies Consulting As your career develops, you may find opportunities to consult with commercial entities such as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Both you and yourhome institution stand to benefit from relationships that extend your reputation, addto your knowledge and skills, and may result in practical applications of your discov-eries. In addition, you may welcome the added income. Remember, however, that theuniversity, as your employer, has primary claim on your labor and allegiance. Many universities have developed explicit guidelines limiting the extent of a faculty member's work with other parties. It is critical that you know your institution's poli-cies regarding your work outside the scope of university employment and your rela-tionships with outside parties.Y our institution should have a clear set of guidelines forthese types of activities, and you may be required to report on them regularly.(Additional information on consulting can be found in chapter 11,\"UnderstandingTechnology Transfer.\") Public Service An academic appointment carries with it a public service obligation.As your career pro- gresses, you may be called on to participate on commissions or testify before government bodies on the meaning of your work or on its ethical or public policy implications. Treat these invitations as a serious responsibility and, as you would with contacts with the press, stay close to the university public relations office. Remember, anything yousay in public will reflect on your institution. It is easy to be misunderstood or quotedout of context. You may also have opportunities to participate in public education\u2014at science fairs, high school assemblies, or other community events.These opportunities can be bothenjoyable and rewarding.Chapter 2 The Scientific Investigator Within the University Structure BWF/rhombus6HHMI 39Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 40BWF/rhombus6HHMIRESOURCES Barker, Kathy.

In addition to being a manager, you are also the leader of your lab\u2014 guiding your staff toward a shared mission of what you want the labto achieve and motivating each person to make that mission a reality.This chapter discusses some of the elements of lab leadership\u2014defining your lab's mission and goals, setting expectations for your-self and the people in your lab, and communicating those expecta-tions effectively. CRAFTING A MISSION STATEMENT FOR THE LAB The first requirement for guiding the people in your lab is to motivate them with the big picture of your vision for the lab and toarticulate goals that will lead to achieving that vision. In her book At the Helm:A Laboratory Navigator ,Kathy Barker advises writing down a few sentences that summarize the mission or the goals foryour lab.This mission statement describes the kind of research you want to do, the motivation for your research, and the kind of atmo- sphere in which you want to work. Keep in mind the following points: /rhombus6 Decide what values you want for your lab (e.g., scientific excellence, discipline, teamwork, competition) and then craft a mission statement that reflects these values.A workshop on laboratory leader- ship was conducted during the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management. It consisted of theo- retical presentations, with examples extracted from interviews with model laboratory leaders, and interactive exercises.The workshop was organized by Martin Ionescu- Pioggia, Ph.D., Burroughs Wellcome Fund. It was developed and led by Christine Harris, Ed.D., executive coach and management consultant, and Joan C. King, Ph.D.,T ufts University School of Medicine, and principal, Beyond Success.The infor- mation in this chapter is based on interviews by Dr. Harris and Dr. King with the following six model lab leaders: Gail H. Cassell, Ph.D., Eli Lilly and Company;Thomas R. Cech, Ph.D., Howard Hughes Medical Institute;Tamara L. School of Medicine; B. Finlay, University of British Columbia; Charles E. Murry, M.D., Ph.D., University of Washington School of Medicine; and Suzanne Pfeffer, Ph.D., Stanford University School of Medicine. Additional information was obtained from some of the resources in this chap- ter. Copyright restrictions prevent the inclusion in this manual of the theoretical content and materials presented in the workshop.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 42BWF/rhombus6HHMI/rhombus6 When developing your mission statement, consider not only your scientific life but also your social and financial goals. /rhombus6 Craft a statement that you feel comfortable communicating to your peers, superiors, and lab members. Once you have a mission statement that embodies your aspirations, you can start to plan the steps to get there. Kathy Barker suggests developing a five-year plan thattakes into account your career goals (e.g., do you want to achieve tenure in fiveyears?), your scientific goals (e.g., do you want to enter a more competitive area of research?), your social goals (e.g., do you want to start a family?), your financial goals (e.g., do you want to perform some consulting to supplement your salary?), and thelab culture you are after.What are my values? I want to do really good rigorous science and I want to publish that work in respected places. I am alsoexcited about the topic we work on, that it is a disease-causingorganism and that we have the overall goal of trying to curethis disease. It is really important to me that lab memberslearn and advance their careers\u2014that people enjoy what theydo and take it seriously, work hard, and are good lab citizens. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine Our mission here is to train students and postdoctoral fellows to be outstanding scientists.Although our success as facultymembers depends on our discoveries and our papers, you aregoing to be the most successful if you focus on helping your labmembers develop their full potential. \u2014Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University School of Medicine If I were asked to summarize my vision for my lab, it would be respect for each individual's expertise and contribution,emphasis on integrity and accurate record keeping and report-ing of results, and being a good team player. \u2014Gail Cassell, Eli Lilly and Company ''''Chapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 43The last point is perhaps the most complex. Lab culture refers to a system of informal rules that spell out how people in the lab should behave.Y ou should ask yourself these questions: /rhombus6 How much time do I want to spend at the bench? /rhombus6 Do I want a big or small lab? /rhombus6 How friendly do I want to be with people in the lab? /rhombus6 What kind of atmosphere do I want in the lab? Take a few moments to think about the kind of lab described in your mission statement. Every decision you make from now on\u2014from hiring staff to choosingscientific projects for the people in the lab to establishing how communicationflows\u2014should be made with this statement in mind.My vision is that we are going to regenerate the heart after a heart attack.This is really what I would like to accomplishwith my career. Initially, I was worried that I would sound\"sappy\" in some fashion when I told people that I had avision. I found that at first people may think it's a little odd,but pretty soon when they hear it again and again, you start seeing people nodding their heads and agreeing with you.Having a clearly stated vision does help to inspire in peoplethe mission behind what you are working on. \u2014Charles Murry, University of Washington School of Medicine Starting your own lab is a lot like getting your driver's license: It's an exhilarating time. Now you have the freedom to gowhere you want to go and go as fast as you want to go. Onthe other hand, you have to pay for the gas.You're not just apassenger anymore\u2014you have responsibilities. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 44BWF/rhombus6HHMISETTING EXPECTATIONS FOR YOURSELF After you develop your mission statement, the next step is to understand your responsibilities as the leader of your lab and set your expectations for yourself accordingly. Your Responsibilities as a Lab Leader A principal investigator has five key leadership responsibilities: Setting the general sci- entific direction for the lab, keeping each person motivated, resolving conflicts, settingand communicating expectations, and mentoring and training the next generation ofscientists. (The role of the lab leader in mentoring is discussed in chapter 5,\"Men-toring and Being Mentored.\") Setting the general scientific direction for the lab. As the principal investigator, your role is to ensure that research projects are in alignment with your vision for the lab.Y ou need to determine what the lab should work on and what directions thework should take.Work with your lab members to develop specific scientific goals for each of them.Y ou should support people in developing projects that match their abil-ities and aspirations.Y ou are also the one who needs to determine when it is time toterminate a project. My role is setting the general direction and motivating people. I'm in charge of making sure that the lab runs as smoothly asit reasonably can in terms of ensuring that there's money andsupport staff, and then steering the lab. \u2014Charles Murry, University of Washington School of Medicine I decide the area in which we're going to work, but I let others have input into where within that area we should go. Forexample, at our lab retreat, I tell everyone not to talk aboutwhat they've done but instead to talk about where their proj-ects are going to be in six months, a year, two years.When weplan general lab strategy, we ask the questions Where in thefield should we be heading? What kind of people or expertiseshould we be recruiting? I direct the discussion and have theultimate veto power, but I find people are much more motivat-ed if they feel that they've had input into where the lab isgoing. It is also very good training for them because eventually,if they become PIs, they're going to have to decide these kindsof things themselves. \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia''''Chapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 45Keeping each person motivated. One of your key roles is to motivate people to work hard toward achieving your shared vision.While different people respond to different types of internal and external motivation, most people are motivated whentheir contributions to the laboratory are recognized and appreciated.This can beaccomplished by involving them in discussions about general scientific strategy, listen-ing to their ideas, and giving serious thought to anything they say even if it seems alittle impractical or naive. Another good way to keep lab members motivated is to schedule individual meetings as often as once a week. Each meeting can also serve the purpose of setting deadlines,discussing completed or in-progress experiments, solving problems, and planningfuture experiments.I think the mistake a lot of us make is to assume all too often that individuals don't have any contribution to make, just sim-ply because it might be a minor contribution. I think gainingan appreciation of what everyone brings to the table isextremely important. \u2014Gail Cassell, Eli Lilly and Company When people present a really good result at a lab meeting, I'll say,\"That seems like a pizza result,\" and I'll buy pizza for thelab in their honor. Sometimes it's by way of appreciation ratherthan an important result. If someone\u2014say a junior technician\u2014gets stuck in a cloning project for a long time and then gets theconstruct he's been trying to make, that's a pizza result. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine'''' I do half-hour meetings with each person once a week. If they come in and say,\"Nothing worked,\" I say,\"OK,\" and changethe subject because I realize that probably 90 percent of theexperiments as a scientist don't work. I've found that thisapproach is a very subtle but effective motivator. Most peopledon't want to come into my office week after week and say,\"Nothing worked.\" \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 46BWF/rhombus6HHMIIt is important to listen to what each person wants to do and understand what his or her goals may be. If a postdoc has decided to pursue a career in industry, trying tomotivate him or her to follow in your footsteps into academia will not work.As a lableader, you need to simultaneously address your lab members' individual goals whileworking together to realize your shared vision. Finally, enthusiasm is a great motivator. If the work you are doing may someday save human lives, talk about this vision to your lab members\u2014share your enthusiasm.Soon they will follow your lead. Recognizing low morale. A lack of motivation may manifest itself as a decrease in productivity. For example, someone who was productive will stop producing resultsconsistently week after week.Y ou will first need to determine the cause for thisdecrease. Is it an interpersonal problem in the lab, an experimental obstacle, or a per-sonal crisis? Discuss the problem with the lab member and see whether you canjointly develop a strategy to address the issue or minimize the impact of the labmember's actions.Whatever you do, do not avoid the problem. Resolving conflicts. Don't ignore conflict in the lab in the hope that it will disap- pear on its own. Deal with conflict as soon as you become aware of it. If you let aproblem fester, it can adversely affect lab morale and productivity.Take the time tomeet with each person individually and hear all sides of the story before doing any-thing.Then bring together all the people involved for an open discussion, which youas the lab leader should moderate.The desired outcome is a mutually agreeable strate-gy that will resolve the conflict. Conflicts often arise over \"turf wars,\" when two individuals are interested in the same project. By staying on top of what each member of your lab is doing, you canIt's important to me that people get the training that they want and have their career going the way they want it, rather than go by any preconceived notions I have. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine'''' I wanted to be in science and medicine since I was a kid. I could not imagine a profession that fits me better. It is usefulto let people know I am doing what I always wanted.Thingstrickle down from that. \u2014Charles Murry, University of Washington School of Medicine''''often spot potential problems and deal with them before they become too serious. For example, if you perceive that two projects in the lab are starting to merge or overlap, call a strategy meeting and re-prioritize the activities for each person involved in the projects. Setting and communicating expectations. Expectations for each member of your lab will stem from your mission statement and should include scientific, person- al, and ethical considerations.Y our lab members need to understand your expectationsand consent to fulfill them. If you value teamwork, you will stress collaborative andcollegial interactions among lab members. If you value primacy in your field above allelse, you will probably expect long hours of work and high productivity.This aspectof lab leadership is discussed more in \"Setting Expectations and CommunicatingThem to Others,\" page 48. Developing a Leadership Style That Suits Y our Personality The expectations you set for yourself will be based, in part, on your personal leader- ship style. Developing your style as a leader is a process of trial and error and mayprove difficult at first. It will be shaped by your vision for your lab as well as by yourpersonal strengths and weaknesses. It will also be shaped by your past experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014in other labs.As new people join your lab, you may find that differentdimensions of your style emerge. Assess Y our Strengths and Weaknesses According to Denise Harmening in her book Laboratory Management: Principles and Processes ,the attributes of a good lab leader are /rhombus6 Character: Having authenticity and purpose; creating value, trust, and com- passion. /rhombus6 Integrity: Possessing sincerity and honesty. /rhombus6 Vision: Being able to see the big picture. /rhombus6 Passion: Having great enthusiasm for the job. /rhombus6 Credibility: Having excellent credentials, substantive knowledge, and practical experience. /rhombus6 Empowerment: Being able to delegate responsibility to others when possible.Chapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 47When you begin a lab, difficult issues are going to arise, and you'll talk to your colleagues and ask them for guidance.You will try different approaches and see what works. It's very chal-lenging, but it does get easier with time. \u2014Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University School of Medicine''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 48BWF/rhombus6HHMI/rhombus6 Courage: Being able to create a new vision and take risks. /rhombus6 Insight: Having the ability to understand people and the organization. /rhombus6 Humility: Being willing to admit that others have good ideas and accepting that you can be wrong. /rhombus6 Sense of humor . /rhombus6 Emotional intelligence: Having self-awareness, social awareness, and social skills. /rhombus6 Positive self-esteem: Being able to work selflessly to support people in your lab. Think about which of these attributes you possess and work with them.Y ou may devel- op new skills as you gain experience, but initially, you should rely on your strengths. SETTING EXPECTATIONS AND COMMUNICATING THEM TO OTHERS Akey aspect of your role as a lab leader is to set and effectively convey expectations that reflect your vision for the lab. Some expectations may apply to aparticular group of lab members (e.g., postdocs), and others will be unique to eachindividual.Y ou may want to work with your lab members to set these expecta-tions\u2014this can increase the likelihood of buy-in and help increase motivation.Below are some general areas that you will want to consider when setting expecta-tions for people in your lab. Work Hours Generally, your work hours set the pace in the lab.The members of your lab are watching to see how hard you work and the number of hours you put in. So, if you don't come back to the lab or work from home at night, you shouldn't expect peoplein your lab to work at night. If you never show up in the lab on weekends, youshouldn't expect them to be there. Many principal investigators may feel they should stipulate a specific number of hours perweek that they expect grad students or post- docs to work. But that strategy does not neces-sarily work well and can generate resentment. Focusing on productivity will prove more successful than focusing on the number ofhours or on the specific hours an individualworks. Nevertheless, you will probably want your lab members to be in the lab during certain hours\u2014to make sure that they caninteract with you and the other lab members.Should this be the case, make sure youexplain your rationale.Question: How do I avoid potential misunder- standings among lab members regarding workhours and time off? Answer: The best way to handle this is to convey your expectations about work hoursand time off to applicants during the interview.For example, the amount of vacation leave varies from country to country (e.g., it is usual-ly longer in Europe than in the United States), so you should let applicants know about yourinstitution's policies.Chapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 49Prolonged Absences Communicate your expectation that lab members should give you several weeks' notice about an upcoming vacation. Inform them of the vacation and personal leavelimits at your institution.Y our institution will also have guidelines about maternityand paternity leave. It is best to follow these guidelines rigorously. Authorship of Papers The inclusion and order of authors on a paper is often a source of discord. In decid- ing who should be an author on a paper, the principal investigator has to considerwho has contributed to what aspect of the work.All lab members who are involvedin a particular project should express their expectations concerning authorship creditson the resulting paper and provide their rationale for being considered as an author. Here are some guidelines to consider: /rhombus6 The first author is normally the individual who is primarily responsible for the project. Occasionally, two individuals may share that responsibility. Most journals permit a statement that indicates that the first two or three authors listed haveeach contributed equally to the publication.Some labs get a bad reputation when PIs say,\"We expect you to be here every Saturday and never take vacations\" or some-thing similar. I think what you want to do is set an exampleand help your people find how to be most effective. It is pos-sible to work regular hours, but one has to be very organizedabout it. I have had very efficient people who can be very pro-ductive working nine to five and just use their time well. Ihave also had other people who don't use their time well, andso I try to work with each lab member to help them figure outwhat works best. \u2014Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University School of Medicine'''' I have included a student on a paper because he had a concep- tual contribution without which the whole study could nothave been done.There was no question, everybody wanted thisperson on the paper\u2014so an author doesn't have to contributean actual figure if they've contributed something that wasessential for that project to go forward. \u2014Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University School of Medicine''''/rhombus6 It is unwise to make up-front promises about authorship.Y ou may choose to make it a policy in your lab to wait until you know how much each person has actually contributed before authorship is assigned. /rhombus6 In deciding whether to include someone as an author, ask,\"Could this project have been done without this person's conceptual or technical contribution?\" Scientific Ethics The best way to communicate ethics to your lab is to live by those ethics.Y ou may also want to talk about some important ethical issues (e.g., scientific rigor and repro-ducible and discrepant results) in a lab meeting or in a more informal setting. Manyuniversities offer lectures or seminars in scientific ethics, and you should encourageyour staff to attend.An introduction to the ethical conduct of research is a report from the Institute of Medicine, Integrity in Scientific Research: Creating an Environment that Promotes Responsible Conduct ,which is available from National Academies Press at http://www.nap.edu . Staying Within Budget Developing a budget for the lab and staying within the budget is something for which you, as a principal investigator, will ultimately be responsible. But it's a goodidea to remind lab members that the amount of funds available to your lab is limitedand to teach them to be careful when ordering supplies. In addition, involving yourpostdocs in budgeting will help them prepare for their future roles as principal inves-tigators. (Also see \"A Bit About Budgets,\" page 145 in chapter 9,\"Getting Funded.\") Project Ownership The principal investigator, with input from individual members, usually decides what projects people in the lab work on. Some labs have strategy discussions every three tofour months during which everyone talks about what projects they would like tocontinue or initiate. Work in the lab is most effective and productive when members have clearly defined projects that are sufficiently distinct so that each person can carry out some inde-pendent work, and at the same time the projects are interrelated so that no one isMaking the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 50BWF/rhombus6HHMII give a \"state of the lab\" talk once a year. I start with review- ing the accomplishments, the things that have gone well overthe last year. I try to point out things that everyone has doneso that there is a sense that everyone has been recognized fortheir part.Then I go over the lab budget\u2014what our \"burnrate\" is, where our money is coming from\u2014and talk a little bit about money management issues and strategies. \u2014Charles Murry, University of Washington School of Medicine''''working in a vacuum.This way, everyone in the lab can consult with and motivate each other. Below are some guidelines: /rhombus6 Encourage collaboration.Y ou should conduct regular discussions to make sure everyone knows what their individual goals are and to determine how people can help each other make the best progress.An added benefit of acollaborative lab is the increased exchange of information and skills amonglab members. /rhombus6 Allow for independent work styles.Working separately may be a necessity for some people at some stages of their scientific development and in the longrun will enable aspiring scientists to begin to think for themselves. /rhombus6 Discourage competition in the lab.There is enough competition in the world of science outside your lab; encourage your group to think of themselves asmembers of a team.Y ou want people to be comfortable sharing ideas andhelping one another.Chapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 51I often encourage people to collaborate or help each other with techniques. So if someone has an idea, I'll say,\"Why don'tyou go to so and so, she has been thinking about that or knows how to use that machine.Why don't you talk to her?\"And I try to make it reciprocal as much as I can. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine'''' Competition happens all the time. I will tell the more aggres- sive person that I appreciate that they are very ambitious andthat they want to be successful but that they are really edgingover onto someone else's territory. I'll say,\"Don't you have somany projects of your own? You should stay away from thisperson's project.\" Or I'll try to let them know that they areperceived in the laboratory as being aggressive and ask them,\"Do you really want that reputation?\"To the person who isbeing encroached upon\u2014these are rarely competitions betweenequals\u2014I'll say,\"I've really been impressed by the way you'veput up with this; I think you've handled this very professional-ly.I know that it's been tough, but I've talked with the other person and I hope things will get better. If they don't, I'd likeyou to come talk with me and I'll give it another round.\" I also point out to people that ambition is not all that bad. It isone of the characteristics of a successful scientist. \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia''''Policy on Letting Projects Leave the Lab You should develop a clear policy concerning whether or not you will allow post- docs to take their projects with them when they leave your lab. Communicate thispolicy to all prospective postdocs. Some principal investigators let their postdocs takewhatever they had worked on during their stay in their labs, with no strings attached.Others will let postdocs take their projects or some aspects of them to serve as thefocus for their new labs. In these cases, the principal investigator makes sure that heor she does not compete directly with the former postdoc's project for a few years,until the postdoc's lab is well established. When you develop your policy, think about how you would want to handle a situa- tion in which the research results are different from what you anticipated or a situa-tion in which the results lead to interesting new avenues of research. If you have a small research group and a focused area of research, you may not be able to let departing postdocs take their projects with them. In this case, you mighthave to develop some alternatives to benefit them. One possibility is to give yourpostdocs six months of salary and resources to generate preliminary data for a newresearch question or direction. Communicating Expectations Effectively The best way to communicate expectations is to convey them continually\u2014at the first interview, on the first day on the job, at lunch time, during lab meetings, and,most importantly, by setting an example. It's also a good idea to communicate yourexpectations in writing, especially for new lab members and when conducting staffreviews, and to periodically review them with your staff.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 52BWF/rhombus6HHMII personally think it's unfair to say to someone who has slaved away in your lab for three years and goes looking for a job,\"You can't continue what you've been working on,\" becausethen that person won't be able to get a grant. \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia'''' The head of a lab needs to be generous, and that is hard for junior PIs because you feel like you are just starting andeverything is crucial to the success of your research program. Soit's hard to let postdocs take projects with them. But they needto, and the main thing is to communicate about it. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine''''Set an Example As a general rule, you should live by the expectations you set for your lab members. Show your workers that you enjoy what you are doing. Especially in the early years,be present in the lab, working side by side with them.They will be able to see howyou work and what is important to you. Lab Meetings Regular, formal lab meetings are an organized way to ensure that everyone is kept informed of the lab's activities and results and for you to reiterate your expectationsand values. By all means, hold regular goal-setting and evaluation sessions: an annuallab retreat, periodic lab meetings involving the full staff, weekly or more frequentsmall-group meetings to discuss specific issues, and regularly scheduled one-on-oneadvisory meetings and performance evaluations. More importantly, make sure that theinformal lines of communication are always open.Talk to people in your lab on adaily basis\u2014they should not have to make an appointment to see and talk to you.Informal group activities, held periodically, are also important for building morale andencouraging lab members to think of themselves as part of a team. Research group meetings. Many research groups hold weekly meetings. One or more people in the lab take turns presenting what they've done since they gave theirlast presentations.They give an introduction, share their results and their interpreta-tion, and then discuss what they plan to do next. Comments and suggestions fromChapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 53We have a package that we give people on arrival that tells them what their lab duties are and how the lab is run.Thefaster you can get new lab members to the bench and get them going, the better it will be. \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia '''' There's a strong correlation between a new investigator's on- going presence in the lab and success, promotion, and tenure. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI They don't just walk in the door and I say to them,\"OK, here are my values.\"You have to lead by example, be honest.Integrity has to start at square one. \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 54BWF/rhombus6HHMIthe research team usually follow. In some labs, especially larger ones, a research group meeting is a semiformal presentation with overheads or PowerPoint slides and can bea somewhat intimidating experience, especially for a graduate student. In smaller labs,these meetings may be more informal\u2014for example, each person discusses what heor she did that week.These meetings are much more interactive.Y et even in smallerlabs, it's important to schedule occasional formal presentations so that students andpostdocs can hone their ability to speak about their research. One-on-one meetings. Regardless of the frequency of research group meetings, you should meet often with each lab member to keep current with progress and problems. Invite your students, postdocs, and technicians to come into your officewith their lab notebooks and show you what they've been working on. Many princi-pal investigators meet with lab members for an hour each week.They may meet withthem more frequently immediately after lab members have finished a series of experi-ments or when they notice that a lab member is struggling. Small-group meetings. Some labs also have meetings attended by individuals working on specific projects or with specific techniques.This is where lab members deal with logistics and technical matters, and they hammer out experiments, trying toget different approaches to work. Strategy sessions. Should you decide that your research needs to take a new direc- tion, you may want to call an official strategy session.A strategy session helps thegroup identify the next most important questions and what experiments will answer these questions. Such a meeting also helps the group develop a shared understandingof the lab's direction and clarifies what needs to be done and who is interested inwhat aspects of the new research area. In addition, these meetings help you determinehow potential conflicts and competing interests can be avoided.If a principal investigator has 20 people in the lab and you ask the PI at any moment,\"What is person number 17doing?\" he or she should be able to give you a two-hour talkon this without any preparation.The sine qua non for being agood lab director is having all of this in your head. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI '''' In my lab, there are five or six breakout groups that meet once a week or two, and that works really well. It gives them ateam-building experience. \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia '' ''Journal club meetings. These meetings are an integral part of training new scien- tists and can vary in frequency from weekly to monthly, or as desired.The discussionof a scientific report serves to illustrate how to and how not to construct and test ahypothesis, what constitutes effective analysis, and how to report scientific findings. In addition, a journal club meeting reinforces the idea that reading current papers isessential to keeping up with the field.These meetings also provide an opportunity tocommunicate your values about science and other people's work. Informal group activities. Organizing social occasions to celebrate a major accomplishment\u2014publication of a paper, a job, a grant\u2014is important for promotingyour shared vision of the lab and building morale. In addition, most principal investi- gators agree that it is important that lab members occasionally socialize in a relaxed,nonwork environment. Such get-togethers can help promote team building andenhance communication among lab members.As you are establishing your lab, youmight have to arrange these outings.After a while, they will occur more sponta-neously. Don't feel that you always have to participate, and don't feel offended if youare not invited to all after-hours occasions. Managing Performance Day-to-day feedback. Give your lab members feedback regularly and immediately. Praise their accomplishments, but also let them know right away w hen they are not doing what you expect them to do and that there are consequences for this.Chapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 55We discuss papers and talk about weaknesses, and it makes it clear that we don't want our papers to have those kinds of weaknesses. I think the scientific rigor issues come up as wego along. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine'''' Although I know it's important, I hate letting people know when their behavior does not meet my expectations.When Ifirst opened the lab, I was more uncomfortable with this than Iam now. Basically, I'm quicker to call people on it now. Ifthings are not working and the quality of their work is some-how slipping, or the effort that they are putting in is somewhatslipping, I have an easier time saying,\"This isn't right, youhave to change it now.\" \u2014Charles Murry, University of Washington School of Medicine''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 56BWF/rhombus6HHMIPerformance review. Although regular feedback is important, it does not take the place of a formal review.The performance review meeting is an opportunity for youand members of your lab to clarify your expectations, review their recent accom-plishments, and set performance goals. It is also a good time to talk about their careergoals and how their work in your lab contributes to achieving those goals.Anotherimportant purpose of performance evaluations is to give your lab members an oppor-tunity to give you feedback on your leadership style.Work with your institution'shuman resources department to make sure you conform to your institution's per-formance management process. The specific goal is that we talk about their career develop- ment. I give them a form ahead of time so that they have tothink about their major accomplishments, their goals, newdirections that interest them, and also about their interactionswith me from both sides\u2014how they would like to changewhat they do, and how they would like to change what I do. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine'''' Starting a Research Group in 1978: Are Any of the Lessons Still Relevant? In his keynote address at the BFW-HHMI Course in Scientific Management, HHMI President and Nobel laureate Thomas R. Cech described his entry into biomedical science in the 1970s. \"In 1978, I moved from MIT, where I had completed a two-year postdoc, to the University of Colorado-Boulder, where I had landed a tenure-track assistant professor position. I was given a formerundergraduate teaching lab for my research space, with a formaldehyde-preserved rat still inhabiting one ofthe drawers, and $20,000 in start-up money to equip it. My teaching assignment was 90 lectures per year,often in courses that I had not taken myself. My new colleagues were pleasant, but they rarely engaged inanything that could be called mentoring.The prevailing attitude was to give new faculty an opportunity tosucceed by themselves and come back in seven years to evaluate the results. \"Although clearly many of the pressures and opportunities for new faculty have changed in the past 25 years, many of the challenges I had to meet are the same ones that you are facing now. One of the main challenges concerns the management of people. Over the years, I've had numerous postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates in my laboratory. I've found that it's really important to treat peoplewith respect and to set an example. It's also important to develop a sense of teamwork and identity foryour lab. If you get a good environment built up in your lab and you have more people wanting to comeinto your lab than you have room for\u2014that is a sign of success. So, if I had one piece of advice to give, it'sthat although you've been hired for your scientific skills and research potential, your eventual success willdepend heavily on your ability to guide, lead, and empower others to do their best work. \" Excerpts from Dr. Cech's address can be found at http://www.hhmi.org/labmanagement .Chapter 3 Defining and Implementing Your Mission BWF/rhombus6HHMI 57Appendix 1 shows a sample performance review form courtesy of Dr.Tamara Doering.

(For a discussion of skills needed to manage the people in your lab and motivate them to work productively, see chapter 3, \"Defining and Implementing Y our Mission.\") GETTING STARTED The process for staffing your lab will vary depending on the position you are trying to fill and the extent to which your institu-tion 's human resources (HR) department is involved. Because the hiring process in an academic setting can be protracted and time-consuming, you should involve your department 's administrative staff or your institution 's HR department from the beginning. Know the Difference Between Employees and Students It is important to distinguish between employees and students. Generally, technicians and postdocs are considered to be employeesof your university or research institution.They receive regular wagesand have taxes withheld, and federal and state laws and your institu-tion 's personnel policies apply to their employment. On the other hand, undergraduate and graduate students are just that\u2014students.Although they may receive a stipend for work in your laboratory,their relationship to you in almost all cases is that of learner toteacher, not employee to employer. For the most part, students workin your lab to gain experience and to learn how to do science, notbecause they receive monetary compensation. BWF/rhombus6HHMI 61This chapter is based on informa- tion provided by Joan E. Dubinsky, J.D., and Myra L. Jackson, Human Resources Department, Howard Hughes Medical Institute. It also draws from question-and-answer sessions held during the BWF- HHMI Course on Scientific Management and transcripts of interviews with laboratory lead- ers conducted by Christine Harris, Ed.D., executive coach and management consultant, and Joan C.King, Ph.D.,T ufts University School of Medicine, and principal, Beyond Success, to develop their workshop in basic laboratory leadership skills for the course. Additional information was obtained from Ronald B. Corley, Ph.D., Boston University School of Medicine;T om Misteli, Ph.D., National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health; Klaus R. L. N\u00fcsslein, Ph.D., University of Massachusetts-Amherst; and some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 62BWF/rhombus6HHMIIn addition, employees are \"hired\" and \"fired,\" and students are \"assigned\" to a lab and \"released\" from it.Although this may seem like mere wordplay, the nuances of theserelationships are important because of the legal implications. Avoid Discrimination In the United States, many laws\u2014at the federal, state, and local levels\u2014guide and con- trol how you as the employer 's representative work with other employees, particularly those you supervise.These laws determine many aspects of the employer/employeerelationship. One very important principle to follow is to avoid discrimination on the basis of an individual 's membership in a protected group or an individual 's pro- tected characteristic. Generally, this means that you cannot discriminate in anemployment-related decision (such as interviewing, recruiting, selecting, hiring,training, evaluating, promoting, disciplining, or terminating) on the basis ofsomeone 's race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, marital status, mental or physical disability, or other protected status.Work with HR andwith knowledgeable people in your department to ensure that you follow the lawand your institution 's policies and procedures. Determine Y our Staffing Needs Your decision to take on staff will depend on several factors, such as the provisions of your start-up package, the stability of your external funding sources, the progress of your research, and even your personal preferences about performing various laborato- ry tasks. Established scientists caution new principal investigators against rushing out and hiring people just to fill an empty lab. Before you bring on staff, think carefullyabout the consequences.Will you be able to recruit the caliber of people you need?Can you make the time to train and mentor others? Remember, you need to pre-serve sufficient time and space for your own work at the bench. Often, the first person a new investigator hires is a lab technician.This versatile lab member can help you with time-consuming initial tasks, such as logging in and set-ting up equipment and handling routine tasks that keep your laboratory working.Although your budget may more easily accommodate a junior technician, you mightbenefit more by hiring an experienced technician who can help train other staff asthey come on board. Some experienced technicians can also contribute in substantiveways to your research project.A technician who is familiar with the administrative processes of your institution can also be extremely valuable. Consider bringing a graduate student on board once your lab is running and you have the time to invest in training.Working with your technician and graduate stu-dent can provide you with additional intellectual stimulation, and when each is ableEarly in my career, when I couldn 't attract top postdocs, I put my energy into graduate students and technicians.The graduate students are like raw lumps of clay that have the opportunityto mold themselves into something really great. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Chapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 63to work independently, you should have more time for grant writing and doing experiments. Hire a postdoc when your main project is well under way and you haveenough other projects, so that you can turn one of them over to the postdoc andallow him or her to have a great deal of responsibility. You may want to be cautious about taking on undergraduates because of the large time investment needed to make them fully a part of the lab. If you decide to take onan undergraduate, consider limiting the initial assignment to one semester.At the end of that time, determine whether the studentshould continue for a second semester.(Additional considerations for working withundergraduates and other lab members can befound in chapter 5,\"Mentoring and BeingMentored.\") Write the Job Description The next step is developing a job description for the open position. First, identify and priori-tize the initial and ongoing lab tasks for whichyou need support.Then determine the qualifi- cations needed to best complete these tasks anddevelop a general plan for allocating the person 's time. Most HR departments have job descriptions that you can use as mod- els. Bear in mind that the position will have to fit within your institution 's established compensation and classification system.The process may be more complicated ifunions represent identified groups of employees at your institution. RECRUITING APPLICANTS Get the Word Out Informal methods. Try to recruit by word of mouth. Ideally, you want people to seek you out. Meetings and seminars where you present your work are good venuesto reach graduate students and postdocs, as well as lab technicians who are notemployed by your institution.Another strategy is to include a statement on your Website inviting people to contact you if they are interested in working with you.As youget to know students in your classes, you may find some who are interested in learn-ing more about your work and carrying out a research project in your laboratory. Inaddition, you may be able to recruit graduate students from those who rotate throughyour lab as part of the curriculum. Formal advertisements. To recruit postdocs, you may decide to place advertise- ments in journals such as Science (http://recruit.sciencemag.org ), Cell(http://www.cell.com ), and Nature (http://www.nature.com ), both in hard copy and on the Web. Other resources for advertising are the Federation of American Societiesfor Experimental Biology 's Career Resources Web site (http://career.faseb.org/careerweb/ ),Science 's Next Wave (http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/jobsnet.dtl ), and the listserves maintained by profes- sional associations such as the Association for Women in Science For any advertise-ments you place, make sure you follow your institution 's policies.Resource: Job Descriptions The University of Michigan offers helpful information about preparing job descriptions(University of Michigan Employment andExecutive Services,\"Conducting a SuccessfulEmployee Selection Process,\" http://www.umich.edu/~hraa/empserv/deptinfo/empsel.htm ).Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 64BWF/rhombus6HHMIWhat Do Y ou Have to Offer? As a beginning investigator, you may find it a challenge to recruit the people you want, especially postdocs and experienced lab technicians. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances: /rhombus6 Promote your vision.When you talk to the applicant, take time to identify your vision for your lab.Y our excitement about your work and your lab will excite and interest potential staff. /rhombus6 Communicate your lab culture.Think about how to create a lab environment that allows you and your staff to work efficiently and harmoniously. If good communication, collaboration, and cooperation are valued concepts in yourlab, they can be selling points in recruitment. /rhombus6 Convey your commitment to mentoring. Let potential staff know that they will be working directly with you and that you have an interest in helping them in their careers. /rhombus6 Offer flexibility where you can. Flexibility, especially about assignments or research avenues, is attractive to most job applicants. /rhombus6 Provide a realistic level of reassurance regarding the stability of your funding. Potential staff are likely to be aware that the money to pay their salaries may be coming from your research grants. What They Are Looking For Lab technicians. Technicians may be attracted to a beginning laboratory because they are eager for the opportunity to work closely with the principal investigator andare interested in learning new techniques and being included on papers. Goodsalaries and status (related to publishing papers) may be of prime importance tocareer lab techs, whereas experience, especially experience that will help them decidewhether to go to graduate school or medical school, may be more important toshort-term lab technicians. Graduate students. Graduate students are often attracted to new labs because, like lab technicians, they are eager for the opportunity to work directly with principalinvestigators. Mentoring graduate students can be time-consuming, especially for thefirst few months.Therefore, you may want to sign up your first graduate student When I talk to students about what kind of a lab they should join, I always tell them that it 's a very special experience to go into the laboratory of someone who is just beginning an inde-pendent research career, because the principal investigator is inthe lab all the time working shoulder to shoulder with them.There is a lot of excitement and anticipation about exactlywhich direction the laboratory will go. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''when your lab is running well and you have time to work with each student prop- erly.Thoughtful mentoring of graduate students early in your career will help youdevelop a positive reputation and will increase your ability to attract other graduatestudents. On the other hand, if your first graduate students have negative experiencesin your lab, they will quickly share this with their peers, and your ability to recruitstudents will suffer greatly. Undergraduate students. Undergraduate students may want to work in your lab because they are curious about research, perhaps because they have talked with theirpeers who are having a good experience in a lab and want to find out whether theyshould consider graduate study. Or they may be looking for academic credit, funding,or recommendations for graduate or medical school.Try to select undergraduateswho are motivated to contribute to the productivity of your lab. Postdocs. It may take two to three years for you to recruit a postdoc with the desired qualifications. Most postdocs are attracted to more established labs becausethese usually are better launching pads for their careers. Nevertheless, some postdocsmight be attracted by your research area, your concern for furthering their careers, oryour institution 's reputation and geographical location. If you have a good reputation from your own postdoctoral work, you may be able to recruit highly qualified post-docs right away. Ha ving a policy that allows postdocs to take their projects, or some aspect of their projects, when they leave your lab is also a potent recruitment tool. SCREENING APPLICANTS Many principal investigators do all the screening for jobs for which scientific qualifications are important but may rely on HR to do the initial screening foradministrative positions. However, as a beginning investigator, you probably will notbe swamped with applicants, so you may want to screen all the applicants yourself. When you review r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, check skills against qualifications and look for transferable skills.Always review r\u00e9sum\u00e9s carefully\u2014some applicants may inflate their experience.Gaps in employment and job-hopping may be signs of problems. Tips for Specific Positions For an applicant to a postdoc position, consider publication quality \u2014not just quanti- ty\u2014and the applicant 's contribution.A first-author citation indicates that the appli- cant probably spearheaded the project.A middle-author citation indicates that theapplicant contributed experimental expertise but may have had less to do with theproject 's intellectual construct.Although it may not be realistic for a beginning inves- tigator, try to find a postdoc with a record of accomplishment\u2014usually two first-author papers\u2014that indicates he or she will be able to obtain independent funding. If a technician has contributed to publications, you should evaluate them to deter- mine whether the technician has the ability to contribute intellectually as well astechnically to the lab.The r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of less-experienced lab technicians may not showa record of contributions to published papers or other indicators of productivity.Carefully check references to find out about their capabilities. For a graduate student, speak informally with other people who have worked with the student, including teaching assistants who may know how the student has performedChapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 65in a laboratory course.Take the student to lunch and see how articulate, bright, and energized he or she is.When selecting graduate students and undergraduates, remem-ber that a high grade-point average is no guarantee of success in your lab. Check References Directly For a variety of reasons, including fear of a lawsuit or hurt feelings and concerns about confidentiality, people rarely write negative letters of recommendation.Therefore, you need to contact applicants 'references by telephone.Y ou may want to talk with HR in advance about your institution 's policies on conducting refer- ence checks. What to ask a reference. When discussing an applicant with someone who has provided a reference for him or her: /rhombus6 Describe the job and the work atmosphere you want to create. /rhombus6 Ask short, open-ended questions, and avoid asking questions to which the desired response is obvious. /rhombus6 You might want to ask,Why is this person leaving? Is he or she reliable? Would you rehire this person? What are this person 's strengths and weak- nesses? What are you most disappointed in with respect to this person? /rhombus6 Probe for further information, and ask for examples. Do not settle for yes or no answers. /rhombus6 Try to determine whether your lab values are similar to those of the refer- ence, perhaps by asking about the reference 's lab and philosophy.This infor- mation should help you decide how much weight to give to the reference. Contact all references. You are trying to make a decision about someone with whomyou will be spending many of your waking hours\u2014make sure you get the information youneed.T o correct for bias in the responses of anyone reference, make sure you call all of anapplicant 's references, even those overseas. Don't rely on e-mail to make the reference check\u2014you 're unlikely to get the kind of information you 're looking for. Sometimes, applicants won 't give the name of a current supervisor as a reference. If that is thecase, you must respect their request for confiden-tiality. However, you should probably ask whythe applicant doesn 't want you to call.Y ou can also ask for additional references who can pro-vide you with information about this person 's work habits, accomplishments, and history.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 66BWF/rhombus6HHMICommon T ypes of Interview Questions Open-ended questions cannot be answered yes or no; for example,T ell meabout yourself.The applicant determines thedirection of the answer. Directive questions solicit information about a specific point; for example,Whatskills do you have for this position? The inter-viewer determines the focus of the answer. Reflective questions solicit information about a past experience that might serve topredict the applicant's future performance; forexample, Describe a time when you demon-strated initiative.Chapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 67Further Screen Applicants by T elephone You may want to screen promising applicants by telephone before inviting any of them for a formal interview.As with interviewing references, focus on asking open-ended questions. For foreign applicants, open-ended questions are particularly helpfulin determining the person 's ability to communicate effectively in English.The appen- dix (page 79) shows a sample outline that can help you in your phone interviews withapplicants. (Consider developing a similar form for talking to applicants 'references.) INTERVIEWING APPLICANTS Invite Applicants to Visit Y our Lab After you have completed the initial screening, narrow your list of potential appli- cants to a reasonable number of good prospects.Then, invite each person to visit yourlab for a formal interview. Remember, the initial telephone screening interview is nosubstitute for this in-person interview. (Y our institution may be willing to pay thetravel costs of applicants for a postdoc position.) In addition to the interview withyou, the applicant should meet informally with other members of your lab or, if this is your first hire, meet with your colleagues, perhaps over lunch or dinner.Alsoarrange for the applicant to spend some time with other lab members and colleagueswithout you. For a postdoc position, require that each applicant deliver a seminar tomembers of your lab or department, and then get their feedback. Share your requirements and expectations for the successful applicant with the other people you have asked to help conduct interviews.This way everyone will be lookingfor the same attributes and skills. Conduct a Structured Interview The goal of the structured interview is to use a standardized set of predetermined questions to gather key information in an efficient, equitable, and nondiscriminatorymanner from all qualified applicants.Y ou want to give each applicant a fair opportu-nity to compete for the position.Y our questions should be /rhombus6 Outlined ahead of time so that you ask basically the same questions of each applicant /rhombus6 Job related and legal (avoid asking personal questions) The presentation [postdoc candidates] give to the lab is key. You can check out their ability in public speaking, which is important because in science a lot of times you are a salesper-son. I usually try to ask them some decently tough ques-tions\u2014not to try to stump them, but just to make sure thatthey can think on their feet, because you have to do that a lotas a scientist. \u2014B.

Topics to Avoid Most illegal or ill-conceived questions deal with race, color, national origin, sex, reli- gion, disability, or age.Y ou should not ask about sexual orientation, marital status, marriage plans, pregnancy or plans for having children, the number and ages ofdependent children, child-care arrangements, or other non-work-related matters.Remember that job-related questions are the only appropriate means by which todetermine skills and qualifications.Y our HR department can provide more guidanceon topics to avoid during interviews. Develop the Interview Questions As you develop your questions, think about how to determine whether the applicant has the knowledge, technical skills, and personal qualities that you need. Review thejob description you created earlier, the applicant 's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and your notes from your conversations with the references to identify any items or information gaps that needclarification in the interview. Sample interview questions. At the Helm:A Laboratory Navigator by Kathy Barker (see \"Resources,\" page 78) contains a list of general questions as well as those gearedfor specific laboratory positions and for determining specific personal characteristics.In addition, you may want to tailor the following questions to the position for whichyou are interviewing. Experience and Skills /rhombus6 Tell me about your most significant accomplishments. /rhombus6 Tell me the part you played in conducting a specific project or implementing a new approach or technology in your lab. /rhombus6 I see you have worked with [insert specific technology or technique].T ell me about its features and benefits.I ask them,Why do you want to come to this lab? What interests you? What areas do you want to work in? I 'm look- ing for people who say they want to broaden their horizons,not those who want to continue doing the same thing. \u2014B. Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia ''''Chapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 69Commitment and Initiative /rhombus6 Why do you want to work in my lab? /rhombus6 Where do you see yourself in five years? /rhombus6 What kinds of projects do you want to do? Why? /rhombus6 Tell me how you stay current in your field. /rhombus6 Describe a time when you were in charge of a project and what you feel you accomplished. /rhombus6 Tell me about a project or situation that required you to take initiative. Working and Learning Styles /rhombus6 What motivates you at work? /rhombus6 Would you rather work on several projects at a time or on one project? /rhombus6 Do you learn better from books, hands-on experience, or other people? /rhombus6 Tell me about a project that required you to work as part of a team.What was the outcome of the team 's efforts? /rhombus6 How would you feel about leaving a project for a few hours to help some- one else? /rhombus6 If you encountered a problem in the lab, would you ask someone for help or would you try to deal with it yourself? /rhombus6 You may be asked to work after hours or on a weekend.Would this be a problem? Time Management /rhombus6 How do you prioritize your work? /rhombus6 What happens when you have two priorities competing for your time? Decision Making and Problem Solving /rhombus6 What is your biggest challenge in your current job? How are you dealing with it? /rhombus6 Tell me about a time when you made a decision that resulted in unintended (or unexpected) consequences (either good or bad). /rhombus6 Give me an example of a situation where you found it necessary to gather other opinions before you made a decision. Interpersonal Skills /rhombus6 How important is it to you to be liked by your colleagues and why? /rhombus6 If you heard through the grapevine that someone didn 't care for you, what would you do, if anything? /rhombus6 Tell me about a situation in which your work was criticized.

Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 70BWF/rhombus6HHMICultural differences. You may find yourself considering applicants from different cultures whose beliefs, such as those about self-promotion, collaboration, and defer-ence, may differ from the beliefs commonly held in the United States.T o learn moreabout cultural factors and to ensure you are considering all candidates fairly, refer toKathy Barker 's At the Helm:A Laboratory Navigator .The author also provides a list of useful questions you might ask a candidate, including the following: /rhombus6 How do you feel about getting in front of a group and describing your per- sonal accomplishments? /rhombus6 How would you respond if a more senior lab colleague took credit for your project? /rhombus6 If you did not understand something, would you persist in asking for help even if the principal investigator got annoyed? Tips for Conducting an Interview /rhombus6 Before you begin, try to make the applicant feel comfortable. Make appropri- ate small talk, offer a beverage, and compliment the applicant on making it thus far in the selection process. Remember that the applicant is also decid-ing whether he or she wants to work for you. /rhombus6 Develop professional rapport, but avoid a social atmosphere: Explain how the interview will be structured.Briefly describe the selection process.Outline the responsibilities for the open position.Convey your expectations about the job. Include values that may seem obvious to you, such as your commitment to lab safety and scientific rigor. Keep in mind the topics to avoid. /rhombus6 Take brief notes. Record actual answers to questions, not evaluative or con- clusive comments. /rhombus6 Listen carefully. Let the applicant do most of the talking. /rhombus6 Develop a high tolerance for silence. Give the applicant a chance to think and develop thoughtful answers to your questions.My favorite questions are,What do you want to be doing five years from now? Ten years from now? What area do you want to be working in? These give me an idea of just how mature[applicants] are in terms of how much they have thoughtabout what they want to do and how committed they are. \u2014Gail Cassell, Eli Lilly and Company''''/rhombus6 Give the applicant many chances to ask questions.This will give you some insight into what is important to him or her. /rhombus6 Never make promises or give commitments, even those that seem innocent to you. /rhombus6 Ask the applicant about his or her timetable for leaving the current job, even if you asked it during the telephone interview. /rhombus6 Before ending the interview, do the following: Give the applicant a chance to add anything else he or she thinks may be important for you to know in making your decision. Make the applicant aware of the next steps, such as additional interviews and the time frame for hiring. Thank the applicant for his or her time. Special Considerations This section is especially relevant for interviewing technicians, postdocs, and other professional laboratory staff. Pregnancy. If, during the interview, a well-qualified applicant tells you she is preg- nant, remember it is illegal to discriminate against someone because she is pregnant.Familiarize yourself with your institution 's policies on maternity leave before making any statements to the applicant about what length of maternity leave would be per-mitted and whether the leave would be paid or unpaid. Similarly, your institutionmay have a policy on paternity leave that may apply to an applicant. Visas. If you are filling a postdoc position and are dealing with foreign applicants, remember that visa rules and requirements are complex and change frequently. Some visa types are more desirable from the perspective of the applicant (e.g., because theyallow for concurrent application for permanent residence in the United States).Other visa types are more desirable from the perspective of the employer (e.g.,because they are easier to administer). Special concerns for any type of visa mayinclude visa arrangements for a spouse and other family members, requirements toreturn to the home country, and employment implications. Keep in mind that obtaining a visa can be a very slow and lengthy process. (Obtaining visas to travel tothe United States has become even more time-consuming given increased U.S. secu-rity concerns and clearance.) Consult HR, your institution 's international office, and your department 's administra- tive staff about visa rules and requirements.They can also help you determine whichvisa is most appropriate for a given applicant.Y ou can also check the latest informationfrom the State Department ( http://www.travel.state.gov/visa_services.html ) and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (formerly the Immigration andNaturalization Service, http://www.immigration.gov/graphics ).The site http://www.visalaw.com may be helpful.A brief visa primer also is available in At the Helm:A Laboratory Navigator by Kathy Barker. In addition, try to determine the consequences (for you as well as the applicant) if poor performance forces you to ask the postdoc to leave your laboratory. Because thisis an extremely complex area of immigration law, it is important that you consultyour institution 's HR or legal department and follow their advice.Chapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 71Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 72BWF/rhombus6HHMIEVALUATING APPLICANTS Before you begin evaluating an applicant, make sure that you have all the neces- sary information. Conduct any reference interviews that you were unable to com-plete before the interview. Gather opinions from others who have met with theapplicant.As needed, seek guidance from your department and HR. Maintaining Objectivity As in any situation that involves interpreting interpersonal behavior, objectivity in evaluation may be difficult. Nevertheless, try to avoid the following: /rhombus6 Relying too heavily on first impressions /rhombus6 Making a decision too early in the interview, before asking all questions /rhombus6 Downgrading an applicant because of a negative characteristic that is not rel- evant to the job itself /rhombus6 Allowing a positive characteristic to overshadow your perception of all other traits, sometimes called the \"halo effect\" /rhombus6 Judging the applicant in comparison with yourself /rhombus6 Comparing applicants with one another rather than with the selection crite- ria (e.g., if you have been interviewing poorly qualified applicants, you may rate average applicants highly) /rhombus6 Allowing factors not directly related to the interview to influence your esti- mation of the applicant (e.g., interviewing during times of the day when you may be tired) What to Look For In addition to determining whether the applicant has the qualifications required to perform well in your lab, you should also keep the following points in mind: /rhombus6 Consider the \"chemistry.\" First and foremost, pay attention to your intuitive reaction to the person. Look for a person who is interested in, and able to get along with, others. /rhombus6 Ascertain whether the applicant is a good fit. Keep in mind that you are building your team and need people with the skills and personalities to get things done. Look for people who have a track record of productivity andhave demonstrated an ability to learn new skills. /rhombus6 Seek someone who has a passion for science and a strong work ethic. Enthusiasm, a can-do attitude, and the willingness to go the extra mile are critical attributes. /rhombus6 Check the applicant 's career plans. Knowing what the applicant wants to be doing in 5 or 10 years can give you insight into his or her scientific maturity and creativity, as well as his or her commitment to a specific research area./rhombus6 Be certain the applicant is committed to good research practices. Record keeping and reporting results are even more important now than in the past because of patent and other legal issues. Insist on the highest level of scien-tific integrity from anyone you are considering. Red Flags Warning signs during an interview that should alert you to potential problems include: /rhombus6 Unwillingness to take responsibility for something that has gone wrong. /rhombus6 Complaining about an adviser and coworkers. /rhombus6 Demanding privileges not given to others. /rhombus6 Delaying answering questions, challenging your questions, or avoiding answering them all together. (Humor and sarcasm can be tools to avoidanswering questions.) /rhombus6 Unless you have been rude, responding to an interview question with anger is never appropriate. /rhombus6 Incongruence between what you hear and what you see (e.g., downcast eyes and slouching are not signs of an eager, assertive candidate). /rhombus6 Trying to control the interview and otherwise behaving inappropriately.Chapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 73If people in the lab had reservations about whether they would get along with someone, I probably wouldn 't bring that person in. \u2014Tamara Doering,Washington University School of Medicine There is enough competition in the field already, and you don't need it in the lab. \u2014B.Brett Finlay, University of British Columbia If people don 't seem like they would be fun to work with, I would use that as a reason to turn them down. Even if theyhave a lot of papers and seem to be very smart, I think youmight want to think twice about hiring them. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''MAKING THE OFFER This section is especially relevant for hiring technicians, postdocs, and other pro- fessional laboratory staff. Before you make an offer, check with your department to learn which items of the job are negotiable and whether you are responsible for negotiating them. HR or yourdepartment should provide you with institutional salary ranges for the position. Insome institutions, HR will determine the initial salary that you can offer. In otherinstitutions, you may be given some leeway within a predetermined range that isappropriate for the job description. Once you have identified the person you wish to hire, contact him or her by tele- phone to extend the offer and to discuss start date, salary, and other conditions ofemployment. (Be sure to check with HR first to determine whether you or they willmake this contact and cover these issues.) Inform All the Applicants First, inform the person you have selected. If he or she turns down the offer, you can move to your second choice. Once you have filled the position, let the other applicants know.Y ou do not need to give a specific reason for your decision not to hire an applicant. However, you may state that the selected candidate had better qualifications or more relevant experienceor that it is your policy not to disclose this information. Check with HR and yourdepartment 's administrative staff about policy in this area. The Offer Letter After you and the selected candidate have confirmed the job details via telephone, your institution will send the formal offer letter. Usually, it confirms the offer terms, including start date and salary. Coordinate with HR and your department 's adminis- trative staff to determine what information to include. An offer letter to a foreign national may need to include more information. For example, it may need to spell out that employment is contingent on the ability toobtain authorization for the individual to work in the United States and to keep thework authorization in effect. HR or your department 's administrative staff will help you follow policies correctly in this type of situation. MANAGING YOUR LABORATORY STAFF For a discussion of the skills needed to manage the people in your lab day to day and get them to work productively, see chapter 3,\"Defining and ImplementingYour Mission.\"Also consult your institution 's HR staff\u2014they have expertise and resources to help you set performance expectations, maintain performance records, motivate staff and evaluate their performance, deal with behavior or performanceproblems, and manage issues related to staff promotion and job growth.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 74BWF/rhombus6HHMIASKING STAFF TO LEAVE Despite all your best efforts, you may need to ask someone to leave your lab. Before considering dismissal, be sure that you have tried various avenues to help thisperson be successful in your lab.This may include assistance with scientific techniquesand counseling for behavioral issues.Also, be certain that your dissatisfaction is basedon objective observations, not your personal biases. Try to determine whether you think the person would be better off in another lab or should consider another career. For students and postdocs, this usually means talkingwith that person and his or her faculty adviser or the graduate student committee. Itmay be best to suggest to someone that research is not for them if you truly believethe profession is not suited to his or her talents or personality.Y ou can provide thatperson with encouragement and options. For example, Science 's Next Wave Web site provides a range of career options for people with bioscience backgrounds( http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/trn.dtl ). There are no hard and fast rules about how a manager should address performance or behavior problems in the lab. However, keep in mind the following, especially ifyou're thinking about letting someone go: /rhombus6 Be fair. /rhombus6 No surprises. Fairness dictates that lab members receive some type of notice about unsatisfactory performance. Make sure the person knows your concerns and is given a reasonableopportunity to respond and turn things around. Keep a Record You should outline and set expectations for the performance and conduct of every- one in your lab.The process is more formal for employees than it is for students. For technicians, postdocs, and other professionals, job expectations should be made clear. Don 't expect your employees to read your mind about what you want them to accomplish and how you want to accomplish it. Keep good records of your conversa-tions with everyone so that you can track your own efforts and determine whetheryour staff has met expectations. If a lab member is not meeting expectations, makeChapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 75When postdocs don 't fit in, I try to help them find other posi- tions. Sometimes they realize that this isn 't where they belong and they do it themselves. I say,What do you want to workon? Let 's see what we can do. People are different, sometimes things don 't work out, and this is not a reason to be defensive. The focus is to help people do what they value. \u2014Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University School of Medicine ''''sure you document your attempts to help the person improve his or her performance or prepare for a new career. Should you ultimately have to terminate this person,these records can help avert external challenges to your decision. Deliver a Warning Warnings should be delivered by you, calmly and in private. Listen to the employee 's point of view and explanation. Develop a plan for addressing the problem withbenchmarks and timelines.Y ou may want to commit your action plan to writing. Ifyou provide advance notice, employees will not be surprised when you take forceful action concerning unsatisfactory performance or behavior. If Y ou Decide to T erminate An employee with serious work-related problems is a disruptive force and, especially in a small lab, can significantly retard research progress.Although it is not easy todecide to terminate someone, those investigators who have had to release staff saythat in retrospect their biggest mistake was not doing it sooner. To be fair to yourself and your staff and to avoid lawsuits, an involuntary termination should never happen out of the blue unless it is the result of substantial misconduct,such as clear fraud or violence in the workplace.Always avoid firing on the spot.Y oushould find a way to calm the situation so that you don 't take precipitous action.A suspension with or without pay may be a good option for the short term while youconsider the situation. If you have decided that termination is your only solution,consult with HR as soon as possible to ensure that you are complying with institu-tional and legal requirements relating to termination and correctly documenting youractions. Questions to ask yourself before letting someone go. HR professionals recom- mend that, if circumstances permit, you ask yourself the following questions and doc-ument each of the actions before proceeding: /rhombus6 Have you given the person at least some type of notice or warning? /rhombus6 Have you made it clear to the person what he or she is doing wrong? /rhombus6 Has the person received counseling or assistance in learning new or difficult tasks? If so, how much? /rhombus6 Are you treating (or have you treated) the person differently from other staff in your lab? /rhombus6 Are you following written procedures and institutional policies? /rhombus6 Does the documentation in the personnel file support the reason for discharge? Ideally, you have conducted regular and candid performance reviews with all your laboratory staff and now can use this documentation to help support your decision.(For a discussion of conducting performance reviews, see chapter 3,\"Defining andImplementing Y our Mission.\") How to terminate. Terminating anyone from your lab is a confidential matter and should not be discussed, before or after the fact, with others in the lab.A terminationmeeting should be conducted by you, the investigator, in your office, in a way that isprivate and respectful. (Y ou can always ask HR for assistance if you are unsure how toproceed or if you suspect that your employee may act inappropriately.) Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 76BWF/rhombus6HHMIPrepare for the meeting. Develop a script and practice it until you can convey the information confidently. Keep in mind that what is said during the terminationmeeting can become part of the basis for a subsequent challenge. Remember to /rhombus6 Be polite. /rhombus6 Stay focused on the issue at hand. Get to the point quickly. Explain the deci- sion briefly and clearly. Don 't apologize or argue with the employee in an effort to justify your decision. /rhombus6 Avoid laying blame. /rhombus6 Arrange to have scientific materials and equipment and supplies returned to you, including lab notebooks; protocol books (unless it is a personal copy); lists of clones, cells, and experiments in progress; and keys. /rhombus6 Let the employee have an opportunity to have his or her say, and pay close attention to what is being said. /rhombus6 Refer the employee to HR or to the office responsible for discussing benefit eligibility. /rhombus6 Take notes that document this meeting and convert them into an informal or formal memo to file. /rhombus6 Try to part on cordial terms. Science is a small community, and your paths may cross again. Termination letters and references. As part of final documentation, a termination letter may be required by your institution or by state law. In addition, you may beasked for, or may wish to offer, a reference. Check with HR about proper procedures. Visa considerations. Consult with HR or your department 's administrative staff about visa issues before terminating a foreign national employee. Be certain that youare not legally responsible for continuing to pay the salary of someone no longerworking in your lab.Again, it 's better to understand these requirements before you hire someone with a visa.Chapter 4 Staffing Your Laboratory BWF/rhombus6HHMI 77Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 78BWF/rhombus6HHMIRESOURCES Austin, Robert D.\"Managing Knowledge Workers: Evolving Practices and Trends.\" Science 's Next Wave (April 26, 2002), http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2002/04/25/5 .

In addition, several of yourundergraduate students may be thinking about careers in science.Each of these individuals will look to you as a mentor. If your repu-tation as a good mentor gets around, young scientists outside yourlab may also begin knocking on your door.At the same time, youwill continue to be in need of guidance for your own continuingprofessional development.This chapter describes the process of men-toring, with the focus on mentoring the people working in your lab.The chapter also suggests desirable personal qualities and plans ofaction for both mentors and trainees. 1 WHAT IS MENTORING AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? Scientific mentoring is a personal ,one-on-one relationship between a more experienced scientist and a junior scientist or ascientist-in-the-making.The mentor is exposed to the trainee'senergy and ideas, and the trainee receives the guidance andencouragement necessary for professional development. Mentors usually include those who are officially responsible for the work of junior scientists or students, such as the principal investiga- tor or a formal adviser. However, it's also important to have mentorswho are outside the direct line of authority.These mentors can beespecially helpful in providing guidance when formal advising rela-tionships become strained or when the personal or professionalinterests of the trainee differ from those of the formal mentor.This chapter is based on a pair of sessions held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management. The sessions were organized by Victoria McGovern, Ph.D., Burroughs Wellcome Fund.The panelists for the first session were Stephen L. Hajduk, Ph.D., University of Alabama-Birmingham (now at the Marine Biological Laboratory); David S. Roos, Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania; and Dorothy E. Shippen, Ph.D.,T exas A&M University. Panelists for the sec- ond session were Elizabeth Keath, Ph.D., Saint Louis University, and E. Lynn Zechiedrich, Ph.D., Baylor College of Medicine.The chapter also draws from transcripts of interviews with laboratory lead- ers conducted by Christine Harris, Ed.D., executive coach and management consultant, and Joan C.King, Ph.D.,T ufts University School of Medicine, and principal, Beyond Success, to develop their workshop in basic laboratory leadership skills for the course. Additional information was obtained from Gina T urrigiano, Ph.D., Brandeis University, and some of the resources noted in this chapter. 1. In this chapter, the people you mentor are referred to as \"trainees,\" although not everyone you mentor may be receiving training in your lab.Not only does mentoring benefit the trainee, it also benefits the mentor.As a mentor, you derive personal satisfaction in helping nurture the next generation of scientists. Your scientific achievements are carried forward by those you have mentored.As your trainees embark on new projects, you are naturally kept abreast of the latest sci- entific developments. In addition, your professional network expands as your traineesexpand their professional horizons. Traits of a Good Mentor Good mentors often share some of the following personal qualities: /rhombus6 Accessibility: An open door and an approachable attitude. /rhombus6 Empathy: Insight into what the trainee is experiencing. /rhombus6 Open-mindedness: Respect for each trainee's individuality and for working styles and career goals different from your own. /rhombus6 Consistency: The habit of acting on your principles and being reliable. /rhombus6 Patience: Awareness that people make mistakes and that each person matures at his or her own rate. /rhombus6 Honesty: Ability to communicate the hard truths about the world \"out there\" and about the trainee's chances. /rhombus6 Savvy: Attention to the pragmatic aspects of career development. Confidentiality in Mentoring As a mentor, you may be privy to a lot of information about your trainees, from their past professional accomplishments and failures to their personal relationships andfinancial situation.Y ou should treat all information as confidential.Y our traineesshould feel that they can trust you with whatever problems they share with you. A MENTOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES Mentoring entails substantial commitments of time, energy, and good will.A significant portion of your time must be allocated to each trainee, and you must beprepared to obtain the resources the trainee needs. In addition, you should use yourexperience and contacts to help the trainee establish a professional network. Choosing Whom to Mentor You will have to make case-by-case judgments about which mentoring relationships you canafford to enter into and how intensive eachone should be.There are some people forwhom you are clearly responsible, such as thepeople working in your lab.The students inyour courses also have legitimate expectations of you. Others, outside your lab or courses,may come to you for advice. Some people aremore promising than others, and you want toMaking the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 82BWF/rhombus6HHMIQuestion: How do I say no to being some- one's mentor? Answer: Be kind: Imagine yourself in your requestor's shoes. Give reasons related to your own limitations. However, be clear and firm. Do not invite misunderstanding. Suggest alternativesources of help, but check first with the poten-tial mentor.nurture their talent. Others have interests closely related to yours, and it is natural for you to want to work closely with them. Still others show promise but are needy in some respect; for example, their skills are not fully developed or they need helpfocusing their efforts.With the people in your lab, the important thing is to be fairand avoid favoritism.With the people outside your lab, you need to avoid overex-tending yourself or setting up expectations you can't fulfill. Defining Y our Role as a Mentor Generally speaking, a mentor provides whatever is needed to further a trainee's profes- sional development but is not necessarily a friend.Y ou should offer to teach technicalskills, give advice about the political aspects of science, and suggest networking oppor-tunities, but you should probably not offer advice on personal matters. Often, emo-tional issues are relevant to one's work, and you can offer moral support, but a goodmentor treads carefully. Mentor Versus Adviser In theory, mentors have multiple responsibilities\u2014being an adviser is one of these. According to The Council of Graduate Schools ( http://www.cgsnet.org/ ) mentors are /rhombus6 Advisers: People with career experience willing to share their knowledge. /rhombus6 Supporters: People who give emotional and moral encouragement. /rhombus6 Tutors: People who give specific feedback on one's performance. /rhombus6 Masters: Employers to whom one is apprenticed. /rhombus6 Sponsors: Sources of information about opportunities and aid in obtaining them. /rhombus6 Models of identity: The kind of person one should be to be an academic. In reality, it is unlikely that any one individual can fulfill all possible mentoring roles. For this reason, many argue that the term mentor should be used broadly to mean an individual who helps another with one or more aspects of his or her personal or pro-fessional development or both. In this sense, trainees are encouraged to seek out vari-ous faculty who can provide some of these components.Chapter 5 Mentoring and Being Mentored BWF/rhombus6HHMI 83One of the lessons is that my job is not to be their best friend. My job is to be their mentor, and my job is to be their boss orsupervisor.... I had this sort of egalitarian thing where I wastrying to run a professional laboratory, but I was also wantingto be buddies with everybody.... I have come to realize thealternative\u2014to have a little distance.Things work better if it'sclear that I am the head of the lab. \u2014Charles Murry, University of Washington School of Medicine''''STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE MENTORING IN YOUR LAB Make Everything a Learning Opportunity It helps to think of mentoring as a highly individualized mode of teaching.Y ou want to establish a \"culture of teaching\" in your lab, so that each individual feels empow-ered to seek whatever he or she needs to do good science. Set Specific Goals and Measures of Accomplishment Work with each individual\u2014at performance evaluation time, in the course of lab meetings, and on other occasions when his or her work is under review\u2014to set spe-cific goals and measures of accomplishment.The following are some examples: /rhombus6 For a postdoc or student, you might want to establish a publishing goal. It should include deadlines. /rhombus6 For postdocs, job-hunting goals might be important.Y ou might say,\"By next month, give me your list of places you want to apply to.Then we can talk about developing your job talk.\" /rhombus6 Have technicians identify new skills they need (e.g., new equipment or soft- ware they can learn to use). Give them time to learn and the opportunity to take courses or seek help from others.Then ask them to demonstrate whatthey have learned at a staff meeting. In some cases, you may have to push people a bit to set their goals. In other cases, people's goals may be well-defined but may not exactly fit your lab's overall goals. Ifyou can, give them room to explore options, and offer whatever educational and net- working opportunities you can afford. Even if they eventually leave your lab to do other things, they will be much happier and more productive while they are withyou if they feel you are looking out for them and their future well-being. Encourage Strategic Thinking and Creativity Those working in your lab, especially newcomers, may not have the experience to judge how long to struggle with an experiment or a project that is not working.As theprincipal investigator, you must decide what work is most important, how long a givenproject can be pursued, and what resources can be allocated to any particular effort.Asa mentor, you should explain the basis of your decisions to your trainees. In this way,you give concrete examples of strategic thinking and prepare your trainees for similar decisions they must make when they are in charge of their own research programs.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 84BWF/rhombus6HHMIIf you just regiment the students' and postdocs' lives, you may have a very productive laboratory, but you may miss out onan opportunity to stumble on a major discovery or new scien-tific direction. \u2014Thomas BWF/rhombus6HHMI 85It is also important to give people enough space to be creative. Don't rush in too quickly with interpretations of data or solutions to problems. Let your staff take the firststab. By doing this, you prepare your trainees to work through projects independentlyand you benefit from their insights and creativity. Uphold Professional Standards Those new to research are still forming their professional standards and habits.They will be working with you for months or years and will learn your lab's way of doingthings. Set high standards for yourself and your workers, and make sure your laboffers an encouraging and disciplined environment. Experienced lab leaders list thefollowing essentials: /rhombus6 Encourage good time-management techniques.At the same time, respect individual patterns of work. (See chapter 6,\"Time Management.\") /rhombus6 Clearly state your expectations. Let people know when they are not meeting them. /rhombus6 Offer criticism in a way that doesn't shame and discourage people. /rhombus6 Keep abreast of laboratory record keeping.This is a key management respon- sibility and an aspect of mentoring.As the principal investigator, you are responsible for seeing that your people keep meticulous records documenting their work and meeting regulatory requirements.This habit will serve themwell later on. By reviewing lab notebooks frequently, you also guard against falsification of data. (For more on record keeping in the laboratory, see chap- ter 8,\"Data Management and Laboratory Notebooks.\") Impart Skills Do the following to encourage your lab workers to learn new skills: /rhombus6 Involve everyone in the scientific publishing and grant-writing process. Part of your job is to teach your trainees how to write publishable scientific papers and successful grant proposals. For papers, have the first author writethe first draft, and then send the paper around the lab for review. For pro-posals, have each person write a piece of the proposal, and then have every-one review successive drafts of the whole package. By doing this, everyonewill gain invaluable experience and get a chance to see the big picture ofthe lab's activities. /rhombus6 Impart technical skills.As a manager, you need to know the skill sets of each member of your lab and make sure that each important skill is passed on to several people in the laboratory, for their benefit and yours. /rhombus6 Teach lab management explicitly. Give the people in your lab managerial responsibilities; for example, have them coordinate the sharing of equip- ment in the lab or draw up a list of routine lab jobs that can be rotatedamong lab members.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 86BWF/rhombus6HHMIProvide Networking Opportunities One of the most important benefits you confer on the people you train is admission to the network of scientists in your field.Y our reputation opens doors for those asso-ciated with you, and the connections are not likely to be made without your involve-ment. So take steps to facilitate the introductions, including /rhombus6 Allowing trainees to meet with seminar speakers invited to your institution /rhombus6 Taking trainees with you to meetings and introducing them to your col- leagues /rhombus6 Encouraging trainees to approach your colleagues about scientific matters, using your name /rhombus6 Encouraging trainees to make presentations at meetings when they are ready Give Moral Support You can help the people you mentor estimate their own potential and chart their life course.T o do so, you must be supportive and honest.Try to convey to each of yourtrainees that you have a commitment to him or her and that when a problem surfaces,you have an interest in helping to solve it and will do everything you can to do so.I have a graduated system for providing opportunities. For example, [graduate students and postdocs] must write theirown meeting abstracts and papers.They must present at labmeetings and seminars in the department when works are pub-lished. If they go to meetings, they must provide meeting sum-mary presentations when they get back. If they do well atthese tasks, I let them review manuscripts with me, providingcomments that I may choose to incorporate into the finalreview. I may have more senior people review grants with me.The ultimate compliment is when I ask them to attend meet-ings on my behalf. \u2014Milton Datta, Medical College Mentoring and Being BWF/rhombus6HHMI 87DIFFERENT MENTORING NEEDS Each type of lab worker\u2014for example, undergraduate, graduate student, post- doc, and technician\u2014is on a different professional trajectory.As you work with them,you need to keep in mind their path and their location on that path. Mentoring Undergraduates The seeds of a scientific career are planted in the undergraduate years or even earlier. Promising undergraduates can be invited to take part in research through academicindependent-study options or can be given paid work.Take their work seriously, andset high standards for them.Y ou might place them under the day-to-day guidance ofa graduate student or postdoc, but you should maintain a strong role in overseeingtheir training and the overall flow of their work within the lab. Keep in mind thatthese beginning researchers may need extra encouragement when their research isn'tgoing smoothly. Mentoring Graduate Students In science as in other fields, graduate school is vastly different from the undergraduate scene. Perhaps the most important difference is that undergraduates are expected tobe primarily engaged in absorbing knowledge, whereas graduate students are expect-ed to begin making their own contributions.A mentor helps new graduate studentsmake this transition.A graduate student may have several mentors, but the mostimportant is the principal investigator in whose lab the student is working. A typical graduate student follows this trajectory: First years. The principal investigator's task is to provide a focus\u2014a coherent plan of study.The student faces a steep learning curve. Basic techniques must be learned,comprehensive exams taken, and a thesis topic chosen.The principal investigatorkeeps tabs on the student's progress.The student's success depends on effective men- toring by the principal investigator. Middle years. At some time during these years, the student may be struggling with his or her thesis.The principal investigator helps the student out of a slump by offeringmoral support and suggesting ways to tackle a scientific problem. By now, the studenthas learned a lot and should be sharing information and techniques with colleagues,younger students, and postdocs.T eaching others is a good way to learn. Final years. The student is preparing to move on.The thesis should be near com- pletion, and the search for a postdoctoral position should be under way.The principalinvestigator will be asked for letters of reference and perhaps more active job-huntingassistance. Other mentors, such as members of the thesis advisory committee, may becalled upon for help in the job search as well. Mentoring Postdoctoral Fellows Postdocs are hybrid creatures. On the one hand, they are highly trained professional scientists who are working in your lab for a limited time to conduct research withinthe general parameters of your interests. On the other hand, they are not really com-plete professionally, because a stint as a postdoc is usually a prerequisite for an aca-demic position.Y our task as a mentor of postdocs is therefore complex.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 88BWF/rhombus6HHMIKeep in mind that the amount of time you can spend helping your postdocs will be limited, so use that time efficiently. In addition, find ways to have them help oneanother or obtain assistance from other sources. You must strike a delicate balance in directing postdoctoral work.Although the post- docs are helping you with your projects, you must treat them as collaborators, notemployees who require close supervision. Encourage them and give them the helpthey need, but give them sufficient independence so that they \"own\" their projects. You do have a protective function when it comes to the politics of the larger aca- demic world.Y our postdocs are young, politically inexperienced, and vulnerable.Y ouneed to be aware of outside competition. Be prepared to steer your postdocs away from projects that might result in conflict with researchers who are already workingon similar projects and who might publish results before your postdocs are able to. If a postdoc is not working out as you had hoped, encourage him or her to make a change.Y ou may be able to help the postdoc find a more suitable position. But evenif you can't, an unhappy postdoc should move on sooner rather than later. (See\"Asking Staff to Leave,\" page 75 in chapter 4,\"Staffing Y our Laboratory.\") As with all trainees, it is important to discuss career goals with your postdocs. Not all will be interested in or competitive for academic positions. For those who are, givethem a project that they can take with them after they leave your lab to help them establish their own labs.Alternatively, you canlet your postdocs take a project with them andwork on it for a specified time period (e.g., for several years) without competition from you,with the understanding that when that periodhas passed, your lab may pursue research in thesame area. You have a huge role to play in facilitating your postdocs' job hunts. Keep alert to job openings, counsel them about the process,coach them in their interview presentations,and give them the best letter of recommenda-tion you can. Sometimes, when the searchdoesn't go smoothly, you may need to keepthem in your lab a little longer than youexpected. Keep up the words of encourage-ment during this difficult period. After they have gone, keep in touch with them.They will be an increasingly importantpart of your professional network. Mentoring Physician- Scientists Physician-scientists have an especially compli- cated balancing act: caring for patients, main-taining a productive research lab, and meetingregulatory requirements for human-subjects research.As a result, they must closely protect their research time. As a mentor, you should understand the unique challenges physician-scientists face. Ifyou have worked in this environment, you can help with establishing priorities and with effec-tive time management. In addition, you can alsohelp the young physician-scientist acquire thenecessary political and diplomatic skills andhelp convince clinician colleagues of the valueof research in Mentoring and Being Mentored BWF/rhombus6HHMI 89Mentoring T echnicians A technician is your employee, hired to get work done.That being said, many techni- cians are a distinct type of professional scientist.Y ou should understand and encouragetheir aspirations. Make it clear to them that they are valued contributors to your proj-ects. If they are interested, you may want to give them research projects of their own.If their aspirations are purely technical, encourage them to gain new skills. MENTORING INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE YOUR LAB When you get a request for mentoring from a young scientist in another lab, or even in another university, think carefully before you agree. On the one hand, the request says something positive about your standing in the research community. In addition, by taking on a new relationship, you might open up the possibility of futurecollaborations. On the other hand, there may be problems you are not aware of.Askyourself the following questions: /rhombus6 Why is this person asking me for help? There may be a negative reason. In the case of a postdoc, perhaps he or she is dissatisfied with relationships in the home lab. If this is the case, make sure you are not offending the individual'sprincipal investigator. Do not enter into such a relationship secretly. Insist thatthe postdoc inform his or her principal investigator that you two are speak-ing.Y ou may find that the other principal investigator welcomes your help asan extra resource. /rhombus6 What are the person's expectations? Y ou need to be clear about whether you are being asked for occasional advice or long-term assistance. If it's the latter, determine whether your mentoring role will be formal or informal. /rhombus6 Do I really have the time and energy to commit to this relationship? /rhombus6 Is this someone I want to mentor? The people in your lab deserve priority. But if the person fits, and you can extend yourself, do so. HOW TO GET THE MENTORING YOU NEED Being mentored is as much an art as mentoring. It's a matter of getting plugged in to a complex network, knowing whom to ask for what, knowing how to acceptthe professional advice you receive, and maintaining long-term personal and profes-sional relationships.The following suggestions may help: /rhombus6 Don't let go of your old mentors. Stay in close touch with your graduate and postdoc advisers.Although they may not be familiar with your newenvironment, their distance from it, combined with their general under-standing of the world of science, can help you put your current environ-ment in perspective.Also, you never know when you will need to ask themfor a reference or other professional help. Even a quick e-mail to let themknow that you published a paper or received a research grant or an awardwill help them support your career./rhombus6 Establish a relationship with a set of official mentors.Y our new department probably will assign you a mentor or even a mentoring committee.These individuals may ultimately constitute your promotion and tenure commit-tee, so cultivate them carefully and treat them with respect.Y ou do notwant to vent your frustrations or confide your uncertainties and weaknesses to this group. /rhombus6 Seek out informal mentors.These usually are experienced scientists within your department or elsewhere who can give you a broader perspective on science and scientific politics. It is especially important to do this if yourdepartment has not assigned you an official mentor. /rhombus6 Establish a set of confidants.These are people with whom you can openly share information about politically sensitive issues. Choose them carefully.Y ou may be more comfortable limiting your confidants to one-on-one relation-ships. Or you may find a group that puts you in close touch with colleagueswhose situations are similar to yours. /rhombus6 Meet regularly with your formal mentors. Keep them apprised of your progress. Do not avoid them if things are going badly. Enlist their help. /rhombus6 Keep meetings professional. Respect your mentors' time constraints. Be spe- cific about what you ask for. How to Be Mentored Well Here are some qualities to cultivate in yourself as you seek to be mentored: /rhombus6 Foresight: Start early to think about your future. /rhombus6 Proactivity: Don't expect to be taken care of.Y ou could easily be overlooked in the competitive world of science. /rhombus6 Probing: Ask tough questions. Find out about the experiences of others with this potential mentor. /rhombus6 Respect: Be polite. Make and keep appointments. Stay focused. Don't overstay your welcome. /rhombus6 Gratitude: Everyone likes to be thanked. /rhombus6 Reciprocation: Repay your mentor indirectly by helping others. /rhombus6 Humility: Be willing to accept critical feedback so that you are open to learning new ways of thinking about and doing science. When the Relationship Is Not Working Out Consider finding another mentor if yours is clearly and consistently uninterested in you, undervalues your abilities, or displays any other signs of undermining the rela- tionship. Consider finding another mentor if yours behaves inappropriately by violat-ing workplace rules or fails to fulfill essential responsibilities to you\u2014for example, bynot sending letters of reference or by not reviewing your work.Y ou may need toappeal to whatever conflict-resolution mechanism exists at your university. Start withthe human resources office for guidance on how to proceed.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 90BWF/rhombus6HHMIChapter 5 Mentoring and Being Mentored BWF/rhombus6HHMI 91However, be careful about changing mentors. Even if the relationship is not going well, you do not want to offend someone unnecessarily. If the relationship is official, ending it will require explicit action and most probably generate bad feeling. If therelationship is informal, and you can just allow it to peter out, do so. If your mentor wants to terminate the relationship, accept the decision with good grace. It will be better for both of you. GENDER AND CULTURE ISSUES You want to treat everyone fairly, and you want to keep scientific merit in the forefront in your judgments about the postdocs, students, and others you mentor.Y ouwant to be treated the same way yourself.Y ou should work very hard to ensure that differences in gender, race, economic resources, and degree of comfort with theEnglish language and with U.S. customs do not affect your mentoring relationships. Gender Issues As you embark on mentoring relationships involving women scientists and pursue your own career, consider the following: /rhombus6 Early in their careers, many women scientists may be in need of role models in their profession. If you are a woman, and you are making good progress on a career in science, younger women may want to know how you do it. If youhave had failures, or are making compromises, they may want to know thattoo.Y ou may want to share your experiences, positive or negative, with thenext generation. /rhombus6 If you are a successful woman scientist, you may be called upon too often to serve on committees as the representative of your gender. Do what you can, but be selective and don't let committee work get in the way of your research. /rhombus6 If you are directing a young scientist\u2014woman or man\u2014part of your goal should be to help her or him remove unnecessary barriers to success. So do what you can to accommodate family responsibilities. Cultural Differences You are very likely to find yourself the mentor of students from other countries, or from minority groups within the United States. Language and cultural differencesmay make the mentoring relationship more challenging. For example, people fromsome cultures may convey information only in indirect ways, or they may be reluc-tant to argue with an authority figure.As a mentor, it is important to be aware of cul-tural differences when dealing with issues in the lab. Most campuses have resources tohelp foreign students become acculturated; encourage the people in your lab to getwhatever aid they may need.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 92BWF/rhombus6HHMIRESOURCES American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Finding ways tomanage the conflicting demands on your time can be the key todeveloping a successful career and a rewarding personal life.Thischapter discusses planning strategies that are critical for successfultime management, such as defining long- and short-term goals andmaking choices.Tips for day-to-day time management are also pre-sented.The chapter also offers guidance on managing committeeservice commitments, balancing research and teaching, and jugglingthe demands of home and work. In addition, it covers issues specificto physician-scientists. STRATEGIES FOR PLANNING YOUR ACTIVITIES Defining Goals Planning is a process that begins with a goal. Once you have set a goal, you can identify the necessary steps to move toward it. Goalscome in descending sizes, each of which informs the next: long-term goals (years), intermediate-term goals (months), and short-termgoals (weeks and days). Long-term goals are likely to be a combination of tangibles (e.g., faculty promotions) and intangibles (e.g., a satisfying personal life) that may change over time, making goal setting an ongoing processthat you should revisit periodically. In defining your long-term goals,you are also defining yourself\u2014who you want to be and how you want to be perceived. Intermediate-term goals, such as publishing a paper, are often com- posed of many short-term objectives, such as preparing figures for apaper. Short-term goals are the ones written on your weekly andmonthly calendars\u2014the small, concrete, finite tasks that can swallowyour is based on the ses- sion \"Time Management\" that was held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management. The session was organized by Maryrose E. Franko, Ph.D., Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), with presentations by Todd Golub, M.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (also HHMI associate investigator); Richard Reis, Ph.D., Stanford University; and Sandra L. Schmid, Ph.D.,The Scripps Research Institute. Additional information was obtained from Milton W. Datta, M.D., Medical College of Wisconsin, and some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 94BWF/rhombus6HHMIGetting from Here to There Take the time to craft a formal plan, beginning with your long-term goals.Then set interim goals along the way that are realistic indicators of progress. By settingachievable goals, you avoid having too much to do and not knowing where tobegin.Accomplishing just one goal can serve as a powerful motivator to tackle thenext goal. Write down all your goals, with each achievement tied to a specific time frame. Putting your ideas into words can help refine your thinking and provide a concretechecklist to keep you on target. Every so often, take a look at your plans, reflect onthem, and revise them as appropriate to changing circumstances. Priorities shift; beprepared to reevaluate yours but also to defend them. Long-term goals. These goals can be achieved in three to five years. Before jotting down your long-term plans, first ask yourself where you want to be after this stage inyour career. For example, if you are a postdoc, do you plan on an academic or applied position? At what type of institution\u2014a research-intensive institution, teaching col-lege, other? Now ask yourself,\"What will I need to accomplish to make myself com-petitive for that job?\" If you are an assistant professor, you probably want to worktoward tenure. Knowing when you 'll be up for tenure, ask yourself,\"What will I need to do by then\u2014how many papers, invited seminars, professional meetings, andother accomplishments?\" Intermediate-term goals. These goals can be achieved in six months to one year. For example, as a postdoc you should be thinking about the experiments needed to complete your next paper or to put together a poster. Completing publishable chunksis an essential intermediate-term goal for faculty. Other such goals are obtaining pre-liminary results for a grant, putting together a new course, and organizing a meeting. Short-term goals. These goals can be achieved in one week to one month.They include preparing figures for the paper you're writing, completing an experiment,preparing reagents for the next set of experiments, or writing letters and makingphone calls to secure a seminar invitation. If you find it hard to get organized, make adaily or weekly to-do list and check tasks off as you complete them. Making Choices Saying no, saying yes. One of the simplest things you can do to streamline your life is, for many people, also one of the hardest: Learn to say no. Remember, you can'tdo everything, please everyone, be available to everyone, and at the same time be anideal teacher and scholar.There are certain tasks you must say no to and others forwhich it's fine to deliver a less than stellar performance. Making such choices willThe key is to identify what matters to you in terms of inter- ests and values and then to apportion your activities through-out the day and week to address all of them. \u2014Richard Reis, Stanford University''''Chapter 6 Time Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 95allow you to focus on doing an outstanding job in what's truly important to you. Establishing these priorities depends on the intermediate- and long-term goals youhave set for yourself. Saying yes judiciously will make it easier for you to say no to things you do not want to do. Because you must accept some administrative assignments, try to make themwork for you. Explore the options, and sign up early for duties that either interest you or will work to your advantage professionally.This will then allow you to turn down administrative duties that have less value to you. Disconnecting. Part of saying no is also not being available on demand.T oday's technological \"conveniences\" are often needless interruptions to concentration.Anysound strategy for time management involves learning to disconnect\u2014be the masterof those tools rather than their servant. MANAGING YOUR TIME DAY TO DAY Many people find long-term goals easy to set\u2014for example,\"I want to be a full pro-fessor by the age of X.\" More difficult is thedaily multitasking\u2014managing the flood ofsmall chores that can threaten to drown eventhe most organized professional.This sectioncovers how to make the most of the timeyou have. Finding Some Extra Time To be able to focus and think creatively, you need blocks of uninterrupted time. Here aresome tips to help you do this: /rhombus6 Get your e-mail under control. If you're lucky enough to have administrativehelp, have an assistant screen messagesand flag time-sensitive ones for you.Y oucan also print e-mail messages thatrequire a personal reply and hand write responses during short breaks in your day.Then have your assistant type andsend them later. If you don't have anassistant, set aside specific times of theday for reading and re sponding to e-mails or take hard copies of your e-mails homeand read them in the evening. /rhombus6 Buy an answering machine or voice-mail service. /rhombus6 Invest in a family cell phone plan to make sure you're available for familycommunication and emergencies whenyou have silenced your office phone.Seven (Not So Obvious) Keys to Working and Living Right 1.Learn how to say yes as well as how to say no. It's easier to say no to unwanted tasks ifyou have already committed to something you do want to do. 2.Establish your absence as well as your pres- ence. Set a schedule for being physically else-where and unavailable, and stick to it. 3.Do a little bit of everything as well as all of one thing. Master the art of multitasking. 4.Determine your tasks as well as your priori- ties.There are many activities, small and large,that lead to your goal. 5.Work until your time is up as well as until your task is done.Approach every task with the goal of making progress during a specificamount of time, then move on to the next taskto maintain forward momentum. 6.Bring some of your home to work as well as some of your work to home.Y ou live in bothworlds; look for ways to bring them together (e.g., if you have a long commute, leave homeearly to beat the traffic and save breakfast andthe newspaper for your office). 7.Seek to integrate your professional and per- sonal activities where appropriate as well as toseparate work and play where appropriate.Doing so can maximize your effectiveness andsatisfaction in both areas.

Reis, Stanford UniversityMaking the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 96BWF/rhombus6HHMI/rhombus6 Close your office door (or come in early).A closed door is a generally respected \"do not interrupt\" signal, and early hours might buy you precious focused time away from clamoring students and colleagues. /rhombus6 Close your lab door. Securing uninterrupted time in the lab is of paramount importance to your career. /rhombus6 Make, and keep, appointments with yourself: Find a quiet hide away and use it on a scheduled basis.This practice trains people to expect you to be inacces- sible at predictable times. Having Trouble Concentrating? If you tend to have difficulty focusing on one task for long periods, you can turn this potential weakness into a strength through multitasking. Make sure that you alwayshave several things to work on, perhaps three or four, and cycle through them withincreasing lengths of time. Because it allows you to make progress simultaneously onmultiple tasks, this approach can help you /rhombus6 Reduce stress as deadlines approach because the work is well along /rhombus6 Make headway on necessary tasks you don't want to do /rhombus6 Improve your sense of accomplishment and control over your workload Setting Priorities On the basis of your goals, decide what you need to do and when, and follow the classic KISS rule: Keep It Simple, Stupid.A grid that allows you to rank short-termclaims on your attention according to urgency and importance can be a useful tool(see figure 6.1).Try to control the not urgent/not important quadrant.Y ou get rela-tively little value for the time spent doing tasks in this quadrant.The urgent/impor-tant quadrant puts you in crisis mode, where few people operate best. For maximumefficiency, you should be spending most of your time in the upper right-hand quad-rant on tasks that are important but not urgent. Source: Sandra L.

Making the Most of the Time Y ou Have It's important to find ways to make efficient and productive use of your time. Be aware that for some activities, it may not be immediately apparent that your time spent is worthwhile. For example, attending seminars in your department can actuallybe a productive and efficient use of your time. Not only will you learn new informa-tion, but if you ask questions, you will also boost your visibility. Efficiency. Successful people tend to be efficient.They have evolved practices to create blocks of uninterrupted time for \"brain work.\" Here are some tips to help you make the best use of those parts of the dayyou control: /rhombus6Create an environment conducive to productivity. Make a place for every- thing, and put everything in its place;clutter is inefficient. Find or make aquiet space (or time) to work. /rhombus6Know your biological clock, and protect your most productive hours for your experiments and critical tasks. /rhombus6During your protected work hours, focus and don't allow interruptions. /rhombus6Eliminate unnecessary tasks. /rhombus6 Avoid procrastination. Start tasks early\u2014at least in outline. If you have a grant due, write your goals early enough to let your lab staff start gathering relevant data without last-minute panic. If a critical reagent requires a long lead timeto produce, start it early enough to make sure it's ready when you need it. /rhombus6 Structure and supervise meetings. /rhombus6 Delegate work. /rhombus6 Get a high-speed Internet connection at home.Question: How do I resolve the competing demands of doing my own bench work versusguiding the work of postdocs and lab staff? Answer: Focus on what you're fied to usually includes mentorship andscientific management; just about everything elsecan be done well by others. Until you have goodpostdocs and trained students and technicians,you'll have to do more work yourself. But as your lab evolves, you'll have more freedom to decide the ways in which you will trust your labmembers to carry out your research agenda.Fitting it all in. Successful people also learn to use small units of time, capitalizing on free minutes here and there (in many professions, people bill their time in incre-ments of 15 minutes or less). Returning phone calls, drafting memos, and reviewingyour weekly schedule are just a few ways in which you can put a few minutes to work for you throughout the day.The trick is to be prepared when those moments arise by having messages or e-mail, students' homework, a notepad, and perhaps a cellphone with you. Some tasks, such as reviewing papers and reading science magazines,adapt well to commuting time if you don't drive. Improving Y our Lab Staff's Time Management Skills Here are some tips for helping your staff work more efficiently: /rhombus6 Establish clear goals and expectations early, starting with simple tasks your staff can handle. Make sure they understand the task. Reward and correct them as appropriate, expand the tasks, then repeat the process. /rhombus6 Help them seek advice without taking up unnecessary time.T each them how to describe projects, issues, and problems accurately and efficiently. /rhombus6 Develop an agenda for every meeting\u2014and stick to it. Start meetings with a clear description of the purpose of the meeting and when it will end. /rhombus6 After meetings, send a \"Dear gang\" follow-up letter containing a summary and to-do list. Use these informal minutes to start the next meeting and gauge progress. (Meeting minutes are also useful for patent protections inestablishing proof of an idea, attribution, and date.) Once the members of your lab learn the importance of time management, you can also delegate to a key staffperson the task of summarizing meetings and assigning follow-up actions.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 98BWF/rhombus6HHMIHaving a high-speed Internet connection at home has revolu- tionized our lives. I can be home at 5:00, put the kids to bed,get on the PC, and do everything from home. It has reallyimproved our parenting and family abilities with more efficienttime management. \u2014Milton Datta, Medical College of Wisconsin'''' Be prepared to take advantage of small chunks of time. In 5 to 10 minutes, you can make a quick phone call, handle an e-mail requiring a personal response, or fill out a form. \u2014Sandra Schmid,The Scripps Research Institute'' ''Chapter 6 Time Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 99SPECIAL ISSUES Managing Committee Service Commitments Committee duties can connect you with interesting people\u2014in your department, your institution, and beyond.They can also help bring your research to the attention of your colleagues\u2014a genuine plus for a beginning faculty member. But how can you avoid spreading yourself thin with committee service obligations? Be proactive and seek out committee service that suits your interests and schedule soyou can turn down other requests with the legitimate excuse of previous committee commitments.Women and underrepresented minorities need to be particularly goodat saying no because they're frequently asked to serve on committees.Investment of time to train others does pay off in time efficiencies. \u2014Richard Reis, Stanford University When your lab members report to you on a project, request that they first provide some context and then organize whatthey tell you in concise bullet points of information:\"I'mgoing to tell you about this morning's experiment.This wasthe result.This is what I think it means.This is what I planto do tomorrow.\"With this strategy, a five-minute interactioncan get you immediately connected to what the person is doing. \u2014T odd Golub, HHMI and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute '''' Try to volunteer for something that you care about or that would benefit you. For example, the graduate admissions com-mittee is often of great interest to a starting assistant professor.Then use these commitments as a reason to decline otheropportunities for committee work that come along. So the nexttime someone comes and tells you about this great committeethat they would like you to sit on, say,\"I would really love todo that, but it turns out I just agreed to do this huge graduateadmissions committee job. It's going to be very time-consumingand it's so important.\"And then they will nod understanding-ly and, hopefully, walk out the door and not ask you again. \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 100 BWF/rhombus6HHMIResearch and T eaching If you're in a department that values good teaching and you're thinking about tenure, if you want your course material to be up to date and engaging, or if you are respon-sible for difficult material you don't fully understand, you may find yourself dedicat-ing a large portion of your time to teaching at the expense of everything else. For thesake of your research career, you must learn to control your class-related hours. Howcan you do this? HHMI President Thomas Cech, recounts the method he used whileon the faculty of the University of Colorado-Boulder, which can be summed up as\"limit your preparation time\": If I had a 10:00 a.m. class, I would start preparing three or four hours before, and whatever I got done in those hours, that was it. I couldn't solve all of theproblems with my lecture, but spending more time wasn't going to make the lec-ture that much better.And after 11:00, I had the rest of the day for my research. As your classroom experience and confidence grow, you can whittle down prepara- tion time.Another approach is to schedule a 30-minute appointment with a localexpert on the subject that you have to teach before you teach it. Other tips for controlling preparation and classroom time include /rhombus6 Admit your ignorance.When you can't answer a question, it's perfectly per- missible to say so. In fact, it's far better than trying to fudge an answer. Instead, acknowledge that it's a good question, you don't know the answer,and you'll check it out. Or ask the student to find the answer and reportback to the class. /rhombus6 Triage the information for your students.Y ou can't know every subject exhaustively and don't need to; neither do your students. Clarify what you expect them to learn, and focus your lectures on that information. Focusingon the really important \"take-home points\" limits your preparation time andtheir questions. /rhombus6 Arrange to teach the same course for three consecutive years.That span will permit you to refine the material and your technique without burning out. Even though it is difficult, you have to set limits for nonresearch tasks and stick to them.When time is up for one task, move on to the next item in your daily planner.This way, you start each day anew without carrying forward serious work deficitsthat accumulate throughout the week.As a guideline, one senior scientist advises thatregardless of how much office work you have, as a beginning principal investigator, you should be spending the equivalent of at least two full days in the laboratory every week. The Triple Load of the Physician-Scientist: Lab, Class, and Clinic Although physician-scientists may have some teaching duties, these duties usually aren't extensive.The larger challenge is balancing lab and clinical time.An even splitbetween the lab and clinic is increasingly rare; it can be as much as 80 percent laband 20 percent clinic. Here are some tips for straddling the lab and the clinic.Chapter 6 Time Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 101In the lab: /rhombus6 Get help early. /rhombus6 Separate lab management from scientific management and mentorship. If possible, hire someone interested in and trained for lab management. /rhombus6 Focus on what you're uniquely qualified to do. /rhombus6 Focus on what you're actually trained to do. In the clinic: /rhombus6 Tell patients how you want to be contacted. /rhombus6 Use support staff effectively. /rhombus6 Learn to tell patients when you have to stop. /rhombus6 Make patients and colleagues aware of your dual roles. Remember, in the lab, in the clinic, and at home\u2014don't suffer in silence. If a patient's poor condition affects your mood and concentration, tell your colleagues and family.Patients care is a major responsibility, and it's reasonable for your clinical care time to affect other aspects of your life. Home and Work: Can Y ou Have It All? This question applies to many professionals in high-pressure careers, including both male and female scientists pursuing academic career tracks. Family communication. It helps to start with a supportive spouse and family. Have clear discussions about career and personal goals\u2014yours and those of your family\u2014early on.T o avoid the resentments of unspoken and unmet expectations, be as explicitas possible about your aspirations with those who are important to you. Shared goalsfor work and family make compromises easier. Balancing work and family. Unquestionably, children complicate the equation, but they can also provide the sanity, personal satisfaction, and motivation to make you a more focused and efficient scientist. Few professionals are willing to forgo havingchildren in order to facilitate career advancement, nor should they. High-quality daycare, domestic services, shopping conveniences, etc., make raising a family and havinga challenging career sustainable and enriching. Indeed, being the boss (i.e., running alab) can give you the flexibility and the financial resources to make the choices andtime commitment adjustments necessary to maintain a balanced lifestyle. Here aresome tips for balancing work and family life: /rhombus6 Take advantage of options for assistance in cooking, cleaning, and other domestic chores, and don't waste energy feeling guilty.When your budget allows (and in the early years, it may not), buy yourself time: Hire help withhousecleaning\u2014even if you can afford only semimonthly scouring of thebathrooms and kitchen. Until then, a messy (but reasonably clean) housewon't hurt you or the kids. Later, a nanny or housekeeper (who also does laundry) is worth the investment.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 102 BWF/rhombus6HHMI/rhombus6 Eat out with your family once a week or once in a while, even if it's fast food.This is an easy family-focused activity you can enjoy together outside the house. /rhombus6 Pick up carryout meals to eat at home.This break from cooking will stretch the dinner table time you have to share information about everyone's day and allow you to play with younger children and put them to bed. /rhombus6 Teach your children how to help out with age-appropriate chores (e.g., put- ting their clothes in a hamper, putting away clean laundry, setting the table). /rhombus6 When you do cook, keep meals simple and make large quantities that can be frozen in meal-size portions for use throughout the week. /rhombus6 If you and your spouse both work outside the house, make the best child- care arrangements you can. If you're away from y our child all day, it's espe- cially important to carve out inviolable family time on evenings or weekends. Is it possible for ambitious scientists to have it all? For those who learn to balance competing demands, the answer is a qualified yes.The key\u2014admittedly easier saidthan done\u2014is to identify what matters most to you and then to apportion youractivities throughout the day and week to address them all.The important thing is toset your priorities, learn to compromise, and be flexible.

WHAT IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? At a basic level, project management is a form of oversight\u2014 planning and supervising an activity from start to finish with the aidof graphs, charts, and procedures often implemented through a soft-ware package. It is a constant learning process, a series of flexible and iterative steps through which you identify where you want to goand a reasonable way to get there, with specifics of who will dowhat and when along the way. Project management techniques are not blinders to limit your focus, nor are they meant to change your work style. Rather, they enableyou to understand and work effectively within, or around, that style. If you find the business-oriented terminology and tools of project management off-putting, here's a tip that may be helpful:The stepsof project management are similar to the components of a grantproposal. (See chapter 9,\"Getting Funded.\") With a grant proposal,the probability of success is proportional to the thought that's goneinto it.The funder wants to see that you've thought things through.Project management is simply another name for that process.This chapter is based on the ses- sion \"Project Management\" that was held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management. The session was organized by Jim Austin, Ph.D.,American Association for the Advancement of Science, and presented by Stanley E. Portny, Stanley E. Portny and Associates. Milton W. Datta, M.D., Medical College of Wisconsin, provided the scientific examples to illustrate how proj- ect management tools are used to plan and track research projects. Additional information was obtained from some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 104 BWF/rhombus6HHMIGETTING STARTED Projects run the gamut from simple to complex, from informal to formal, and from familiar to novel. Every project starts with two questions:\"Should I do it?\" and\"Can I do it?\" Once you've determined that the project is both desirable (its poten-tial benefits outweigh its projected costs) and feasible, you then follow the three basicsteps of project management: /rhombus6 Planning: Develop a statement of work, define the audience, develop a work breakdown structure, schedule the project, and estimate resources. /rhombus6 Organizing: Assign tasks and responsibilities. /rhombus6 Controlling: Monitor, review, revise as appropriate, communicate, and manage risk. The next sections focus on these steps. Questions you should ask and tools to help you answer them are included, as well as real-life examples of how these questions and tools are used to plan and track a scientific project. PLANNING THE PROJECT Develop the Statement of Work Think of a project as a journey. From a known starting point to a desired destination, you map out details of the trip\u2014which, for your purposes, may not necessarily be the fastest or most direct route. In project management parlance, your trip planner is the statement of work, and everything else flows from it.The statement of work shouldinclude the following sections: Purpose. This section should include /rhombus6 Background: Why the project was initiated and by whom, what happens if it's not done, and what else relates to it. /rhombus6 Scope of work: What you will do\u2014a brief statement describing the major work to be performed. /rhombus6 Strategy: How you plan to perform the work. Objectives. Objectives are the end results to be achieved by the project. Each objec- tive should include /rhombus6 Statement: A description of the desired outcome when the project is done.A detailed, well-designed project plan is one of the sharpest tools available for convincing a funder, such as NSF or NIH,to give you the resources you require. \u2014Stan Portny, Stanley E. Portny and Associates'' ''Chapter 7 Project Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 105/rhombus6 Measures: Indicators to assess how well you have achieved the desired outcome. /rhombus6 Specifications: Target values of the meas- ures that define successful results. Constraints. These are the restrictions on the project, which fall into two categories:limitations and needs. Limitations are con-straints set by others, and needs are constraintsset by the project team. Assumptions. These are the unknowns you posit in developing the plan\u2014statementsabout uncertain information you will take asfact as you conceive, plan, and perform the project (e.g., you may assume that no one willleave the project before a certain milestone isreached). Be aware that as your project progresses, your goals may change. Build in periodic reviewsof results against objectives and revise theobjectives if necessary. No matter how muchyou've invested in a project, it's never too late to redirect or stop work altogether if you dis-cover, for example, that another route is morepromising than the main avenue of research,an important calculation was botched, or akey premise was off base. Define the Audience Any of your audiences\u2014the people and groups that have an interest in your project, are affected by it, or are needed to support it\u2014can sink the entire enterprise if notconsidered at suitable stages. Early on, you should make a list of the project's audi-ences, both within your institution and outside it.Although you can do this in yourhead, a written list serves as a reminder throughout the project to touch base withthese people as you proceed.When you are writing a grant, creating an audience listfocuses your attention on these key players and helps you shape strategies to keepthem happy and accommodate their needs.The same principles apply to other typesof projects. Divide your audience list into three categories: /rhombus6 Drivers: People who tell you what to do, defining to some degree what your project will produce and what constitutes success.As a principal investigator, you are the main driver for your research.Additional drivers might include other scientists working in the field, the editors of scientific journals (e.g., ifthey are advising you on what experiments should be done in order to get amanuscript published), and the study section reviewers of the research grants(e.g., if their feedback is shaping the course of your research project).Question: Isn't it possible that a full under- standing up front of the scope of work involvedmay discourage us from trying and accomplish-ing worthwhile work? Answer: The goal is to allocate resources in a sensible way.The more information you have atthe outset, the better you'll be at allocatingresources.The better you are at allocating resources for the work that has to get done (e.g., the experiments proposed in your fundedgrant), the more likely you will be able to savesome funds for more speculative projects (e.g.,an interesting side project that may result in anew grant). Question: Given the uncertainties in science, is it possible to reassess and redefine goals? Answer: Absolutely. Project management isn't meant to be rigid or blindly restrictive. Indeed, bysystematizing the regular reexamination of goalsand circumstances, project management encour-ages reconsideration of which path is best.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 106 BWF/rhombus6HHMIStatement of Work: A Real-Life Example Section 1: Purpose Background. Theresa, a postdoc in the laboratory, wants to examine the possible role of Sumacan in prostate cancer. She noted that Sumacan, a growth factor receptor gene that our lab is studying,maps to a genetic region involved in human prostate cancer. Current studies in the lab focus on therole of Sumacan in brain tumors. Bob, a postdoc, is examining drugs to block Sumacan function; Ming Li, a graduate student, is working on elucidating the Sumacan functional pathway; and Steve, a gradu-ate student, is performing a mutational analysis of the Sumacan gene.These studies can be extendedto prostate cancer, thereby opening up new avenues for funding through prostate cancer foundations. Scope of work /rhombus6 Demonstrate that the functional pathway for Sumacan is present in human prostate cancer cells. /rhombus6 Examine the expression of Sumacan in human prostate tissues and prostate cancers, and correlate expression levels with clinical outcome in prostate cancer. /rhombus6 Identify mutations in Sumacan in patients with prostate cancer. Strategy. Each person in the lab is already working on different aspects of Sumacan biology in brain tumors. In each case, the work will be translated to prostate cancer cell lines that we willobtain from Mike, a colleague in our department. In addition, we have identified two potential collab-orators\u2014Rajiv, a pathologist who studies human prostate tissues and cancers, and Kathy, a geneticistwho studies human prostate cancer families, who will help us examine the role of Sumacan inhuman prostate cancer. Using our preliminary findings, we aim to obtain National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for this project, which would provide a second R01 grant to the laboratory. Section 2: Objectives Statement. Investigate the possible role of Sumacan in prostate cancer. Measures 1. Appropriateness of the experiments that are done Specification /rhombus6 Experiments must address the following questions: Is Sumacan expressed in the prostate? Is Sumacan expressed in prostate cancer?Is there a difference between the expression of Sumacan in the prostate and in prostate cancer?Chapter 7 Project Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 1072. Quality of laboratory research Specifications /rhombus6 Acceptance for publication of two articles in a top-tier research journal /rhombus6 Upon submission of a request to NIH for funds to continue the research begun, receipt of a percentile score on first-round submission of at least 25% and subsequent funding on the resubmission 3. Awareness of the research by people in the field Specifications /rhombus6 Several requests received for information about the research /rhombus6 At least two publications about the research in the scientific literature /rhombus6 At least two conferences at which papers on the research results are presented Section 3: Constraints Limitations /rhombus6 The NIH proposal is due June 1, 2004.This means that the first scientific manuscript must be submitted to a journal by approximately January 1, 2004, and accepted by mid-April 2004. /rhombus6 Our lab has limited funds to cover the generation of preliminary data, which means that productivity has to be reviewed monthly. Needs /rhombus6 Our lab needs to be able to grow prostate cancer cells. /rhombus6 Our lab needs to be able to handle human prostate cancer specimens. Section 4: Assumptions /rhombus6 The current research team will be willing and able to perform prostate cancer studies (in addition to their brain tumor studies). /rhombus6 The collaborators will be able to work with our group or will provide the name of another person who wants to collaborate.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 108 BWF/rhombus6HHMI/rhombus6 Supporters: People who will perform the work or make the work possible (e.g., the students and postdocs in your lab aswell as the program director for the organization that is funding the project). /rhombus6 Observers: People who have an interest in your project but are neither drivers nor supporters\u2014they're interested in whatyou're doing, but they're not telling you what to do or how to do it (e.g., otherscientists working in your field). Why do you need an audience list? Because a project can succeed only if everyone involved does his or her part.T o increase theodds of that happening, it helps to think about who has an interest in your projectand what that interest is. To avoid misunderstandings down the line, it's a good idea to make sure that all your audi-ences agree about which group\u2014or groups\u2014they belong in. For example, your departmentchair may be a driver, a supporter, or anobserver, depending on your relationship withhim or her.As you work on the project, revisethe list as necessary. Categorizing audiences is less difficult than it may look, and you don't have to start fromscratch for every activity. Many of the samepeople are likely to be on your audience listover time for different activities. Develop the Work Breakdown Structure One of the most important benefits of project management is that it helps you more accu-rately anticipate how much time a project willtake and what resources you need.The workbreakdown structure, or WBS, is an outline ofall the work that will have to be performed inyour project.The WBS corresponds to a research plan in a grant proposal.The WBS is relevant for just about any undertaking because every project has distinct steps that must be performed.The WBS is a hierarchy of increas-ing levels of detail. Start with broad workassignments, break them down into tasks, anddivide these tasks into discrete subtasks, if thatlevel of detail is needed (see figure 7.1).Question: We usually have open-ended activi- ties. Is it appropriate to go off on tangents notcommitted to a particular audience? Answer: Yes, but, as in other situations, you should clarify your focus.What constitutes suc-cess for you? What do you need to do toachieve that success? For example, your focusmight be to secure future funding or publishpapers. From that new focus, identify whobelongs in your audience list.

Activity/T ask 1Determine whether Sumacan is expressed in the prostate.Activity/T ask 2 Determine whether Sumacan is expressed in prostate cancer cells.What level of detail is necessary? To decide whether a particular part of the proj- ect is detailed enough, ask yourself three questions: /rhombus6 Can you come up with a reasonable estimate of the resources required for this work? /rhombus6 Can you come up with a reasonable estimate of the time required to do this work? /rhombus6 Would anyone to whom this task is delegated understand it well enough to do it to your satisfaction? If the answer to any of these questions is \"no,\" more detail is necessary. One function of a WBS is to help your sup- porters carry out the work.The level of detailyou need depends, in part, on who those sup- porters are. Most undergraduates will needmore detail than an experienced postdoc ortechnician. When you develop a WBS, think in one- to two-week increments.Y ou probably wouldn't want to include detailed plans for activities that take less time (e.g., experiments to be done each day). But keep in mind that this, like most specific project managementguidelines, is merely a rule of thumb. In science, it's unlikely that you'll be able to make a detailed plan very far in advance. Much of the detailed planning will be done \"on the fly\" as the project proceeds.Trya rolling approach, in which you revise estimates in more detail as you progressthrough the project. But even if you don't end up following your detailed plan, mak-ing such a plan can be beneficial.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 110 BWF/rhombus6HHMIElectronic T ools of the Trade: Project Management Software Project management software is handy, especially for large and long-term projects. For example, it can help you spot resource conflicts (such as one person assigned to three overlapping activities)and identify which activities can be delayed to accommodate that problem without jeopardizing theschedule. Good software helps you brainstorm the organization of activities on screen, create aWBS, link activities, develop a schedule, identify resources, maintain information on progress, andgenerate reports.When you make a change, the software reflects the impact of that changethroughout the project. Like other software, project management programs come with bells and whistles you may never need or use. Remember that software is merely a tool to help you plan and organize your work. Itshould not become your work, bogging you down in complex manipulations or fancy graphs and charts that look impressive but don't improve on simpler presentations of the information.A goodrule for all software is \"Use what you need and ignore the rest.\" Microsoft Project is one of numerous such software programs. For information about others, see http://www.project-management-software.org .Question: Is project management a top-down or a mutual process? Answer: It must be mutual. For the best possi- ble outcome, you need both staff insights and\"buy-in.\" Project management does not say,\"Forget thinking and just do what I say.\" It's aprocess for identifying what to think about, not howto think about it.Chapter 7 Project Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 111The WBS will support the planning, organizing, and tracking functions in the next steps. Specifically, it will help you schedule the project and its parts, estimateresources, assign tasks and responsibilities, and control the project. (For more informa- tion about this tool, see http://www.4pm.com/articles/work_breakdown_structure.htm , cited in Portny and Austin,\"Project Management for Scientists.\") Using the WBS to delegate tasks. The resources of a lab as a whole are delegated differently for different projects, but a WBS can help in setting up the lab and divid-ing big tasks into smaller ones\u2014for example, ordering equipment, hiring staff, anddealing with compliance issues. Encourage your staff to develop a WBS for each oftheir projects. Schedule the Project Project schedules should include realistic esti- mates of how long it will take to performeach activity and the order in which theactivities are to be performed.The tool forthis step is a network diagram, a flow chart ofthe proposed work showing the sequence andtime associated with each task. Network dia-grams include the following three elements: /rhombus6 Event: A milestone that signals the start or end of an activity (e.g., a paper based on preliminary data for a projectis submitted). /rhombus6 Activity: The work needed to advance from one event to the next, described with action verbs (e.g., prepare reagent, do meta-analysis of preliminary data). /rhombus6 Duration: The time necessary to finish an activity. Many factors influence how long an activity takes, such as staff commitments and equipment capacity. When you have this information, you can develop feasible schedules. Several formats can be used to organize a schedule: /rhombus6 Key events schedule: A table showing events and target dates for reaching them (see figure 7.2, page 112). /rhombus6 Activities plan: A table showing activities and their planned start and end dates (see figure 7.3, page 113). /rhombus6 Gantt chart: A graph in timeline format showing planned start, performance, and end dates for activities. /rhombus6 Combined milestone and Gantt chart: A graph in timeline format showing start, performance, and end dates for plannedactivities and when certain events will bereached (see figure 7.4, page 114).Question: If I have experiments A, B, C, and D, is it reasonable to do detailed planning only forA first and deal with the others later? Answer: That may be reasonable, but what if B isn't entirely dependent on A, and you couldhave done some work for B or any of the oth-ers without waiting until A was done? Projectmanagement tools and software can help yousee where timelines may overlap, so that youcan use your time most productively. Key Steps in Scheduling Activities and the Tools Needed 1.Identify activities (work breakdown structure). 2. Identify constraints (statement of work).3. Determine durations (network diagram).4. Decide on order of performance (network diagram). 5. Develop initial schedule (key events schedule, activities plan, Gantt chart, or combined milestone and Gantt chart). 6. Revise schedule as necessary.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 112 BWF/rhombus6HHMIKey Event (T ask)DescriptionPerson ResponsibleDate Due Comments 1 (1) Prostate cells found Theresa August 5 2 (1)Prostate cancer cells foundBob August 5 1 (2)Prostate cells successfully grownTheresa August 26 2 (2)Prostate 26 2 September 26 1 (4)RT-PCR of Sumacan from prostate cellscompleted Theresa October 26 2 (4)RT-PCR of Sumacan from prostate cancer cells completed Theresa October 26 1 (5)Western blots to demonstrateSumacan in prostatecells completed Bob October (5)Western blots to demonstrateSumacan in prostatecancer cells completedBob October (1)Comparison ofSumacan RNA levels in prostateand prostate cancercells completed Theresa BobNovember 5 3 (2)Comparison of Sumacan proteinlevels in prostateand prostate cancercells completed Theresa BobNovember 5 3 (3)Relationship between RNA andprotein levels ofSumacan determined Theresa and BobNovember 5Figure 7.2.

Estimate Resources: The Resource Matrix and Loading Chart Before you begin any project\u2014even one as seemingly clear-cut as preparing a pre- sentation\u2014you should have a thorough list of the resources required.The resource listwill be specific to each project\u2014the work you've described in the WBS and the timeframes you have developed with the network diagram. Resources include people, funds, equipment, raw materials, facilities, and information. The following tools are helpful for displaying resource requirements: /rhombus6 Resource matrix: Shows how much of a given resource you'll need for each activity in the WBS (see figure 7.5). /rhombus6 Loading chart: Shows how much of a resource you'll need at different times during an activity (see figure 7.6, page 116).Chapter 7 Project Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 115Key Event (T ask)Activity Theresa Max Bob Yvonne LaurenPrincipal Investigator 1 (1)Look for sources of prostate cells3 8 2 (1)Look for sourcesof prostate cancer cells8 8 8 1 (2)Tr y to grow prostate cells20 40 2 (2)Tr y to grow prostate cancercells 20 30 30 1 (3)Try to isolate RNA and proteinfrom prostatecells 24 44 2 (3)Try to isolate RNA and proteinfrom prostatecancer cells 24 50 50 1 (4)Try to perform RT-PCR from prostate cells100 120 2 (4)Try to perform RT-PCR from prostate cancercells100 120 1 (5)Try to perform Western blots on prostate cells100 120 120 2 (5)Try to perform Western blots on prostate cancercells100 120 120Figure 7.5.

Be sure to take into account everyone who is needed to complete each task listed on theWBS. For example, if you need specializedexpertise outside your lab for data analysis,make sure that you have identified a suitableperson, that the person has given you an esti-mate of work time he or she will require, andthat your project schedule accommodates theexpert's availability (as well as any time thatmight be needed for delivery of the data andreturn of the analyses). If your work or any part of it has been done before by others, you may have some guidancein estimating resources. Consult writtenrecords of relevant work or speak with those who were involved. However, before you rely on the experience of others, make surethe equipment, schedule, and personnel qualifications were sufficiently similar to whatyou propose. In addition, be conservative in your estimates. Nothing is more frustrat- ing than being unable to continue a project that is going well because you don't haveenough resources.Figure 7.6. Example of a loading chartThis loading chart displays Theresa's workload. She is responsible for the first three steps in Task 1. In addition, during the time the project is being run, she will be teaching a microbiol- ogy lab course (5 hours/day with monthly exams).

Do I still need to? Answer: Not for your benefit, but you have to consider whether others need to know whatyou're doing\u2014the sequence of steps as well as the materials and time required. If they do, proj-ect management tools are a useful part of therecord. Project management isn't just a planning tool, it's also a training and communication tool.ORGANIZING THE PROJECT Assign T asks and Responsibilities: The Linear Responsibility Chart The statement of work encourages you to spell out your assumptions explicitly.The WBS pushes you to think comprehensively about tasks and subtasks.A linear respon-sibility chart lets you assign a person to each of the tasks you have identified. (For theexample used throughout this chapter,Theresa is directly responsible for the prostatecell lines, RNA and protein isolation, and the RT -PCR from both the prostate cellsand prostate cancer cells. Bob is responsible for the prostate cancer cells, RNA and protein isolation, and the protein Western blotson the prostate and prostate cancer cells.)Keep in mind that responsibilities extend beyond performing core project tasks; forexample, communicating with audiences is anactivity associated with the operation of a laband its projects.The more such tasks you canidentify and assign, the more smoothly workwill proceed. (For the example used through-out this chapter, the principal investigator willcommunicate with the department chair,NIH, journal editors, and the external collab-orators;Theresa will communicate with theundergraduate student Max; and Bob willcommunicate with the high school studentsYvonne and Lauren.) Finally, an accurate assessment of the skills, experience, and limitations of your staff willhelp you match the right people to each task. Stretching is good, but overreaching is not. If your team lacks the expertise required fora critical activity, you may have to reconsider your approach or seek out a collaborator.Chapter 7 Project Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 117Question: Despite the best explanations, inex- perienced students may focus only on theirpart of the work. Are there devices to helpthem get the big picture? Answer: It's important that they do get the big picture, and project management may be part ofthe solution. Although it's true that projectmanagement encourages a focus on details, italso encourages you to consider the big picture.Students, especially smart ones, may be reluctantto admit what they don't know.Y ou can conveyto them that it's all right to ask. Get them totalk, and paraphrase what they say. If that doesn'twork, ask them to write a statement of work for their part of the project, which requires background on the entire project.The greatest chances for success are achieved when project information is used to align, guide, and motivate team mem-bers, and when these team members, in turn, use this informa-tion to guide their work. \u2014Stan Portny and Jim Austin,\"Project Management for Scientists,\" Science 's Next Wave, 2002''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 118 BWF/rhombus6HHMICONTROLLING THE PROJECT Effective project management demands that the components of a project be constantly monitored and revised as new information arises. In science, it is hard topredict how the course of a project will run. Flexible planning is needed to help youdeal with the unexpected and to keep the project under control.The following is alist to help you stay on track: /rhombus6 Anticipate and address the potential for shifts from the original plan. /rhombus6 Consider different scenarios to identify what may not unfold as you anticipate, and identify the range of ramifications. /rhombus6 Select aspects of your project that are most likely to produce deviations (e.g., a graduate student who is not familiar with interpreting experimental resultsand thus may slow progress or a techni-cian who does not aggressively follow upon orders from a slow vendor and thusmay not receive needed reagents ontime), and monitor them closely. /rhombus6 Develop strategies to reduce the likeli- hood of deviations, as well as contin- gency plans for any that occur. /rhombus6 Create indicators or defined results (such as a completed Western blot or a clearly interpretable experimental finding) thatwill help you evaluate the project againstyour stated objectives.The indicators should be clear and directly relate toyour objectives. Poorly chosen indicators are worse than none at all and may causeyou to abandon a project when in fact the objective may be sound. /rhombus6 Monitor the project carefully and consis- tently to promptly identify detours from course. /rhombus6 Implement contingency plans, and revise your master plan as necessary. This process may sound complex, but it's essential, and once you're used to it, it is easy to implement for most projects in an academic laboratory.As a scientist, youwant your research to be worthwhile, even if it doesn't proceed the way you plannedKeeping People Motivated Especially for long-term projects, it's important to encourage the project team to be enthusias-tic and to motivate them to reach key mile-stones. Paying attention to the following fourpoints can help you do that. Desirability: To stay focused and committed, people need to have a sense of value in whatthey're doing.\"What's in it for me?\" is a validquestion. Emphasize the benefit to each in-dividual of his or her work, as well as the valueto the lab and the organization. Feasibility: People have to believe that what they're attempting can be done. In fact, a majorpurpose of laying out plans in advance is todetermine and demonstrate that the project isfeasible. Progress: People need to see progress in both the small and large pictures throughout theproject.The one- to two-week increment inproject planning gives you an opportunity forperiodic motivational feedback. Reward:This is a concept that extends beyond promotions and salary increases. It's a matterof showing members of your team the value oftheir contributions.Chapter 7 Project Management BWF/rhombus6HHMI 119or produce the expected outcome. Much use- ful information can be salvaged from com-pleted (or abandoned) projects that might beconsidered unsuccessful when measuredagainst the statement of work.T o get the mostout of your investment of project resources,learn to work through the \"what ifs\" by posit-ing multiple possible outcomes and timelinesand planning ways to deal with each one. A project plan should be more than a sug- gestion but less than a straitjacket. It's impor-tant to recognize that the outcomes, enddates, and budgets specified in your plan arealways provisional.

Answer: Project management can help you anticipate and plan for their departure. Identifywho's most likely to leave and the places in theproject where that's most likely to happen.When it does happen, stop and assess theimpact on your project and determine stepsyou can take to minimize the effects.Y ou can also ask staff to stay for a while, until the proj-ect reaches a stage where their departure willbe less disruptive.BWF/rhombus6HHMI 121Chapter 8 DATA MANAGEMENT AND LABORATORY NOTEBOOKS As science explodes with new information and competition increases, and as academic scientists engage in more collaborationswith industry scientists, proper recording of laboratory activities andmanaging the volumes of data produced by a laboratory are becom-ing increasingly important. This chapter covers some of the basics: the importance of day-to-day record keeping and good practice for laboratory notebooks; what to consider when developing a system to track and store information;and finding the right data management system for you. DAY-TO-DAY RECORD KEEPING: THE LAB NOTEBOOK Why Keep Daily Records? Every person working in a lab should keep detailed records of the experiments conducted each day. Here are some reasons why. Establishing good work practices. Lab records allow your work to be reproduced by others.The records you keep should allow youand others to re-create the work and achieve the same results, there-by validating or extending your work.The records also allow you to prepare formal reports, papers, and presentations.They also serve as asource for assigning credit to lab members. Teaching the people in your lab. Scientific training involves gathering information, forming hypotheses, designing experiments,and observing results. Lab notebooks, in which these activities arecarefully recorded, can be a valuable aid in teaching your grad stu-dents, postdocs, and technicians how to analyze results, constructnew theories and tests, and retrace their steps to identify an error.This chapter is based on the ses- sion \"Data Management and Laboratory Notebooks\" that was held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management.The ses- sion was organized by Maryrose E. Franko, Ph.D., Medical Institute, with presenta- tions by David J.Adams, Ph.D., Duke University Medical Center; Howard Kanare, Construction Technology Laboratories; and Joseph M.Vinetz, M.D., University of T exas Medical Branch-Galveston.Additional information was obtained from some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 122 BWF/rhombus6HHMIMeeting contractual requirements. From grants to contracts to patent applica- tions, researchers have explicit terms and implicit expectations to meet, for whichdetailed records and data are essential. For example, the National Institutes of Healthhas the legal right to audit and examine records that are relevant to any researchgrant award.Accordingly, the recipients of research grants have an obligation to keep appropriate records. Avoiding fraud. Lab directors are respon- sible for the integrity of their lab and every-thing it produces. Periodic checks of raw datain notebooks and project files can uncoverand correct carelessness or outright fraudbefore it becomes a huge problem. Defending patents. U.S.patent law follows a first-to-conceive rather than a first-to-file sys-tem.That is why documentation to support thedate of discovery or invention is critical andwhy pages of lab notebooks and other recordsshould be consecutively numbered, dated, andsigned. Careful records can save a patent. Good Practice for Laboratory Notebooks Although individual scientists are responsible for maintaining their own notebooks, heads oflabs are responsible for making sure that thenotebooks of those under their direction are inorder.The precise way in which to documentscientific research varies from field to field andfrom institution to institution, but some gener-al rules apply, such as the following: /rhombus6 Use a permanently bound book, with consecutive signed and dated entries. When appropriate, witness entries as well.Enter allyour work in a notebook\u2014even procedures that did not work. \u2014David Adams, Duke University Medical Center Reading notebooks is a nonconfrontational way to keep current with your students' and postdocs' work, and notebooks are crit-ical when these lab members leave. \u2014Joseph Vinetz, University of T exas Medical Branch-Galveston'''' Question: For patent purposes, what's an \"original\" record? Answer: An original is the first human- readable form\u2014for example, a printout of a measurement but not a photocopy of it. Itshould be dated, signed, and filed. Question: Genomics produces massive amounts of data. If the data are burned on aCD, are they considered \"original\"? Answer: In this era of computer-assisted research, many pieces of data are collected, stored, and analyzed by computer.The problemwith electronic records is that it is hard toprove that the data are not added to, deletedfrom, or in some way tampered with.The Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) has publishedclear guidelines for maintaining electronicrecords in a way that will meet legal scrutiny ( http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/part11/ ). If you have really important results, it is probablysafer to print them out, sign and date the docu-ments, and indicate why they are significant.Chapter 8 Data Management and Laboratory Notebooks BWF/rhombus6HHMI 123/rhombus6 For computer-kept logs, you can use a loose-leaf notebook, but pages must be consecutively numbered (using a sequen-tial page-number stamp), dated, andsigned. /rhombus6 Record entries chronologically. /rhombus6 Each entry should stand on its own to permit others to replicate the work. /rhombus6 Organize material with sections and headings. /rhombus6 Identify and describe reagents and speci- mens used. /rhombus6 Identify sources of those materials (e.g., reagent manufacturer, lot number, purity, expiration date). /rhombus6 Enter instrument serial numbers and cal- ibration dates. /rhombus6 Use proper nouns for items. /rhombus6 Write all entries in the first person, and be specific about who did the work. /rhombus6 Explain nonstandard abbreviations. /rhombus6 Use ink and never obliterate original writing; never remove pages or portions of a page. /rhombus6 If a page is left blank or a space within a page is left blank, draw a line through it. /rhombus6 Permanently affix with glue any attach- ments (such as graphs or computer printouts) to the pages of the notebook;date and sign both the notebook pageand the attachment. /rhombus6 Outline new experiments, including their objectives and rationale. /rhombus6 Include periodic factual, not speculative, summaries of status and findings. /rhombus6 Enter ideas and observations into your notebook immediately. Summarize discussions from lab meetings and ideas or suggestions made by others, citing the persons by name.Question: Why should I learn to write in the notebook? Answer: You want to create an accurate, origi- nal, permanent record.There is a tendency torecord information on the handiest piece of paper available, even on a paper towel lying ona bench, and then later transferring the infor-mation to a notebook.Therefore, you shouldget into the habit of immediately recordingdata as they are being collected into your labnotebook. Question: What's the responsible way to doc- ument errors? Answer: Make the required changes as soon as possible without obliterating the originalentry. Electronic documents may require a newentry, not an override. If the error is logged byhand, do not erase or alter the initial entry.Correct the data at the point in the log wherethe error was discovered, refer to the originalpage, and go on (e.g.,\"Reagent was 50 percentof the strength we originally thought.\"). Question: How do I get people in my lab to keep good records? Answer: All students, technicians, and post- docs should be issued their own laboratorynotebooks, with instructions on how to recordin them. Establish expectations early and re-inforce them periodically.The job interview isnot too early to describe expected lab record-keeping methods and media. Many lab heads have a system for regularly reviewing all labnotebooks.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 124 BWF/rhombus6HHMIWhen Is a Witness Warranted? Some companies require that all notebook pages be witnessed. In academia, few labs fol-low this practice, but under some circum-stances, having a certain record signed by awitness is desirable. Learn to recognize an entry that merits a witness. When you think you have con- ceived an invention or an idea that may haveintellectual property value, the date you did sois when you want a witness. For example, iflunch with a colleague leads you to an idea sotantalizing that you simply must go write itdown, that's a notebook page you want wit-nessed.Another important date from a patentlaw standpoint is when the idea is put intoactual practice, called \"reduction to practice\"(see chapter 11,\"Understanding T echnologyTransfer\"). Learn who constitutes an appropriate witness. Although a witness serves a certify- ing function much like a notary public, unlikea notary, a witness needs a sound grasp of thescience. However, the witness should notbe a co-inventor, who, from a legal perspective, has a vested interest in verifying the claim. Find someone who is not directly involved inyour work but who understands and can explain your idea.Y ou may also need differ- ent people to witness pages containing different ideas. Do not designate one personas the \"official\" witness in your lab. Rote signatures unsupported by suitable scientificcredentials will not meet the standard for credibility in court. Where and How Long to Keep the Notebook Lab notebooks that are \"in progress\" should be kept in the lab and reviewed periodi- cally. Usually, notebooks are kept on a lab bench, but if you are concerned about therisk of damage or contamination, make it a rule that at the end of each day, all lab notebooks are placed in a fireproof cabinet or other designated space. Completed lab notebooks should be indexed and kept in a safe central repository, along with corresponding patent applications or patents. Notebooks should be cata-logued. Every time someone takes a notebook, it should be checked out and thenreturned.A person who is leaving the lab for a position elsewhere should not take any original lab notebooks but could be allowed to take copies of the lab notebookshe or she has maintained. In general, the principal investigator should keep notebooks for at least five years after funding for the study ends.At that point, the notebooks can continue to be stored onsite or moved to a storage facility. For anything that has been patented, the generalrule is that the corresponding lab notebooks should be kept for the life of the patentElectronic Laboratory Notebooks Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) do everything their handwritten forebears do but with the attractive bonus of search and organi-zation functions.Through links to analyticalsoftware, ELNs can usually download and storedata directly, and many ELNs also supportsecure access for multiple users and remoteusers. Choosing the right ELN for your lab requires homework. One important consideration iswhether the ELN complies with the FDA'srules for acceptance of electronic documents,which were published in March 1997 in title 21of the Code of Federal Regulations ,part 11, avail- able online at http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/part11/ . So far, few ELNs have been subjected to legal scrutiny, and it is doubtful that many wouldpass the test. For this reason, most researchersin academic and industry settings are stickingto paper records.Chapter 8 Data Management and Laboratory Notebooks BWF/rhombus6HHMI 125plus six years.Y our institution may have specific policies for you to follow. If you move to a new institution, you should also check your old institution's policies; someinstitutions require departing faculty to leave their original lab notebooks. TRACKING AND STORING INFORMATION Developing a Data Management System Take the time to think about and produce a plan to track and store data generated by the people in your lab. Some requirements of your system will include the following: /rhombus6 Ability to sort and search. If you want to be able to sort data in your sys- tem by a particular criterion, the information has to be entered as a sortable field.Try to identify at the beginning all the ways you might want to retrieveyour data later.This is a challenging but productive exercise in thinking ahead. /rhombus6 Consistency. For comparability, you need standards that are followed consis- tently. If everyone in your lab uses a different document-naming protocol, the departure of one person can create chaos. Decide on a consistent systemfor the file names of electronic and paper documents as well as the identifica-tion of samples and specimens\u2014everything that your lab catalogues andstores. Figures 8.1 and 8.2 (page 126) present examples of alphanumeric cod-ing systems for electronic documents and specimens. /rhombus6 Ability to update records. It is important that you set up a system for log- ging in reagents and that everyone in the lab uses the system. Assign Responsibility It's not enough to have a data management plan; someone needs to make sure the plan is executed. Because this is your lab, it's your responsibility\u2014to handle personallyor to delegate. Once you have made that choice, put quality assurance procedures inplace, including scheduled spot checks of your established procedures. Make sure thateveryone in your lab knows what to store where, how to do it, and who needs to log in that information. What to Store and How You will likely want to store the following: /rhombus6 Lab protocols /rhombus6 Primary data, including imagesEvery gel should be dried down and put in the lab note- book\u2014even negative results. \u2014Joseph Vinetz, University of T exas Medical Branch-Galveston''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 126 BWF/rhombus6HHMICR0216G XRD01 A347.xls Project number File type: Sample D b, c, etc.) Notebook number Page number Sequential number, on page and splitFigure 8.1. Electronic document file names Figure 8.2. Sample and specimen IDsSource: Howard Kanare, Construction T echnology Laboratories Source: Howard Kanare, T echnology Laboratories/rhombus6 Lists of specimens and reagents /rhombus6 Information about instruments Where and how long you keep this information will likely be dictated by the type of information, but you also need to consider issues of lab space, fees and security issuesfor off-site storage, and the shelf life of the materials being stored. Here are somegeneral guidelines. Printed records. Records written in ink on acid-free paper and laser-printed records can be archived for a long time; ideal conditions are approximately 50 percent relative humidity and 21C or cooler. Electronic records. In theory, CD-ROMs and DVDs can last more than 200 years when stored in the dark at 25C and 40 percent relative humidity. Floppy disks, how-ever, have a shelf life of only about three years. Similarly, magnetic media are not designed for long-term storage.Another point to consider is whether the hardwareand software needed to read the information will be available in the long term. Lab protocols. Many labs keep a master collection of lab protocols, which is avail- able either electronically or in print and is updated periodically by the revised ver-sions kept in each lab member's own files. Lab protocols are rarely the type of recordsyou need to store for the long term. Reagents. It is important to have a system in place for keeping track of reagents that are used in your lab.While work is in progress, maintain records about the reagentsused and keep the reagents themselves easily accessible in storage. Database programssuch as FileMaker are easy to use and useful for keeping track of items such as oligos,antisera, plasmids, and cell lines. Many labs also use Excel spreadsheets or even paperrecords.When people leave the lab, have them place their unique reagents in storage boxes and document their location. Make sure everyone in the lab updates the data-base regularly. You will also need a reliable tracking system for the sharing of reagents\u2014requesting them from other sources and transferring yours to other labs.This involves Requestfor Materials forms and Material Transfer Agreement forms (see chapter 11,\"Understanding T echnology Transfer\"). Instrument histories. The care and maintenance of equipment are important responsibilities that affect the entire lab. Make sure someone accepts them and follows through. Lab records should include instrument logs that contain purchase, upgrade,and repair information; a calibration schedule and results; a control chart for perform-ance trends; and blind quality control/quality assurance checks. FINDING THE RIGHT DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR YOU Many academic labs, especially small ones, track samples, reagents, and experi- ments through paper records and simple electronic spreadsheets. But as the amountand complexity of data grow, some investigators may turn to specialized softwareproducts, such as laboratory information management systems (LIMS), data reposito-ries, archival software, and tools to integrate the different applications.Chapter 8 Data Management and Laboratory Notebooks BWF/rhombus6HHMI 127Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 128 BWF/rhombus6HHMISelecting a suitable program\u2014one that fits your lab's needs and budget\u2014involves something at which you excel: research. Consult colleagues who have been throughthis process themselves, and don't be shy about involving your institution's informa-tion technology office. Once you have narrowed the list of candidate software,arrange vendor demonstrations and visits to labs that use these systems, and, of course,conduct reference checks.Y our institution's purchasing office may also be helpful. Some of the questions that you should consider are /rhombus6 Is the system compatible with your existing software and hardware? Will it interface with your instruments? /rhombus6 Are other users satisfied? (Talk to people in your field who have purchased a system.) /rhombus6 What kind of support is available from the vendor? /rhombus6 How much flexibility does the system offer? Can it be configured to satisfy your particular needs? /rhombus6 How much training will be required? /rhombus6 Is the company that sells the system well established or is it likely to be out of business in a few years? /rhombus6 Is it worth it, or can you get by with the system you already have? Do you really need more software? Laboratory Information Management Systems Traditionally, LIMS have been used by chemistry labs that conduct batteries of tests on thousands of samples.

Archival Software The multitude of data generated by a single lab can be overwhelming.A growing number of software systems allow the user to collect, store, and visualize disparate kinds of information\u2014ranging from mass spectrometry readings to microarray data.The systems provide a central repository for all data generated in a lab. One of thecritical features that sets different types of software apart is the degree to which storeddata can be retrieved and manipulated in the absence of the original instrument soft-ware.Another important consideration is the degree to which the stored data meet the FDA criteria set forth in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations ,part 11 (see box \"Electronic Laboratory Notebooks,\" page 124). As principal investigator, you know that main- taining accurate and consistent laboratoryrecords and managing the flow of data your lab generates are critical to the success of yourresearch program. So, be proactive.As you're setting up your lab, determine the standardsand procedures for record keeping and com-municate these to the members of your lab. Develop a plan to efficiently track and store data and find an electronic data management system to help you implement this plan.Once you've done this, you're well on your way to keeping the avalanche of dataorganized and retrievable.Resource: Buyer's Guide BioIT World produces an annual buyer's guide of products, including LIMS, which is available at http://www.bio-itworld.com/buyersguide .Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 130 BWF/rhombus6HHMIRESOURCES American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But thepressure is on\u2014soon you will have to find financial support for yourresearch from sources other than your institution. It's time to learn the art of getting funded. Numerous public and private sources support scientific studies, but the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a component of the PublicHealth Service under the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices, is by far the nation's largest funder of academic research.For that reason, this chapter focuses on NIH and emphasizes the R01 grant, an investigator-initiated research project grant for whichmost beginning academic investigators will have to apply. This chapter provides an overview of the NIH funding process and the two-level review system that is used by NIH for most R01 grantapplications. It also details the steps involved in preparing a strongR01 grant application, including turning your concept into a solidresearch plan and making sure that individuals with the appropriate expertise review your application. In addition, the chapter discusseswhat to do if your application is not funded. UNDERSTANDING THE NIH FUNDING PROCESS NIH Institutes and Centers An important part of writing a successful grant application is having a good understanding of the mission of the funding organization andthe type of projects it supports.At this point in your career, you areprobably already familiar with NIH and may have even applied forNIH postdoctoral funding. However, it's still useful to remember thatNIH is composed of institutes and centers (I/Cs) whose numbersincrease and whose structures are reorganized periodically. (From agrant applicant's perspective, the only relevant distinction between institutes and centers is that an institute can make awards of less thanThis chapter is based on the ses- sion \"Getting Funded\" that was presented at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management. The session was organized by Jim Austin, Ph.D.,American Association for the Advancement of Science, with presentations by Anthony M. Coelho Jr., Ph.D., Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH); Bettie J. Graham, Ph.D., National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH; and Suzanne Pfeffer, Ph.D., Stanford University School of Medicine.The chapter also includes information provided by Anthony Demsey, Ph.D., Office of the Director, NIH; Michael E. McClure, Ph.D., National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH; and Carl Rhodes, Ph.D., Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Additional information was obtained from some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 132 BWF/rhombus6HHMI$50,000 without approval from its national advisory council, but a center cannot.) As of October 2003, NIH had 20 institutes and 7 centers. Each I/C has its own missionand research agenda, and 24 of the current 27 I/Cs have funding programs for extra-mural awards (research conducted outside their own facilities and staff), including those that fund R01 grants.Although not essential, it will be useful for you to identify anI/C that is likely to be interested in your research (see \"Find a Home for Y ourApplication at NIH,\" page 141). The R01 Review: An Overview R01 grant applications are usually investiga- tor-initiated.Applications can also be submit-ted in response to a Request for Applications(RFA) or a Program Announcement (PA),both of which are announced in the NIHGuide for Grants and Contracts( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html ). R01 applications submitted in response to anRFA are generally reviewed by the issuingI/C. R01 applications submitted in responseto a PA are reviewed by the Center forScientific Review (CSR). Regardless, all appli-cations are sent to the CSR and then follow atwo-level review process: 1) CSR assigns theapplication to a Scientific Review Group(SRG) for evaluation of scientific and technicalmerit and 2) assigns it to one or more I/Cs toreview for programmatic relevance and fund- ing recommendations. (Figure 9.1 provides anoverview of this two-level review process.) CSR conducts scientific peer review ofapproximately 70 percent of the applicationssent to NIH; I/Cs evaluate the others. Of themore than 68,000 applications received annual-ly by NIH, perhaps only 25 to 30 percent arefunded.The funding range can vary from yearto year and from one I/C to another.There is no grantsmanship that will turn a bad idea into a good one, but there are many ways to disguise a good one. \u2014William Raub, former deputy director, NIH '' '' Question: At what stage in my career should I apply for my first R01 grant? Answer: After you have accepted a position at a university or medical center, you may beencouraged by your department chair to applyfor your first NIH grant, even before you move into your new lab. Some experts warn, however,that it might be better to wait until the secondyear of your appointment, because it will help your application considerably if you have gener- ated some preliminary data in your new lab.Whenever you decide to apply, remember thatyou are in that special position of \"new NIH investigator\" only once; make the most of it. Question: What's the difference between an RFA and a PA? Answer: An RFA invites grant applications in a well-defined scientific area for which an I/C has determined a specific research need (e.g., tostudy West Nile virus).This is usually a one-time competition and funds are set aside for acertain number of awards.A PA invites grantapplications for a scientific area for which an extramural research program within an I/C hasnew or expanded interest or continuing inter-est (e.g., to study drug addiction).These applica-tions are accepted on standard receipt dates onan ongoing basis.Chapter 9 Getting Funded BWF/rhombus6HHMI 133 NIH/CSR receives application SRG (study section) conducts review for scientific merit and votes a priority score I/C national advisory council conducts review for program relevance and funding, makes recommendation I/C director, acting on behalf of NIH director, takes final action to fund or not I/C notifies PI of final actionIf application is in funding range, PI receives letter notifying of need to get IRB and IACUC approval if not already obtainedSRA prepares summary statement of review results, sends to PI and I/CCSR sends PI confirmation of receipt (also called assignment notification letter)CSR assigns application to SRG and Institute or Center (may assign to more than one I/C)Figure 9.1. Overview of the NIH R01 grants process CSR: Center for Scientific ReviewIACUC: Institutional Animal Care and Use CommitteeI/C: NIH Institute or CenterIRB: Institutional Review BoardPI: Principal InvestigatorSRA: Scientific Review AdministratorSRG: Scientific Review GroupThe following is a general guide to the process used to review R01 grant applications. First-Level Review: Scientific Review Group One type of SRG, the study section, is used by CSR to review R01 grant applications. Studysections are clustered into Integrated ReviewGroups (IRGs), organized around a generalscientific area. Each study section has a specificscientific focus. (For simplicity, the terms study section and SRG are used interchangeably in this chapter.) R01 applications are usually assigned first to an IRG and then to a study section within thatIRG.The study section reviews the grantapplication for scientific merit, rates it with anumerical priority score from which a per- centile ranking is derived, and recommends anappropriate level of support and duration ofaward. Scores, ranks, and percentiles. Every mem- ber of a study section gives each application arating, or priority score.Those scores are aver-aged to create a three-digit number, which isthat application's final score in the NIH com-puter system.A 100 is the highest possiblescore, and a 500 is the lowest possible score.Some applications are not discussed at the review meeting and thus do not receive a score (see \"Streamlining and Deferrals,\" page 136). Percentiling is a reflection of the rank of a particular score in the pool of all scores given by a study section in its current meeting plus the two previous meetings. For example, an application whose score ranked number 50 out of 100 applications wouldreceive a percentile of 49.5, according to the following formula: P = 100 x (R - 1/2 ) / N In the formula, P is the percentile, R is the ranking (in this case, 50), and N is the total number of applications. The percentiling process is specific to each study section and is the way that NIH I/Cs can account for different scoring behavior in the various study sections.Thus, ifthe 20th percentile is a 150 priority score in Study Section A and a 190 priorityscore in Study Section B, both applications are considered in the 20th percentile andtreated as such when funding decisions are made by the I/Cs.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 134 BWF/rhombus6HHMICommon Abbreviations AREA:Academic Research Enhancement Award CRISP: Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects CSR: Center for Scientific ReviewIACUC: Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee I/C: NIH Institute or Center (also written IC)IRB: Institutional Review BoardIRG: Integrated Review GroupOER: Office of Extramural ResearchOHRP: Office for Human Research Protections (formerly OPRR, Office of Protection fromResearch Risks) OLAW: Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (formerly Division of Animal Welfare withinOPRR) PA:Program Announcement RFA: Request for ApplicationsRFP: Request for ProposalsSEP: Special Emphasis PanelSRA: Scientific Review AdministratorSRG: Scientific Review GroupChapter 9 Getting Funded BWF/rhombus6HHMI 135Behind Closed Doors: Demystifying the Study Section Chartered study sections /rhombus6 Are managed by a scientific review administrator (SRA), a professional at the M.D. or Ph.D. level with a scientific background close to the study section's area of expertise /rhombus6 Have 12 to 24 members recruited by the SRA, most of whom are from academia\u2014some have long-term appointments and others are temporary members /rhombus6 Review as many as 60 to 100 applications per meeting /rhombus6 Usually assign three reviewers to each application /rhombus6 Are supported by a grants technical assistant, who reports to the SRA Under the terms of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, study section meetings are closed. Meetings include /rhombus6 Orientation (discussion of general business) /rhombus6 Provisional approval of list of streamlined applications /rhombus6 Discussion of remaining applications The discussion of applications includes the following: /rhombus6 Reviewers with a conflict of interest are excused. /rhombus6 Assigned reviewers present strengths, weaknesses, and their preliminary scores. /rhombus6 Other members discuss scientific and technical merit. /rhombus6 Range of scores is expressed (every member scores every application). /rhombus6 Codes for gender, minority, and children and human subjects are assigned (NIH has requirements for inclusion of women, minorities, and children in clinical research and strict criteria for research involving human subjects and animals). /rhombus6 Recommended budget changes are discussed. After each meeting, the SRA documents the results in a summary statement, which is forwarded to both the I/C and the principal investigator. Summary statements may vary somewhat depending on the SRA, but all of them contain the following: /rhombus6 Overall r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and summary of review discussion (for applications that were discussed and scored) /rhombus6 Essentially unedited critiques by the assigned reviewers /rhombus6 Priority score and percentile ranking /rhombus6 Budget recommendations /rhombus6 Administrative notes (e.g., comments on human subjects or animal welfare) For more information about what happens in a study section, see the CSR Web site (http://www.csr.nih.gov ). Also, professional societies, such as the American Society for Cell Biology, often conduct mock study sections at their meetings using already-funded applications.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 136 BWF/rhombus6HHMIPoor priority scores. Applications can receive poor priority scores for any number of reasons, including the following: /rhombus6 Lack of original ideas /rhombus6 Absence of an acceptable scientific rationale /rhombus6 Lack of experience in the essential methodology /rhombus6 Questionable reasoning in experimental approach /rhombus6 Diffuse, superficial, or unfocused research plan /rhombus6 Lack of sufficient experimental detail /rhombus6 Lack of knowledge of published relevant work /rhombus6 Unrealistically large amount of work for the given time frame or funding level /rhombus6 Uncertainty about future directions Streamlining and deferrals. A study section gives a score to only about half the applica- tions assigned to it every review cycle.Through a process called \"streamlining,\" appli-cations that are deemed by reviewers to be inthe lower half of those assigned for review areread by the assigned reviewers and receive written critiques, but they are not scored ordiscussed at the review meeting.Any membercan object to the streamlining of any applica-tion, thereby bringing it to full discussion atthe meeting. Streamlining was instituted toallow more time for discussion of applicationsnear the fundable range and to shorten themeetings.This more efficient process also helpsattract more reviewers. A study section can also defer an application if, for example, more information is needed before the reviewers can adequately consider the application. Deferred applications require amajority vote by the study section and are rated \"DF .\" Deferrals are rare. Second-Level Review: I/C National Advisory Council or Board After an R01 application has undergone study section review, it undergoes a second- level review by the national advisory council or board of an I/C.The advisory councilis composed of people outside the I/C.Approximately two-thirds are scientific mem-bers who are generally established in their fields, such as deans or department chairs.Others are advocates for specific health issues and patient populations, ethicists, andlaypersons.The secretary of Health and Human Services has ultimate authority to makethese appointments.Question: What should I do if an SRA asks me to be a reviewer for a study section? Answer: Views differ on this question. Service on a study section can provide valuable insightsfor grant writing and open professional doors in other ways. However, many senior scientistscounsel that junior faculty should wait until theyhave obtained tenure before accepting an invita-tion to be appointed to a term on a study sec-tion, because they should be devoting theirenergies to their research, which is the primarybasis for the tenure decision. However, agreeingto serve as a temporary member might beappropriate at this stage in your career.Chapter 9 Getting Funded BWF/rhombus6HHMI 137The advisory council assesses the quality of the study section's scientific review, makes recommendations to I/C staff on funding, and evaluates the application's relevance to program priorities. For every scored application, the advisory council will do one ofthe following: /rhombus6 Concur with the study section's action /rhombus6 Modify the study section's action (but it cannot change the priority score) /rhombus6 Defer the study section's action for another review, with no changes allowed (e.g., if the principal investigator has appealed, the council may recommend a re-review because it considers the first review flawed) The I/C director, acting on behalf of the NIH director, takes final action.Awards are made on the basis of scientific merit, program considerations, and available funds.Thedirector usually (but not always) follows the advisory council's recommendations. Roughly half of the funding I/Cs post their funding plans on their Web sites.The funding plan is the percentile to which the I/C anticipates being able to fund appli-cations on the basis of its budget, recent funding history, and program priorities. Ifthat information is posted, you can check the Web site after you receive the summarystatement that shows your application's percentile. Regardless of whether the I/C towhich your application was assigned posts its funding plan, you may want to ask yourprogram officer about the likelihood of your obtaining funding. Review and Funding Cycles The meetings of the national advisory councils form the basis for NIH's three over- lapping review and funding cycles (see figure 9.2). However, NIH is trying to expe-dite the funding process by making some awards before the council meeting. Forexample, a candidate for expedited funding might be an R01 application that has ahigh score, is in an area of strong interest, and does not involve human subjects. Depending on the I/C, approximately 30 percent of funds are allocated at each of the first two meetings; more is spent at the third meeting. Some I/Cs may be a bit moreconservative in funding (e.g., to the 25th percentile) in the first two cycles to holdfunds in reserve in case strong applications are submitted during the final funding cycle.In addition, every advisory council and I/C staff have \"select pay\" for which they cannominate applications that have poorer scores but are of high interest for funding. As much as possible, consider the timing of your application in terms of the career track at your institution.Y ou want to be funded when decisions about tenure are made.Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 Application submitted February June October SRG (study section) review June October February Advisory council review September January May Earliest award December April JulyFigure 9.2. Typical timeline for a new R01 application Note:This timeline is specific to R01 research grants.Always check with the I/C to verify due dates for specific types of applications. RFA due dates are stated in the solicitations.PREPARING A STRONG GRANT APPLICATION Getting Started Successful grant applications begin with a good idea. Figures 9.3 and 9.4 (page 140) show the sequence of steps that can carry you from a good idea through the submis- sion of an application to the final decisionabout funding. Once you have a good idea, you can get start- ed in two realms: your own institution and anappropriate NIH I/C.These activities overlapto some extent, but they are presentedsequentially below. Seek input at your own institution. An experienced scientific reviewer and NIHgrantee recommends seeking peer review of your research proposal at your own institution according to a plan devised by KeithYamamoto, University of California-SanMaking the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 138 BWF/rhombus6HHMICalling Beginning Investigators:NIH Wants Y ou NIH actively seeks to support beginning inves- tigators.When you apply for your first NIHgrant, check the box on the form that signalsto reviewers that you're a new investigator(meaning you haven't been principal investiga-tor on an NIH research grant before).Thereviewers are often more forgiving of applica- tions from novices.Other (Non-R01) NIH Opportunities for Beginning Investigators The following research awards are also available for beginning investigators: /rhombus6 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) /rhombus6 Independent (K02) /rhombus6 Mentored Award (K08) /rhombus6 Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) /rhombus6 Career Transition Award (K22) Many of these programs are announced periodically in the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html ). Each has its own criteria for eligibility and sub- mission of applications. Information on these and other NIH extramural funding opportunities canbe found at http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/funding/funding.htm . In addition to NIH, other federal agencies and private sector organizations solicit and fund research grants, and each has its own application and review system (see \"Resources,\" page 149).Y ou cansend the same application to multiple funding sources in the public and private sectors, but youmust disclose your multiple applications to each potential funder to avoid \"double dipping\" when awards are made.Chapter 9 Getting Funded BWF/rhombus6HHMI 139Francisco.The process, which begins at least two months before the application dead- line of your grant, involves the following steps: 1. Choose three senior colleagues as your \"grant committee.\" Ideally, these would be successful grantees and would include someone who has experi- ence on a study section. 2. Discuss research goals, aims, and ideas with the committee (1.5 hours).3. Draft one page listing three to five specific aims, and explain why each aim is important.In the beginning: The good idea Write an abstract (clear language suitable for educated layperson) If encouraged, send abstract to program officer, discuss suitable study section Prepare your application;refer frequently to Criteria for Rating of NIH Grant Applications In your cover letter, suggest a study section and I/C, mention supporting program officerIf discouraged, ask about alternative I/Cs and program officerContact the program officer at the target I/C(s)Find a home for your research; investigate suitable I/CsSeek input at your own institutionFigure 9.3.

Discuss your aims and rationales with the committee (1.5 hours). 5. Refine your aims according to committee comments.6. Draft the abstract and the research design and methods sections.Then draft the progress report and the background and significance sections. (See box\"Components of the NIH R01 Grant Application,\" page 141, and \"PreparingYour Application,\" page 143.) 7. Read \"Criteria for Rating of NIH Grant Applications\" (page 144), and revise your drafts as appropriate. 8. Seek feedback on the drafts from your committee. In addition to seeking advice from other scientists, seek administrative advice from appropriate review bodies, such as your local Institutional Review Board andInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Reviewers will look for your track record in the field, so if necessary, create one by conducting some preliminary work and presenting the results in your grant application. Submit your application on time; follow instructions carefully Review the summary statement If notified that application is in funding range, get IRB and IACUC approvals if not obtained beforeIf score, percentile ranking,and recommendations arepositive, do nothing(but celebrate) Learn from the summarystatement and program officer; write a strongerapplication next timeIf appropriate, consult the program officer about challenging a review you think is flawed Application is funded: Begin your research Application isn't funded: Consult your program officer for guidance and either revise or apply what you've learned to a new conceptReceive notice of final funding decisionIf revision and resubmission are recommended, consult colleagues at your institution and the program officer for guidanceAddress all critical comments thoroughly and resubmit your applicationReview confirmation of receipt/assignment notification letter for accuracy and concernsFigure 9.4.

In many cases the appropriate I/C and program officer for your research might beyour mentor's. On the other hand, it may take legwork to find the I/C most likely to beinterested in your idea.An experienced NIHprogram officer suggests that beginning scien-tists should /rhombus6 Check the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html ) for relevant and recent PAs and RFAs. /rhombus6 Check the NIH CRISP (Computer Retrieval of Information on ScientificProjects) database ( http://crisp.cit.nih.gov ) for projects like yours that have beenfunded.The two letters in the grantnumber tell you which I/C funded the project. /rhombus6 Conduct a literature search to see what has already been done in your area. (Thiscan help you address the innovationaspect of evaluation criteria and, ifappropriate, revise your study design ormethods accordingly.) Once you've narrowed the list of potential I/Cs, go to the Web site of each I/C to learnwhat areas they are currently interested in andare funding. (The NIH Web site lists all itsI/Cs and offices at http://www.nih.gov/icd/ .) I/C Web sites commonly describe scientific areas of interest as well as identify thestaff members who are responsible for each program area and maintain a portfolio ofgrants in that area. The I/C program officer is the best person to help you decide what type of grant to apply for and which study section may be most appropriate.The program officerwhose area of responsibility is most appropriate to your research also can be your bestadvocate and adviser at NIH throughout the application process.The program officerwill not evaluate the quality of the research idea or the science.That job is left toyour institutional colleagues and the study section.Chapter 9 Getting Funded BWF/rhombus6HHMI 141Your NIH R01 history is a form of peer review at the nation- al level and is weighed heavily in decisions about promotionand tenure. \u2014Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University School of Medicine''''Components of the NIH R01 Grant Application /rhombus6 Research Plan Abstract Specific Aims Background (like a review article) and Significance Progress Report (preliminary results and demonstration of relevant expertise) Research Design and Methods /rhombus6 Resources and Facilities /rhombus6 Budget /rhombus6 Budget Justification Tip:Conclude each section in the research plan with a few sentences stating what you willlearn and why that information is important\u2014for example,\"These experiments are important because nothing is known about X, and theywill enable us to distinguish between two con-troversial models that are widely discussed inthe field.\" For information about how to prepare a grant application form, visit http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html .Before you call this key person, be sure to have an abstract of your research project ready (see box \"Tips on Writing an Abstract\").The program officer will probably ask for a copy; if not, you can offer to send one. Review by more than one I/C. Remember, you can ask for assignment to a second I/C if you've had encouragement from another pro- gram officer or think that your application fits within another I/C's scientific areas of inter-est.Y our application can be funded by onlyone I/C, but more than one advisory councilcan review it to broaden your chance of fund-ing. In such cases, the application will beassigned a primary and a secondary I/C.Thesecondary I/C can consider it for fundingonly if the primary I/C opts to relinquish firstright of funding. Despite your homework on finding the appropriate I/C, the first program officer you contact may not consider your proposal appropriate for funding by that I/C. In suchcases, the program officer will likely suggest a more suitable I/C and program officer. Getting Assigned to the Right Study Section The most important thing you can do to bolster your chance of funding is to have your application assigned to the right study section. Read the study section descrip- tions and rosters before finishing and submitting your application. Remember thatkey words in the title, the abstract, and the specific aims will be used to direct your application to a suitable study section. If you submit a cover letter, it should contain an informed request for assignment to a specific study section and a brief explanation of why you think it's best suited for yourapplication, as you have determined through your own research and your discussionwith the program officer. Include the name of the program officer who supports thisrequest. CSR staff members will consider your suggestion for a study section; if your suggestion is logical, it is likely they will honor it.Y ou can also recommend the type ofexpertise needed to evaluate your application, but you should not provide specificnames of potential reviewers. After you have been notified about the study section to which your application has been assigned, check the roster to make sure the expertise you consider essential to afair and thorough evaluation of your application is still represented. If someone who you regard as an important interpreter of your research plan has dropped off the ros- ter, you can request that expertise be added.These requests are generally taken seri-ously and responded to, and appropriate expertise is provided on site or through anoutside review by phone or mail. Similarly, if someone has joined the study sectionand you think for some reason that this person will not provide a fair review, you canrequest that this person not review your grant. Be aware, however, that during the study section meeting, the person you are excluding will be informed that you madethis request.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 142 BWF/rhombus6HHMITips on Writing an Abstract The abstract should convey the big picture\u2014 the general hypothesis and aims, the method-ological approach, and the significance of theresearch. It should also include key words, which the referral officer at NIH will use toassign your application to the right study sec-tion, whether or not you request a particularreview group.Try to avoid technical jargon, and write the abstract in language an educatedlayperson can understand.Preparing Y our Application First, be sure you're using the most current application form. (The Web site http://forms.psc.gov/forms/PHS/phs.html has the most current version of the PHS 398 Grant Application Kit.) Second, follow a simple mantra: Start early, write,read, rest, re-read, revise. In your application, you should address the following questions, keeping in mind the information given under \"Criteria for Rating of NIH Grant Applications,\" page 144): /rhombus6 What do you want to do? /rhombus6 Why is it important? /rhombus6 Why do you think you can do it? /rhombus6 Has this area been studied before (and if so, what has been done)? /rhombus6 What approaches will you use, and why? /rhombus6 Why do you think it's feasible? /rhombus6 What will you do if your initial approach doesn't work as planned? /rhombus6 What resources and expertise are available to you from your institution?

NIH understands that beginning investigators may not have much opportunity to acquire preliminary data.The NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html ) often announces programs (e.g., R03 and R21) that are specifically designed to allow new investigators to obtainpreliminary data. Criteria for rating of NIH grant applica- tions. Here are some questions that reviewers will ask about your proposal: /rhombus6 Significance: Does it address an important problem? Will it advance scientific knowledge? Will it affect concepts ormethods in this field? /rhombus6 Approach: Are the experimental design and methods appropriate to the aims? Does it acknowledge problem areas andconsider alternative tactics (in otherwords, is there a thoughtful backup plan)? /rhombus6 Innovation: Does it employ novel concepts, approaches, or methods? Does it challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies? /rhombus6 Investigator: Is the investigator appropriately trained to carry out the proposed work? Is the work appropriate to the experience of the principal investigator and collaborators? /rhombus6 Environment: Does the institutional environment contribute to the probability of success? Is there evidence of institutional support? Remember, every yes answer strengthens your application. Every no answer repre- sents an area of potential vulnerability during scientific review. For a detailed descrip-tion of these criteria, see the PHS 398 application instructions at http://grants.nih.gov/gr ants/funding/phs398/phs398.html .In addition, guidelines for reviewers for grants from new investigators can be found at http://www.csr.nih.gov/guidelines/newinvestigator.htm .Question: How do I distinguish myself from my mentor if I want to continue in the same research area? Answer: Get a letter from your mentor explaining that he or she is pleased to knowthat you will be continuing to work on projectX, which he or she will not pursue. Have thisdiscussion with your mentor before you startto write the grant application.Chapter 9 Getting Funded BWF/rhombus6HHMI 145A Bit About Budgets This section does not discuss how to draw up a budget for your grant application. Most institutions have a central grants office with experienced staff who can devisebudgets suitable to the scope of the research proposed and in keeping with your institution's policies.Take advantage of that expertise. However, this section does provide an overview of four budget-related topics.The first, direct costs versus indirect costs, can be the source of misunderstanding betweenfaculty and administration at academic institutions.The next, modular grants, con- cerns the initial budget request that is now part of many NIH grant applications.Thelast two topics, administrative budget supplement and competing budget supplement,are relevant to later requests to supplement the initial award amount. Direct costs versus indirect costs. Direct costs comprise those expenses that are directly related to conducting a research project.They include salaries, employee ben-efits, equipment and scientific instruments, consumable supplies such as printer paperand pipettes, reagents, laboratory computers, and postage. Indirect costs (informallytermed \"overhead\") comprise the expenses that are paid to your institution by thefunding organization to support your research but that can't easily be charged directlyto a specific grant.These include administration, utilities, computer infrastructure,building maintenance, security, and custodial services.These costs can be from 10 per- cent to 80 percent of the total direct costs of a research grant. Generally, an institu-tion's administrators negotiate indirect costs, on behalf of the investigator, with thefunding organizations (such as NIH or the National Science Foundation) that allowthese costs.The organization then provides funds for indirect costs to the institution,along with funds to cover direct costs charged to the research grants. In general,beginning investigators need not be concerned about indirect costs. However, youshould be aware that a significant part of the budget for a large funding agency mayinclude indirect costs; the more paid to institutions for indirect costs, the less availablefor direct costs for investigators and their research projects. Modular grants. To simplify the budgeting process, research budgets are now requested in units, or \"modules,\" of $25,000.This applies to all investigator-initiated grants (R01, R03, R15, and R21) with direct costs of up to $250,000 per year over the period of the award (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/oer.htm ).The number of modules can differ from year to year. For example, acquisition of equipment canmake first-year costs higher than those for subsequent years. Request what you need,but be sure to justify that amount. Administrative budget supplement. This budget request covers unforeseen expenses that arise, generally because initial budget assumptions have changed.Examples are increases in the cost of isotopes or animal care.Administrative supple-ments are also offered occasionally for special purposes. For example, you may be ableto get an administrative supplement to pay for a minority student to work in yourlab.These requests are submitted to the I/C program staff rather than to the CSR forpeer review. If you have questions about the appropriateness of this type of request,ask your program officer. Competing budget supplement. Competing continuation applications are designed for the principal investigator who wants to modify the scope of approvedwork (e.g., by adding an aim or following an exciting lead).These requests are subject to the competitive peer-review process, usually through the same study section thatMaking the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 146 BWF/rhombus6HHMIreviewed the initial application. If you're considering this mechanism, ask your pro- gram officer about the feasibility of getting those funds from the sponsoring I/C. More advice on laboratory budgets can be found in the resources listed at the end of this chapter. Equipment:What Y ou Should Know Keep in mind the following: /rhombus6 Cost sharing has many benefits. Consider arranging for your department or institution to share equipment costs. /rhombus6 If you need new equipment to pursue your research, ask for it on your renewal application. Never request major equipment funds in the last year of the grant. /rhombus6 Your institution owns equipment funded by your grant only after the award period ends. If you're the principal investigator and you relocate, the equip- ment generally goes with you. /rhombus6 If you're in doubt about anything related to equipment, ask a grants manage- ment specialist at your institution. You may find help with equipment costs through the Shared Instrumentation Grant Program (S10) or the Small Instrumentation Grants Program (S15) run by NIH'sNational Center for Research Resources. For more information about these pro-grams, visit http://www.ncrr.nih.gov . Submitting Y our Application Follow instructions for mailing.Applications must be received by or mailed on or before the published receipt date. It's appropriate to send a courtesy copy of yourapplication to the I/C's program officer. Confirmation letter. NIH will send you a confirmation of receipt, which is also called an assignment notification letter. Review it carefully to make sure all informa-tion is correct and you have no concerns (e.g., about assignment to a study sectionother than the one you requested).The letter will include the following items: /rhombus6 An application number with codes for the type of grant (such as R01), the assigned I/C, and an identifying application ID number.The two letters in the ID number denote the primary I/C to which the application has been assigned. /rhombus6 The assigned SRG (or study section) /rhombus6 The name of the SRA and contact information The letter will also outline the expected timetable for review and funding decisions and explain who to contact if you have questions. New data. If new data become available after you have submitted the application, contact the SRA of your assigned study section.Y ou may be allowed to submit thisadditional information.The SRA can tell you how much to send, what format touse, and when and where to send it.Chapter 9 Getting Funded BWF/rhombus6HHMI 147Interpreting the Summary Statement After the study section meeting, the SRA will draft a summary statement (see \"Behind Closed Doors: Demystifying the Study Section,\" page 135). Usually, thesummary statement is straightforward and will tell you whether your grant is likely toget funded or not, but in some cases, you may need help interpreting it. For example,if your summary statement recommends revision and resubmission, do the reviewersreally want to see it again? Or have they politely refrained from stating plainly that they consider your hypothesis untenable, your expectations excessive, or yourapproach extremely flawed? The program officer, who usually attends the study section meetings or enlists a col- league to do so, can help you interpret the results of the scientific review. If the pro-gram officer wasn't present, he or she can call the SRA for guidance.Y our institutional mentor or grant committee can also help you evaluate the summary statement.Afterthe national advisory council meeting, you can discuss the potential for funding or revi-sions with the program officer. Occasionally, mistakes are made during the review process. If you believe that the reviewers criticized you for information that they overlooked in your application or think the review was flawed for other reasons, consult the program officer about thepossibility of appealing the study section's decision.Although this action is sometimesappropriate, it's usually better to address review comments and resubmit your applica-tion. Follow the program officer's guidance on this matter. If the reviewers thought your starting hypothesis was seriously flawed, don't waste your time revising and resubmitting the application. Instead, learn as much as you can from the summary statement and discussion with the program officer and your col-leagues, reconsider your project and approach, and write a stronger application thenext time. Resubmitting Y our Application If your application is not immediately funded, remember that with an NIH funding average of 25 to 30 percent, many applications aren't funded the first time. If the pro- gram officer thinks it's worthwhile for you to revise the application, keep the follow- ing points in mind: /rhombus6 Reviewers of amended applications get to see the summary statement from the previous reviews. /rhombus6 Always treat review comments respectfully. /rhombus6 Respond to all suggestions and comments, even if you don't agree with them. /rhombus6 Be explicit about changes: Mark each section of the revised application where you have addressed reviewer critiques. /rhombus6 Provide any additional data that are now available and update your publica- tion list, if necessary. /rhombus6 Resubmit the revised application by the due date.Y our revised application now begins its journey through the review process all over again, along with the next batch of new submissions from other applicants.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 148 BWF/rhombus6HHMIAlthough your first instinct may be to request that your revised application be assigned to a different study section, you would need a compelling scientific reason for thatrequest to be honored. Further, there's always the possibility that a different study sec- tion might find additional reasons to criticize your application. A revised application supersedes the previous version, erasing the earlier score and pushing you back farther in line in the funding decision-making process. However, asthe funding cycles progress and I/C staff have a clearer idea of what remains in theiraward budget for that fiscal year, they can reactivate the previous version if they find that the score on your initial application looks promising for funding (see \"Review andFunding Cycles,\" page 137). If you submit a revised application and the program officerlater tells you to withdraw it because your funding chances now look good, do so. How many times can, or should, you revise and resubmit the same application? NIH policy is that after a second revision, you must reconsider your project and approachand submit a new application.

It also offers somepointers for increasing your visibility in the scientific community. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING This section reviews some of the basics of the publishing process. Types of Journals Within the broad category of peer-reviewed journals, individual jour- nals vary in the audience they try to reach and in the scope of cover-age they provide. For example, some journals\u2014typically the top-tierjournals\u2014focus on a broad scientific audience. Others are deliberatelynarrower in scope, publishing research within a scientific specialty. Inaddition, a hierarchy exists within the world of scientific publishing.Some journals are more prestigious than others are, a situation that isdictated in part by each journal's impact factor \u2014a measure of how fre- quently papers published in that journal are cited in other journals(see box \"A Word About Impact Factors,\" on page 152).The moreprestigious the journal, the more competitive its publication process is.This chapter is based on the ses- sion \"Getting Published\" that was held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management.The ses- sion was organized by Jim Austin, Ph.D.,American Association for the Advancement of Science, with a presentation by Angela Eggleston, Ph.D., Cell Press. Additional information was obtained from Mark A. Hermodson, Ph.D., Purdue University;T om Misteli, Ph.D., National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health; and some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 152 BWF/rhombus6HHMICommunication Formats In scientific journals, primary research holds center stage, although significant space is often allocated to reviews and commentaries. Depending on how complete the studyis, original research can be published in a variety of formats, including full-lengtharticles, brief communications, technical comments, or even letters to the editor. As a beginning investigator, you will need to concentrate on getting your research published as peer-reviewed, full-length articles.These are by far the priority of bothtenure committees and the study sections of granting agencies.T echnical commentsand notes count for very little in most fields. A well-written and useful review may be worth the investment of your time, particu- larly if you've been writing grants and have collected all the literature anyway; how-ever, a review does not carry the weight of original research. Good reviews tend to get cited frequently by other scientists, which would increase your citation index (ameasure of how many researchers cite your work); this sometimes makes a difference with tenure committees. However, reviews areextremely labor-intensive, and to do themwell, you need the breadth and depth of knowledge that generally comes only withlong experience.Writing a review that revealsyour lack of expertise could be embarrassing, so be careful. As your career progresses, you may want to consider other opportunities to express yourviews\u2014in letters, comments, and discussionsof scientific trends. Most readers peruse this\"front matter,\" and contributing to it givesyou quick and wide visibility. In the top-tier journals, however, front matter tends to becommissioned by the editors and is thusreserved for established investigators. The Editors Some journal editors are professional editors who trained as scientists but no longer workin a lab. Others are working scientists whohave their own research programs but alsoserve for a period of time as editors.The top-tier journals in the biomedical sciences, suchas Cell,Science ,and Nature ,a r e s t affed by pro- fessional editors.When talking to a profession-al editor about your work, be sure to take thetime to highlight the general interest of yourpaper and explain the nuances of the science.An editor who is also a working scientist ismore likely to already know these things.A Word About Impact Factors In 1975, the Institute for Scientific Information began to publish Journal Citation Reports (JCR) (http://www.isinet.com/isi/products/citation/jcr ), a database of quantifiable information designed to indicate the relative importance of a journalwithin its subject category. One of severaltypes of data published in JCR,the impact fac- tor is a measure of how frequently the \"aver-age article\" in a given journal has been cited ina particular year or other time period.Theimpact factor, which is updated annually, is cal-culated by dividing the number of current-yearcitations by the number of citable items pub-lished in that journal during the previous twoyears. Although the impact factor is often used to provide a gross approximation of the prestigeof a journal, many other factors can influence ajournal's impact and ranking. For example,review articles are generally cited more fre- quently than research articles are, because theformer often serve as surrogates for earlier lit- erature, especially in journals that discourageextensive bibliographies.The inclusion ofreview articles in a journal will, therefore, increase its impact factor.PLANNING FOR PUBLICATION Because publishing original research papers is critical to your career, this section focuses exclusively on submitting and publishing these types of papers. Knowing When to Publish Y our Research Your tenure committee will want to see that you have published at least one paper a year in a highly ranked journal in your field as a senior author. (Some departments and institutions may expect several papers per year; make sure you discuss theseexpectations with your mentor.) If you have one or more postdocs who want to pur-sue research careers, each of them is under similar pressure to publish.T o obtain a fac-ulty position, it is usually necessary that a candidate be first author on two or morepapers, at least one of which is a high-impact paper. Research projects have a natural point where it makes sense to publish (see box \"Creating an Integrated Research and Publication Plan,\" page 154). However, youmay want to write up your results before you reach this point. If there is competitionin your field and you wait to publish, you run the risk of being \"scooped\"; in thiscase, you would have to publish your research in a journal that is not as prestigious asthe one you had initially envisioned.Also, if you wait to obtain complete results, youmay not be able to accomplish your goal of publishing at least one paper a year. In deciding when to publish, you will have to balance several considerations, but try to resist the temptation to rush into print. Remember, the quality of your publica-tions is what matters most in the long run.A paper that is incomplete or carelesslyput together is less likely to be accepted for publication and will be an inefficient useof your time. Even worse, incorrect results will damage your reputation.Chapter 10 Getting Published and Increasing Your Visibility BWF/rhombus6HHMI 153The number of papers needed for promotion has encouraged short, scientifically incomplete papers that do not serve the scien-tific community well\u2014\"slicing the salami thin\" is a descriptionof that in the publishing business. But it is a fact of life. \u2014Mark Hermodson, Purdue University'''' Writing up an incomplete or flawed story is not time-effective, since writing a good or bad paper generally takes the sameamount of time. \u2014T om Misteli, National Cancer Institute''''Choosing a Journal Because most papers today have several authors, the choice of where to publish often involves considerable negotiations.All authors typically want to publish in themost prestigious journal that is likely to accept their paper, but views on whichjournal is best will differ. Negotiations will also depend on who is involved.As theprincipal investigator, you will want to take into consideration the suggestions ofstudents and postdocs in your lab; however, you will generally make the final deci-sion. Decisions about where to publish may become more complex when two ormore principal investigators have coauthored a paper that involves extensive inter-laboratory collaboration. Here are some questions that can help guide your decision: /rhombus6 Are my results sufficiently groundbreak- ing, and do they have enough general appeal, to be considered by one of thetop-tier scientific journals? Do I have alarger story that makes my results reallyexciting? /rhombus6 Even if my results are not earth-shattering, have I taken an interdisciplinary approach, making the findings interesting to scientistsin several fields and therefore appropriatefor a general journal? /rhombus6 If my results are primarily of interest to my particular scientific specialty, which journals reach the members of that spe-cialty? Within this group, which journalor journals have included articles on myparticular subject area in the past coupleof years? /rhombus6 Would any journals be particularly inter- ested in my subject because it fits into a theme they have been pursuing? Somejournals, and some editors, pursue theirown special interests over time. The top-tier journals receive far more submis- sions than they can publish. For example, Nature rejects about 95 percent of the bio- medical papers it receives. Be realistic aboutyour chances.Y ou will lose precious time by submitting your paper to the wrong journal. It helps to ask trusted colleagues where they think your paper should appear. If they arefrequent reviewers for several journals in yourfield, they will have a good idea of what thestandards are for each journal.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 154 BWF/rhombus6HHMICreating an Integrated Research and Publication Plan There is a balance to be struck between trying to produce a \"dream paper,\" which may neverget done, and sending out a set of fragmentaryobservations. One way to find this balance is tointegrate your plans for publication into yourresearch plans. In her book At the Helm: A Laboratory Navigator ,Kathy Barker suggests strategies for doing this. As you decide on thelong-term goals of your research and on theseries of experiments or calculations you wantto undertake, Barker suggests that you envisionthese experiments or calculations as compo-nents of a published manuscript or series ofmanuscripts.Think graphically; imagine howeach set of results will be displayed in a figure,graph, or table. Put your ideas in writing at theoutset, sketching out the hypotheses you wantto pursue, the methods you intend to use, andthe results you hope to get. By integrating research planning, the develop- ment of displays of your data, and interpretivewriting, you force yourself to focus your ener-gy and you move your project forward.The questions you generate as you analyze andwrite up the results of each experiment shouldsuggest additional clarifying experiments, whichyou should also express graphically. As you write, you will uncover gaps in information andshaky conclusions. Eventually, you should beable to decide that you have a set of resultsthat warrants publication.Chapter 10 Getting Published and Increasing Your Visibility BWF/rhombus6HHMI 155Making Y our Pitch To make sure you write your paper for the right journal, you may want to submit an initial query to your target journal to gauge its interest in your work. Most journalshave guidelines for submitting so-called presubmission inquiries; check journal Websites for this information. If the journal does not provide guidelines, send an e-mail toone of the editors. (Try to find out the name of the editor who handles papers inyour area.) A presubmission inquiry usually includes the following: /rhombus6 An abstract stating the purpose of the project, methods, and main findings and conclusions.This abstract can be slightly longer than the abstract of a typical research paper and may include citations of relevant journal literature.Make sure that the abstract is clear to nonspecialists and that they will be ableto understand what the scientific advance is. /rhombus6 A cover letter briefly describing what questions led you to your research proj- ect, what you did, why you think your findings or methodology is significant, how your findings advance the field, and why they are of special interest tothat journal's readers. Limit the cover letter to no more than 500 words. Presubmission inquiries are typically considered within a few days; when that time has elapsed, follow up with a telephone call or e-mail. If you contact an editor byphone, use the opportunity to make your pitch. Be sure to allude to the larger con-text of your research\u2014the big picture that makes your particular effort meaningful. You can expect a reply of either \"we're not interested\" or \"send the full manuscript.\" A positive response to a presubmission inquiry is not a guarantee that the manuscript will be sent out for formal peer review.The editor will want to see the actual paperbefore making that decision. GETTING YOUR PAPER PUBLISHED Writing Y our Paper Once you have decided where you want to submit your manuscript, review the jour- nal's editorial guidelines (available from the journal's Web site or directly from theeditor) and follow them carefully. The main consideration when writing a paper is to clearly describe your most important findings and their impact in your field. Don't let your manuscript look likea compilation of lab data; make sure the reader can understand how you haveadvanced the field of research. But don't overdo it\u2014claiming that your work is moreimportant than it really is earns little more than contempt from reviewers. Assign the task of writing the first draft of the paper to the student or postdoc who will be first author. Encourage that person to prepare the figures, tables, and legendsfirst, because a scientific paper is best written with the final form of the data in frontof the writer.Then work with the author to get the paper into shape.Although thismay not be the most efficient way to write a paper, it is important for people in yourlab to get experience and feedback on writing papers.Once you have a good first draft, send it to colleagues in your field and in your department for review. Have it proofread by someone in your lab with access to yourdata and the documents you have cited.The last thing you want to do is to appearcareless; doing so will raise suspicions about the quality of all your work. It is also agood idea to give the paper to someone outside your field to see whether theyunderstand its importance. Three particularly important parts of your submission are the title, abstract, and cover letter. Title and abstract. Create these two elements after the manuscript is complete.The title should summarize the take-home message of your paper.The abstract shouldbriefly summarize the paper and should stand on its own. Describe the experimentalquestion, the methods, the main results, and the conclusion. Unless the main point ofthe paper is a new technique, methods should be limited to a sentence or a fewwords. Keep in mind that the abstract will announce the existence of your work to people who may not have time to read your paper. If the abstract attracts their atten-tion, they could be induced to read your article, rather than passing on to the nextabstract.Also note that your title and abstract will be used as the basic tools for theretrieval of your paper from electronic and paper libraries. Cover letter. The cover letter should explain why the paper is significant and why you think it is appropriate for the journal to which you are submitting it.The letter should cite a major question in your field and describe how your work helps answerit.Y ou may want to cite other papers the journal has published in this field or provideother reasons why the journal's readership would find your work of interest.The let-ter of introduction is the place to mention whether there is competition in the fieldthat could lead to your being \"scooped,\" as well as to include a list of colleagues whohave reviewed the paper and any information necessary to ensure a fair reviewprocess. Most journals will give you an opportunity to suggest people who are quali-fied to comment on your work and to exclude one or two particular individuals whomay be competitors and should not be reading about your work before it is pub-lished. Be sure to take this opportunity. Many books and articles that explain how to write scientific papers are available in print and online. (Some of these are listed in the \"Resources\" section at the end ofthis chapter.) Submitting Y our Paper Electronic submission is becoming more prevalent: Each journal has its own require- ments with respect to such matters as preferred file formats for text and figures andthe procedures for uploading files. Consult the journal's Web site for specific instruc-tions and be sure to follow them. Regardless of whether they receive a paper manuscript or an electronic version, most journal editors will let you know that they have received your manuscript and howlong you can expect the review process to be.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 156 BWF/rhombus6HHMIChapter 10 Getting Published and Increasing Your Visibility BWF/rhombus6HHMI 157Navigating the Review Process The reviewers of your paper will be chosen by the journal's editor, who will take into account any names you have suggested, his or her own knowledge of the field,and a literature search. Receiving the reviewers' comments. A paper is rarely accepted after the first round of review.When you receive the editorial decision and the reviewers' comments, youwill have to decide how to proceed. Sometimes the editors will indicate they wouldlike to publish your work, provided that you make a few minor revisions or do a fewadditional experiments. In other cases, the editors will say that the work is potentiallyinteresting but too preliminary or that it has significant flaws that preclude its publica-tion.Another possibility is that the reviewers will advise the editors not to publish thework even if it is revised, because it is either not sufficiently novel or it does not fit the scope of the journal. Most editors are happy to talk to you by telephone to help youassess whether you should revise and resubmit your paper or try another journal. In any event, it is important to remain unemotional during such conversations. Responding to reviews. Do not react defensively. Focus instead on the substance ofeach editorial comment.Value good advicewherever you find it. Read the reviews care-fully and communicate your responses inwriting to the editor. It is a good idea not torespond as soon as you hear from the editor. Let a couple of days go by.A hastily writtenand emotional response will hurt your chancesfor resubmission. If the reviews include a request for additional information that will require a few moreexperiments, carry them out and send yourresponse to the editor.Y ou can make the process easier by repeating each comment,stating your response, and indicating explicitlywhere in your paper you are making a recom-mended change. If the main problem is that the manuscript does not convey the importance of the work,you may want to rewrite it and add more data.Y ou might want to check with the editorfirst to make sure this is an appropriate courseof action. In the end, you will have to do a cost-benefit analysis. If you believe that satisfying all thereviewers' concerns would bog down your research program in unnecessary experiments, you may have no choice but to take your paper elsewhere.If Y ou Are Asked to Review a Paper As your relationships with journal editors develop, you may be asked to review manu-scripts submitted by other scientists.Take thetask seriously. Do the reviews thoroughly andpromptly. If you don't have time or don't thinkyou have the right expertise, let the editors know right away.They will not hold this againstyou. A late or weak review, however, could hurt your reputation with the editors.The ben-efits of serving as a reviewer are potentiallygreat. Not only will you learn about others'research, you will improve your own critical skills and confirm your standing as a knowl-edgeable scientist in the eyes of the editors.Your own future papers will be taken more seriously if you do good reviews. You will be asked not to reveal the contents of any article reviewed and be reminded that youshould not use your knowledge of the prepub-lished results to further your own research.Take this admonition seriously\u2014it is essential that you respect the confidentiality of thereview process. If you have a conflict of interest that precludes you from reviewing an article(e.g., you are directly competing with theauthor of the article you are reviewing or theauthor is one of your former postdocs), stopreading the paper and let the editors know immediately.They will not be pleased if theyfind out about a conflict of interest after youhave reviewed the paper.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 158 BWF/rhombus6HHMIIf you think a criticism is off the mark or that a requested additional experiment is unreasonable, write a rebuttal letter covering the relevant issues. Ultimately, you arethe person best acquainted with the details of your work and the limitations of yourresearch tools. Keep your emotions in check; never demean the reviewers.The reality is that reviewers, especially those who manage their own laboratories, sometimeswork under unrealistic time pressures. Occasionally, the reviewer selected may not have the expertise to judge a paper competently.Whatever the case, do not question areviewer's expertise. If you think a reviewer missed an important point, politely tell your editor, who has the option of identifying additional reviewers for your paper if doing so seems warranted. Submitting your paper to another journal. If you are advised that your paper isn't appropriate for the journal to which you have initially submitted it (e.g., it is notsufficiently novel or does not have the right focus), the best course is usually to selectanother journal. In some cases, you may not want to inform editors of the secondjournal that the manuscript was submitted elsewhere and rejected\u2014it might preju-dice the process. For example, if your paper was rejected by Nature and you resubmit it to Science (or vice versa), don't let the editors of the second journal know.These journals compete for the best papers and don't want to publish each other's rejec-tions. If, however, your paper was reviewed by Nature or Science and the reviews were generally positive but the editor did not feel the paper had a sufficiently high impactvalue for a top-tier journal, you may be able to use the reviewers' comments as lever- age for your next submission to a second-tier journal.Ask the first journal's editor tosupport the resubmission, and tell the second editor that your paper has already beenreviewed.The second review process may be expedited. Regardless of your course of action, never send a rejected manuscript without changes to a second journal. If, as is likely, the same reviewers receive it a secondtime, they will be annoyed to see that you have ignored their comments. INCREASING YOUR VISIBILITY Your patience and persistence have paid off, and your article has been accepted by a good journal. Now you can use your newly minted publication as a tool in a legitimate effort at self-promotion.Y ou want to become known to your scientific col-leagues nationwide. Here are some things you can do: /rhombus6 Announce the publication on your personal Web site and in e-mail corre- spondence with your friends. Consider making it available in PDF format. /rhombus6 Give a workshop or a brown-bag presentation at your own institution on the research described in your article and your future research plans. Doing so is relatively easy and is good practice. /rhombus6 Call your friends at universities around the country and offer to give a talk on your research at their institutions or at conferences they are organizing. However, don't invite yourself to a meeting by writing to the organizers ifyou do not know them.Y ou might come across as arrogant and put people in the awkward position of having to turn you down. /rhombus6 Once you have an invitation, take it seriously. Prepare and rehearse your talk./rhombus6 Consider going public. Contact your university public relations office for help in contacting the media. It is in the university's interest to have the good work of its scientists publicized. /rhombus6 If your research was supported by an outside funder, let the appropriate staff at the funding organization know about the publication as soon as possible. Getting your work published and promoting your publications are essential, inter- related tasks of scientific communication. So think \"big picture\" and \"long term\" when working on your publications, presentations, and other efforts to bring yourwork to the attention of others in your field.Chapter 10 Getting Published and Increasing Your Visibility BWF/rhombus6HHMI 159I learned early on that if you want to be promoted, you need to get a national reputation.This means that you have to beinvited to give talks at universities around the country and atnational conferences.The people listening to you might be theones recommending you for promotion; they might be sitting onan NIH study section when your grant comes up for review; orthey might be potential collaborators. Or they might be graduatestudents who would consider coming to your lab as postdocs. Sohow do you get these invitations when you're just starting out?Well, you can't be shy.You have friends all over the country who are also young faculty and carrying out work that wouldbe of interest to your department colleagues. Call them up andmake a deal:\"I'll invite you if you'll invite me.\" \u2014Thomas Cech, HHMI ''''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 160 BWF/rhombus6HHMIRESOURCES Curran-Everett, Douglas.\"The Thrill of the Paper, the Agony of the Review: Part One.\" Science 's Next Wave (September 10, 1999), http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/1999/09/08/6 .

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.Chapter 11 UNDERSTANDING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER Two decades of explosive growth in biomedical science have quietly revolutionized the role of academic investigators in the com-mercialization of research results. Patent applications for promisingdiscoveries, once the near-exclusive domain of industry, are nowfiled routinely by research universities.Through the process knownas technology transfer, these patents are licensed to companies fordevelopment into marketable products or services. The technology transfer guidelines at your institution will be based, at least in part, on federal and state laws, regulations, and guidance.This chapter provides an overview of the technology transfer infor-mation most important to academic scientists.The informationshould be viewed as a supplement to the information in your insti-tution's faculty handbook and its intellectual property policies. The chapter reviews the role of the university's T echnology Transfer Office (TTO) and covers the ways in which a university's intellectu-al property (IP) is protected, the process for bringing an invention tomarket, and diverse types of legal agreements. Conflicts of commit-ment and interest are also discussed. UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICES In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act to jump-start the transfer of inventions from federally funded aca-demic laboratories to the public.As a result, today most academicresearch institutions have TTOs that, with the help of the inventor, evaluate an invention for potential use and marketability and handle the forms, filings, negotiations, and follow-up of technology trans-fer. Most universities'TTOs follow the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act, regardless of whether the research is federally funded.This means that if you make a discovery with potential commercialvalue, your university will own and control the IP , but you will get a percentage of any resulting licensing income, including royalties. BWF/rhombus6HHMI 161This chapter is based on the ses- sion \"T echnology Transfer\" that was held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management. The session was organized by Andrea L. Stith, Ph.D., Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI; now at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology).The pan- elists were Martha J. Connolly, Ph.D., EntreMed (now at the Maryland T echnology Enterprise Institute); Francis J. Meyer, Ph.D., A.M. Pappas & Associates; and Christopher T. Moulding, HHMI. Additional information was obtained from Heidi E. Henning, J.D., HHMI;T ony G.Waldrop, Ph.D., University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill; and some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 162 BWF/rhombus6HHMISoon after taking your post at your new institution, you should meet with the TTO staff.They can tell you about what they do and how they can help you. THE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS It Starts with an Invention For a scientist, most technology transfer begins with an invention: a new and useful process, a machine, an article of manufacture, composition of matter, or any relatedimprovement to these.The invention itself has two steps: conception and reduction topractice. Reduction to practice is further subclassified into two types: /rhombus6 Constructive reduction to practice involves filing a patent application even though an invention isn't yet physically reduced to practice or \"made.\"The information in the application should make it possible for a person of ordi-nary skill in the art to make and use the invention without undue research orexperimentation. /rhombus6 Actual reduction to practice requires a working model demonstrating that the invention will work as intended. Moving from Invention to License The journey from invention to license can be frustratingly long and very expensive. The following are typical steps: /rhombus6 Discussion: The inventor informally dis- cusses the invention with the institution's TTO.These discussions may help theinventor decide whether to proceed withfiling an invention disclosure. In somecases, further work on the invention maybe advisable before proceeding. /rhombus6 Disclosure: The inventor reports the invention to the TTO using the institu- tion's standard disclosure form. /rhombus6 Evaluation: The TTO inven- tion for patentability and commercial potential. /rhombus6 Filing and commercialization decisions: The TTO may ask the inventor to do further work on the invention before proceeding, may file a patent applica- tion if the invention has commercial potential and appears to be patentable,or may decide to market the invention without filing for patent protection. Ifthe TTO is not excited by commercialization prospects, it may \"waive title,\"in which case ownership rights may be released to the inventor. Some uni-versities waive title only on certain conditions\u2014for example, an inventor may be asked to reimburse patent costs or pay a percentage of any income fromthe invention or both.Commonly Used Abbreviations CIP: Continuation-in-part (patent Conflict to useMTA: Material transfer agreementTTO:T echnology Transfer Office USPTO: United States Patent and TrademarkOfficeChapter 11 Understanding Technology Transfer BWF/rhombus6HHMI 163/rhombus6 Marketing: The TTO will contact potential licensees. /rhombus6 Licensing: The TTO will negotiate and manage licenses to companies. At the end of this process, approximately 30 percent of inventions reported to the TTO will be licensed. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: THE LEGAL TERMS AND AGREEMENTS This discussion is an overview of some of the common terms and legal agreements used in connection with technology transfer. For more information and project-specificassistance, consult your institution's TTO. Patents The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) grants three types of patents: /rhombus6 Utility patents (20 years) may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, composition ofmatter, or any new and useful improvement to these. /rhombus6 Design patents (14 years) may be granted to anyone who invents a new, orig- inal, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.Should I File an Invention Disclosure? Deciding whether to file a disclosure with the TTO to report a discovery made in your lab may not be a clear-cut matter. Some of the factors that might encourage you to file include the following: /rhombus6 The invention could lead to a useful diagnostic or pharmaceutical, and patent protection would be necessary to convince a company to incur the costs of development and clinical trials. /rhombus6 You and your university, department, and colleagues could profit from a patent both financially and in terms of enhanced reputation. /rhombus6 If you pass on the opportunity to file a disclosure, there's no going back. Later on, it may not be possible to obtain patent protection. Before filing a disclosure, you should also be aware of the following considerations: /rhombus6 Dealing with the TTO, patent attorneys, and eventually, licensees, can be very time-consuming. /rhombus6 Filing for patent protection can delay publication; you will want assurances from the TTO that the delay will be minimal (often 30-60 days is reasonable). /rhombus6 If you can't identify a specific use and potential licensees, it may be unrealistic to expect that the TTO will be able to solve this problem. /rhombus6 Be careful with patents on research tools; you will want your invention to be made broadly avail- able, not restricted for the use of a few./rhombus6 Plant patents (17 years) may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant. Most patents produced by academic researchers fall into the utility category. What does a patent do? A patent gives the owner or an exclusive licensee the right to exclude others from making, using, or sellingthe patented invention for a specific periodthat begins with issuance of the patent.Thepatent provides protection within the countrywhere the patent is granted. For U.S. patentprotection, an application may be filed up toone year after public disclosure of the invention, but patent rights outside the United States can't be obtained if public disclosure occursbefore a patent application is filed. Researchers musthave a clear understanding of what constitutes public disclosure. If some-thing you say or write allows someone else to practice your invention before a patent application is filed, you may have created abar to filing patents on your invention outside of the United States. Before discussingyour discovery in any forum that could be considered public, you may wish to con- sult your TTO about the proposed disclosure. What is\u2014and is not\u2014patentable? To be patentable, an invention must be useful, novel, and \"nonobvious\" to someone of ordinary skill in the art. If you think youhave a discovery that meets these criteria, the best approach may be to go directly toyour TTO and let the experts take charge from there. You may want to conduct a \"patentability search\" of key words at http://www.uspto.gov to screen for similar inventions in the files of patent applica- tions.Y ou can do this yourself, without the aid of a patent professional. Certain forms of unpatented IP may be licensed to companies by the TTO for com- mercial use.These kinds of IP include the following: /rhombus6 Tangible property: This can be licensed for compensation but without patent protection; others are not precluded from independently developing the same materials. Examples are cloned DNA, viral vectors, cell lines, seeds, tissues,and organisms.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 164 BWF/rhombus6HHMIEducate yourself about what constitutes public disclosure. Talking to a grad student doesn't, a faculty lecture comes close, and a presentation in a public forum may cost you the patentrights. \u2014Martha Connolly, Maryland T echnology Enterprise Institute'''' Question: Are the public disclosure rules the same for foreign patent rights? Answer: No. If your invention is publicly dis- closed before you file a patent application, youlose foreign rights. If you file a U.S. applicationbefore the first public disclosure, you have oneyear from that filing date to file foreign patent applications.A Patent Cooperation Treaty appli- cation preserves the right to file in selectedforeign countries for 18 months after the one- year period.Chapter 11 Understanding Technology Transfer BWF/rhombus6HHMI 165/rhombus6 Know-how: This can be licensed in some circumstances, usually nonexclusively in conjunction with a patent license.Examples are techniques, experimentalsystems, and special knowledge. /rhombus6 Copyrighted works: Although copyright in scholarly works normally rests with the authors, copyright in other writtenworks may be claimed by the university. Examples are formulas, algorithms, andsoftware, including source code. In contrast to industry, universities almost never maintain trade secrets, which are anti-thetical to the knowledge-expanding cultureof an educational institution. The patent application. When the TTO is confident that your invention meets the crite- ria for being patented and has commercial potential, it's time to prepare a patent application. Like most legal documents, a patent application is best prepared by a spe-cialist\u2014a patent attorney or agent. Universities normally hire patent law firms toprosecute patent applications. The patent attorney is likely to need input both from the inventor(s) and the TTO inorder to prepare a patent application.Y ou canexpect to speak with the patent attorney sev-eral times over the course of the patentprocess.Y ou will probably also be asked toreview draft documents.The major elements of a patent application are the abstract, back-ground/introduction, specification (how to practice), and claims. In preparing the patent application, the patent attorney will need to make a determinationof who should be named as inventors. It isimportant that this determination be accurate,because a patent may be invalid if the namedinventors are not correct (either because anindividual who did not make an inventivecontribution is named or because an individ-ual who made an inventive contribution isnot named).The inventors may differ from the authors of the paper that describes the invention. For example, a postdoc whojoined the project after the inventive steps had occurred and then provided support-ing data might be a coauthor but not an inventor. Normally, only the named inven-tors share royalties under institutional policies. What happens to the patent application? From the time the application is filed, the USPTO usually takes 12 to 18 months to complete its examination and issue anWho Owns Inventions at a University? As a condition of employment, U.S. universities require faculty and staff to assign invention rights to the university.A common key phrasein university IP policies is \"use of universityfunds or facilities\" in conception or reductionto practice of inventions or development ofmaterials, which extends the institution's own-ership to IP of graduate students and guestresearchers. In other words, the university owns inventions made by university personnel and may have rights in inventions made by others using university funds or resources. Question: How much does it cost to get a patent? Answer: Costs vary widely depending on fac- tors such as the patent attorney's time spentand hourly rate, what is being patented, thenumber of claims in the application, the number of (and reasons for) USPTO rejections, andwhether foreign filings are pursued. Preparationcosts can run between $5,000 and $20,000 andup, and filing fees and possible prosecution costbetween $3,000 and $5,000 and up (sometimesmuch more).The university pays the fees, but in almost all cases, the first income from theinvention is earmarked for reimbursement ofthese costs. Only then does the income-sharingformula for the inventors kick in.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 166 BWF/rhombus6HHMI\"Office Action.\"The first Office Action is generally a rejection.The applicant is then required to narrow patent claims and justify the novelty or nonobviousness of the invention in the light of prior art identified by the USPTO. Subsequent OfficeActions often result in issuance of a patent, but this process takes an average of aboutthree years. An alternative is a provisional patent applica- tion, a streamlined version that can be filedwithout some of the time-consuming formali-ties of the standard form.The USPTO doesn'texamine this type of application, a patent can'tbe issued directly from it, and it expires auto-matically one year after its filing. During thatyear, the university can file a regular patent application. So what's the point? This optionhas at least three benefits: /rhombus6 Temporary filing protection can be secured for your invention for less money (less time for an attorney and afiling fee of only $80 for a small entityor a university). /rhombus6 If filed before a public disclosure, a pro- visional application preserves the right to file for foreign patent protection. /rhombus6 The one-year term of a provisional appli- cation doesn't count toward the 20-year (or other) patent term. Many applications filed by universities are provisional, even if the application is extreme-ly thorough.The reason:This option buysvaluable time.The technology is usually at an early stage of development.A year later, the TTO can file a regular application that includes not only the invention described inthe provisional patent application but additional results developed in the interim,which may result in approval of broader claims. Despite its conditional nature, a provisional application shouldn't be a sloppy filing that the TTO plans to fix during the following year. It should be prepared by a patentattorney or agent and held to the same standards as the work that led you to thispoint. In addition, be aware that in some cases in which a provisional patent is filed,TTO staff may not yet have done a thorough search for competing or similar patents.You should find out whether such searches have been conducted and make sure a patent attorney examines the results. Licensing Agreements In technology transfer terms, a license is a legal contract that allows a company to make, use, and/or sell a university's invention.Through a licensing agreement, some-one agrees to pay for the use of IP that someone else (in this case, the university)Technology Transfer and Faculty Recruitment Increasingly,TTO staff are part of the university recruiting team.When faculty candidates com- pare employment offers, many often considerthe university's commercialization record andpolicies regarding income sharing. Commercialization record. Licensing and commercialization success can be strong sellingpoints, along with the TTO's track record incrafting advantageous terms. Income sharing. Formulas differ for distribut- ing IP-related royalty and equity income, but acommon distribution is 40 percent as taxableincome to the inventors (split if there are mul-tiple inventors), 40 percent to the inventors'departments for education and research, and20 percent to the university for managementof the invention and support of technologytransfer efforts. However, some universitiesgive the inventors as much as 50 percent ofnet licensing income, and others give the inven-tors as little as 20 percent.Chapter 11 Understanding Technology Transfer BWF/rhombus6HHMI 167owns\u2014under strictly defined terms and con- ditions that are specific to each license\u2014butthe university maintains its ownership rights tothe IP . In other words, a license allows people(or entities) to make, use, or sell somethingthey don't own without being prosecuted. Ifspecial know-how developed by the inventorsis needed to \"practice\" the invention, it's oftenincluded as part of the licensing agreement. Licenses can be exclusive or nonexclusive.An exclusive license grants the right to use theinvention to only one licensee. Exclusivelicenses usually allow the license holder tosublicense the invention to others for a fee.These sublicenses generate \"pass-through roy-alties\" as an additional source of income tothe university.A license also can be granted exclusively to one licensee for a specific application, or \"field of use,\" maintaining theuniversity's option to issue licenses for other fields of use. A nonexclusive license can be granted to multiple companies.The TTO, with the inventor, will decide whether an invention is best licensed exclusively or nonexclu-sively. Know-how is usually licensed nonexclusively in order to preserve the inven-tor's right to share the know-how with other scientists informally. Your TTO will probably handle licensing arrangements for your institution, but keep in mind one point: Many companies often want all future improvements to an inven-tion to be licensed to them. However, universities generally do not license inventionsor improvements (unless very narrowly defined) that have not been made.This policyserves as a protection to you, the inventor, to keep from encumbering your futureresearch results.Y ou need to be aware of the tension between the interests of the uni- versity and the companies to whom inventions may be licensed. Option Agreements An option agreement is a right to negotiate a license\u2014a document that says,\"I want to andI hope I can, but I'm not ready yet.\" It's lesscomplex than a license, relatively easy tonegotiate, and may or may not include thefinancial terms of the expected future license. Because it's of limited duration (usually 6 to 12 months), an option agreement is a usefulmechanism in dealing with start-up compa-nies and their inherent uncertainties. It givesthe hopeful licensee an opportunity to securefunds and attract other resources needed forcommercial development, and it gives all par-ties time to evaluate the technology and whateach brings to the table and to establish trust.Question: Do I have any say in where my invention is licensed? Answer: Although your university has ultimate authority regarding the choice of licensee andthe license terms, you will probably have somecontrol over where your invention goes. In thelicensing process, a full faculty member's prefer-ences will likely carry more weight than a post-doc's. In some cases, a company will already havelicensing rights because it provided researchfunding or materials. If it exercises those rights,the university may not be able to license theinvention to any other company, regardless ofthe university's or inventor's preferences. Negotiating the Agreement The TTO has responsibility for protecting the university's and the inventor's interests. If theinventor insists on unreasonable terms, someTTOs may be obliged to present them, damag-ing the negotiating process and the relationshipin which all of you will be tied. So, try to refrainfrom inserting yourself into the negotiatingprocess in this way. During the negotiation,however, it is necessary for you to understandwhat restrictions an exclusive license mayimpose on your ability to share data or materi-als with others.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 168 BWF/rhombus6HHMIMaterial Transfer Agreements Often as a result of a publication or presentation, other researchers may request mate- rials from your lab\u2014generally a cell line, animal model, research reagent, genetic con- struct such as a plasmid or phage, or purified proteins. Some institutions require that amaterial transfer agreement (MTA) be signed and returned before material is sentout. Some send the MTA form with the shipment and consider delivery of the mate-rial to be implied consent, whether or not a signed MTA is ever returned. Others may be unconcerned about keeping records for outgoing material (at least when therecipient is another nonprofit institution). Almost all MTAs for incoming materials require the signature of an authorized repre- sentative from the university. Even if an institutional signature is not required by thematerials provider, university policy may call for institutional review of the termsanyway. Check with your university's TTO about who needs to approve the terms forand signs MTAs for incoming materials for your lab. MTAs have distinct uses and caveats according to the entities involved.The following lists address three MTA scenarios: transfer of materials between academic labs, fromacademia to industry, and from industry to academia. MTAs covering transfers between academic labs usually have relatively benign provi- sions.An exception is when the materials have been exclusively licensed to a companythat successfully negotiated for restrictions on distribution.Work to avoid this situationbecause it puts your responsibilities as an author to share reagents at odds with yourcontractual responsibilities to a licensee. MTAs used for transfers to an academic labtypically and reasonably require that recipients of the materials do the following: /rhombus6 Use the materials for noncommercial research purposes only. /rhombus6 Acknowledge the providing scientist in publications. /rhombus6 Not send materials to third parties without the provider's consent. /rhombus6 Assume responsibility for damages caused by use of the materials by the recipient. /rhombus6 Not use the materials in human subjects. MTAs used for transfers from academia to industry usually do not permit use of the materials commercially (e.g., for sale or to make a commercial product) or in humansubjects but allow use for defined internal research purposes.They may also requirethat recipients do the following: /rhombus6 Share manuscripts before publication, in addition to providing proper acknowledgment in publications. /rhombus6 Indemnify the provider for damages caused by use of the materials by the recipient. /rhombus6 Not send the materials to third parties. /rhombus6 Pay a fee.Chapter 11 Understanding Technology Transfer BWF/rhombus6HHMI 169MTAs used for transfers from industry to academia tend to be the most restrictive and difficult to negotiate.They may include the following terms: /rhombus6 Ownership: Beware if the definition of materials specifies that the company will own all derivatives and modifications made by the recipient or if the MTA requires assignment of inventions to the company or provides thecompany with an automatic nonexclusive license to all inventions. Manyinstitutions try to avoid granting broad \"reach-through\" rights in new mate-rials or inventions developed by their faculty. /rhombus6 Publications: Beware if the MTA reserves to the company the right to approve or deny publications. More reasonably, the company may require review of manuscripts 60 days or more before submission for publication, and delay ofpublications for 60 days or more after manuscript submission.At a minimum,most companies want a 30-day prepublication review to protect confidential-ity and their investment and to consider filing for patent protection. /rhombus6 Reporting: The MTA may require extensive reporting and sharing of data from the recipient. The university's TTO will scrutinize the language of an MTA for incoming materials for restrictions like these and weigh the costs and benefits. If negotiations can't alterunacceptable MTA terms, the university may refuse to proceed. Under these circum-stances, the requesting university scientist will not be able to get the materials fromthat provider. SPONSORSHIP AND CONSULTATION Through publications, presentations, and personal contacts, the work of an aca- demic investigator might pique the interest of industry. If there's a good fit betweenthe avenue of research and the company's strategic interests, the company may wantto buy an option to commercialize the lab's research results or support some of theinvestigator's research. Or the company may invite the investigator to become anadviser or consultant.The typical mechanisms for doing so are described next. Sponsored Research Agreements When a company funds a university laboratory's research, the terms are spelled out in yet another form of legal agreement, called a sponsored research agreement, negotiat- ed by the TTO or the university's Grants and Contracts Office. Most sponsoredresearch agreements will take into account the following guidelines: /rhombus6 Project control: The work should be entirely under the control of the universi- ty, not directed in any way by the sponsor. /rhombus6 Technical representatives: A person from the institution and the sponsoring company should be identified to serve in this capacity, establishing a researcher-to-researcher relationship.These are usually the scientists leading the research at both places. /rhombus6 Reporting: Reporting requirements should be limited, and oral reporting allowed as much as possible, to minimize what can otherwise be a time- consuming burden. Sponsors usually require quarterly or semiannual reportsor meetings for periodic updates on the research./rhombus6 Publishing rights: The university should ensure that the laboratory has the right to publish and present all findings.The sponsor may have the right of advance review but not the power to veto proposed publications and not theright of editorial control. /rhombus6 Invention rights: The university owns inventions that arise from the sponsored research but will tell the sponsor about the inventions in confidence. /rhombus6 Licensing rights: The sponsor is usually given a time-limited right to negotiate for an exclusive or nonexclusive licenseto inventions that arise from the research. /rhombus6 Discussion and collaboration: The university researchers should have the right to dis- cuss their work on the sponsored projectwith other academic scientists and tocollaborate with them (as long as theother scientists are not funded by a dif-ferent company). Consulting Agreements Faculty members are usually allowed to spend a limited amount of time on consult- ing outside their institutions. If you have a manual that outlines the university's con-sulting policies, make sure you read it and understand the policies. Review the agreement. If your institution chooses to review consulting agree- ments involving employees, the appropriate office will examine your proposed agree-ments for conflicts of interest and other problems. If your institution does not reviewthese agreements, consider hiring a qualified person (e.g., a contract law specialist) atyour own expense to conduct a contract review because consulting may subject you to personal liability.The TTO can probably give you a referral for this purpose. Best practices. Consulting agreements vary widely to suit the particulars of a given situation, but they should abide by some general best practices. Companies should engage consultants for the exchange of ideas only, not to direct or conduct research on behalf of the company.They should not use the name of a con-sultant or university in promotional materials unless they have written consent. Consultants should have a limited and reasonable time commitment (e.g., a maxi- mum number of days per year for a specific number of years).There should be a pro- vision allowing the consultant to terminate the agreement by giving reasonablenotice, and it is fair for the company to have the same right. Consultants should notdisclose information about their laboratory research that they wouldn't normally dis-close to members of the scientific community. In addition, they may assign to thecompany rights in inventions arising from consulting activities if such rights haven'tarisen from their own research undertaken as a university employee. Consulting agreements should acknowledge that the consultant is an employee of the university and is subject to all of its policies, including those related to IP and conflictof interest (COI). If the company requires a noncompetition clause, the consultingagreement should state that this provision doesn't apply to the consultant's relation-ship with the university.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 170 BWF/rhombus6HHMIQuestion: How do I find the right sponsor for my research? Answer: Look for a strategic as well as a sci- entific fit, an alignment of business objectives,and a supportive alliance with management.Heed your instincts: If it doesn't feel right,chances are that it's not right.CONFLICTS OF COMMITMENT AND INTEREST Whether the lure is simply scientific inquiry or economic rewards, a career can easily run aground on conflict of commitment or interest. Conflict of Commitment Is your time really your own? Y es and no.As an employee, your first professional obli- gation is to fulfill your agreed-upon duties to your employer\u2014the university orresearch institution. Faculty members should give priority to their time and goals accordingly.The \"20 percent rule\" is a good guideline:Y ou may take up to 20 percentof your time for outside activities that are in the interest of you and the university. Conflict of Interest When dealing with technology transfer, a COI can lurk anywhere from the sponsor- ship of research to the nature and timing of published research results. One of themost common scenarios for COI is when the content or timing of publishedresearch findings affects license income, funding, or stock value for the financial gain of the investigator or the institution.The following definition, from Francis Meyer ofA. M. Pappas & Associates, can help you recognize a potential COI: A conflict of interest is a situation in which financial or other personal and institutional considerations may directly or significantly affect, or have theappearance of directly and significantly affecting, a faculty or staff member'sprofessional judgment in exercising any university duty or responsibility or inconducting or reporting of research. Here are some tips to help you avoid COIs: /rhombus6 Remember that industry is interested in science to increase sales and profits. Altruism and enlightenment are not corporate incentives. /rhombus6 Be careful about your involvement with start-up companies.With a start-up, you're more likely to have significant equity in the company, and if the com- pany was founded on your technology, the possibility of a COI increases. /rhombus6 Be careful of what you say during press interviews. It may be better to let the university do the public speaking about your research. Off-the-cuff remarks can present an opportunity for COI to be perceived where none exists, andthe perception can be as damaging to a scientist's credibility and career as thereality. At some point in your research career you may make a discovery in your lab that has potential commercial application. By having a better understanding of the concepts,processes, and potential pitfalls of technology transfer, you will be better prepared towork with your university's TTO and with industry to bring your discovery to market.Chapter 11 Understanding Technology Transfer BWF/rhombus6HHMI 171Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 172 BWF/rhombus6HHMIRESOURCES Association of American Medical Colleges.

Because a scientific collaboration is a com-plex exchange, you will need to acquire a new set of managerial andpolitical skills to be a successful collaborator.This chapter summa-rizes some of the questions you should ask yourself before embark- ing on a collaborative project and provides some guidelines to helpensure that the project proceeds smoothly. THE VARIETIES OF COLLABORATION In science, the word collaboration refers to a process during which two or more scientists pool their energies and resources toconduct a research project. In contrast to mentoring\u2014a relationshipbetween a senior and a junior scientist\u2014collaboration is essentially arelationship between equals. Collaborators are researchers who share an interest in the outcome of a project, not buyers or sellers ofgoods and services.The sharing of reagents or materials described ina publication does not in itself constitute a collaboration; scientistsare expected to make published materials available to others.Similarly, a service rendered by a scientist in a core service facilitywithin his or her own institution is usually not considered a collabo-ration.The core service facility exists to perform specific tasks forother laboratories. Collaborations can vary greatly in scope, duration, and degree of for- mality.A limited collaboration might entail only a series of consulta-tions about a technique or the provision of samples to be tested.Atthe other extreme, several scientists or laboratories might join togeth-er to establish a permanent consortium or center for the pursuit of aparticular line of research. Depending on its complexity, a collabora-tion can be launched by an informal agreement that is sealed with ahandshake or an e-mail or by a legally binding document. BWF/rhombus6HHMI 173This chapter is based on the ses- sion \"Collaborations\" that was held at the BWF-HHMI Course in Scientific Management.The session was organized by Victoria McGovern, Ph.D., Burroughs Wellcome Fund, with presentations by Joseph DeRisi, Ph.D., University of California-San Francisco; Claire M. for Genomic Research; and Rick Tarleton, Ph.D., University of Georgia. Additional information was obtained from T om Misteli, Ph.D., National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and some of the resources noted in this chapter.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 174 BWF/rhombus6HHMISHOULD YOU COLLABORATE? Unless you are in a lab that is exceptionally large, well funded, or very special- ized, you will probably need to collaborate at various points in your research. Butcollaboration is a major responsibility\u2014one that is not to be entered into lightly. Itwill take time, effort, and the nurturing of relationships.The larger the collaboration,the more complicated it is. Be sure that you are ready to collaborate and that a givenopportunity is right for you. Once you've signed on, you will be expected to followthrough on your commitments, and your scientific reputation will be at stake. Assessing a Collaborative Opportunity Regardless of whether you are approached by another scientist to collaborate or you are thinking of approaching someone to collaborate with you, here are some ques-tions you should ask yourself before embarking on the project: /rhombus6 Do I need this collaboration in order to move my own work forward? Is there a missing piece\u2014a technique or resource\u2014that I must have? /rhombus6 Even if collaboration is not strictly nec- essary to my current work, will it enable me to contribute something significantto science? /rhombus6 Do I really have the expertise or other resources that are sought by the other collaborator? /rhombus6 Can this collaboration be conducted efficiently, given such factors as distance, restrictions imposed by my institution, and, in the case of international collabo-rations, cultural differences or legal andpolitical complications? /rhombus6 Is there funding for the work envi- sioned? If not, can it be obtained? /rhombus6 Can I afford the time? How much will it take away from my other responsi- bilities? Is the project close enough to my central interests to warrant the necessary time expenditure? /rhombus6 Is this person someone with whom I want to collaborate? What is his or her track record? Can someone I trust tell me whether this potential collaborator is honest and reliable? /rhombus6 Are our professional and scientific interests compatible? Does what each of us has to gain or lose by collaborating seem comparable? /rhombus6 Will this person be accessible to me and consistently interested in the proj- ect? (There is no point in collaborating if interaction will be difficult.An investigator at a small lab may be a better match than the director of a largeoperation because a more established scientist is likely to be busier and less inneed of the collaboration.) Question: If I am not interested in a collabo- rative project with my department chair orsomeone else who can influence my tenureappointment, how do I decline politely? Answer: Explain to your chair that you don't have the resources at the moment to enter acollaborative project or that it would not bebeneficial to your grad student, who needs towork on a project that is all his or her own. Offer instead to provide input and suggestionsinto the research and, if possible, suggest otherpeople with similar expertise who might begood collaborators.Chapter 12 Setting Up Collaborations BWF/rhombus6HHMI 175/rhombus6 What exactly is being asked of me? (For example, if someone simply wants your technical expertise or the opportunity to run his or her experiments on your equipment, he or she may not consider you a collaborator at all.The essential ingredient of collaboration is mutual interest in the research out- come. If you have this interest, but the other party assumes that you do not,you may not be treated as a collaborator.This may be acceptable, as long as you understand what you are getting into.) /rhombus6 Can I rule out potential conflicts, either personal or institutional? (For ex- ample, you do not want to collaborate with a competitor of your department chair or someone with whom your chair is already collaborating.) /rhombus6 Before making a decision about a collaboration, consider all factors.A good collaboration can take your research in a completely unexpected course; a bad one will siphon off energy and demoralize you. SETTING UP A COLLABORATION Someone may eventually ask you to collaborate, but if you are a beginning investigator, it is more likely that you will need to approach a potential collaboratoryourself.A collaboration, like any relationship, has no fixed rules; however, there are some guidelines you can follow to ensure that the collaboration starts off on the rightfoot and proceeds smoothly (also see box \"Personal Qualities of a GoodCollaborator,\" page 178). Approaching a Potential Collaborator Once you have identified a potential collaborator and decided that you want to go forward, develop an outline of your proposal for the joint project. Define in detailhow you think each of you can complement the other's efforts. Send an e-mail. Make your initial contact with an inquiry designed to whet the other person's appetite. Send a short e-mail describing your research in general termsand asking for the opportunity for a conversation. Do not call on the telephonefirst\u2014you do not want to put the person on the spot, and you dowant to give him or her a chance to find out more about you through personal contacts or your scien-tific publications. In your initial e-mail, say up front that you are interested in a collaboration. Don't pretend to be asking for expert advice.Thatcan be annoying. \u2014T om Misteli, National Cancer Institute '' ''Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 176 BWF/rhombus6HHMIIn your e-mail, focus on the big picture and on conveying your enthusiasm.Y ou must convince your potential collaborator of the following: /rhombus6 You have the expertise you claim. /rhombus6 You believe that he or she is the best-possible collaborator for the project at hand. /rhombus6 Both of you stand to benefit. /rhombus6 The whole is indeed greater than the sum of the parts. Be informed. To make your pitch effective, you need to be familiar with your potential collaborator's work. Be sure to read the lab's published papers.Y ou will alsoneed to have a clear idea of what you want to do and of the respective role each ofyou will play. Your e-mail should lead to telephone conversations.At this point, a trip to your col- laborator's lab for a face-to-face meeting is definitely worthwhile. The Collaboration Agreement Using an informal agreement. An exchange of e-mails is usually sufficient to get a project under way. Before you actually start the work, however, it's best to developand agree on a detailed written summary of your joint research plan.The plan shouldspell out the following: /rhombus6 The purpose of the collaboration /rhombus6 The scope of work /rhombus6 The expected contribution of each collaborator /rhombus6 Financial responsibilities of each collaborator /rhombus6 Milestones /rhombus6 Reporting obligations /rhombus6 Expectations about authorship An explicit plan offers several advantages. It prevents misunderstandings, and it helps keep the project on track. Furthermore, if you expect to apply for funding for the project, this information can function as a grant proposal. In collaborations betweentwo academic labs, the collaboration agreement can simply be e-mailed back andforth until both parties are satisfied; obtaining signatures could seem overly formal. Using a formal agreement. A formal, legally binding written agreement is proba- bly necessary if the collaboration involves a commercial entity such as a pharmaceuti- cal company or a commercial application in which a patent is an expected outcome.You and your collaborator will want to consult with appropriate offices at your respective institutions to help you draft this agreement.This will typically be the technology transfer office or the grants and contracts office; their staff may alsoarrange for legal review by the institution's attorneys. Make sure to spell out the timeperiod of the collaboration or provide a mechanism by which you can terminateyour involvement.Chapter 12 Setting Up Collaborations BWF/rhombus6HHMI 177Be aware that if your academic collaborator has financial support from a company for his or her share of the work, the funding agreement may contain restrictions thatapply to the collaborative project. For example, the company may have the right todelay publication and to license the results of the collaboration. If the collaboration isan important one for your laboratory, be sure to ask in advance whether your collab-orator will use company funding for his or her work on your joint project. If so, youcan ask your institution's technology transfer office to help you determine whetherthere are restrictions that apply to your share of the work. It may be possible tonegotiate an agreement that limits the effect your collaborator's funding arrangementshave on you. (See chapter 11,\"Understanding T echnology Transfer,\" for more infor-mation about company-sponsored research.) THE INGREDIENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATION Once your agreement is in place and your expectations of one another are clear, you and your collaborator can focus on keeping your lines of communicationopen and maintaining attitudes of mutual consideration and respect. Keeping the Lines of Communication Open An open, trusting relationship is essential if you want to be able to discuss problems candidly and to give and receive critical feedback. In a good collaboration, partici-pants stay in close touch and are accessible to one another. Make it a practice toreturn your collaborator's calls right away. Meetings. Set up systems to ensure that regular communication takes place.A fixed schedule of face-to-face meetings or conference calls is a must.Also consider settingup occasional videoconferences if your institution and your collaborator's have suchfacilities. No matter what type of meeting you choose, send out agendas by e-mail, take notes during the discussions, and send out e-mail summaries of the meetings.Include in the summaries \"action items\" for each collaborator. Keeping up. Once the project is under way, stay with it. Do not be the \"rate-limiting step\" that holds things up.When unavoidable conflicts emerge and you can't meet adeadline, let that fact be known right away, so that the deadline can be reset. Dealing with Authorship and Intellectual Property Issues Expectations for authorship .Because credit for your work, expressed as author- ship of publications, is crucial to your scientific career, you need to pay attention tohow credit will be distributed in a collaboration. It's best to discuss expectations forauthorship, including who will be first author, before a collaboration begins.However, agree to revisit the issue as publication nears; the relative contributions ofdifferent participants often changes from what was originally envisioned. Once youhave a sense of whether the data from your experiments can be published, discussplans for publication immediately; don't wait until a manuscript draft is prepared.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 178 BWF/rhombus6HHMIPursuing patents. If patents are sought, appli- cations should be filed before the work is pre-sented publicly or is published; otherwise, rightswill be lost. Do not jeopardize your own or theother party's intellectual property rights by dis-closing your results prematurely. If your collaboration produces patentable dis- coveries, you will undoubtedly need to dealwith the legal concept of \"joint intellectualproperty.\" Generally, you will have to assignyour ownership in intellectual property to your institution or employer, and your collab- orator must do the same to his or her institu-tion. Each party to a collaboration will retainits own \"background\" intellectual property,that is, the intellectual property it ownedbefore undertaking the project. Each partywill also retain the intellectual property rightsto discoveries created solely by its ownresearchers in the course of the project. Joint intellectual property is that created jointly bycollaborating researchers.The collaborators'institutions may file a joint patent applicationthat names inventors from both institutions,and the institutions will hold the patentjointly. Often, the institutions will need toreach an agreement on management and licensing of the intellectual property so thatany royalties can be shared according to anagreed-upon formula. If you think a joint patent application is a likely outcome of your collaboration, askyourself these questions before you begin the collaboration: /rhombus6 What aspects of the proposed project are so interactive that any potential discover- ies will be owned jointly? /rhombus6 Who will take responsibility for, and incur the expense of, filing joint patent applications? /rhombus6 Who will maintain the patents once received? See chapter 11,\"Understanding T echnology Transfer,\" for more information about the patent process, including the effect disclosures can have on the ability to obtainpatent rights.Personal Qualities of a Good Collaborator Honesty /rhombus6 Disclose anything that might affect someone's decision to collaborate. /rhombus6 Once the collaboration is under way, be willing to \"cut through the nonsense\" and offer constructive criticism. Openness /rhombus6 Stay in touch with your collaborator throughout the project, especially when there are problems or delays. /rhombus6 Try to resolve problems with your col- laborator directly. Fairness /rhombus6 Be sure to give credit where it is due. Industry /rhombus6 Put your full effort into the project. /rhombus6 Carry your fair share of the labor and financial outlays. Respect /rhombus6 Appreciate your collaborator's contri- butions. /rhombus6 Never assume that your contributions are more important than those of your collaborator. Reliability /rhombus6 Deliver what you have promised, on time.Chapter 12 Setting Up Collaborations BWF/rhombus6HHMI 179SPECIAL CHALLENGES FOR THE BEGINNING INVESTIGATOR In the early stages of your career, collaboration can present particular challenges. You are under pressure to get your own research program up and running.Y ou can't afford to let your progress toward tenure be impeded by collaborations that do notyield good results and appropriate credit.Y ou need to keep the following facts of sci-entific life firmly in mind as you decide about specific collaborations: /rhombus6 If you collaborate with established, well-known scientists, your tenure com- mittee may undervalue your role in the effort. People may assume that you played a minor role, even if you are first author on a paper. For the same rea-son, collaborating with your postdoctoral mentor may not enhance your rep-utation as an independent investigator. If you do collaborate with establishedscientists or your previous mentor, make sure you arrange the collaborationso that the relative contributions of each scientist are made clear in publica-tions and other communications. /rhombus6 The larger the collaborator's lab and the more complex the collaboration, the harder it will be to negotiate first or last authorship. Smaller projects may offer a better chance of getting credit. /rhombus6 If you have special technical expertise that is in demand, you may be inun- dated by numerous requests to collaborate, even within your own depart- ment. Do not allow your time to become so fragmented that your centralresearch projects are neglected. Learn to say no gracefully and, if needed, ask your department chair to offer some protection. /rhombus6 If you engage in multiple collaborations, the probability increases that you will find yourself with a conflict of interest. Especially in these early years, it is better to keep things simple so that you know all the actors and can iden-tify potential conflicts. When Y our Students and Postdocs Collaborate Your graduate students and postdocs need to learn to collaborate.Y ou can start them off by assigning them joint projects and by guiding them in establishing their expec-tations of each other and in monitoring the fulfillment of promises. It is quite another matter when your students and postdocs approach scientists out- side your lab or are themselves approached as potential collaborators.They may haveno idea of the politics involved or of the extent of the commitments they are mak-ing. Insist on your prerogative to approve all outside commitments in advance.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 180 BWF/rhombus6HHMISPECIAL CHALLENGES OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION The practical difficulties of international collaboration can be overwhelming. They include geographic distance, as well as cultural, linguistic, and political barriers.You must be realistic in judging whether you have the energy and resources to make a long-distance project worthwhile.Ask yourself these questions: /rhombus6 How much travel will be required? What will be the costs of each trip in terms of airfare, hotel accommodations, and time away from the lab? /rhombus6 Is travel to this country safe? /rhombus6 How good are the channels of long-distance communication? (E-mail is vir- tually universal and certainly will help, but if the other lab is on the otherside of the world, long-distance telephone conversations will be inconvenientbecause of the time difference.) /rhombus6 Do I understand the other culture\u2014especially its etiquette of information sharing\u2014well enough to communicate about scientific matters? /rhombus6 Do I know the language of my potential collaborators? Do they have a good command of oral and written English? Will scientific papers be published inanother language? If so, how can I vouch for the translation? /rhombus6 What are the country's customs regarding publishing and authorship? /rhombus6 Is the other lab adequately equipped and supported by the country's infra- structure (e.g., electricity, telecommunications)? Although physical and technical factors are important, it is the human dimension thatmost often makes or breaks an internationalcollaboration. Be especially sensitive to emo-tions that may be in play under the surface,especially if your collaborator's lab is less wellfunded than your own. For example, your col-laborators may have concerns about beingexploited or disparaged. Considering these special challenges, interna- tional collaboration requires extra dedication.Two key ingredients should be in place at the outset: a stable funding source and at least oneindividual in the other lab who is as commit-ted to the project as you are.A Funding Source for International Collaborations The Human Frontier Science Program brings together scientists from different countries forcollaborations focused on the complex mecha-nisms of living organisms.The three-year Y oungInvestigators' Grants provide $250,000 per yearfor a team of researchers, all of whom are with- in the first five years of establishing an inde-pendent laboratory. See http://www.hfsp.org .Chapter 12 Setting Up Collaborations BWF/rhombus6HHMI 181WHEN A COLLABORATION IS NOT WORKING Collaborations can fail for various reasons. Here are some possible scenarios: /rhombus6 One party loses interest or develops other priorities and intentionally or inadvertently puts the project on the back burner.There's no intent torenege, but deadlines are allowed to slip. /rhombus6 Illness or family problems hinder someone's progress. /rhombus6 Scientific results are not forthcoming, and the project simply stalls. /rhombus6 Honest disagreements arise about the plan, finances, or authorship. /rhombus6 One or both parties behave badly (e.g., they do not honor some aspect of the agreement, steal credit, or disparage the other collaborator to others). When such situations arise, you will have to decide how to protect yourself.The worst thing you can do is to allow a bad situation to fester. If you decide your col- league is failing to fulfill the original agreements, get on the phone, or on a plane ifneed be, and have a straightforward discussion. It is worth your while to try to fix asituation, especially if you have invested significant time and resources in the project.If, however, the other party has lost all interest or you really don't get along, the bestthing might be to back out.Although you may be tempted to let your colleaguesknow about the failure, remember that such a retaliation can harm your reputation asmuch as that of your collaborator. If a collaboration doesn't succeed, it's important not to become discouraged.Although collaborations can be a lot of work and, at times, challenging, you will gain much fromworking with other scientists.Y our research can take unexpected turns and expand into new and exciting areas.Y ou will form professional relationships with scientistsoutside your department who may be willing to write letters of recom-mendationwhen it is time to apply for tenure.Y our collaborators can help increase your visibilityby inviting you to give seminars at their institutes, and they might send graduate stu- dents or postdocs to work in your lab.

COURSE DEVELOPMENT Why Have a Course in Scientific Management? The course was conceived following discussions between BWF and HHMI staff and scientists who had received research training orcareer development grants from the two organizations and expresseda need for additional training in laboratory management to success-fully launch their research programs.These scientists had notreceived formal training in this area during graduate or medical school or postdoctoral study. The course had three goals. First, it aimed to provide participants with laboratory management skills that would help them rapidlyestablish well-run, productive laboratories. Second, it aimed to pro-vide participants with an opportunity to develop networks withtheir peers and more established scientists.Third, it sought to pointout the need for early career training in laboratory management touniversities, professional societies, and postdoctoral associations andprovide these institutions with an example of how they might designtheir own courses in laboratory management.Course codirectors Andrea L. Stith (HHMI; now at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology) Course coordinator: Laura Bonetta, science writer and consultant Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 184 BWF/rhombus6HHMIHow the Course T ook Shape The course was developed over a two-and-a-half year period by staff from BWF and HHMI, with assistance from the American Association for the Advancement ofScience (AAAS). The first year was spent identifying the topics to be covered.The course developers convened two focus groups mainly composed of BWF and HHMI grant recipients,including advanced postdocs and newly appointed faculty and physician and non-physician scientists.The focus group participants (see Appendix 1) identified a diverserange of career development needs that coalesced under the general theme of scien-tific management.T o further refine the list of topics, the course developers consultedwith senior scientists and professionals affiliated with BWF and HHMI. The course developers also retained executive coaches Christine Harris, Ed.D., and Joan C. King, Ph.D., to create an in-depth introductory session on laboratory leader- ship and interpersonal management strategies designed specifically for scientists inlaboratory settings.As part of a preliminary needs assessment, Dr. Harris and Dr. Kingdesigned a questionnaire that was completed by 41 \"model laboratory leaders\"\u2014bio-medical research scientists who had been identified by their peers, students, and post-docs as particularly good motivators, mentors, leaders, or managers (see Appendix 2for the list of model laboratory leaders). Because of the limited time frame of the course, certain important topics were not covered, such as lab safety. Course developers and focus group participants felt thatthis information was either taught at most universities or was available from othersources. The course developers eventually narrowed down the list of potential topics to 14, which they thought could be adequately covered within the time frame of thecourse.These topics were /rhombus6 Laboratory leadership /rhombus6 Project management /rhombus6 Collaborations /rhombus6 The scientific investigator within the university structure /rhombus6 Getting funded /rhombus6 Getting published /rhombus6 Current issues in research ethics /rhombus6 Time management /rhombus6 Data management and laboratory notebooks /rhombus6 Mentoring and being mentored /rhombus6 Gender issues in the laboratory /rhombus6 Technology transfer /rhombus6 Obtaining and negotiating a faculty position /rhombus6 Budgets and budgeting Chapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 185The next step was to develop the chosen topics into sessions.The session organizers researched the areas, discussed the topics with BWF and HHMI grantees and senior scientific staff, determined the amount of time needed to address each topic and theformat to be used, identified and contacted potential speakers, and organized thebackground materials for the course syllabus.A course coordinator oversaw the ses-sion organizers' activities, set the final course agenda, sent out invitations to speakersand participants, and tracked the responses.The preparation time for materials, speakerinvitations, presentations, and the course notebook (see \"Course Materials\" below)was about 10 months. Course Agenda and Session Formats The course began with an evening reception and welcome and keynote addresses by the presidents of BWF and HHMI and continued over the next three-and-a-halfdays, with a full schedule of back-to-back sessions (see Appendix 3 for the courseschedule). Course topics were presented in four formats: workshop (one session),panel discussion (seven sessions), roundtable discussion (one session), and single speak-er or keynote address (seven sessions). Some sessions of interest to particular sub-groups of participants (e.g., technology transfer and obtaining a faculty position) were offered concurrently. Each session concluded with time for questions and answers.The course format also included opportunities for participants to informally networkwith their peers, the speakers, and senior scientists and staff from BWF and HHMI. Speakers and Participants The course was taught by 32 scientists and other professionals from academia, indus- try, and scientific communications (see Appendix 4). The number of participants was limited to 128 current and former BWF and HHMI grant recipients, who were selected on the basis of the stage they had reached in their scientific careers. Preference was given to scientists who either had recently obtainedacademic faculty positions and started their laboratories, had received a job offer, orhad started interviewing for a position. Forty-one percent of the course participantswere women, 43 percent were physician-scientists, and 48 percent were advanced postdocs. Cost per Participant The actual cost per participant is difficult to calculate because HHMI lent much of its infrastructure to the course and most development costs were included in staffsalaries or in time donated by speakers. However, not counting these costs, theamount was approximately $2,800 per participant, which was paid for by the spon-sors. Most of this amount can be attributed to travel, meals, lodging for participantsand speakers and speaker honoraria.A similar course conducted for on-site partici-pants at a university would cost significantly less. Course Materials Each participant was given a course notebook\u2014a large three-ring binder containing the agenda, outlines of the presentations, and other resource materials. It also con-tained exercises that were to be completed during or after some of the sessions. Eachparticipant was also given a copy of HHMI-produced videos on laboratory safety andthe opportunity to receive complimentary copies of the following books: /rhombus6 At the Helm:A Laboratory Navigator ,by Kathy Barker (Cold Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2002)/rhombus6 Tomorrow's Professor: Preparing for an Academic Career in Science Engineering ,b y Richard M.

Starting a Research Group in 1978: Are Any of the Lessons Still Relevant in 2002? Following a welcome address by BWF President Enriqueta C. Bond, Ph.D., HHMI President and Nobel laureate Thomas R. Cech, Ph.D., described his entry into bio-medical science in the 1970s. Dr. Cech talked about the challenge of job hunting andnegotiating for resources; the strategies he used to balance teaching, research, andother responsibilities; and the lessons he learned about the importance of interper-sonal skills in the establishment of a successful research program. Excerpts from Dr. Cech's address can be found in chapter 3,\"Defining and Implementing Y our Mission,\" and at http://www.hhmi.org/labmanagement . Workshop in Basic Laboratory Leadership Skills This eight-and-a-half-hour workshop, held over two consecutive days, was organized by Martin Ionescu-Pioggia, Ph.D. (BWF). Interpersonal skills are among the most difficult to teach effectively and the most important in managing a laboratory.Consequently, the course organizers allotted the largest amount of time to this ses-sion.The executive coaches for the session, management consultant Christine Harris,Ed.D., and scientist Joan C. King, Ph.D., taught participants the skills that form thebasis for effective leadership in the scientific setting. Based on the results of their sur-vey with 41 model lab leaders and six in-depth interviews, together with their com- bined expertise and experience, Dr. Harris and Dr. King recommended a set of topicsto be included in the leadership portion of the course.These topics included creatinga vision and mission statement for the laboratory; identifying key leadership values;and learning how to lead and manage, interact with, and motivate laboratory staff.Extensive time was devoted to understanding and appreciating the variety of inter-personal preferences and helping participants identify their communication styles andpersonality types.The workshop provided participants with opportunities for practic-ing lab leadership skills through visualization and role-playing exercises and small-group discussions. For example, participants were asked to visualize the ideal laborato- ry,identify their values, and translate their visions and values into an action plan. Participants worked on strategies for communicating expectations, giving and receiv- ing feedback, and managing conflict.They also took the Myers-Briggs T ype Indicator,the widely used personality inventory developed by Isabel Briggs Myers andKatharine C. Briggs.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 186 BWF/rhombus6HHMIChapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 187Because only basic leadership and interpersonal skills could be taught during the course, the organizers arranged for participants to obtain additional one-on-onetutorials after the course to develop leadership skills of particular relevance to theissues in their laboratories. Participants were invited to apply for six hours of post-course coaching in laboratory leadership from Dr. Harris and Dr. King. Project Management This two-and-a-half-hour session was organized by Jim Austin, Ph.D. (AAAS). Stanley E. Portny (Stanley E. Portny and Associates) spoke about developing a managerial per-spective toward the operation of a laboratory.A successful research program comprisesa series of discrete projects, all designed to help address different aspects of the overallprogram's goals.This session presented a proactive approach to planning and perform-ing these projects that minimizes wasted time and effort, helps anticipate risks anduncertainties, and supports timely and insightful project tracking and control.The for-mat consisted of a two-hour presentation followed by a question-and-answer period. Collaborations This one-and-a-half-hour panel session was organized by Victoria McGovern, Ph.D. (BWF).The panelists were Claire M. Fraser, Ph.D. (The Institute for GenomicResearch); Rick Tarleton, Ph.D. (University of Georgia); and Joseph DeRisi, Ph.D.(University of California-San Francisco). It explored the benefits and challenges ofcollaborative research as well as the practical issues of establishing collaborations acrosssectors and among researchers in disparate fields.The format consisted of a 10-minutepresentation by each panelist, followed by a question-and-answer period. The Scientific Investigator Within the University Structure This evening keynote session was organized by Maryrose E. Franko, Ph.D. (HHMI). Tony G.Waldrop, Ph.D. (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill), gave an overview of the \"standard\" organizational structure of a university, how the investiga- tor fits within this structure, and the entities the investigator interacts with. He alsodescribed the factors involved in promotion and tenure for university faculty. Getting Funded This two-hour panel discussion was organized by Jim Austin, Ph.D. (AAAS).The panelists were Anthony M. Coelho Jr., Ph.D. (Office of the Director, NationalInstitutes of Health [NIH]); Bettie J. Graham, Ph.D. (National Suzanne Pfeffer, Ph.D. (Stanford University).The focusof this session was on preparing winning proposals in a competitive environment. Keythemes included understanding the mission of the grant-making organization; theintricacies of the review process at NIH; and how best to meet the expectations ofreview panel members.The format consisted of a 10-minute presentation by each panelist, followed by a question-and-answer period. Getting Published This one-hour session was organized by Jim Austin, Ph.D. (AAAS).Angela Eggleston, Ph.D. (senior editor, Cell, Molecular Cell ,and Developmental Cell ), gave participants an overview of the submission and review process at a scientific journal, including how the initial assessment of a submission is made, how reviewers are chosen, how thedecision to publish is made, and what the process for revisions and appeals is.TheMaking the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 188 BWF/rhombus6HHMIpresentation also provided tips on developing a paper, including what to include in a cover letter, abstract, and introduction; how to present results; and how to apply thoseresults more broadly in the discussion.The format consisted of a 45-minute presenta- tion followed by a question-and-answer period. Current Issues in Research Ethics This evening keynote session was organized by Maryrose E. Franko, Ph.D. (HHMI). R.Alta Charo, J.D. (University of Wisconsin Law School), talked about the challengesof protecting the rights and welfare of all who volunteer to participate in researchand to make those protections relevant to the myriad new forms of research.T opicsincluded the examination of medical records, stored human tissue samples, familycohorts, and international collaborative studies. Dr. Charo also spoke about the chal-lenge of developing better rules to protect those who cannot decide for themselves toparticipate, such as children, the mentally ill, or the neurologically impaired, as well asthe challenge of managing conflict of interest within review boards. Excerpts from Dr. Charo's presentation can be found at http://www.hhmi.org/labmanagement . Time Management This two-hour panel session was organized by Maryrose E. Franko, Ph.D. (HHMI). The panelists were Richard M. Ph.D. (Stanford University); Sandra L. Schmid,Ph.D. (Scripps Research Institute); T odd R. Golub, M.D. (Dana-Farber CancerInstitute; also HHMI associate investigator).The session focused on two distinctaspects of time management in a laboratory setting: managing day-to-day activitiesefficiently, such as handling multiple priorities and deadlines, and managing the con-current demands of teaching, administrative duties, and family responsibilities.Theformat consisted of a 15-minute presentation by each panelist, followed by a ques-tion-and-answer period. Data Management and Laboratory Notebooks This two-hour panel session was organized by Maryrose E. Franko, Ph.D. (HHMI). The Laboratories);Joseph M.Vinetz, M.D. (University of T exas Medical Branch-Galveston); and David J. Adams, Ph.D. (Duke University Medical Center).The session focused on how to setup a system for efficient flow of information in the lab and how to maintain accurateand consistent records. Case studies were presented to stress the importance of main-taining electronic records and laboratory notebooks.The format consisted of a 15-minute presentation by each panelist, followed by a question-and-answer period. Mentoring and Being Mentored This topic was addressed in two separate sessions, which were organized by Victoria McGovern, Ph.D. (BWF). Speakers for the first session were Dorothy E. Shippen,Ph.D. (T exas A&M University); David S. Roos, Ph.D. Pennsylvania);and L. Hajduk, Ph.D. (University of Alabama-Birmingham; now at theMarine Biological Laboratory). Panelists for the second session were E. LynnZechiedrich, Ph.D. (Baylor College of Medicine), and Elizabeth Keath, Ph.D. (SaintLouis University).Chapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 189The sessions explored what it means to be a mentor and, in particular, using mentor- ing as a strategy for facilitating learning.The first session, lasting one-and-a-halfhours, was an introduction to basic principles of mentoring.The presentations werefollowed by a 30-minute question-and-answer period. Participants were given\"homework\" questions to complete in preparation for a one-hour session the nextday that included a panel discussion and a question-and-answer session in response toquestions from the audience.The second session on mentoring was held concurrentlywith the session \"Budgets and Budgeting.\" Roundtable Discussion: Problems and Solutions in Scientific Management This two-hour panel session was organized by Rolly L. Simpson (BWF); (labo-ratory leadership skills workshop designer); and Kathy Barker, Ph.D. (author, At the Helm:A Laboratory Navigator ). Before the course, participants were asked to submit summaries of problems they had encountered in their labs. Forty responses were received, the majority dealing withissues in laboratory leadership and mentoring. BWF and HHMI staff then selected 10cases that were representative of the topics covered in the course and career situationsof course participants. Participants met in the conference center auditorium for anintroduction to the session.Then participants were assigned to 1 of 10 small groups,each consisting of about 13 participants. Each group was given a case study and 30minutes to discuss the problem and develop a solution.The groups then returned tothe auditorium, and each was given 8 minutes to present its solution to all the sessionparticipants and receive feedback from a panel that included course presenters andBWF and HHMI staff who had developed the course sessions. The session was included as a way to tie together all the issues discussed during the course and to provide participants with an opportunity to use what they had learnedin the course to develop solutions to lab management problems.The most commonthemes selected for the case studies were mentoring, collaboration, and laboratoryleadership. In order to cover as many areas as possible, issues involving publishing,technology transfer, time management, and project management were also included.The following laboratory management problems were discussed: /rhombus6 Collaborations.A senior principal investigator used a tool for genetic map- ping studies that was developed by an assistant professor working in the field of bioinformatics.The assistant professor's technician trained the senior prin-cipal investigator's technician in the use of the tool. Should the assistant pro-fessor's contribution be acknowledged in a subsequent paper? /rhombus6 Mentoring and time management.A fourth-year postdoctoral fellow in a large research lab in a large medical school is performing poorly because of family obligations and the lack of a long-term goal.What would be the best advice from the postdoc's mentor? Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 190 BWF/rhombus6HHMI/rhombus6 Mentoring, laboratory leadership, and time management.A first-year clinical faculty member in a university research laboratory has accepted a position that includes clinical responsibilities and protected time for research. Howcan the physician-scientist balance laboratory with clinical responsibilities? /rhombus6 Mentoring and technology transfer.A postdoctoral fellow in the last year of training (Ph.D.) in a university research laboratory was working in an area that was no longer being pursued by the principal investigator. However, asresults were accumulated, the principal investigator developed renewed inter- est in the area.The postdoc wants to continue the work as an independentinvestigator after leaving the lab, but the principal investigator wants to keepthe project. How can this situation be resolved? /rhombus6 Mentoring and laboratory leadership.A new assistant professor wants his three postdocs to be more motivated and productive. How can this be done? /rhombus6 Project management and laboratory leadership.A postdoc joins two other postdocs on a project that requires two of them to work all day on Sundays. The postdoc who most recently joined the group finds it increasingly diffi-cult to work on Sundays because of family responsibilities. Can a compro-mise be worked out? /rhombus6 Mentoring.A doctoral student left a lab to take a postdoctoral position before a manuscript was completed. Subsequently, some experiments were repeated and new data were incorporated with the understanding that the formerdoctoral student would still be an author on the paper.After three years, themanuscript is still not complete.What can the former doctoral student do tomove the manuscript along? What responsibility does a principal investigatorhave to former students? /rhombus6 Laboratory leadership.A lab technician was a productive member of a labo- ratory until his acceptance into an MBA program, at which time his work and attitude began to deteriorate. It will be nine months before the lab techstarts school.What can the principal investigator do to improve the lab tech'sperformance? /rhombus6 University structure.T wo faculty members, both Ph.D.s, were encouraged to take leading roles in the establishment of a translational research program. Because of conflict between the two faculty members, the program has gonenowhere.What can be done to correct this situation? /rhombus6 Mentoring.A physician-scientist will be leaving a lab to take a position as an independent investigator.The physician-scientist has been working on several projects using mouse knockout strains and would like to take one of theprojects to the new position.The principal investigator is reluctant.What isthe principal investigator's responsibility? Gender Issues in the Laboratory This evening keynote session was organized by Laura Bonetta, Ph.D. (course coordi- nator). how gender plays arole in the professional life of a research scientist. She reviewed data from a study on the status of women faculty in science at the Massachusetts Institute of T echnologythat indicated inequities in advancement and salary levels and found that womenChapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 191faculty felt more marginalized as their careers progressed. Dr.Turrigiano also spoke about the challenges of balancing work and family and related issues, such as decidingwhen to have children and taking maternity leave. She discussed the special issues thatprincipal investigators face as they mentor women and that female scientists face asthey seek to be mentored. Technology Transfer This two-hour panel session was organized by Andrea L. Stith, Ph.D. (HHMI; now at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology).The panelists wereFrancis J. Meyer, Ph.D. (A. M. Pappas & Associates); Christopher T. Moulding(HHMI); and Martha J. Connolly, Ph.D. (EntreMed; now at the Maryland T echnologyEnterprise Institute).This session introduced participants to the terminology, pro-cesses, and concepts related to intellectual property and technology transfer.Thespeakers demonstrated various scenarios to help participants avoid potential disputesand hazards and maximize their effectiveness in working within the system.Participants received a list of helpful Web sites, textbooks, and journal articles.The format consisted of three 25-minute lectures followed by a 30-minute question-and-answer period.The session was held concurrently with the session \"Obtaining andNegotiating a Faculty Position.\" Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position This two-hour panel session was organized by Rolly L. Simpson (BWF).The speakers were Chris M. Golde, Ph.D. (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching); Johannes Walter, Ph.D. (Harvard Medical School); and Christopher Wylie, Ph.D. (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation). It was included in thecourse because the topic was of key interest to advanced postdoctoral participantswho participated in the precourse focus groups.The format consisted of three 25-minute lectures followed by a 30-minute question-and-answer period. Budgets and Budgeting This one-hour session was organized by Jim Austin, Ph.D. (AAAS). Michael E. McClure (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH) discussed writing effectivegrant proposals and tracking and managing the fiscal side of conducting research.The format consisted of a half-hour presentation followed by a question-and-answer period.The session was held concurrently with the \"Mentoring Panel Discussion.\" COURSE EVALUATION AND LESSONS LEARNED Evaluation Process Participants completed an evaluation at the end of each session and an overall evalua- tion at the end of the course (see Appendix 5 for a sample session evaluation formand Appendix 6 for the course summary evaluation form).The evaluations wereanonymous\u2014responses were associated with the participant's badge number on theevaluation form.The number was then linked to the participant's demographic infor- mation (e.g., academic level, degree), but not to his or her name.Additional feedbackwas obtained from a focus group held with several course participants directly after the course ended. Evaluations at six months and at one year have been conducted todetermine which components of the course have been useful to participants.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 192 BWF/rhombus6HHMIInformation from the on-site evaluation and the postcourse focus group was analyzed by an evaluation specialist.The results were used to shape the content of this manual and may prove useful to institutions that are developing their own courses in sci-entific management.A summary of the evaluation results is presented below. Fordetailed information about evaluation outcomes, contact BWF and HHMI at labmgmt@hhmi.org . Lessons Learned Overall impressions of the course. All 128 course participants completed the course evaluation and said they would enthusiastically recommend the course to theircolleagues. Seventy-eight percent rated the course as far exceeding or exceeding theirexpectations for overall course quality, and 87 percent rated the course as far exceed-ing or exceeding their expectations for overall relevance. Eighty-one percent said thedegree of change they anticipated in the way they run or will run their laboratoriesfar exceeded or exceeded their precourse expectations. Many mentioned they planned to share information from the course with coworkers. Some pointed out thatthe course was especially valuable for postdocs who had yet to set up a laboratory.Some participants thought the course was valuable both to senior postdocs and juniorfaculty and that it was good to have a mix of people at different levels to get different perspectives. Participants were asked to rate the overall value of each session.The following six ses- sions (in /rhombus6 \"Workshop in Basic Laboratory Leadership Skills\" Format of the course. Many participants liked that the course was held as a \"retreat\" rather than at a university or some other setting where it would be moredifficult to focus on the course content and take advantage of the networking oppor-tunities. One individual pointed out that he/she would not have been comfortablediscussing a laboratory management problem if the course had been offered athis/her university because of the lack of anonymity in such a setting. Some participants thought that the course would be improved by providing more take-home materials in book, CD/DVD, or Web format. Several participants felt oneway to increase exposure to the course was to offer video conferencing with small groups interacting at local sites.All seemed to agree that the information provided in the course should be disseminated as widely as possible. Improving the course. Participants had the following suggestions: /rhombus6 Increase the input from senior investigators\u2014for example, include them in the roundtable discussion breakout groups and have them sit on more panels and participate in the question-and-answer periods at the end of the sessions./rhombus6 Include at least one practicing scientist in each panel session. /rhombus6 Have panelists review each other's presentations before the course and adapt their presentations to avoid overlap.Allow more time for questions and answers in each session, and have a strong moderator to keep the questionsfocused on the session topic. /rhombus6 Reduce the number of plenary lectures and increase the number of small- group discussions. /rhombus6 Use \"graduates\" of the course to lead small-group breakout sessions in future courses. /rhombus6 Focus less on \"big picture\" aspects of a topic and more on its relation to sci- entific management and the needs of a beginning investigator. /rhombus6 Have the speakers include a short executive summary or take-home message for their sessions. /rhombus6 Promote networking among course participants and with speakers and senior investigators by setting aside more time for informal interactions and organiz- ing the tables by scientific field at one of the dinners. /rhombus6 Offer a follow-up workshop for more established principal investigators who are getting ready to apply for tenure. Overall course length. Seventy-four percent felt the length was about right. Twenty-four percent felt that the course was too long and should be reduced by half to one day. Participants felt that time could be saved by /rhombus6 Holding the speakers to their allotted time /rhombus6 Keeping the question-and-answer sessions more focused /rhombus6 Offering more simultaneous sessions (however, some participants felt that they were missing something when sessions were offered concurrently) /rhombus6 Reducing the length of the \"Workshop in Basic Laboratory Leadership Skills\" by conducting the Myers-Briggs testing before the course /rhombus6 Giving participants any session-related \"homework\" materials before the course Several criticized the 7:30 a.m. start times, especially those who had arrived from the West Coast. Several said they would have appreciated a longer break in the afternoon, with sufficient time for exercise or rest, even knowing that this would then push thecourse sessions into the evening hours. Most useful aspects of the course. Many respondents commented that one of the most valuable parts of the course was the question-and-answer period at the end ofeach session.This part of the session was sometimes considered more valuable thanthe structured presentations. Many respondents also felt that the networking opportu-nities during the breaks and meals were very important and would like to have hadeven more such opportunities (possibly including a more purely social event).The most popular format for the sessions was the small breakout group. Many participantsalso noted that the most useful panels included background information provided bythe presenters, followed by case study examples. Having a diverse panel in terms ofage, faculty position, and scientific discipline was also thought to be useful.Chapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 193Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 194 BWF/rhombus6HHMISessions identified as having overlap. The following sessions were identified as hav- ing similar material:\"Getting that they didn't think the sessions were redundant somuch as that some information was presented in more than one session. Some thought that in many cases this overlap served to reinforce the concepts. The course organizers held one or more group conferences with members of each session before the course, partially to reduce overlap, which is difficult to accomplishwhen multiple independent presenters are used for different sessions.These confer-ences were successful in reducing overlap within a session and probably reduced over-lap throughout the course. Additional topics for future courses. Many suggestions for additional topics were offered, but there was also concern about lengthening the course to include such ses-sions.The following is a list of ideas contributed by respondents, in no particularorder of popularity: /rhombus6 Include a separate session for physician-scientists. /rhombus6 Include a session on designing and conducting an academic course. (It was thought that this could be offered simultaneously with the session for physician-scientists.) /rhombus6 Provide more specific information on mentoring women and minorities in science. /rhombus6 Include a discussion of issues related to hiring and firing. /rhombus6 Include a separate session on how to get tenure, instead of combining the topic with how to negotiate for and obtain a job. Lessons Learned by Session Workshop in Basic Laboratory Leadership Skills. This session worked especially well when the participants broke into small groups to discuss how to resolve prob- lems or conflicts. It was suggested that sending reading material to the participantsbefore the beginning of the course might be a way to reduce the time required forthis session.Although participants enjoyed learning about themselves through theMyers-Briggs testing, they thought the testing was too time-consuming.T o reducethe length of the session, some suggested offering the Myers-Briggs testing before thecourse.There was great interest in adding material on conflict resolution (e.g., whenor when not to get involved in lab conflicts, how to fire someone, how to mendbridges).Another suggestion was to invite more senior principal investigators toattend and participate as much as possible in the question-and-answer period. Project Management. It was thought that this session might work better with the following format: a one-hour presentation followed by a one-hour small workinggroup session headed by lab managers familiar with project management strategies (principal investigators or senior technicians). In the working group session, the par-ticipants could try to apply the principles learned in the previous presentation.Participants also thought that the addition of case studies based in a biological labora- tory would make it easier to absorb the information.Collaborations. Several participants recommended limiting the presentations to a few key points and case studies and then reserving a larger amount of time for thequestion-and-answer session. In addition to learning about collaborations with largelaboratories at major research institutions or commercial operations, participants wereinterested in learning more about establishing collaborations between small indepen-dent laboratories. Participants wanted more information on how to approach some-one about starting a collaboration, how collaborations affect the tenure decision, andhow to establish authorship in a collaborative situation. The Scientific Investigator Within the University Structure. This subject might be better suited to a panel format so that once the general structure of theuniversity had been discussed, other related topics could be addressed. Of specialinterest was the information on how to assemble promotion materials and develop a\"tenure\" CV , the administrative structure of a university (e.g., the difference betweena chancellor and a provost), and how to make the maximum use of universityresearch resources. Participants were eager to learn more about the tenure process and fulfilling contract obligations. Getting Funded. Participants appreciated that the panel included a representative from NIH to explain the internal structure of NIH and whom to contact with ques-tions or problems, as well as a chair of an NIH study section.They said that they alsowanted the panel to include representatives from a university grants and contracts office and from a private foundation that supports scientists, as well as a senior princi-pal investigator from a major research university. Participants wanted an example of asuccessful R01 grant application (including a sample budget) as a handout for thissession. (Course organizers attempted to obtain examples of successful grant applica-tions from several sources but were unsuccessful in doing so.) Physician-scientistsappeared to have many questions specific to their unique status at medical schools,where they have clinical duties in addition to research. Participants thought a break-out session for this subgroup, with specific information on career development awardsand salary limits, would be useful. Getting Published. Because all the participants had some experience in writing sci- entific papers, this session was geared toward the process of getting a paper published(e.g., selecting the appropriate journal, responding to reviewer comments, and learn-ing more about the editorial process). Participants would have liked a variety of jour-nals to be represented in the panel, rather than only a single, for-profit journal(although many found the process of paper submission at such a journal interesting).Participants were also interested in learning more about how to become reviewers and wanted examples of good and bad submissions. Current Issues in Research Ethics .While several participants with Ph.D.s in the basic sciences commented that this talk was geared toward medical researchers, and assuch, should be offered as a separate session just for M.D.s, others pointed out that itwas very helpful to learn more about the human research guidelines and to not be intimidated by experiments dealing with human subjects. Other topics of interestwere the production and retention of accurate tissue and medical records, the purpose and structure of Institutional Review Boards, and international research. Some par-ticipants thought that it was especially helpful that the bioethics speaker had a lawdegree because this provided a different perspective than a presentation by a Ph.D. oran M.D.There was also considerable interest in expanding the discussion on laborato-ry ethics and issues of misconduct, in addition to the \"big picture\" ethics of using human subjects in research. Perhaps the session could be reconfigured to have twospeakers, one to deal with laboratory research problems and another to discuss the useof human subjects.Chapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 195Time Management. This session was extremely popular, especially with participants who were trying to juggle work and family issues.Any concrete suggestions on howto save time or to be more efficient were greatly appreciated.While some participantsfelt it would make more sense to separate the M.D.s and Ph.D.s into separate sessionsbecause of their different time management challenges, others thought it was a goodidea to keep the groups together to get a better understanding of each other's chal-lenges.The diverse panel (in terms of age, faculty position, mix of M.D. and Ph.D.degrees, and scientific discipline) was thought to be important to the success of thissession. Data Management and Laboratory Notebooks. Many participants recommend- ed that this session be combined with the one on project management because thetwo sessions complemented each other.They thought that having a diverse panel (interms of faculty position, M.D. and Ph.D. degrees, and scientific discipline) was anadvantage. Participants thought it would be helpful to include several senior principalinvestigators to speak about their experiences in managing a variety of projects simul-taneously.There was great interest in learning more about data management and, to alesser extent, project management software. It was suggested that vendors be invitedto display their software. Mentoring and Being Mentored. Participants appreciated the concrete sugges- tions for creating an open and productive laboratory environment, including adviceon mentoring individuals close in age to themselves (such as postdocs) and writinggood recommendation letters.There was also significant interest in learning how toget the most out of being mentored. Participants liked the diverse composition of thepanel (age, professional level, and mentoring style). Roundtable Discussion: Problems in Scientific Management. This was one of the most popular sessions in the course because it allowed participants to apply whatthey had learned in practical situations and begin to achieve a sense of competenceabout laboratory management.The session was offered on the third day of the courseafter participants had completed sufficient training to solve case studies. However, theparticipants were getting tired by this point and would have appreciated having fewerthan 10 cases to discuss as a group during the roundtable feedback session, especiallybecause some of the cases had significant overlap. Five to six cases seemed to be theideal number.A small-group format could have been used, but all participants wouldnot have benefited from feedback from the entire audience. Participants suggested including a senior principal investigator in each breakout group to help lend some perspective. However, the senior principal investigator should bereminded not to dominate the discussion process. If the course were to be held at a small research institution, it might be a good idea to use examples from a previouscourse so as not to embarrass the person submitting the problem (or potentially causemore serious problems with their department heads). It would speed up the session ifthe participants could review the case studies the night before or even to have thematerial sent to them before the course. Finally, soliciting cases during rather than before the course might have resulted in a broader, more salient variety of case studies being discussed. Participants would havebeen exposed to the wide range of components that make up lab management andhad a chance to think about how to apply the lessons they had learned to their ownsituations.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 196 BWF/rhombus6HHMIChapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 197Gender Issues in the Laboratory. Participants wanted more statistics (perhaps as \"ammunition\" to take back to their departments).They also suggested that a hand-out containing recommended reading on the subject be included in future presenta-tions. Participants wanted to expand the talk beyond women and raising children toinclude discrimination in the workplace (including minorities) and specific strategieson how to support both male and female junior faculty and postdocs. Instead ofhaving a single-speaker format, participants thought the session would benefit fromhaving panel members who are at different career stages; who have spouses withsimilar time constraints; and who have spouses who contribute their time, not justincome, to child care. Technology Transfer. Because this session was offered concurrently with \"Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position\" and attendance was optional, partici-pants recommended that they be told ahead of time why it was worthwhile to attendsuch a session. It would appear that many universities have not educated their facultyor postdocs about the benefits of patenting or bringing a product to market, so somesort of pitch should be made before the session to attract attendees. It was also rec-ommended that the panel include a technology transfer software specialist. Particpantswould have appreciated sample completed forms for invention disclosure and boiler- plate technology transfer agreements. Obtaining and Negotiating a Faculty Position. This was a very popular session, mostly with postdocs rather than junior faculty who had recently gone through theprocess of finding a job. Participants were particularly eager to learn more about whatis allowable in terms of negotiating (e.g., just how much back and forth is acceptable)and wanted more information on typical start-up packages, including sample facultyoffers. Several participants suggested this would have been an ideal format for a work-shop. Participants wanted the panel to consist of people with diverse perspectives\u2014including individuals who had recently obtained their first faculty positions andothers who had served on search committees. The session also included information on obtaining tenure. Many junior faculty course participants were unable to attend because they were attending the concurrentsession on technology transfer.They strongly recommended that the topic of obtain-ing tenure be covered in a separate session. Participants who were physician-scientists wanted to know when it was necessary to obtain legal advice for negotiating clinical duties and call schedules. Participants alsowanted tips about negotiating a job for a spouse (especially in locations with only one university). Budgets and Budgeting. Participants thought this session could be combined with the \"Getting Funded\" session. Participants thought a panel session, with at least twosenior principal investigators, and possibly a workshop or small discussion group sec-tion, would be ideal. Participants wanted more information on how to construct a rea-sonable budget for the first R01 grant application\u2014how much to allocate for salaries,fringe benefits, equipment, and supplies.As such, sample budget forms (perhaps inelectronic format on a CD) would be of great use. Participants also wanted specificinformation about what NIH (or the National Science Foundation) allows in terms ofsalaries and how to split salaries between multiple grants or funding sources. Otherissues that were of particular interest were equipment ownership (regarding NIHgrants), indirect versus direct costs, and how to make the most out of start-up funds.Making the Right Moves A Practical Guide to Scientific Management 198 BWF/rhombus6HHMIAPPENDIX 1 Focus Group Participants The following faculty and postdoctoral fellows provided feedback on the course at various stages of development: Suzanne Admiraal, Harvard Medical School Matthew Anderson, Massachusetts Institute of T echnology Gerard Blobe, Duke University Azad Bonni, Harvard Medical SchoolDoris Forest University George Daley,Whitehead Institute for Biomedical ResearchRicardo Dolmetsch, Stanford University Robert Flaumenhaft, Harvard Medical School Lisa Glickstein,Tufts University Lindee Goh, Massachusetts Institute of T echnologyWilliam C.

Adams, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center David J.Adams completed his undergraduate work in 1972 at the University of Iowa and obtained his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Nebraska. In his post-doctoral work at the University of T exas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio, hemoved his studies from steroid hormone action in the rat uterus to the understandingof estrogen-dependent growth in human breast cancer. He was a senior tumor biologistfor 12 years at Burroughs Wellcome Company, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,developing new anticancer drugs. He helped advance three compounds to clinical trial,one of which (Crisnatol) soon will be approved for therapy of brain tumors. In addi-tion, he was involved in the development and the Investigational New DrugApplication for Navelbine, an important drug for breast and ovarian cancer.Adamscurrently heads the Drug Discovery and Development Laboratory of the DukeComprehensive Cancer Center.The mission of this laboratory is to develop novel,more selective anticancer drugs and drug combinations and to provide laboratory sup-port for phase I and II clinical trials. Currently, his lab is collaborating with investigatorsat the Research Triangle Institute and the National Cancer Institute to develop the nextgeneration of drugs based on the natural product camptothecin (analogs of which areused clinically to treat breast and colon cancer). In addition,Adams's group is evaluatingnew drug combinations for leukemia, work that has led to two clinical trials at Duke.Adams is a member of the Cancer Protocol Review Committee and Duke UniversityMedical Center Institutional Review Board, which are responsible for protectinghuman subjects in clinical research. Thomas R. Cech, Ph.D., President, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Born in Chicago, Illinois, on December 8, 1947, and raised and educated in Iowa,T om Cech received a B.A. degree in chemistry from Grinnell College. He obtained hisPh.D. in chemistry from the University of California-Berkeley and then conductedpostdoctoral research in the Department of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology. In 1978, he joined the faculty of the University of Colorado-Boulder, where he became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator in 1988and Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1990. In 1982, Cechand his research group announced that an RNA molecule from Tetrahymena ,a single- celled pond organism, cut and rejoined chemical bonds in the complete absence ofproteins.Thus, RNA was not restricted to being a passive carrier of genetic informa-tion but had an active role in cellular metabolism.This discovery of self-splicing RNAprovided the first exception to the long-held belief that biological reactions are alwayscatalyzed by proteins. In addition, it has been heralded as providing a new, plausible sce-nario for the origin of life. Because RNA can be both an information-carrying mole-cule and a catalyst, perhaps the first self-reproducing system consisted of RNA alone.Only years later was it recognized that RNA catalysts, or \"ribozymes,\" might provide anew class of highly specific pharmaceutical agents, able to cleave and thereby inactivateviral RNAs or other RNAs involved in disease. Cech has received many national andinternational awards and prizes, including the Heineken Prize of the Royal NetherlandsAcademy of Sciences (1988), the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award (1988),the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1989), and the National Medal of Science (1995). In1987, Cech was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and also was awarded alifetime professorship by the American Cancer Society. Since 2000, Cech has beenpresident of HHMI, headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. He continues researchon ribozyme structure and on telomerase in his Boulder, Colorado, laboratory.Chapter 13 Course in Scientific Management:An Overview and Lessons Learned BWF/rhombus6HHMI 207R.
