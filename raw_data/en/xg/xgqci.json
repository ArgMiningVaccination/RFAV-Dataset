It is a reaction on the skin to a viral infection and is harmless and oral antihistamines can be given for symptomatic relief of itching. After much research, it was very clear to me what I would do if I were treating my own child using Ayurvedic principles. To reduce the Pitta in the rakta dhatu and to balance the excess pitta in the liver.

She added a banana (go mommy!) to this and gave it to him once a day for 3 days. The results are amazing! This photo shows day one, day two, and day three! Remarkable difference and this is why I LOVE practicing Ayurveda! Thanks, Jenny for letting me share! Your little sweet Ben is so precious! "}
