Hardy, M.D., director of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Integrative Medicine Medical Group, respiratory disease (including sinusitus, environmental asthma and related conditions) has become America's first environmental epidemic, with nearly one-third of Americans afflicted with sinusitis, allergies, asthma or bronchitis. Dr. Hardy is a board-certified specialist in internal medicine, and a member of the American Botanical Society and the American Holistic Medical Association. \"While conventional medicine can often effectively treat the symptoms, most chronic respiratory sufferers are told that they simply must learn to 'live with it,'\" says Dr. Hardy. \"However, extending conventional medical therapies to include integrative approaches can be highly beneficial to many sufferers,\" she adds. Paul Steier, D.O., one of the physicians in the Integrative Medicine Medical Group, notes that respiratory problems are particularly prevalent in the greater Los Angeles area. \"There has been a substantial increase in all respiratory diseases in urban Southern California,\" he says. The Oct. 30 presentation will provide participants with information on the basics of addressing these issues holistically. \"There's no magic bullet,\" he says, \"but sometimes making some very simple lifestyle changes can make a significant difference. The key lies in knowing what changes can benefit you.\" For example, some people are sensitive to fungi and yeast, both of which thrive on sugar. So, says Dr. Steier, avoiding sugar may be helpful in improving the well-being of the individual. Another measure that is appropriate for some individuals is diet rotation. Sometimes the immune system can be become \"hyper vigilant,\" identifying even naturally occurring elements as foreign entities and attacking them. By rotating one's diet, it is sometimes possible to identify - and then avoid -- specific items that cause a reaction. In addition to dietary modification, the presentation will include information on other techniques such as vitamin and herbal supplements, aromatherapy, the use of ionizers and filters, nasal irrigation and saline nasal sprays, and more. # # # For media information and interviews, call 310-423-47 Story Source: Materials provided by [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](http://www.csmc.edu).
