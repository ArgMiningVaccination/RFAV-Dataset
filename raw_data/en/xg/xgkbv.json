The Good and Bad About Drinking Charcoal - Beware of These Claims! What are the real health benefits of using activated charcoal products? If you plan to buy activated charcoal, you need to know how to differentiate between myths and facts. Here are the most common health claims most brands make when selling activated charcoal capsules, powder, and supplements: 1. Detoxifies Your Body The claims are that drinking organic activated charcoal pulls toxins from the body and can be a strong detoxifier. However, strong detox isn't always a good thing for your body. When you take something that detoxes your body, your body also loses nutrients in the process. So if you go on a cleansing program, make sure you still consume the necessary nutrients and minerals to maintain normal bodily functions. Otherwise, your cleanse will do more harm than good. 2. Gives You a Flat Stomach The claim is drinking charcoal helps cleanse the intestine and your colon, which helps get rid of bloating. Sadly, charcoal does not burn fat and won't make you have a slimmer body. It can just help with bloating and help you fit into your clothing a bit better. If you want to lose weight, then you need to combine using activated charcoal with proper diet and regular exercise.

Cures Hangovers The claim is that the strong cleansing properties in activated charcoal helps remove toxins from your bloodstream and liver, but it does not absorb any of the alcohol left in your system. So many people believe this helps your head in the morning, but it only minimally helps get rid of that headache from last night's drinking.

Also, do not attempt to perform any emergency poison treatment procedure using activated charcoal if you do not have any professional experience. Simply put, activated charcoal only becomes effective in treating poisoning if the procedure is performed by a professional. Although you can use it to treat mild food or toxin poisoning, do not forget to visit a medical professional immediately after that. 6. Filtering Water Yes, you can use activated charcoal or charcoal briquettes as water filters. It can effectively absorb the harmful toxins, minerals, and contaminants in your drinking water to make it safe for consumption. 7. Whitening Teeth There are plenty of activated charcoal-based toothpaste solutions available on the market nowadays. But is there any truth to their teeth-whitening claims? The answer: yes!
