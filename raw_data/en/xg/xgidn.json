It's in patients' best interests to tell their doctor about the CAMs they're taking, experts say, because some alternative medicines may interfere with over-the-counter medications, prescription drugs, or other conventional medical approaches. \"Communication between patients and physicians about CAM and conventional therapies is vital to ensuring safe, integrated use of all health care approaches,\" the report states. An open dialogue \"allows patients and physicians the opportunity to identify CAM practices that might be beneficial and also minimizes risks to a patient from potential therapy interactions.\" Among a total of 1,559 individuals aged 50 and older surveyed in the spring of 2006, 63 per cent reported having used one or more CAM therapies. People between the ages of 50 and 59 are the most likely to report CAM use, according to the survey results, which can be found at www.aarp.org/research/health/prevention/camt2007.html. Forty-five per cent of CAM enthusiasts used massage therapy, chiropractic manipulation or other bodywork; 42 per cent used herbal or dietary supplements; 15 per cent used mind/body practices, including hypnosis and meditation; 14 per cent used naturopathy, acupuncture, or homeopathy; and 10 per cent had tried energy therapies. Sixty-six per cent of CAM users said they did so to treat a specific health problem; 65 per cent for overall wellness; 45 per cent to supplement conventional medicine; and 42 per cent to prevent illness. Sixty-nine per cent of those who reported using CAM had not discussed it with a doctor. Why? Forty-two per cent said because their doctor never asked; 30 per cent said they did not know they should; 19 per cent felt there was not enough time during the office visit; 17 per cent didn't think the doctor would know about the topic; and 12 per cent thought the doctor would be dismissive or tell them not to use CAM. Women were more likely than men to have discussed CAM use with their doctor (26 per cent v 16 per cent) and those younger than age 65 were more likely to discuss CAM use than were older individuals.
