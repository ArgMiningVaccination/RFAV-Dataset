I have tried traditional medicine, diet, and they all have definitely helped. I wanted to seek some alternative aid as well to see if it would help me as well. I came with no expectations other than to experiment and learn at the very least. Oksana took the time to ask me so many questions I had never thought about it. It was kind of like a little therapy session in terms of really thinking about how I am and how my own body is. She took about a week after that to see all my answers and develop the proper remedy for me. It ended up being Nux vomica. She gave me very clear and thorough instructions on how to use it. I have to say it has helped tremendously. My stomach issues have greatly decreased and have not affected my day to day activity. For anyone considering alternative remedies and medicine I would highly recommend coming here for your needs to be fulfilled. - 12/2/2022Updated review Returning customer! During Thanksgiving week our whole office got sick with this nasty flu, including myself. I had fever, body aches, chills, headache - couldn't get up from bed! I called Oksana and after brief conversation she was able to find a right remedy for me. I was feeling much better next day! My coworkers were sick for almost 2 weeks, while I was able to return to work so quickly feeling great! Thank you, Oksana, you are the best!10/8/2014Previous review It is such a pleasure to receive help from such a professional like Oksana. I highly recommend her services as it has helped me a lot! - 1/10/2022 I can not say enough about Oksana, and the services she provides. Let me begin by stating that this is my first experience with homeopathic remedies. I had been suffering for a number of years with a variety of different ailments: hair loss, digestive issues, stress related issues, etc. I have been to countless doctors who attribute these issues to age and don't really seem to be able to provide a solution or relief. So, I decided to try another route. I did a quick Yelp search looking for homeopathic doctors and found Oksana. I was able to quickly book an appointment with her and was able to see her professionalism and expertise right off the bat. The initial consultation is amazing. She literally asks you every detail about every facet of health. But, what stood out to me was her attentiveness. She listened closely to all of my ailments, asked great follow-up questions, and really took her time when choosing the specific remedies I needed to feel better. Finding Oksana was incredible, and I can confidently say that I am no longer suffering from the issues that caused me to seek her out, or those issues have significantly improved. If you are open to trying different forms of healing, you will not regret paying Oksana a visit. - 1/17/2018 Amazing!!! If you have any weird ailment's that you need to get to the bottom too, this is definitely the way to get it done. Kellie is amazing at what she does, she really helps you get down to the problem. Through her specialty blood tests where she views your blood through a microscope, to her hair sample tests. If you decide to do both test there's a discount. Make an appointment so you can figure out what's wrong with you, and how to fix it! - 7/12/2019 I am so thankful to Oksana for how my health has improved. For two years my doctor was prescribing antibiotics for recurring UTIs, but my symptoms didn't not resolve. After a month of following Oksana's advice I have been pain free. - 6/21/2016 She is the best! She is so patient and caring, she listens to you and spend a lot of time to know more and more about you to get to the point. She is young but cares about you like a Mom! The way she treats a patient is like you are the only patient! and I know she is busy. I am trying to get rid of my old asthma problem and in the first steps of the way, but already feel so good about her knowledge and treatment. Thank you Oksana - 3/10/2021 I have known Oksana for about 6 years already and have been using her services very successfully all these years. And not only me! Several members of my family, on my advice, are successfully treating their ailments with her. Oksana is a great professional, attentive doctor who sympathizes with her patients and sincerely wants to help. She has saved me and my family members more than once in difficult health situations. Then when allopathic medicine was unable to help. And Oksana solved these problems quickly and professionally. She always listens carefully to her patients and selects the appropriate treatment carefully, efficiently and quickly. Over the years, I have repeatedly been convinced of Oksana's exceptional professionalism as a doctor and Oksana's exceptional personal qualities as a person! And I'm not exaggerating at all if I say that these years Oksana has become a very close person for our family! I wish her and her family good health and many years of successful professional career for our beloved Oksana! - 5/11/2020 I have known Oksana for more than 4 years. During this time, she has been my mentor at the Los Angeles School of Homeopathy and currently helps me with my own practice. Oksana is very professional and very knowledgeable homeopath, who constantly improves her education and shares her knowledge with others. In addition, I wanted to mention that she is very kind, caring, supportive and good-hearted person. I feel blessed that Oksana had been my mentor during my school years, a person who not only believed in me, but later helped me to find a better approach to start my own practice. I highly recommend Oksana as a professional mentor for homeopathic students as well as a homeopathic practitioner - 4/19/2017 Oksana was a life saver! My 6 week old baby had bronchiolitis and was coughing for days.. After Kaiser said there was nothing they could do, I turned to homeopathy for help. After Oksana treated me, I noticed about a 75% improvement in my baby's cough within 24 hours! It was amazing. She also followed up with me and cared. Thank you!!!! - 10/8/2014 My life would not be the same if it were not for the miracles that Oksana made possible, with her extensive knowledge and her ability assess the situation she was able to the perfect cure. She is not like most other doctors i have had, she cares, REALLY cares about her patients, and i can honestly say that she has become a friend! I am glad that i have met such a wonderful person! History: Prior to this i did not believe in homeopathic medicines, i was very skeptical but I was sick of the medicines i had been prescribed by doctors, i had about 7-8 different nerve medicines due to a severe burn, and about 4-5 very strong pain medicines. When we first met i didn't believe that something so simple could relieve any pain or help but again i was willing to try anything! After we started I couldn't believe the results, i honestly stopped taking my medicines that my doctors prescribed and continued to take the homeopathic medicine. Then i thought maybe it wasn't the medicines maybe i just healed and was doing great and didn't need anything anymore. I experimented and stopped taking the homeopathic medicine and a lot of the pain came back, i realized that this was the reason i could bare my everyday life. I was able to replace so many medicines with what feels like drinking 2 teaspoons of water! Take it from me give it a try! The results were unbelievable! I would recommend this to anyone and from what i hear there is something for everything! Eastern medicine has been around a lot longer than western medicine. I am not saying that i know it will work for you nor am i saying use this as an alternative from going to your doctor but again from my experience WOW!
