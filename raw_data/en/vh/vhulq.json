For me, shamanism is a language grounded in nature for connecting physicality and spirituality. We can all be shamans. A shaman is simply a person who acts as an instrument for energy, a channel to facilitate communication between the seen and the unseen. Someone who has done deep healing work, and gone as deep as is needed to feel into the darkness, then returning to the light to help humanity increase it's realized potential in this life and generations to come. ROOTS I have trained in Native American and African Shamanism, as well as Reiki Drumming. All of which help in healing the soul and helping people connect with what they truly want in life. Unlike some traditions where the shaman does the journey for you, I believe in facilitating a journey that you do for yourself. AWARENESS OF SELF IN RELATION TO NATURE I help my clients' find an increased awareness of self in relation to what matters to them, nature and other beings by way of ceremony, ritual, meditation, and journey work. When done with intention and commitment in cooperation with nature, we can tap into the conduit that connects us all and in doing so brings clarity of purpose.
