HealthMasters Naturopath Kevin Tresize ND Treatment Recommendations 1.0 Core Recommendations 1.1 [D-Ribose](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-d-ribose-300-g) Dosage: For fatigue, take 5.0g (1\u00bc tsp) once daily. For chronic fatigue syndrome, take 5g (1\u00bc tsp) three times daily D-ribose is required for ATP production, improving mitochondrial energy production when cellular bioenergetics are impaired. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - D-ribose is a naturally occurring monosaccharide within the pentose pathway that assists with ATP production.[78] - D-ribose is involved in the synthesis of adenosine, used to create ATP. The chemical structure of ATP consists of adenosine coupled to three phosphate groups, with adenosine itself composed of an adenine ring and ribose.[79] - A large, multicentre study involving 257 patients with fibromyalgia and CFS showed that 5 g of ribose given three times daily for three weeks significantly improved energy levels by 61%, with additional improvements in overall wellbeing, cognitive function, sleep quality and pain.[80] 1.2 [Vitamins B5, B6 & C for Stress and Adrenal Health](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-hpa-essentials-60-tabs) Dosage: Take 1 tablet twice daily with food. Nutritional cofactors required for neurotransmission and steroid hormone synthesis, to regulate HPA axis activity (adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol synthesis) and the sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the stress response in fatigued individuals. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Vitamin B5 forms part of coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for the production of acetylcholine[81] (a neurotransmitter involved in brain and muscle function). CoA is also required for the synthesis of steroid hormones including cortisone.[82] - Vitamin B6, is a vital cofactor for transaminase enzymes, which are fundamental in the creation of GABA, dopamine, histamine and serotonin.[83] Research also suggests that vitamin B6 diminishes sympathetic output and acts peripherally to blunt the physiological impact of corticosteroids.[84] - Biotin (vitamin B7) is an important cofactor for enzyme pyruvate carboxylase, which is involved in cortisol production.[85] - Vitamin C is involved in dopamine production and is a necessary cofactor for the activity of enzyme, dopamine B-hydroxylase.[86] 1.3 [Enhanced Bioavailability Ubiquinol for Energy and Cardiovascular Health](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-bio-q-absorb-ubiquinol-30-soft-gel-capsules) Dosage: Take 1 capsule daily with food and 1 capsule during day if required. Active ubiquinol (CoQ10) to support ATP production required for cellular energy and the maintenance of neuronal energy reserves. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - CoQ10, in both its reduced (ubiquinol) and oxidised forms (ubiquinone), is involved in oxidative phosphorylation, facilitating ATP production within the mitochondria.[87],[88] - CoQ10 (100 mg/d for three months) prescribed to women with chronic fatigue significantly improved fatigue and exercise tolerance in 90% of supplemented participants,[89] while 150 mg/d of CoQ10 over 12 weeks demonstrated improvements in autonomic nervous function, cognitive function, sleep quality and depressive symptoms.[90] - CoQ10 also functions as a membrane antioxidant, therefore protecting the mitochondrial membrane from oxidation and lipid peroxidation.[91],[92] 1.4 [Mental and Physical Energy Powder](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/search?q=Metagenics+EnergyX) Dosage: Add 2 level scoops (9.5 g) to 200 mL of water, twice daily. A magnesium formula that provides cofactors required for energy production and oxidative phosphorylation, to reduce the effects of physical and mental fatigue. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Magnesium is a critical cofactor for ATP manufacture within the electron transport chain, which generates phosphorylation reactions. Magnesium ions support cellular bioenergetics through interactions with phosphorylated molecules and by influencing the kinetics of ion transport across plasma membranes.[93] - Phosphate is required for the generation of ATP (adenosine combined with three phosphate groups), providing high-energy phosphate bonds that, when hydrolysed, release energy required for cellular processes.[94] - Carnitine assists in the transport of fatty acids across cell membranes, particularly in muscle tissues, for use as an energy source. It is essential for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, the primary fuel source for the heart and skeletal muscle.[95] - 4 g/d of carnitine has been shown to reduce both physical and mental fatigue in a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial involving 96 subjects prescribed acetyl-L-carnitine for 180 days.[96] - Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) is many including oxidative phosphorylation.[97] - Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), as part of coenzyme A, participates in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and protein. It also plays a role in cellular respiration, the oxidation of fatty acids and acetylation of other molecules.[98] - Mecobalamin (vitamin B12) has several key roles, including cell growth and replication; metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins; nucleic acid synthesis and red blood cell production.[99] - Supports optimal thyroid functioning, with iodine,[100] tyrosine,[101] selenium[102] and zinc[103] required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones and the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to active T3. 1.5 [High Purity, Low Reflux, Concentrated Fish Oil Liquid or Capsules](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/search?q=Metagenics+MetaPure+EPA%2FDHA) Dosage: 4.2 mL (1 tsp) daily or 2 capsules twice daily. Omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), associated with impaired mitochondrial function and cardiovascular disease risk. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) modulate the production of eicosanoids, cytokines and other factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which regulate the inflammatory response.[104],[105],[106] - EPA and DHA can inhibit cytokine-induced endothelial activation and reduce endothelial migration and proliferation, essential to vascular endothelial cell wound repair. This action occurs via the suppression of VEGF.[107] - EPA and DHA decreases proinflammatory matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), a protease that regulates pathological remodelling of the extracellular matrix, basement membrane, and other tissues in the body by digesting collagen components in these tissues, causing inflammation and fibrosis.[108] 1.6 [Alpha Lipoic Acid for Antioxidant Support](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-lipoic-acid-600-60-tabs) Dosage: 1 tablet daily with food. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an intracellular antioxidant that protects mitochondrial membranes from free radical damage, improving their structure and function to facilitate cellular bioenergetics. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Lipoic acid is a enzymes play a key role in both anaerobic and aerobic cellular energy metabolism,[109] facilitating the production of mitochondrial ATP. - ALA features two thiol groups, which facilitate its redox activity in the body. From its oxidised state, ALA cycles into its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) enzymes. DHLA assist in the regeneration of endogenous antioxidants, which are essential in stabilising oxidative stress in the body.[110] - LA has been shown to induce nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 proteins (Nrf2), which are involved in up-regulating genetic expression of endogenous antioxidants and detoxification enzymes in the body.[111] 2.0 Additional Considerations If presenting with low iron or iron deficiency anaemia: 2.1 [High Potency Vegetarian Iron with 5-MTHF](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-hemagenics-iron-advanced-with-5-mthf-30caps) Dosage: Take 1 capsule daily with food.

Vitamin C also increases the absorption of iron.[113] If patient presents with low mood/depression: 2.2 [BCM-95 Turmeric & Saffron for Depression](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-infla-mood-60-caps) Dosage: Take 1 capsule twice daily with food. An anti-inflammatory herbal blend that reduces HPA activity, preventing stress-induced elevation of cortisol, glutamate excitotoxicity and subsequent volumetric changes within the brain. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Safranal and crocin, present in saffron, have been shown to reduce HPA axis activity and decrease stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels.[114] - Safranal has also been shown to have anxiolytic and sedative effects via innervation of the GABAergic pathway.[115] In vitro, crocin was found to have a weak, but significant affinity to the NMDA receptor and to reduce ethanol-induced depression via this affinity with the NMDA-receptor.[116] - Turmeric activates glutamate randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 123 participants who were prescribed 500 mg/d of BCM-95 Turmeric combined with 30 mg/d of saffron revealed significant reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms after 12 weeks.[118] If presenting with stress-induced exhaustion: 2.3 [Herbal and Nutrition Support for Adrenal Health](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-adrenotone-120-tablets) Dosage: Take 1 tablet three times daily with food or Take 2 tablets morning and midday. Adaptogenic herbs and tyrosine to modulate HPA axis function, enhancing stress adaptation, cognitive function and energy production. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Withania, Siberian ginseng and rhodiola have been shown to modulate HPA axis activity. Withania and Siberian ginseng were shown to down-regulate cortisol-inducing CRH, while rhodiola has been observed to exert a stress protective effect via inhibition of CRH, resulting in a modulatory effect on cortisol production.[119] - Fifty-two subjects experiencing chronic stress received 600 mg/d of withania extract and demonstrated reductions in perceived stress after four and eight weeks of supplementation, as well as a reduction in serum cortisol levels after four and eight weeks.[120] - Withania[121] and liquorice[122],[123] are shown to moderate levels of NO and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in models of cellular stress. These adaptogens ameliorate the impact of stress upon cellular energy production. - Tyrosine is the core amino acid involved in the synthesis of dopamine and noradrenaline and provides essential neurotransmitter support for cognitive enhancement.[124] If presenting with cognitive decline/mental fatigue: 2.3 [Lipids and Tocotrienols for Healthy Cell Membranes and Cognition](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-omega-brain-plus-190ml) Dosage: Take 1 metric teaspoon (5.0 mL or by measuring cap) twice daily. A combination of phospholipids and essential fatty acids to enhance mitochondrial membrane structure and neuronal energy production. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - DHA and EPA are crucial to normal neurological function, with deficiency resulting in neuronal impairment and decreased ATP production.[125] - DHA constitutes between 30% and 40% of the phospholipids of the cerebral cortex and retina[126] and increases cell membrane fluidity, required for neurotransmission[127] and synaptic plasticity.[128] - Depletion of phospholipids within the mitochondria has been found to severely impair mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory chain activity,[129] ATP production and cell survival and growth.[130] - Tocotrienols (vitamin E) are a potent antioxidant for lipid-rich tissue[131] found within the central nervous system and mitochondria, correcting redox imbalances that would otherwise promote DNA damage and disrupted cellular homeostasis.[132] If presenting with chronic infection: 2.4 [AHCC and Ginger](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-immunogenics-60-capsules) Dosage: Take 2 capsules twice daily. Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) and ginger enhance immune function and surveillance, to support the immune system at times of chronic and serious infection. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - AHCC has been shown to increase interferon gamma (IFN-)-producing T cells and splenic T cell populations,[133] and enhance splenic natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity.[134],[135] - AHCC lowers local cortisol levels and systemic levels of noradrenalin and cortisol,[136] while also intensifying local immune infiltration but lowering systemic leukocyte activity for a more controlled immune response.[137] AND Dosage: Take 4 capsules or 1ml daily with food until blood test is 150 then half dose. Vitamin D to modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses, supporting immune function during infection. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: Vitamin D receptors are expressed on a wide variety of cell types and are involved in the modulation of activated T and B lymphocytes.[138] Vitamin D has been shown to regulate T helper cell and dendritic cell function, as well as induce regulatory T cells.[139] For bacterial and/or fungal infections and/or chronic gut infections: 2.6 [Small Intestinal Bacterial Control](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-bactrex-60-caps) Dosage: Take 2 capsules twice daily with food. Potent antimicrobial herbs phellodendron, oregano, thyme and clove, to penetrate biofilms, microbial and inhibit infection. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Thymol, found in thyme, has been shown to disrupt cell wall membranes.[140] - Eugenol, from clove, has exhibited a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity,[141] inhibiting the growth of gut pathogens difficile, Escherichia coli and Candida - been shown to have potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions, due to berberine's activity against stealth pathogens; inhibiting bacterial protein and DNA synthesis of cell wall deficient microbes,[143],[144] and preventing biofilm formation.[145] - Oregano inhibits the growth of preformed biofilms, helping to eradicate persistent and recurrent infections that are resistant to antibiotics.[146] AND 2.6 [High Potency IgG Colostrum in a Capsule Trace Nutrients OR High Potency Colostrum with Glyconutrients](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-ultra-probioplex-80-caps) Dosage: Take 2 capsules twice daily with food or 2 level teaspoons (5.0 g) to 200mL water once per day. High Potency bovine colostrum to maintain normal gastrointestinal and immune function and build resistance to digestive tract infection. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Colostrum contains high levels of immunoglobulins, known collectively as lactoglobulin, that are vital to the removal of toxins and foreign microbes from the gut.[147] - Lactoglobulins bind to bacteria, parasites and virally infected cells to form an immune complex that immobilises the pathogen, reducing its ability to bind to gastrointestinal mucosa.[148] - Glyconutrients (oligosaccharides) in bovine colostrum prevent the adherence of pathogenic bacteria to mucous membranes and cleave bacteria that are already attached.[149] If patient has had exposure to biological biotoxins (i.e. tick-borne infections): 2.7 Refer to the Gut Pathogen Elimination Detoxification [Metagenics Clinical Detoxification Program](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/collections/metagenics-metagenics-clinical-detoxification) under Supportive Programs If patient has had exposure to environmental biotoxins: 2.8 Refer to the Liver Chemical Clearance Program in [Metagenics Clinical Detoxification Programs](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/collections/metagenics-metagenics-clinical-detoxification) under Supportive Programs If patient presents with glycaemic dysregulation: 2.9 [Cocoa, Cinnamon and Chromium for Metabolic Syndrome](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-resist-x-advanced) Dosage: 1 tablet twice daily with food. Antihyperglycaemic herbs and nutrients that moderate glucose uptake and metabolism via AMPK/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR)/phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and protein kinase B while also stimulating insulin secretion. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Cocoa polyphenols may assist in the maintenance of cellular redox states in pancreatic -cell lines, thereby exerting a protective influence against -cell dysfunction.[150] - Cocoa polyphenols, cinnamon, [151] chromium [152] and gymnema[ 153] may reduce fasting glucose and facilitate glucose uptake, in addition to down-regulating markers correlated with diminished glucose transport. - A randomised clinical trial in 66 subjects with type 2 diabetes given 4.8 g/d of cinnamon found significant reductions in fasting glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 12 weeks of treatment.[154] AND 2.9 The [Metagenics Shake It Practitioner Weight Management Program](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/collections/metagenics-shake-it-range) If presenting with symptoms of hypothyroid: 2.10 [Lycium Hypothyroid Support](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/products/metagenics-thyrobalance-60-tabs) Dosage: 2 tablets twice daily until improvement, reducing to 1 tablet twice daily. This combination of herbs and nutrients provides multiple benefits for thyroid health including enhanced thyroid hormone production, antioxidant protection of thyroid tissue and adaptogenic support. Mechanism of Action/Clinical Research: - Withania has been shown to directly induce thyroid hormone release at the glandular level, enhance the conversion of T4 to T3 and modulate levels of glucocorticoids.[155] - A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 50 participants with subclinical hypothyroidism demonstrated that 600 mg/d of withania for eight weeks significantly improved TSH, T3 and T4 levels.[156] - Iodine is an essential cofactor for the production of thyroid hormones. T4, the prohormone, has four iodine molecules, and is converted to the active T3 by the removal of one of these iodines by deiodinase enzymes.[157] - Selenium is involved in the metabolism of iodine. Iodothyronine deiodinase enzymes, responsible for the activation of thyroid hormones, contain selenocysteine.[158] - Zinc is required in the cysteine residues of thyroid transcription factors and to facilitate the release of retinol-binding protein, which plays a central role in T4 to T3 conversion.[159] - Vitamin A is required for peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones and the conversion of T4 to T3 through induction of 5'-deiodinase in the liver and thyroid.[160] It is also required for the expression of T3 nuclear receptors. - Vitamin E is important for the conversion of T4 to T3, supporting the function of iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase.[161] Supportive Programs Reduced exposure to environmental and endogenous toxins supports optimal mitochondrial function and cellular energetics. The [Metagenics Clinical Detoxification Program](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/collections/metagenics-metagenics-clinical-detoxification) is designed to reduce toxic burden, increase toxin resilience and improve the efficiency of waste elimination. The [Metagenics Shake It Practitioner Weight Management Program](https://shop.healthmasters.com.au/collections/metagenics-shake-it-range) is designed to help patients comfortably transition from a hypercaloric diet to a hypocaloric diet, facilitating sustainable weight loss while also improving insulin sensitivity and optimising metabolic function. Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations Diet: - Current research indicates that a balanced diet inclusive of high-fibre whole grains, polyphenol-rich vegetables and fruit, and omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods may reduce disease-related fatigue symptoms.[162] - The Mediterranean diet has been found to improve disease-related fatigue by lowering the inflammatory load and simultaneously balancing gut microbiota.[163] - The Mediterranean diet is inclusive of high intake of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, quality essential fatty acids, and wholegrains (limiting starchy grains and vegetables). - The Metagenics Wellness Diet reflects the wholefood principles of the Mediterranean diet and also provides a simple guide to moderate portion size and the overall balance of macronutrients. - Insufficient amino acid intake has been implicated in the development of disease-related fatigue. Particularly glutamine, which has been identified as significantly depleted in patients with CFS compared to healthy controls. As glutamine is utilised during gluconeogenesis, de novo synthesis of amino acids and proteins, and immune-related catabolic processes (e.g., muscles maintain a high glutamine output to feed lymphocytes and macrophages), insufficient glutamine intake negatively affects these processes and may contribute to fatigue.[164] - Maintaining muscle mass and strength through adequate protein intake may enhance fatigue by preserving functional capacities. In particular, whey protein, which is rapidly digestible and high in leucine, has been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.[165] - Avoid low kilojoule diets or high-energy foods that are nutritionally poor. Energy-dense foods, such as chocolate bars or caffeinated drinks, only offer a temporary energy boost that may worsen fatigue. - Consuming protein and low glycaemic index carbohydrates, while also avoiding refined carbohydrates may assist with blood glucose stabilisation. Lifestyle - Infrared light therapy has been shown to increase ATP production and reduce fatigue. Specifically, the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been shown to be photosensitive to red and near-infrared light.[166],[167] - Ensure adequate sleep, achieving approximately eight hours of sleep each night.[168] - Avoid alcohol, illicit drugs or additional stimulant substances (caffeine, nicotine), as these may negatively impact HPA axis activity and nervous system function, contributing to daytime fatigue and/or disturbing normal sleep patterns.[169] - Engage in regular physical activity to improve fitness, health and wellbeing, and reduce stress.[170] The type and amount of exercise may depend on fatigue severity and patients may require a graded exercise program to prevent post-exertional fatigue. - An initially supervised exercise program to preserve and increase strength is beneficial for most patients.[171] - A Cochrane review consisting of eight studies and 1,518 participants with CFS found that individuals who regularly exercised for 12 to 26 weeks experienced less fatigue and improved physical functioning. Participants exercised at different levels of intensity using variations of aerobic exercise such as walking, swimming or cycling.[172] - Cognitive-behavioural therapy trials have shown positive effects on fatigue levels, work, depression/anxiety, and social adjustment.[173] References [78] fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia with D-ribose- an open-label, multicenter study.
