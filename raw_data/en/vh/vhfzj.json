In our vision for the future, the City of Varberg has unique opportunities. Our goal is clear, and we are acting on it. We are building a community converging around means of public transportation in a rapidly expanding region. The railroad, which has long created a barrier between the seaside and the city centre, will now be relocated into a tunnel underneath the city. To expand on this opportunity we are moving the harbour in order to further free up land for letting the city reclaim its position as a seaside town. In total, the project will result inmore than 500,000m 2of land for development of our future city front. For people living, working or visiting the city of Varberg, the change will dramatically increase the freedom to experiencethe coastline. Places of residency, places for eating and meeting, places to shop and work, etc. - comes as a bonus. Come to Varberg. Share our vision.

A sector with the highest expectations is the digital economy. That's why the newly elected President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, made the development of the digital single market a priority right of the beginning of his mandate. In his speech at the European Parliament in July 2014 he said: \"We must make better use of the opportunities of the digital technology which knows no borders. We must break down national silos in telecommunication regu lations, in copyright and in data protection stan dards. We have to break down national silos as far as the management of radio waves is concerned. We must knock down these barriers, these hurdles togrowth. Roaming charges in Europe have to and will disappear. If we are successful in implementing a real digital single market, we can generate \u20ac250bn of addi tional growth in Europe.\" The goal is to create new job opportunities, especially for young job-seekers, and to ensure the transition of Europe to vibrantknowledge-based society. Juncker even charged one of the new Vice-Presidents, Andrus Ansip, with the horizontal competence for the digital single market and Commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger in particular with the digital economy and society. They will have the task to make Europe a world leader in information and communication tech nology, with all the instruments to compete successfully in the global digital economy and to participate in an interlinked global digital society. I am proud that I personally could contribute to put the cornerstones to this ground-breaking project for Europe's future. The rst cornerstone was eliminating the initial borders blocking the free flow of information, the legislation to cap roaming charges. The second cornerstone is a simple, concise and clear legal frame- work for data protection, thus bringing back \"trust\". Data is at the centre of the digital world. It is the currency of this new market. Already in 2011, European data was worth \u20ac315bn. By 2020, European data will be worth \u20ac1tn. But like any currency, it relies on trust. Yet citizens' trust in the way in which data is used in the economy is low. Even before the surveil-lance revelations, 92% of Europeans were concerned about the way their data is used without their consent. Therefore we need to engage to restore trust in the digital economy. That means: personal data needs tobe protected by a strong European regulation. Viviane Reding Former Vice-President of the European Commission,Member of the European Parliament (MEP)European citizens want strong data protection rules and companies need a simple, clear and enforceable legal framework for doing business in the EU's internal market. Those are the 2 objectives of the EuropeanData Protection Reform. It is conceived as a win-win deal for citizens and businesses alike. For citizens, the goal is to secure that administrations and businesses do not collect and use more personaldata than they need. Further, individuals should be back in control by updating their rights. The right to be forgotten, the right to data portability and the right to be informed of personal data breaches are key features. They will help close the growing rift between citizens and the companies with which they share their data. For businesses, the reform will stimulate growth by establishing a true Digital Single Market. At the moment, a rm operating in all 28 Member Stateshas to deal with a dierent legislation, as well as with dierent data protection authority in each country.The European Union wants to replace this complexand multilayer legal situation by one concise law that and valid in all of Europe: One continent, one law! The proposal has been agreed by the European Parliament and is still under deliberation in the Council. I hope that strong and credible EU data protection rules can be approved as soon as possible, thereby setting a global standard for data protection. Viviane Reding Former Vice-President of the European Commission, Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Introduction It's all change for Europe this month with the new President of the Euro pean Commission Jean-Claude Junker starting his 5-year term with his chosen Commissioners. On November 1st the new Commis-sioners and Vice-presidents took to their new roles with some recognisablefaces amongst the new line up, as both G\u00fcnther Oettinger, and Johannes Hahn continue as Commissioners, but withnew responsibilities. A regular contributor to AdjacentGov ernment, Hahn is now the Commissioner in charge of European Neighbourhood Policy & EnlargementNegotiations. Oettinger will follow on from Neelie Kroes, in his new role as Commissioner for Digital Economy & Society. In this winter edition of Adjacent Government we give you a rundown of the new Commissioners and Vice- presidents, including their nationalities. We wish all the new Com missioners good luck in their role, and look forward to working with them on future articles. We kick start this edition with a foreword from a former Vice-president of the European Commission and MEP Vivienne Reding. Ms Reding discusses the changes afoot, as well as the importance of Europe being digitally successful in the future, in order for businesses to achieve growth. In line with Ms Reding's foreword we have a number of articles that look at the digital agenda . On a local level, Sunderland City Council describes howthe city is embracing and becoming more flexible in regards to digitalisation. We also fea ture an article from Tom Saunders at Nesta, who highlights the impact digital technologies can have on our cities. A major focus this month is given to the agriculture sector. Agriculture is a key part of the economy and environ- ment. Reflecting this, we examine the important role soil plays within our lives in articles from Moujahed Achouri, FAO Land and Water Division of the Global Soil Partnership, and the Scottish Environmental Protection Association (SEPA). Other areas of discussion within thepublication include: the new UK state pension; change management; the urban agenda; healthcare innovation; and the new UK curriculum. The health and social care section of the publication delves into the world of non-communicable diseases. With the Ebola epidemic hitting West Africa, Adjacent Government asks the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) to detail prevention methods that could be carried out throughout Europe to help prevent the further spread of the disease that has already killed around5,000 and aected people in the USA and Spain. As always I hope you nd this edition thought provoking and useful, and welcome any feedback and feature ideas you may have.

With a total budget of around \u20ac352bn for the 2014-2020 period, thereformed Cohesion Policy becomes a real strategicinvestment policy contributing to the achievement of sustainable, long-term growth. During recent years Cohesion Policy has become even more important due to the economic and nancial crisis, because it has remained a vital source of public investment across the EU. Getting the maximum out of the limited available resources became of the utmost importance in our eorts to return to growth. In the whole of the EU, public investment declined by 20% in real terms since 2008. In countries such as Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Latvia, Portugal and Estonia, Cohesion funding now represents more than 60% of the investment budget. Cohesion Policy has prevented a total collapse of public investment in many Member States during the crisis and has played a crucial role in supporting the capacity of Member States to carry out growth and job enhancing investments. The reformed Cohesion Policy aims at concentrating all resources available to make ecient investments that will steer Europe back onto the path of recovery and growth. It aims at concentrating resources on key growth sectors in line with the Europe 2020 strategyand rmly linking the policy to the European semesterand the multilevel economic governance procedures. It also aims at increasing its eectiveness throughgreater result orientation and by putting in place appropriate framework conditions for investment. Need for sustainable and integrated urban development During recent years urban areas have gained recognition as the engines of economic growth and innovation for Europe. Cities can provide the opportunities and infrastructure necessary for economic growth and jobcreation but at the same time they have suered more during the crisis than other regions in terms of employment losses, migration, environmental, climate and energy challenges. That's why we have to work to strengthen the investments in cities through the Structural and Investment Funds. Integrated sustainable urban development is a key aspect of Cohesion Policyfor 2014-2020, and we expect more than half of ERDF to be spent in cities. An integrated approach towards urban development will help to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy's goal of 'smart, sustainable and inclusive Ms Iskra Mihaylova Chairgrowth'. It combines various sectoral planning approaches for a city in a unied concept and aims to sustainably improve all dimensions of urban life.Only an integrated approach to urban development can enable cities to respond to the challenges repre- sented by globalisation, as well as to all issues that have been aggravated by the recent economic crisis. An urban agenda will promote the integrated approach to policy development, better coordination and greater consistency. It could help us to bring together theeorts of dierent levels of governance: EU, national, regional and local because I believe that all governance levels need to be involved and work together tostrengthen eorts to improve urban policy making. Bulgarian example for integrated approach in urban development An example of good practice in urban development in Bulgaria is the elaboration of integrated plans for urban regeneration and development (IPURDs), which are to serve as the basis for the implementation of sustainable urban development actions during 2014-2020 period through dierent nancial resources - ESIF, national and municipal budget, public-private partnerships, etc. They are focused on establishing and ensuring attractive public spaces, high standard of living environment, modernisinginfrastructure networks and improving energy eciency to ensure high quality of life of residents and attractiveness of the city. The IPURDs in Bulgaria demonstrate a place-based and result-oriented approach, determining intervention zones within cities, including a system of interrelated actions aimed at lasting improvement of the economic, physical, social and ecological situation of a given territory. They encompass various elements of the urban environment like demography, infrastructure and public facilities in its interrelation and complexity,as well as dierent sectors of economy and public policies on local level in their integrity. A key feature of IPURDs is the broad public participation - they were developed with the widest public participation. Priorities of the Committee on Regional Development The Committee on Regional Development (REGI Com mittee) controls the ecient implementation of the legislative framework for regional development in close partnership with the Council, the European Commission, the Committee of the Regions, European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), interregional cooperation organisations, local and regional authorities and other institutions and bodies. As a Chair of REGI Committee, I would like to highlight the importance offocusing our attention on the implementation and overall impact of Cohesion Policy investment. There is in the 2014-2020 nancial perspective also a clearly marked position for the cities in the Cohesion Policy,as vehicles for growth and jobs. This requires a clear involvement of the EU level in urban policy making. Increased synergy and complimentarily between EU regional policy and other community policies is neces sary to ensure optimal investment and increase its eciency. The main priorities of our work also include better coordination between the Structural and Investment Funds with EU economic governance, encouraging transnational and trans regional cooperation, greater recognition of cities, thus reinforcing the link between climate, energy and the environment, with a high degree of social cohesion, socially inclusive housing and developed social European Parliament Tel: +32 (0)2 28 45858 iskra.mihaylova@europarl.europa.euThe Built Environment 16The Built Environment 17Creating an urban Europe Adjacent Government details the work that former Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn achieved before passing the baton to Corina Cretu, and why an Urban Agenda is so crucial to Europe... Former Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn made some great strides in creating a more structured urban agenda throughout Europe. Committed to urging Europeans to shape a future Urban Agenda. During his term as the regional policy commissioner, Hahn called forengagement from citizens in order to share their views. Speaking in Rome in October, Hahn said: \"I have championed a stronger role of cities in our policies: in my own portfolio cohesion policy, but also in other areas of EU policy for which depend heavily on you for their success. \"I am at the end of my 5 year term as Commissioner responsible for regional and urban policy; and I canproudly say that we have made considerable progress together during these ve years. \"We have a cohesion policy with a strong urban dimension, and we have a directorate general withinthe Commission responsible for regional and urban policy. My nal plea as the outgoing Commissioner responsible for the EU urban agenda is that you helpus keep that momentum in this process that we seto in February with our CITIES forum. 1 Hahn believes that the Urban Agenda process needs to be kept alive and pushed forward by the Commission, but it's up to the new Commissioner responsible for Regional Policy, Corina Creu to dene her prioritiesin the area of urban development. From the 1st November, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Creu took over where Commissioner Hahn left o. Although he is no long the Commissioner responsible for this area, Hahn urged cities of Europe to continue the dialogue.\"The urban agenda needs to be kept alive and pushedforward by the Commission, but also by you. You, as capital cities have a particularly important role to play in that you are the most important urban actor inyour country.\" In her rst speech as Commissioner for Regional Policy, Creu expressed the need also in order to strengthen the basis for economic competitiveness and job creation. She said: \"We live in critical time. Europe is seeking to get into a path of sustainable growth, and to over- come its investment and nancing gap. The recentreforms establishes regional policy as a key pillar forinvestments Regional Policy Johannes HahnImagine living in Cantagalo since you were born. The daily routine of playing games, or trying to find your parents, if still alive, hoping to stay away from drugs trafficking, but also attracted to the excitement and its golden promise. At the end of the day you're feeling hungry so you try to find a snack, some chips and lemon- ade to feed you. Or you try your first booze, and get dependent on 'others',whoever they may be, as they have some kind of power over you. These people provide a safety net of sorts. But, you're still stuck with old food tra- ditions, such as alcohol, pre-wrapped cakes and candy. Now imagine the house where you were born stands in Hardenberg, where the cows graze around your vil- lage. From day one your parents feed you with the best milk products, fresh vegetables and meat. When you start your study in Velp you're interested in making the world a bit more sustain- able, but the main thing you want is to build something nice. A roof garden - or something else fancy. But lately, you're more into fast food and having a beer with your friends. Not the most healthy diet, but who cares? That issomething to worry about later. These worlds came together in Rio deJaneiro, where Bart and Marc, from Velp in the Netherlands met Asun\u00e7ao, born in Cantagalo, Brazil, and where they built the first FoodRoof in the world.A FoodRoof? Professor Rob Roggema at VHL Uni- versity of Applied Sciences invented the FoodRoof, which supports resi- dents of the favelas in Brazil to grow their own food. A FoodRoof is a com- pletely closed aquaponic system, pro- ducing fish, vegetables, fruit and herbs, it is lightweight, easy to con- struct and fits on a (small) roof. With more than 50% of the world popula-tion living in the city, and roughly another 50% living with limited access to a healthy diet, the question is no longer if we can produce enough to feed the world, but how and where we must grow food to feed everyone. The answer could well be that weshouldn't become more efficient, large-scale and more productive, FoodRoof Rio: How Favela Residents Grow Their Own Food 18but we need to reach the places where people suffering from eating unhealthy food live. Instead of asking people to eat healthy food, teach them to grow it themselves. In order to do this, we need to go deep into these communities and create productive pieces of city-landscape. That's what we did in Cantagalo favela. Cantagalo Standing on Ipanema beach you can be unaware of Cantagalo favela (Figure 1), hiding behind the tall luxury buildings along the coast. But the heart of the favela is only a 10 minute stroll away. Up the hill the seemingly randomly placed houses follow the pattern of the slope. PROFILE The houses in the favela were built with whatever material was available or could be obtained for nothing, but they're mostly extremely well constructed. The main incentive for constructing strong buildings is so the owners can rent additional floors, simply to earn extra money. This has led to a diverse housing stock, with one characteristic in common: flat roofs, or the opportunity to create one. Due to overcrowding in the favela, roofs offer the only productive spaces. To support the residents of the favelas food needs to be grown in the vicinity where it is consumed. It requires a system that fits in the urban environ- ment, provides fresh and healthy food, must be simple and safe to operate, and is easy to construct and cheap. Aquaponic systems are light- weight and sustainable with closed cycles of nutrients, water and energy, and consist of fish breeding, water storage and the growth of fresh veg- etables and fruit. We have identified 3 success factors for designing, planning and realising aFoodRoof:1. Work with the strengths within the community. They need to be the owners of the project. When the local residents are made co-creators of the project they become commit- ted, are open for collaboration and support and feel more responsible for maintenance. 2. Use local food potentials. In the case of favelas there is not much space, but the roofs are flat and 19strong enough. There is no soil, so an artificial system is preferential. To design the roofs, the micro-climate, natural shade, humidity, but also the place where rain water can be caught and stored, determine the design. 3. Support start-ups first and then accelerate to extend the project beyond the initial pilot to the entire favela. In order to help residents construct a FoodRoof by themselves, 2 students from VHL University of Applied Sciences have developed a manual, giving explicit, visual and clear directions on how to construct the roof step-by-step. This bilingual manual contains easy to understand 'IKEA-like' information with images of tools and materials needed for the construction (Figure 2). Building the FoodRoof The theoretical background and even the shopping list of required materials may be complete and ready, this doesn't mean the construction of the FoodRoof is easy. Cantagalo favela Figure 2. The 'IKEA' manual, with required tools and materialsWe set ourselves a target of 'one-week one-roof'. Within a week materials needed to be purchased, tools needed to become available, the materials needed to be transported to the house and on to the roof and the system needed to be constructed. Without the help from local architect Marcelo, we wouldn't have been able to achieve the result. When the only available drill wasn't suitable, Marcelo brought his own, when the fish needed to be bought from outside the city Marcelo arranged the purchase and transport. When we were short on clay balls, Marcelo knew the flower stall where they provided us with 700 litres. Meanwhile, Bart and Marc con- structed the system on the roof. The manual proved to be an excellent helpexplaining to the installer, local resi- dents and shop owners what was needed and how things should be constructed. When the system was nearly ready, there was no water avail- able in the favela to fill the tanks. Luckily the next morning the water supply was functioning again. On day 5 the system was in operation and ready to show to a delegation of the Dutch Consulate, the other favela res- idents, the State Government of Public Works and colleagues and friends. The first FoodRoof in the world was realised. What can 'we' do? This first example FoodRoof houses the aquaponic system, a system which is well known in many western countries. The application of this tech-nique in a new context, in challenging spatial and social conditions, that ben- efits local residents who have no access to healthy food is truly innovative. When we talk about 'we', the Western countries, could learn 2 things fromthis. First, bringing a fixed solution, no matter how sustainable it is, to a new country does not make sense. Sec- ondly, to reach the people you really want to reach, you need to be able to adapt, genuinely be interested in the people you want to reach and be cre- ative and flexible. Western countries should learn that it is not enough to develop the solution only. This must be done first, in a controlled and safe environment. When the solution is tested and readyfor implementation, the real innova- tion starts: be modest enough to allow modifications where necessary to the technique in order to make it work in its new environment. Many aid oriented organisations and regular businesses are not readily equipped to step in the latter role. But when the technique is sound, exported to a new context, and implemented with modesty, as the FoodRoof example illustrates, the benefits are there for the people that need it. Therefore, Western countries need to enter deep into the community to reach the people's needs. This out- reach must be executed in a genuine way, and not for profit, because oth-erwise the reception by the residents will be a \"thanks, but no thanks\", and no real change will occur. Also, sending money only is not enough to make a change, as money can go missing due to corruption. Set clear goals and ambitions, but realise these through bridging cultures in an empathetic way. People with real interest and curiosity are sought and they don't come in hordes. Western- ers often tend to be blinkered, push- ing their knowledge and therefore their solutions, forgetting about the new context they enter. 20PROFILE The building processHow does the FoodRoof work? The Aquaponic System of the FoodRooof consists of 5 elements: 1. Fish-tanks There are 3 fish tanks on the roof (each tank has a group of fish of different size (small/baby-fish, medium growing fish, and large, ready for consumption fish). Each tank has an overflow from where the water flows to one central pipe and is led to the horizontal grow- bed. The fish produces waste in the form of ammonia. Residents eat veg- etables and fish (as soon as the fish is big enough and ready for consump- tion) from the system. The fish eat the food waste. The fish food contains a lot of proteins, which are found in the waste from food such as bread, grain, fish waste, maggots or worms. 2. Horizontal grow-bed The grow-bed is located next to the fish-tanks. It is a horizontal vegetable plant system, consisting mainly of clay-balls. The water is irrigated through the bed in which the crops are planted. When the water reachesa certain maximum level it leaves the bed through a siphon to the feeder tank. Water with ammonia is led through pipes to the grow bed for plants. Plants require water, light, CO 2 and nitrates. The bacteria which attach to the clay balls in the grow bed break the ammonia down to nitrates, which the plants subsequently use.

Students are gener- ally flexible and curious, and this could add value to their career portfo- lio. This is similar to elite sportsmen, who are very well equipped to lead businesses, because they have learnt the lessons of losing and winning in their sports, and overcoming set- backs. When students are placed in the context of creating FoodRoofs they will need their practical skills, but they also gain other experiences and become human beings with empathy and creativity who can solve unprece-dented problems quickly.

Feeder tank This is a storage tank for water over- flowing from the horizontal grow-bed. Using a pipe on the bottom of the tank, the water continuously flows tothe vertical grow-bed. From the feeder tank the water is pumped up to the upper tube in the vertical grow system. 4. Vertical grow system The second grow system consists of tubes through which water flows. The tubes have holes in which the fruit and herb crops are planted in small substrate cups. The roots of the plants must continuously be in the water. The water flows through the tubes into the pump-tank. 5. Pump tank A pump tank is placed at the end of the vertical grow system, from here the water is pumped to the fish tanks. The pump gets power from a 12V battery, which is connected to a small solar panel. A solar pump is needed to circu- late the water through the entire system and return water to the fish-tanks. This system creates a closed cycle. Every month the system loses 10-15% of water due to evaporation. When water is added to the system it should not be taken from chlorinated city water, but instead, rainwater should be used. FoodRoof Design (by Bart Broekhuis and Marc Drissen)Malm\u00f6: Green Policies transform an industrial city The City of Malm\u00f6 in Sweden is transforming itself into a sustainable city of culture. Here, Ilmar Reepalu, former Mayor of Malm\u00f6, and G\u00f6ran Rosberg Senior Adviser at the City Planning Oce discuss the transformation and how it benets Malm\u00f6 residents... Malm\u00f6 is the third largest city in Sweden, with 310 000 residents. It is rapidly changing and, has undergone a profound transition from the classic smokestack city in decline to a successful city of culture and knowledge. It is recognised forpro viding a sustainable future for generations to come, being awarded the UN Habitat Scroll of Honourin October 2009. By the year 2020, Malm\u00f6 has committed itself to be climate neutral - which means that buildings owned and managed by the city are to be powered by renewable energy - and, by 2030, the whole city is to run on 100% renewable energy. This will be accomplished byfurther decreasing energy consumption, by at least 20% per person by 2020, and a further 20% by 2030.At the same time, solar, wind, water and biogas will be phased in and fossil fuels phased out through measures such as further development of rail tracand, green electricity driven public transport. The long journey In January 1995 the Municipal Executive Board set out a clear, long-term vision for the future (Project Malm\u00f6 2015), elaborating the steps toward remaking Malm\u00f6 a competitive city in the \u00d6resund Region by becoming a knowledge society. This decision was taken in the context of an agreement between Sweden and Denmark to establish the \u00d6resund Link. Malm\u00f6's future was thus understood as part of a transnational, integrated region at a time when cities and regions were becoming the key driving force of European development. Emerging as the most important economic actors were regions comprising a polycentric, often transnational, network of cities and towns. A partnership betweenthe cities and towns in the region was initiated withthe aim of dening, developing and marketing the region as a whole, while respecting those aspects in which they remained in competition. The investment in the regional infrastructure, in the context of globalisation, has generated new patterns in the way people live and work in a region. The borders between local and regional identities is erode as one no longer has to live, study and work in the same town. The development of an extensive commuter network allows people to choose where to live on the basis of their interests and the opportunities that area oers, and then commute to centres of learning, work, cultural facilities, recreation, and entertainment. The growth in IT has aected the way people work: it has made us more flexible, but it places greater demands on the quality of face-to-face encounters, and this, in turn, has generated greater demands for a high quality urban life in those locations where we do meet. It is now 20 years since that important moment in Malm\u00f6's journey from declining industrial town to aculture and knowledge-based city marked by the adoption of the new plan in 1995, and almost 15 years since the completion of the \u00d6resund xed link in the year 2000. These brought a new dimension to the changes at the local level change that had begun at the end of the 1970s, following upon the demolitions that had taken place during the previous 20 years, to ll the \"bomb holes\" that had thus been cre ated in the central parts of the city. With the regional integration brought by the \u00d6resund link and complementary infrastructure investments, the city's vision for the future took on both a regional and local perspective.The Built Environment 22The Built Environment The regional perspective starts from Malm\u00f6's geographic position at the other end of the bridge from Copenhagen. Rather than in competition with the capital city, its development complements it. A railway system centered in Malmo was developed and expanded sothat the xed link connected Malm\u00f6 and the regioninto the European transport grid. This in turn was integrated with a highly expanded system of local and regional public transport. The crucial decision to engage in an ultimately fruitful dialogue with Copenhagen's administrators was dicult but unavoidable. Copen hagen today is only 30 km from Malm\u00f6, while Sweden's seat of government, Stockholm, is 640km away. The local vision is based on the simple idea that Malm\u00f6 continues to grow as an attractive city to live and work. The key added dimension this vision brings is an environmental one, of long term development as a compact and mixed city through the promotion of anenvironmentally adapted trac system, by limiting the exploitation of valuable natural resources and by strengthening biological diversity. To maintain Malm\u00f6 as a compact city entails planning new construction to take place in centrally locatedareas within the outer ring road that are unused or where renovations can expand land utilisation. This places the focus on the older harbour and industrialareas, along with several other centrally located areas where renovation of dwellings and businesses can result in a denser, mixed urban environment and lifestyle, with easy access to public transport facilities. The resulting compact and mixed city reduces transport cost, links citizens with urban services and their providers, and intensies city life. The Future The environment is at the centre of Malmo's futureplans, with 2020 as the date by which the City ofMalm\u00f6 is to be climate neutral and 2030 the date the entire municipality will run on 100% renewable energy. This ambitious goal is to be achieved by combining: More ecient energy consumption. Energy consumption in Malm\u00f6 will decrease by at least 20% per person by2020, and by a further 20% by 2030. \"By the year 2020, Malm\u00f6 has committed itself to be climate neutral -which means that buildings owned and managed by the city are to be powered by renewable energy by 2020 -and, by 2030, the whole city is to run on 100% renewable energy.\" More renewable energy. Solar, wind, water and biogas will be phased in and fossil fuels phased out. The proportion of renewable energy will be 100% in the City of Malm\u00f6 by 2020, with as large a proportion of this energy as possible produced locally. Reduction of emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by at least 40% from 1990 levels. Green Transportation. There will be signicant devel opment of rail trac and other electrically pow ered forms of transport for people and goods, as well as extension of the network of cycle lanes. Adaptation to climate change. Malm\u00f6 will take steps to adapt to temperature changes, rising sea levels, and increased precipitation.

The municipality is growing quickly and has a population of more than 60,000 residents, mainly due to its location between two expanding regions - G\u00f6teborg (the West Sweden region) and Malm\u00f6 (the \u00d6resund region). Varberg is a stronghold for culture and tourism, and is especially renowned for its 13th Century fortress, long stretches of beautiful beaches and inland deciduous woodland with plenty of small lakes. It is also well known among surfers from all across northern Europe as one of the best places in Scandinavia for all kinds of surfing. The City of Varberg is focusing strongly on sustainable development and has been acknowledged for its success in bridging the gap between public service and the diverse interests of various partners in society (e.g. commerce,business, industry, development, conservation, culture, etc.). The municipality has a sharp focus on the way ahead, and a portfolio full of solidstrategies. In our vision for the future, the City ofVarberg has unique opportunities and we are acting on them. We are building a city converging around means of public transportation in arapidly expanding region. The railroad, which has long created a barrier between the seaside and the city centre, will now be relocated into a tunnel underneath the city. To expand on thisopportunity we are moving the harbour in order to further free up land for letting the city reclaim its position as a seaside town. In total, the project will result in more than 500,000 m2of land for development of our future city front. For people living, working or visiting the city of Varberg, the change will dramatically increase the freedom to experience the coastline. More places of residency, places for eating and meeting, places to shop and work, etc. - comes as a bonus. In our vision for Varberg 2025 we are striving to be at the forefront of supporting social and cultural aspects of sustainability. The municipality is localised in the middle of a strong academic region. The University of G\u00f6teborg and Chalmers University of Technology, the University of Lund and Malm\u00f6, the University of Bor\u00e5s and the University of Halmstad are all located well withinReinventing the City Building on Creativitycomfortable commuting distance from Varberg. This is of great importance for our local business climate and for our young. We are focused on consolidating the relationship with our academic allies even stronger, strengthening the position of our own Campus Varberg. The same is true for cultural institutions. For our growth it is key to attract enterprises and institutions that share our idea of building a more sustainable future, in the heart of a progressive region. This means that we are especially on the lookout for academic and cultural institutions, and enterprises with profiles that fit our idea of a modern sustainable city and trying to attract them into investing in Varberg. It is often stated that the place, and the people and lifestyle associated with it, is everything. If this is true, then the City of Varberg has everything to offer. www.varberg.seCome to Varberg. Share our vision.Supporting and understanding innovation in our cities Damian Walne, Director of socio-economics at Lancaster University's Work Foundation details how their Cities 2020 programme looked at some of the challenges of understanding innovation in cities... Cities\" and \"Innovation\" - two words buzzing together in current policy debate. In recent months, we have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer talking up England's northern cities as a powerhouse for the UK economy, and we have seen government initiatives of City Deals and Growth Deals with ambitions to promote \"innovation\". The European Commission has put smart cities at the core of its regional development funds, and there is a new Future Cities Catapult to promote urban innovation. It becomes dicult to keep up, so what does it allreally mean? Beyond the buzzwords, are we really seeing the types of policies that support innovation in our cities? We must separate what is informed evidence-based economics about the relationships between cities and innovation, from what is, let's say,a little fluy. Otherwise, in the pursuit of innovation, national and local policy-makers might prioritise the wrong things. Here at Lancaster University's The Work Foundation, we aim to be at the forefront in evidence-based think ing about cities and innovation. Our \"Cities 2020\" programme of research looked at high growth rms in cities; explored the challenges of the 'eco-system' for innovation; the role of anchor institutions such as universities; and the demand for graduate skills. We continue to work with local government, for exam ple with our current work in understanding the creative economy. We know some of what makes this a tricky topic. And so here we look at some of the challenges in 26\" The Built Environment understanding innovation in cities; and consider what the evidence really tells us about how policy- makers can support it. The challenges of understanding innovation The rst challenge: What is \"innovation\"? The word is well used. But there is ambiguity about its meaning. The language of \"innovation\" is a positive way of fram ing discussion of economic change. This contrasts with language of \"growth\", \"development\", \"restructuring\", \"disruption\", and so on, each of which imply economicchange has some consequences. We look to dene innovation as \"doing things dierently\" to createand apply new knowledge. This is not simply growth through doing more of the same, but by combining people, machines, and premises in ways to create new and better goods or services (product innovation), or to do things better (process innovation). The second challenge: Even if we can dene innovation, it is not clear if and how we can measure it. Some obvious things analysts look at are metrics such as the registration of patents for new products, or how much rms spend on research & development. But these may tell us very little. It also misleads usinto thinking about innovation in terms of industry and manufactured goods, rather than new services or methods of doing things. Good measures of inno vation must also draw from data such as survival rates of enterprises, or surveys of business managers on their new products and processes. But none of these are perfect. The third challenge: There is no single framework for understanding what drives innovation. There is some agreement around the importance of the \"innovation eco-system\". This is the argument that innovation emerges from a web of technologists, scientists, busi nesses, banks, consumers, universities, workers, and public bodies that interact in multiple dierent ways. But there is no unied theory. The dominant arguments point to ideas such as: Creative destruction with competition between enterprises within and across sectors, as better and newer products and processes out-compete older approaches;Learning by doing as the development of people's skills, knowledge, and experience lead to better ways of doing things; Dynamic gains from trade as products and processes flow across countries, with ideas exported, copied, adapted, and imported back; The rules of the game, highlighting how institutions and systems of governance shape incentives andbehaviours. Understanding innovation in cities The interest in cities takes us to questions about how innovation relates to geography. \"Place\" plays a role in that all innovation happens somewhere. For example, an enterprise that aims to make prots will choose a location with benets (revenues through proximity to customers, or reduced prices through proximity to suppliers) against the costs (the price of accommodation or the wages of workers). This explains the clustering of activity, and the formation of cities. The advantage of innovation in cities is largely one of economic mass - that is simply the proximity of many able people, jobs, and enterprises within short traveltimes. This proximity widens considerably the scope for innovative activity - this is people meeting and sharing ideas, buying and selling o one another, and introducing new products to consumers. The challenge is that this relationship between cities and innovation is not straightforward. For example: The place may not matter. It is enterprises that innovate, not the cities they are in. An innovative employer may be within a city, but have little relationship with other parts of the local economy.Or local units of a large enterprise may introduce new products or process but this will be driven by interactions within the enterprise, not within the city; Where place may matter, the eects are not clear. The most important eect may be workers moving jobs between dierent rms - and taking ideas with them. Urban labour markets allow workers and their skills to better match with employers. 27How to support innovation in cities So what should local policy makers, across local authorities or local enterprise partnerships, do to support innovation in their areas? There are never easy answers. But here are 3 key arguments: 1. Do not over-state what local policy-makers can do. Local policy must operate in a context of wider patterns of economic growth and trade, and within a policy environment of tight public funding and limited local powers. So this means a reality-check on whatis feasible; not everywhere can be a hub for favoured industries like biotechnology, ICT, or advanced engineering. It also means better understanding of how the rules, taxes, and spending of national government may run against objectives to support cities and inno vation. Take an obvious example: England's hous ing market. If high house prices, especially in growing cities, deter people from moving there, it does not help innovation. National policies on land-use planning and taxation may deter the building of homes that growing innovative cities need. 2. Learn what works. This means that whatever interventions local policy makers try, they must invest in building up robust evidence, ideally using experimental controlled trials that we can really learn from. It is somewhat disappointing, that from all the publicmoney over many years that has funded initiatives to support business innovation or local growth, so little eort has gone towards rigorous economic evaluation. 3. See where the evidence we have actually takes us. Firstly, many of those interventions that local economic strategies tend to frame in terms of innovation, are less than compelling. See examples such as Enterprise Zones, cluster development, broadband, and culture-led regeneration. Each are interventions where the evidence contests their eectiveness or value for money. Secondly, there is mixed evidence on the role of oer ing support to small and growing enterprises through business advice around management, training, and exports and so on; or facilitating access to nance and venture capital. What is less clear is the extent to which this is a role for local policy-makers or is more eective through institutions such as banks, universities, or national business support agencies.Thirdly, so much innovation in cities is about people.So that should mean local policy-makers prioritising those interventions that enable residents and workers and visitors to succeed in cities. That should include: Housing that enables people to move to the cities where job opportunities are; Urban public transport that enables people to move around cities and between jobs; and Helping people overcome the barriers they face, such as in careers advice, social care, and childcare, that prevent them from going into productive employment. \"The advantage of innovation in cities is largely one of economic mass -that is simply the proximity of many able people, jobs, and enterprises within short travel times. \" Interestingly, the case is rarely made for how newhousing, public transport, or locally provided services support innovation and local growth. Perhaps that is because housing tenants, bus passengers, young unemployed people, and busy parents, are not so eective at coordinating business cases around howthe services they use support innovation. In recent years these services have often been very vulnerable to cuts in public spending. \"Cities\" and \"innovation\" are both great things. If we emphasise that cities are about people, and innovation is about enabling people to do stu, then perhaps we will achieve a goal of more innovative 28Managing the car bon footpri nt David Fatscher Head of Market Development for Sustainability at BSI explains how a new standard for measuring greenhouse gas emissions at city level, is helping London manage its carbon footprint... With an estimated 50% of the planet's popu lation becoming urban citizens by 2030, making cities more sustainable has become one of the most important challenges of the 21st Century. Cities play a key role in tackling climate change and how they respond to this depends in part on access to quality data on greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions. Any city inevitably gives rise to the production of GHG emissions both within and beyond its boundaries and yet GHG accounting methodologies vary con- siderably, covering dierent scopes and making com- parisons dicult. Credible reporting and meaningful benchmarking of data requires greater consistency and research in 20091estimated London's consump- tion-based GHG emissions, whilst highlighting the need to include a wider range of emission sources in the inventory. As a result, the Mayor of London made a commitment to conducting a more complete GHG emission assessment2. PAS 2070, BSI's specication for the assessment of city GHG emissions, is a response to this challenge. It species requirements for identifying the assessmentboundaries, the sources of GHG emissions, the data requirements for carrying out the analysis, and the calculation of the results to develop a city-scale GHG inventory. It also captures both direct GHG emissions (from sources within the city boundary) as well as indirect GHG emissions (from goods and services that are produced outside the city boundary for consumption and/or use within the city boundary). In PAS 2070, these are termed: direct plus supply chain (DPSC) methodology and a consumption-based methodology (CB). The DPSC methodology captures territorial GHG emis sions and those associated with the largest supply chains. It covers direct GHG emissions from activities within the city boundary and indirect GHG emissions from the consumption of, for example, grid-supplied electricity and district heating, travelThe Built Environment 30The Built Environment and the supply chains of key goods and services produced outside the city boundary (e.g. water, food, building materials). Meanwhile, the CB methodology captures direct and life cycle GHG emissions for all goods and services consumed by city residents, so emissions are allocated to the nal consumers rather than the original producers. Although the Greater London Authority (GLA)com missioned the development of the standard, PAS 2070 is intended for widespread use and is the resultof expert input from a truly international group of stake holders, including the City of New York, Stockholm Environment Institute, University of Toronto, as wellas Thames Water, Transport for London and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. The GLA had always intended that the PAS would enable it to carry out a more complete assessment throughout Greater London and has recently published a case study3, demonstrating how to apply the standard's methodology. Among the many ndings, the PAS 2070 study highlights that using the DPSC methodology: London emitted 81 million tonnes of CO2e4in 2010 (or 10.05 tonnes CO2e per person); Energy use in buildings is the largest source of GHG emissions in London accounting for 50% of emissions; Transport is the second biggest, accounting for 31% of London's GHG Emissions; The consumption of food and drink accounts for 13% of GHG emissions. Meanwhile, applying the CB methodology: London emitted 114 million tonnes of CO2e in 2010 (or 14.15 tonnes CO2e per person); Utility services is the largest sources of GHG emissions (18.1%), followed by transport services (17.0%); 75% of the emissions relate to household consumption.In 2008, the world's rst product carbon footprint specication was published, PAS 2050 and its 2011 revision introduced a framework that enabled BSI to work with individual industries to develop sector and product group-specic requirements. This year has also seen the revision to PAS 2060, the specication for demonstration of carbon neutrality. PAS 2070 also relates to, and informs, the development of a series of standards around smart cities and sus tainable communities.5 As with other GHG assessment standards, PAS 2070 seeks to provide a robust and transparent method for consistent, comparable and relevant quantication, attribution and reporting of GHG emis sions, enabling city leaders to measure more holistically and eectively, to assess their risks and opportunities, create a strategy to reduce emissions, and ensure that progress towards a low-carbon envi ronment/ economy can be reliably monitored. 1Capital Consumption.

Peter Hansford, Government Chief Construction Adviser details the value of BIM for the UK... Technology is moving fast - including in construction. We are moving quickly towards a digital economy which is starting to have profound implications for our built environment. We must act now to ensure UK construction is, and remains, at the vanguard of smart construction and digital design, and have made a good start in embracing this through the BIM programme. Indeed, the UK BIM standards and processes are working as a world-wide acknowledged benchmark for industrydigitisation. For the public sector, BIM oers HM Government the opportunity to industrialise and reform its built environment through a digitally enabled procurementprocess. Indeed, the level 2 BIM programme isalready helping cement signicant savings: early adopters such as the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) are reducing cost and improving quality through their BIM library concept, where they have standardised and digitised many of their assemblies. This process has also helped them drive down area requirements and determine solutions which will make it easier to ultimately economically dispose of their assets - such as courthouses - by formulating standard grid solutions compared to traditional non-standard layouts. Our present goal is that all centrally-funded public procurement projects be delivered using Level 2 BIM by 2016, and the government's commitment to thisBIM 32Peter Hansford Government Chief Construction Adviser Department for Business Innovation and SkillsBIM target - set out in the Government Construction Strat egy - remains rm. It provides a strong drive towards digitising our industry and, I am glad to report, one that is going well with signicant progress and appetite from the departments to adopt BIM within standard procurement practices and operations. We are on track with our plan for getting BIM Level 2production ready, which will position the departments perfectly for increasing the rollout of BIM acrossproj ects and making it business as usual. With around 2.9 million people employed within our industry, the biggest challenge is not within the government departments, but raising awareness, building capacity and capability within the supplychain. Our whole sector approach to BIM is making organisations challenge preconceived ideas, andencourages techniques and incentives to standardise ways of working in which 3D geometry and data is stored throughout the lifecycle of buildings andinfra structure. Key to this is the creation of Level 2 BIM maturity by the BIM Task Group who, along with BSI, have devel oped a number of standards, documents and guides to explain clearly how BIM should be applied. This is the big challenge for the supply chain: better controls and denitions of both data deliveries and data classication. The Level 2 BIM programme is a key enabling strategy for the UK developing both these processes, and open data denitions. Creatinga capable, informed work force will cement the UK as the recognised leader in vision, policy, capability and results for Digital Construction World Wide. Creating and managing digital data sets for transactions and queries is undoubtedly a step change for industry. Within the supply chain we are seeing early adoptersoering levels of eciency, reduced costs, faster delivery and ultimately, delivering buildings and infra structure that are 'right rst time', and oerings consistent with sectors that have made a switch to digital working and process automation. Communities such as the BIM4 working groups are helping articulate the business case for BIM, and help demystify what needs to be done within their relevant populations to make level 2 BIM happen. The fact that they can buildin beta digitally and debug before executing flawlessly on site makes it all worthwhile. The Industrial Strategy for Construction - Construction 2025 - set out a vision of \"an industry that is ecient and technologically advanced\". It is therefore essential that we are prepared for a sector switch from analogue to digital given the size of the prize. Economists have estimated that the UK market for BIM-related serviceswill be an annual \u00a330bn by 2020. In a global context, UK-based rms already export \u00a37bn of architectural and engineering services. Pursuing a global leadership position in developing BIM capabilities will provide strong potential for further export growth, and enable our industry to deliver higher quality and a more sustainably built environment for Skills Tel: 020 7215 SMEs: unity is knocking SMEs are key to the UK's BIM journey, so their uptake is vital to ensure our BIM leadership. David Philp, Head of BIM at Mace and the UK BIM Task Group explains their importance... In 2013, there were 4.9 million businesses in the UK, with over 99% categorised as small or medium sized businesses (SMEs) i.e. employing between 0-249 people. Of this populace the SME community's share of construction turnover in the UK private sector was 72.4%. Given that SMEs are the backbone of our sector, we must ensure that they have sucient digital capacity and capability to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of BIM leadership across the globe. But why should they care? Why should they consider investing in change?The reality is they have to compete on a new basis with erce international competition for the provision of skills and products and ever tight project aord-ability constraints. It is self-evident, therefore, that to flourish with the backdrop of these challenges they must reform and unlock more ecient ways of working. BIM really oers SMEs the opportunity to raise their game and contend in the heavy weight classes. Despite often being resource constrained, the SMEs are a motor of innovation with inherent change characteristics often not found in bigger organisations, coupled with faster decision making processes. It is essential, however, that SMEs build adequate knowl- edge capital in the BIM space to improve their value creation processes to: Sell or export this knowledge to another organisation as part of at Mace and Head of UK BIM Task GroupBIM Improve their oering, such as manufacturers who can liberate the data associated with their products to increase exports, create new markets or simply get specied earlier in the construction process. There is much evidence to support the hypothesisthat digital enabled workflows benet the SME in the built environment. Organisations such as David Miller Architects (DMA) have seen both direct and indirectbenets through their BIM implementation; growing from a small to medium size practice through the eciencies they are achieving, but also how they are being perceived dierently by clients and through meritocracy competing for larger and more prestigious commissions. Additionally, the tier 2 and 3 communities play an important part in enabling the larger tier 1 organisations. It is therefore essential there is a symbiosis between these parties to help each other up-skill and exchangedigital data. So where should an SME start their journey? Firstly start with the free stu. 1. Perhaps I am a tad biased on this but visit the BIM Task Group website www.bimtaskgroup.org .

Join the dots with your local Regional BIM Hub http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/ cic-bim-regional-hubs/ and the BIM4SME working group http://www.bim4sme.org/ who are doing great work to raise the awareness and value proposition of BIM for smaller organisations. 4. Capability. You are probably already doing some BIM eorts but perhaps you don't even realise it. Have a review of how you create or manage your digital data. Do you use a common data environment? Work out where you are on your point of departure and determine what up-skilling is necessary to close the gaps. Consider both: knowledge of processes as wellas skills on digital toolsets. 5. Have a play about. Most technology vendors oer free viewing, or indeed in some cases, free clash detection tools. Often viewing and reviewing models will be all you need and you can do it for free. Do your duty. Ensuring the UK construction sector builds on its rich heritage and makes a big step into the digital frontier will be massively driven by the uptake of the SME community, so remember you can't hit a home run unless you step up to the plate.

Insulation can be damaged during installation or by a following trade. The course encourages all trades to consider those that have gone before, and those that are following - if trades don't work together and understand the implications of their installations then they're unlikely to deliver a building that performs to its highest potential.

Steve Thompson, Chair of BIM4M2 discusses the support and advice available... Even before the UK government announced its intention to require collaborative 3D BIM on its projects by 2016, the construction industry had been busy readying itself for the change to a digital world. Whilst it is clear that the creation, exchange and use of product data is crucial to the BIM process, a common understanding of the type of information that product manufacturers should provide to support BIM has been missing. In March of this year BIM4M2 was formed, with the purpose to support product manufacturers through the transi tion to a BIM-ready industry, and to provide a forum to share their knowledge. For me, one of the most exciting aspects of BIM isthe willingness of organisations and individuals across the industry to collaborate and work together to address the challenge. Manufacturers have been using digital information and processes for over half a century, but exchanging digital information with supply chain partners is a very dierent proposition, and one that the sector is eager to tackle. From thepreliminary results of the survey of manufacturers that our Promotions Working Group are undertaking, 93% of those responding said they plan to invest in the process (41% already have, and 52% will have by 2016). So, for many the question is less about whether to develop their BIM capabilities, but moreabout how, in what format and on which platforms? This is where the real challenges lie for the manufac- turer, and the answers can be dierent for every organisation depending on their product types, supply chain routes, markets, regions and scale.How ever, the basic principles remain the same, to provide structured digital product information that can be exchanged with supply chain partners.Adding to the complexity is the dierent information requirements of members of the client and supplychain team on any given project. To nd a way through the complexity, we need to work together as an industry and develop an agreed way of describing products and their attributes, both for the UK and internationally. Certainly BS1192:4 (COBie) forms part of the solution as the mandated exchange format for Level 2 in the UK, and the broader Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are also crucial; but these need to be supported by further denition of what information supply chain partners need and how this can be pre- sented consistently by product suppliers. I'll illustrate this using a customer satisfaction approach. As we know, on any construction project the client has a set of requirements that need to be met through the delivery of the project, and to support their delivery is a set of information requirements. In the BIM process these are the Employer's Information Requirements (EIR). Added to this, members of the supply chain also need information to deliver the project eectively, and to share with others. In the BIM process these are described in the BIMExecution Plan (BEP). BIM 38 Mix of manufacturer organisation size responding to the BIM4M2 survey, and where they export toBIM Without close engagement and accurate denition of what information is required and the level of granularity (element, system, product), there is real potential for a gap between the supply team's expectations on what information a manufacturer provides and whatwill be delivered: the expectation-delivery gap. With a common framework for product information, supply teams will know what to expect, manufacturers will know what to provide as a minimum, and the gap between expectation and delivery is reduced. With the development of COBie, the Digital Plan of Work and BS 8541 parts 1-6 in the UK, the gap willcertainly begin to close where they are applied. To reduce the gap further the BIM4M2 Data TemplatesWorking Group are working closely with other BIM4Community groups, clients, professional institutes, trade associations and content providers to develop and rene product data templates to enable suppliers to provide information in a consistent format. There should, and will always be the potential to go further, but the templates will look to set the baseline to support the requirements of a Level 2 BIM maturity. For those supplying products internationally, a common concern is that in developing structured information or objects for the UK, they will need tocreate dierent information for use in every region they operate in. The good news is that with the devel opment of an ISO standard for the BIM process,there is the potential to reduce the dierences that exist, and by structuring our information in a common digital format, it makes exchange of information across regions much more straightforward. Furthermore, the BIM4M2 Education Working Groupis developing guidance for product manufacturers on the implications of BIM, and how to develop and deliver a BIM strategy that is t for their business.

Being involved at the beginning of a new project, and then maintaining this involvement through to eventual handover and post occupancy is key for FM in the BIM process. M J Packham, BIM/Soft Landings Champion at BIFM sheds light on the current situation... BIM for FM has a certain ring to it and I have to confess that it is very easy to get carried away by the groundswell of enthusiasm that the topic generally seems to engender - particularly amongst our designer/construction colleagues. How ever, before we get swept away by the BIM tide, it is perhaps appropriate to take a step back to give serious consideration to the potential benets for FMand, more importantly, how we go about ensuring that these are realised. Certainly I think that we will all recognise the operational benets to be derived from BIM in terms of a co-ordinated structure and services installations design. Like me, I suspect that many FMs will have experienced problems with access and general main tenance activities as a result of the structure having \"got there rst\" and the services installations having to be modied on an almost ad hoc basis as a result.This scenario brings to the fore what I see as being one of the key benets of BIM, i.e. it provides a mech anism for ensuring collaboration between the respective members of the design/construction supply chain. From a FM perspective we need toensure that this collaborative ethos also extends to include the operational phase of the built environment that is being created. This in turn brings into play consideration of the related, but entirely separate, Soft Landings initiative (otherwise known as Government Soft Landings - GSL - in the Public Sector). For those unfamiliar with it; \"Soft Landings is the process for the graduated handover of a new building or refurbishment...\" Soessentially it is about FM getting involved up front in the genesis of a new project and then maintaining this involvement through the various stages of devel opment of design and construction, through to eventual handover and post occupancy evaluation. 40The idea being that, in this way, the operational/ occu pational phase of the building life cycle - which is by far and away the most signicant in cost terms - is always kept under review. I have wandered somewhat o theme so to return to BIM, one of the other key benets that I see it bringing to FM relates to the information that gets provided at handover. Again I think that most practising facilities managers will be familiar with the scenario whereby the information they are provided with on taking over new premises is less than perfect - with the net resultthat they are eectively \"flying blind\" until the gaps are closed. With BIM this should be a thing of the past. Thus on completion we will - in theory at least -be taking ownership of a fully populated building model that provides all of the asset and service run information required to operate the building at optimum eciency. Of course all of this lovely information will be in the BIM system and not the CAFM system (orequivalent) which is probably where we really want it. So one of the issues we need to address is how do we get the two to talk to each other in a way that does not involve an undue amount of data manipulation (and hence time/cost). Equally we need to give thought to how frequently we are going to need to refer to the BIM model; once an asset register etc is up and running, I suspect that this will not be as often as some of the BIM protagonists would have us believe.I could go on but I suspect that by now you are starting to understand where I am coming from on BIM. Yes there are a lot of positives for us in FM, but we needto be a bit cautious and not get too excited as thereare a number of hurdles we need to navigate before we can expect to fully realise the benets that it Management (BIFM) (0)1279 Landings ChampionFind out about the Nottingham H.O.U.S.E project by visiting: http://www.saint-gobain.co.uk/university- students-zero-carbon-house.aspx A New Model for Affordable Housing How has a collaborative student-designed project become one of the first of its kind designed to some of the world's most stringent design codes? Stacey Temprell, New Build Sector Director for Saint-Gobain, tells us how the world leader in sustainable habitat paired up with The University of Nottingham on the project. Stacey Temprell Residential Sector Director Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) is a full-scale, fully functioning family home that complies with the future Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES), likely to be the requirement for the 2016 Zero Carbon Homes performance requirement. The house has been designed to perform at a very low level of energy usage by optimizing both the building's fabric and services to meet the Zero Carbon Hub's FEES and the Government's agenda for reduction of impacts on climate change and fuel poverty. FEES is the proposed maximum space heating and cooling energy demand for zero carbon homes. This is the amount of energy which would normally be needed to maintain comfortable internal temperatures.

The important area of re protection standards is one that British Approvals for Fire Equipment(BAFE), the independent third party registration body for the re protection industry, is dedicated to improving. Established 30 years ago as an independent not-for-prot organisation, it's supported by statutory bodies, re and rescue services, insurers, and leading trade and certication bodies including SSAIB. BAFE's objective is to bring a single registration scheme to market for each re protection product or service for which third party certication is consideredappropriate, and life safety re risk assessment is one of the most recently introduced of these. In England and Wales employers, owners, landlords or occupiers of business or other non-domestic premises are responsible for re safety and known as the 'responsible person'/'duty holder' - re safety rules are dierent in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Competence and training It's essential that the person(s) carrying out the re risk assessment are competent and have received appropriate specialist training, while the purpose and scope of the assessment should be clearly specied and the resulting documented assessment should be 'suitable and sucient'. While the re risk assessorhas a duty of care to the organisation involved, ulti- mate responsibility for the adequacy of the re risk assessment rests with the duty holder (normally acompany) or responsible person. This follows a change in re safety law with the introduction, in October 2006, of the Regulatory Reform Order (Fire Safety) 2005. Given these circumstances, BAFE's SP205 UKAS-accredited certication scheme enables those responsible, and required under law to carry out a re risk assessment of a premises, to employ a specialistHealth and Safety 44Health and Safety third party company to provide this. Taking such a step will allow them to demonstrate that they've taken the necessary reasonable action to complywith their legal obligations and requirements under re safety legislation. Besides those responsible for carrying out such an assessment, the new independent third party certication service oered by SSAIB and others willalso benet re risk assessment providers, who'll be able to use their accreditation to attract end user customers. Certication provides a benchmark recog nition of a company's capability in providing high quality re risk assessments - by showing that theyhave the required technical and quality management competency, and that their assessors possess therel evant prociency and knowledge. Interest in re risk assessment is growing steadily, driven by factors including the scope of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 in England and Wales and the equivalent Scottish legislation - the Fire(Scot land) Act 2005 - and Northern Ireland - the Fire and Rescue Services (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. Achieving SP205 certication oers accredited providers with a signicant marketing tool by enabling them to display a valuable certication mark (including the'crown and tick' logo). Here at SSAIB we've invested time and resources in achieving this UKAS accredited approval, so that end users with responsibilities under the law can rest assured that risk assessment serviceproviders holding certication approval will provide re risk assessments that fully comply with the law. Independent views So how do companies themselves, who've already achieved been certicated under the BAFE SP205 scheme, feel it will provide benets? Michael Cliord, Managing Director of one company - Beacon Fire Safety - which gained it last year, comments: \"This will assist us in demonstrating to our existing and potential clients that we are a competent provider of re risk assessments and that we are serious in proving this commitment to them.\" Meanwhile, oering another independent viewpoint, is Paul Gotthardt, Director of Fire Safety Solutions. He believes the scheme allows customers an easier wayof ensuring that the responsible person/duty holder has fullled their obligations: \"Gaining SP205 certication helps me to prove to our existing and potential clients that we carry out due diligence and are up to the mark. A little, or indeed the wrong knowledge, can be dangerous and the SP205 scheme provides a benchmark for reassurance. This is a tremendous marketing tool and we'd recommend it to others.\" SSAIB, the UK's leading re, security and telecare certication body for organisations - which celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2014 - also oers a range of management systems certication schemes, including ISO 9001 quality management systems certication and ISO 14001 environmental management systems certication. Over 1500 companies are now 42 ssaib@ssaib.co.uk ssaib.orgwww.twitter.com/thessaib 45Fire risk assessment - what's involved A re risk assessment is a process involving the systematic evaluation of the factors that determine the hazard from re, the likelihood that there will be a re, and the consequences if one were to occur. The process involves a physical inspection of the building to determine the adequacy of the existing re precautions and the need for any additional measures. Of equal importance to the physicalinspection is a review of re safety management in the organisation and consideration of the human factors - how people will respond to an emergency and whether they will take appropriate action. The scope of a survey involved in a re risk assessment should include re hazards, emergency escape lighting, compartmentation, re detection and re alarm systems, and smoke control systems. Courtesy of CS Todd & Associates LtdCurrent fire protection legisla- tion across the UK requires property managers of all non- residential premises to have adequate fire protection. It is their responsibility to ensure that there is an adequate, updated fire risk assessment and that all aspects of the requirements are carried out competently. This is not only to ensure that customers, staff and premises are adequately protected, but also to minimise the risk of costly unwanted false alarms. A competent fire risk assessment is one of the basic Health and Safety requirements for any employer. The most recent CFOA guidance for the Reduction of False Alarms and Unwanted Fire Signals highlights some of the solutions to this problem, amongst which is the use of third party certificated providers of fire pro- tection services: http://www.bafe.org.uk / uploads/DOC53C531E465792.pdf To demonstrate that the responsible person (duty holder in Scotland) has met their legal obligations a large number of public authorities and commercial organisations large and small, now insist that their fire protection services are carried out by a company that has been third party certificated. Many now specify that providers are BAFE registered. You can find out if your potentialprovider is third party certificated, by looking on the BAFE website: http://www.bafe.org.uk/companies.php BAFE is the independent third partycertification, registration body for the fire protection industry. We develop schemes for UKAS accredited certifi- cation bodies to assess and approve companies to recognised standards. There are now more than 1175 BAFE registered companies across the UK. Our aim is to support property man- agers to ensure that they get quality fire protection for their premises, staffand service users. In 2012 BAFE launched the first UKAS accredited scheme for Companies who carry out Fire Risk Assessments (SP205) which is a vital part of meeting obligations under fire legislation. The scheme considers the competence of the individual assessors as well as the quality requirements for the organisa- tion. There are a growing number of companies registering to the scheme, throughout the UK. If you are looking for the supply and maintenance of portable extinguishers, look for one of the 330 Companies accredited to BAFE Schemes SP101/ ST104. Companies are certificated to ISO9001 and all of their technicians are assessed by BAFE for initial and ongoing competence. There are currently more than 1200 BAFE regis- tered technicians, working for our registered companies. For installing or maintaining fire alarm systems Companies should hold BAFE modular SP203-1 scheme approval. This scheme includes design, installa- tion, commissioning and maintenance of fire detection systems and alsoStephen Adams Chief Executive BAFE info@bafe.org.uk www.bafe.org.ukBAFE - Helping you to meet your fire protection obligations 46requires that all equipment used is third party certificated. The scheme now has over 750 registered companies. Registration to this BAFE scheme is often a key requirement criteria in tenders for the provision of fire alarms. Our Emergency Lighting scheme (SP203-4) sets out the standards and staff competence criteria to be met. It is modular as with the fire alarm scheme and is achieving growing recognition from end users. There are a range of other BAFE schemes covering particular sectors of the fire protection industry and details can be found on the BAFE web- site, along with a complete search facility to find registered companies in your area.

PROFILEBAFE - Helping business to meet their re protection obligations It is a legal requirement across the UK that all premises have a full and competent Fire Risk Assessment and then implement the re protection requirements. The 'responsible person' has the duty to ensure that they have carried out these obligations - but how can they be sure that they have used competent contractors? BAFE has developed a scheme for Companies who carry out Fire Risk Assessments (SP205) which is a vital part of meeting legal responsibility obligations under /f_ire legislation. Providers are rapidly recognising the value of this scheme and gaining certi/f_ication. After a number of fatal /f_ires, such as the one at Rosepark Care home in Scotland and Lakenal House in London, there have been updated requirements for /f_ire risk assessments. BAFE is the independent, third party certi/f_ication, registration body for the /f_ire protection industry, founded nearly 30 years ago with a wide range of industry bodies represented on our Council. We develop schemes for UKAS accredited certi/f_ication bodies to assess and approve companies to recognised standards. There are now more than 1150 BAFE registered companies across the UK. Our aim is to support property owners and speci/f_iers to ensure that they get quality /f_ire protection for their premises, sta and service users. If you are specifying the supply and maintenance of portable extinguishers, look for Companies accredited to BAFE Schemes SP101/ST104.

In 2009 RAFKAP Schemes were launched by the British Retail Consortium and the Chief Fire Ocers Association (CFOA). RAFKAP stands for Retail and Fire Key Authority Partnerships and these schemes were designed to deliver consistency in re inspection and enforcement, enabling re and rescueservices to target resources on high-risk businesses. These schemes were an early forerunner of Primary Authority Schemes. Lead Fire Authority Schemes have also existed for some time, for example in 2012 Derbyshire Fire and Rescue (DFRS) entered into such a scheme with South Yorkshire Housing Association (SYA). In this scheme DFRS provided a Liaison Ocer from within the Fire Protection Department who acted as a single point of contact for both parties. Plus, DFRS oered advice to SYHA in relation to all new build projects and were available for consultation for projects that fell outside of the Derbyshire area.Looking further back in 2005 the then Labour Government commissioned a report from Sir PhillipHampton entitled 'Reducing Administrative Burdens:Eective Inspection and Enforcement'. This report then became known as 'The Hampton Report' and itlooked at the impact that regulators were having onthe ability of business to compete and contribute to the recovery of the economy. The report concluded that across the regulatory gamut there were a number of factors that impacted on a business, such as inconsistent advice, excessive enforcement and inspection. The Hampton Report published a number of recommendations and all of these were accepted by the government. Following on from the Hampton Report, the government, via The Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act introduced the Primary Authority Scheme (PAS). PAS was developed as a partnership scheme based in law with statutory guidelines.Health and Safety 48Health and Safety These were designed to create business investment in growth by developing confidence that regulators in dierent local authority areas would not place competing demands on a business which in turn could impose extra nancial burdens on it. PAS includes a variety of 'strands' including: Assured Advice which would be provided by the regulator to a business and this would be accepted by enforcers of the same regulations; Inspection Plans would be agreed between the regulator and business so as to co-ordinate inspection activity under an agreed local inspection programme that was risk based; Enforcement Referral whereby the partner regulator has the ability to stop proposed Enforcement Action that is not consistent with the Assured Advice. PAS was to be available to any business that operated across more than one local authority area, and it was to be applied to the majority of local authority regulatory services including the Fire Safety Order. However CFOA opposed PAS for the Fire SafetyOrder and argued that its implementation would be contrary to the implementation of local Integrated Risk Management Plans. Thus, the Fire Safety Order was not included at this time in PAS. In 2012, via the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, the government proposed a number of changes to PAS which included it being available to trade associa- tions and franchises. In order to see if the 'new' PAS was suitable for re safety law, two six-month pilot schemes were run from January 2013. These were: A Statutory Scheme managed by the Better Regulation Delivery Oce (BRDO) of The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS); A non-Statutory Fire Authority Partnership Scheme managed by CFOA.These pilots were independently evaluated and it was decided that the Statutory Scheme was the most appropriate option. In April 2014, PAS was nally extended to the Fire Safety Order and to date there are 91 partnerships listed with Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service and London Fire Brigade, being responsible for approxi- mately two thirds of them. The FIA welcomes the extension of PAS to the Fire Safety Order as the provision of consistent assured advice is a step forward for all concerned. However, the trade does have one area of concern and that is where the Fire and Rescue Service involved in a Partnership has an arms-length company that provides re related services to the other party. This could lead to the accusation of conflict of interest when enforcement issues are concerned, plus, there will always be the suspicion that the work was obtained because the business partner feels that it will make life easier in general for itself if it uses the +44 (0)203 166 5002 info@a.uk.comwww.a.uk.com 49 Steps for a successful safety program The most important thing to consider when designing your fire extinguisher training program is your actual workplace. Focus your training on the type of emergencies your employees may face. For example, an office complex, manufacturing facility, hospital facility, and University dorm should all have markedly different programs. Every successful program should combine classroom and hands-on instructional elements. Many of the basics can and should be covered before allowing hands-on training. Trainees should leave the program with knowledge of sources of fire, classes of fire and their corresponding fire extinguishers, how to identify an extinguisher, how to assess a fire situation, and fire emergency protocols. Sources of Fire: Fires are chemical reactions that occur when fuel, oxygen, and an ignition source combine. Fire extinguishers work by removing one or more of these sources, with different extinguishers working in different ways. For example, water extinguishers remove the heat and carbon dioxide (CO 2) extinguishers remove the supply of oxygen. Five Classes of Fire: Class A fires involve ordinary combustible materials such as cloth, wood, paper, rubber and many plastics. Class B fires involve flammable and combustible liquids, such as gasoline, alcohol, diesel oil, oil-based paints and lacquers. Class C fires involve flammable gases. Class D fires involve combustible metals such as magnesium, titanium, and sodium. Class F fires involve vegetable oils, animal oils or fats in cooking appliances. Choosing the Correct Fire Extinguisher: Many fire extinguishers are designed for use on specific types of fires. The most common fire extinguishers are: Class A: water Class B: foam, CO 2, dry powder Class C: water, foam Class D: dry powder Class F: wet chemical Users must understand that operating a fire extinguisher which does not match the class of fire can actually increase the fire hazard and endangers the user and those nearby. Identifying a Fire Extinguisher: Teach employees how to identify an extinguisher, including its class and the size of fire it is designed to combat by the markings on the fire extinguisher. Help employees identify the actual extinguishers found around their place of work. Assessing a Fire Situation: As portable fire extinguishers are designed for incipient stage firefighting, employees should be familiar with how to properly asses a fire situation. Individuals should not use a portable fire extinguisher to combat fires larger than themselves. Individuals should also asses the fire's location (is it fully visible or has it spread behind walls or equipment?), levels of heat (is the room too hot to remain in comfortably?), presence of thick smoke or fumes, and the availability of sufficient exit routes. Additionally, each organisation should clearly instruct employees as to what alerting actions are required and when evacuation is required. Ideally, employees should never attempt to fight a fire without signaling that there is an emergency. FIRE EXTINGUISHER TRAINING: BEST PRACTICES Tips for Hands-On Training: Consider these tips for further engaging and educating employees: Simulate various fire situations, including different types of fires or fire level difficulties. Consider using digital fire simulators where live burns aren't permitted. Have employees work with varying sizes of extinguishers to understand the potentials and limits of each. Teach employees to maintain proper distance from fires depending on the size of extinguishers used and the type of fire. Teach employees to check the pressure gauges and test extinguishers before approaching a fire. Have trainees select from multiple training extinguishers where one or more are not fully charged. Keep class sizes small to make it easier for everyone to participate, ask questions and stay engaged. HAAGEN Head Office (the Netherlands).

[THE NEXT LEVEL OF EXTINGUISHER TRAINING IS HERE Behavioural safe ty ensures effectiv e organisation Rob Burgon, Workplace Safety Manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) details how our behaviour at work can influence our health & safety... In the workplace, there are human factors - such as the working environment, organisational and job factors, and human and individual characteristics - which can aect how a person behaves. Everyone can make errors, regardless of how well trained and motivated they are but in the workplace, the consequences of such human failure can be severe. With that in mind, it is essential that employers consider certain aspects when trying to manage human failure to avoid accidents and ill health at work. These are: the job, the individual and the organisation. Let us rst talk about the job. This includes areas such as the nature of the task, workload, working environment, the design of displays and controls, and the role of procedures. Employers should design tasks in accordance withergonomic principles to take account of both human limitations and strengths. This includes matching the job to the physical and the mental strengths - such as perceptual, attentional and decision-making requirements - and limitations of workers. When considering the individual, their competence, skills, personality, attitude, and risk perception, all come into play. Individual characteristics can influence behaviour in complex ways but certain characteristics such as skills and attitude can be changed and enhanced. The working environment also plays a signicant part in the behaviour of an individual or group. Factors such as work patterns, the culture of the workplace, resources, communications and leadership should also be considered. 52 Health and Safety So, what can we take from this? Firstly, that human factors not only concerns the tasks that people are set but also who is doing the task, i.e. how competent and skilful they are at carrying it out, and the place inwhich they are working. As all of these factors influence behaviour at work in a way which can aect health and safety, it is essential that human failures are managed to prevent major and occupational accidents, and ill health, all ofwhich cost businesses money and their reputation. It is crucial to understand that human factors not only influence the safety culture of an individual, but also aect the culture that exists within an organisation.Safety management systems should include human factors, which allow them to be examined in a similar way to any other risk control system. The best way for businesses to achieve these goals is by having good technology, together with a skilledworkforce with sta placed in jobs suitable for their abilities. Remember, successful businesses achieve high productivity and quality while ensuring healthand safety. The influence of biological, psychological and organi- sational factors on an individual at work can not only aect their personal health and safety, but also their eciency and productivity. For example, someone is more likely to suer injury if exerting a large proportion of their strength to com plete a task and could possibly cause damage to the product and tools.If the mental demands of a task are too high - i.e. if it involves diagnosing faults under signicant time pressures - then there can be both a health issue forthe employee but also a quality, and possibly safetyissue for the production line, process and plant. It is also essential that workers are properly trained for their roles - this is the employer's responsibility. As individuals have a wide range of abilities and limitations, a human factors (or ergonomics) approach focuses on how to make the best use of these capabilities. \"As all of these factors influence behaviour at work in a way which can aect health and safety, it is essential that human failures are managed to prevent major and occupational accidents, and ill health, all of which cost businesses money and their reputation. \" In order to improve the health and safety of workers,employers need to ensure that jobs and equipment are t for them, which would in turn lead to a better managed and more Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Tel: +44 (0)121 248 2000www.rospa.com 53 Rob BurgonWorkplace Safety ManagerExcellence in workplace safety and health Behavioural safety is a key part of a business's journey towards ensuring excellence in workplace safety and health. Here Jill Joyce, Senior Policy & Research Adviser at the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) explains the process that companies can take... Behavioural safety programmes can help to prevent work related accidents and diseases, which are expensive for companies. Research has shown that up to 80% of work related accidentsare caused by employees' behaviour. 1Behavioural safety is about identifying bad habits that could cause accidents or lead to ill health and reinforcing good habits. It's important not to confuse this approach with inspections, which are looking for unsafe conditions.Safe behaviour is regarded as a critical work relatedskill so unsafe behaviours can act as an early warning system for accidents and incidents. If we measure these behaviours, this provides information we can useproactively to improve workplace safety and health. What do organisations need to do before introducing a behavioural safety programme? If a behavioural safety programme is to be eective itmust be implemented well. There are several stagesto follow for a successful implementation. The rst is to assess whether the company is ready culturally for such a programme. For example is there management commitment to the idea, does the company have agood internal communication strategy and is there a 'fair blame' culture? A survey could be carried out before the programme starts to measure the safety climate. 2 It is essential to have support from both the manage- ment and work force. The best way to gain support from employees is to involve them in the programme.A steering group needs to be set up to oversee the programme and it is important that this is representative of the whole workforce. The next step is to train the observers how to identify critical safety behaviours, what to record and how to provide feedback. It's important that everyone is 54Health and Safety using the same criteria to judge behaviours. It is usual to compile a checklist of critical behaviours. These can be based on analysis of previous accidents or incidents. Near misses are particularly important to consider as they may give an indication of behaviours that could have led to accidents. When the checklist is ready, it is useful to establish a base line by conducting initial observations and noting the current level of safe behaviours. This enables future progress on the pro gramme to be measured.3, 4 Then there follows a continuous loop of observation,feedback and review and if necessary training. It's important that feedback is phrased positively so that safe behaviours are reinforced. For example, someone who is acting safely would be praised, but someone who was not would be told how they could changetheir behaviour without apportioning blame to them. The data from the observation process can be used to examine trends and identify areas for improvement.Participative goals that employees help to set are more eective. 5Rewards can be given for meeting safe working goals, for example at the London Olympic Park, these ranged from verbal praise to monetary rewards, vouchers, knock o earlyschemes, T shirts and fleeces etc. 6 Visible leadership is important Managers need to show commitment to the process and can do so by allowing observers time to conduct their observations and encouraging employees toreport problems with safety and health. They should praise individuals they see working safely and ensure there are resources available if any corrective actionsare necessary. It's also important to understand why employees might behave unsafely. For example, do work deadlinesmean that they have to cut corners (for example not using a mask because it is uncomfortable and a job will not take long to do)? Do employees understand the risks associated with a particular task or arethere ergonomic factors that prevent them behaving safely? At the London Olympic Park construction site, employees handed out yellow and red cards to highlight unsafe behaviour. These were followed up with a discussion with the employees concerned to establish why they acted unsafely. Behaviour based approaches work best when the physical environment and plant are well maintained and procedures are in place. The benets of introducing a behavioural safety programme within an organisation is the opportunity it provides for the whole workforce to co-operate together proactively to continuouslyimprove safety and health.

Really! How? you ask. Well, now imagine your management team and workforce aligned with and engaged in a common purpose to improve performance, with both identifying and fixing bottlenecks, and challenging unwanted behav- iours within a mutually trusting andsupportive atmosphere. Does this sound like your place of work? or, is it something you aspire to? Behavioural approach Derived from the Industria l/Organisa- tional Psychology discipline, the behavioural approach used to achieve these proven real world results, havebeen implemented over the past five decades in a wide variety of work set- tings. Applicable to quality, productiv- ity, and safety performances, the purpose is to reduce the number of incidents caused either by poor man- agement controls and/or hazards present in the working environment; those triggered solely by 'unwanted' behaviours; or those triggered by an interaction between poor controls, hazards and behaviours. Defined as an 'unexpected andunwanted event' an incident can be property damage, a quality reject, apersonal injury, or a catastrophe. Forexample, in a bottling facility a worker was removing plastic bottle stoppers with a sharp knife pointed toward his stomach, from glass product bottles rejected by quality control. With the unsafe behaviour noticed by a safety psychologist during a site visit, discus- sions revealed one bottle per minute was being rejected due to misaligned or damaged labels (1440 per day!). The root problem was traced to the labelling machine, where, with minor variations along the horizontal and vertical axis, it became clear that the stack of labels were not sitting in their feed-tray properly. Smoothing these so they sat flush fixed the labelling issues, and eliminated the potential for an injury from the workers unsafe use of the knife when handling the rejects. The annual cost savings were around \u20ac2.6 million. Incident pyramids, such as that shown, illustrate that most incidents have a relatively mild impact, and that critical impacts (i.e. catastrophic) are relatively infrequent events. It is a matter of chance, however, whether a mild impact event may have been more serious, as the severity of out- come cannot be controlled in the same way as the inputs. Preventative opportunities arise, therefore, from controlling unwanted behaviours, eliminating hazards, and tightening management controls at the base of the pyramid. By simultaneously focus- ing on all three, the possibility of a critical impact event is significantly reduced, while greatly improving performance and efficiencies.Optimising behavioural performance 56In the occupational safety arena, research shows that people's behav- ioural choices account for around 56% of all potential serious injuries and fatalities (SIFs), with poor management controls (e.g. job planning, poor quality rules & procedures), and physical hazards and risks accounting for the remainder. Well-designed and exe- cuted Behavioural Safety approaches systematically address these three factors in a proactive and planned manner by targeting people's behav- iour at each layer of the incident causation chain. Incident causation The universal model of incident causation consists of five layers: [1] the Strategic level relates to Senior Management decision-making; [2] the Operational level refers to line-man- agement implementation issues; [3] the Tactical level reflects support func- tions such as Human Resources, Pur-chasing & Supply, Finance, etc.; [4] the Behavioural Level, primarily concerns employees operational behaviours;PROFILE Critical Impact Severe Impact Serious Impact Moderate Impact Mild Impact Hazards and Risks Unwanted Behaviour(s) Poor Management Controls Inputs (Can Control)Outcomes (No Control)and [5] the Defensive level represents the presence and types of control measures. Incidents occur because system faults reside, or are created by people's behaviour, in each layer. On their own they are harmless, but combined with others they can breach any defences to cause an incident. Very often, unwanted behaviour is the trigger that causes two or more of these system faults to combine. The greater the number of system faults at the top three layers, the greater the variety of local triggers there are at the behav-ioural layer, which could potentially breach a greater number of loopholes in the defensive layer. If there is an alignment of the breaches at each layer, an incident will occur. This tells us that safety is a social activity: the behaviour of one person can affect many. It makes sense, therefore, to help remove any system faults by focusing on the safety-related behav- iours of people at each level. By focusing on people's behaviours ateach layer in the incident causation chain, Behavioural Safety processes also create a safety partnership from a combination of management's safety leadership activities and employee engagement in the safety effort. Developing this partnership is impor- tant as safety leadership can impact people's behaviour by as much as 86%, and engaged employees are 5 times less likely to be involved in an incident. Targeting behaviour At both the 'Strategic' and 'Opera-tional' levels, well-designed and exe- cuted Behavioural Safety processes help by targeting safety leadershipbehaviours of the management team, to ensure safety is on their radar and is consistently demonstrated. At the 'Tactical' level, Behavioural safety processes focus on the behaviours of those support func- tions directly impacting the safety of operations workers (e.g. purchasing of fit-for-purpose equipment). At the 'Behavioural' level the focus is on operational safety behaviours (e.g. fill- ing product tanks). At the 'Defensive' level the behaviour of those responsible for corrective actions, management ofchange procedures, emergency pro- cedures, etc., are targeted to ensure the defensive systems are functioning as intended. To achieve this, project teams examine a facilities previous incident history to identify specific behavioural problems resulting from the interaction between people and their wider working envi- ronment. These include those arising from various management systems (safety and non-safety), the quality and effectiveness of leadership, the resour - cesavailable (financial and non-finan- cial) and the overall safety culture. Once identified, attempts are made to discover the triggers (e.g. unavailable equipment) driving the unwantedbehaviour(s) (e.g. using improvised tools), and what factors are maintain- ing them (e.g. getting the job done to meet deadlines), so appropriate corrective actions can be taken. Executing the change strategy usually involves removing any inappropriate behavioural triggers and establishing a monitoring process to help improve the frequency of the desired behav- iours. The results are used to www.bsms-inc.com 57 PROFILE feedback, appropriate corrective actions (e.g. remove hazardous materials, etc.), and the tracking of progress. Long term data trends are used to adapt the process to suit the particular circum- stances (e.g. shift focus to other prob- lem behaviours). Conclusion Organisations good at managing safety also tend to manage operations well - in other words, operational and safety excellence go hand-in-hand. Well- designed and executed Behavioural Safety processes are known to provide a return on investment of around \u20ac1.3million per 100 workers, per year, from incident reductions. In addition, there is strong evidence showing productivity improvements, as well as reductions in insurance premiums and operating costs. It achieves these cost-benefits by identifying and elimi- nating system faults, while fully involving all personnel in the safety improvement journey within a mutually trusting and supportive atmosphere. In the next four editions, we will be providing further articles on how to optimise or introduce a Behavioural Process to achieve maximum benefits.Planning for asbestos removal The importance of planning for asbestos in construction work cannot be underestimated. Tracey Boyle - Chartered Occupational Hygienist and current Honorary Secretary of BOHS outlines many of the pitfalls in failing to plan for asbestos removal... Often, when acting as an expert witness in civil litigation in relation to asbestos management, asbestos surveying and personal injury claims for asbestos-related diseases, I receive telephone calls along these lines: \"Hello, I'm a solicitor acting for Principal Contractor. PC disturbed asbestos on site while working. It cost\u00a3000s to remove and the project was delayed by months. The Client is blaming PC and refusing to pay extra costs and imposing time penalties. We need an asbestos expert to investigate and report on the incident.\" When investigating these incidents, while the details vary, the incidents often follow a familiar pattern asdetailed here. Health and safety before, during and after construction work is currently legislated for by the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 (CDM). Everyone in construction has heard of CDM and almost all construction projects must comply with the obligations under CDM. There are duties placed on the Client, the CDM Co-ordinator, the Designer and the Principal Contractor. In my experience, the construction industry and its clients are less clear about the duties placed upon them in relation to the management of asbestos, even though asbestos is still to be found in about half a million commercial premises in the UK. Under CDM, the client or client's agent puts together a tender package of health and safety information. Asbestos usually appears on a checklist of potential health and safety issues to be considered. Sometimesan asbestos survey is appended. This is often a man agement survey that has been undertaken to allow the client to comply with its obligations underthe Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012. \"Contractors tendering for a contract with insucient information about asbestos will almost always under-estimate, if considered at all, the costs associated with asbestos removal because he doesn't want to add unknown costs to his tender as he will out-price the competition and lose the contract. \" Often, the management survey is accepted as sucient for the construction project, the tenders are submitted and the contract is awarded. Work commences and after some time into the contract, asbestos not identied during the management survey is discovered and work is halted. Or it is discovered that sub-contractors have been pulling outpartitioning constructed from asbestos insulating board for the last week, exposing themselves and a number of other contractors to asbestos and spread ing contamination throughout the building. The priority of course is to resolve the immediateproblem. The client instructs the principal contractor to engage a licensed asbestos removal contractor (LARC) and get the site cleared. The LARC arrives on site, provides a quote and informs the contractor that work cannot start until 14 days after the quote has been accepted because the HSE has to be given 14days notication of the works. The actual asbestos removal and clearance procedures may take several weeks to complete. Health and Safety 58Health and Safety And so the recriminations start. The client says they provided information in the tender package. The principal contractor says that the information wasn't detailed enough. The sub-contractor says that hismen have been exposed. HSE gets involved, solicitors get involved, expert witnesses get involved, and costs spiral while the project is delayed for several weeks or even months. This type of situation arises because, on the issue of asbestos, all parties very often seem to have limited knowledge of it and its associated problems when it isn't considered properly at the planningstages of a project. Under both CDM and CAR2012, the client should inform tenderers/contractors about asbestos on the site. Asbestos and the Control of Asbestos Regulations are specically mentioned in the HSE's CDM ACOP .If the client doesn't know what asbestos is present on the site, they should commission a suitable and sucient survey for inclusion in the tender documents. This will allow the tenderers to take account of asbestos when preparing the quote for the tender. What does suitable and sucient mean? Refurbishment or demolition projects require a refurbishment/demo- lition survey. This entails surveyors inspecting cavities and voids in a building; above suspended ceilings, inside ducting and risers, inside lift shafts and under floorboards. If a building is occupied, it may not be possible to fullycomplete a refurbishment /demolition survey at the pre-tender stage. If this is the case, then this should be acknowledged in the tender package and should be dealt with openly. A requirement of the tender should be that the principal contractor commissions a refurbishment/demolition survey prior to com- mencement of the construction phase. The costs and time associated with the removal of any additional asbestos found should be outwith the main tender pricing and timings, as until the survey is completed and an LARC has quoted for any removal required, no-one knows what the costs and time constraints will be. Contractors tendering for a contract with insucient information about asbestos will almost always under- estimate, if considered at all, the costs associated with asbestos removal because he doesn't want to add unknown costs to his tender as he will out-price the competition and lose the contract. The client will almost always select the cheapest quote in a tender process. When the survey is commissioned, the client or contractor will select the cheapest surveyors and the survey may not be well-executed.The surveying contractors know this, so they put in a cheap quote. Because of this, the surveyors do not have enough time and they don't have the correct access equipment. If they had quoted for a reasonable amount of time and hiring in mobile access equipment or scaolding, they would have lost out to a cheaper surveying rm. And so it goes on. In an eort to 59 Tracey Boyle MSc CFFOH, Honorary Secretary of BOHScontrol costs, asbestos is not looked for, or not found on site in a controlled manner, but is found or disturbed in an uncontrolled way during the construction phase of a project. This costs everybody a lot more, including nancially, the reputations of all concerned, and in terms of health risks to workers. \"In my experience, the construction industry and its clients are less clear aboutthe duties placed upon them in relation to the management of asbestos, even though asbestos is still to be found in about half a million commercial premises in the UK.\" The solutions are relatively simple. They do involve slightly higher upfront costs, but these pale into insignicance compared to the costs of decontami-nating a construction site and resolving legal disputes due the unbudgeted time and costs associated with asbestos found on site during the construction phase of a contract. I would advise that: The client should commission a suitable and sucient survey from a reputable rm of asbestos surveyors and include the survey report in the tender documentation, highlighting where asbestosremoval will be necessary as part of the contract; Those submitting a tender should obtain quotes from reputable LARCs, including a time budget. These costs should be included in the tender; If the client/client's agent is unsure of costs they can get independent quotes from LARCs. Tenders with very cheap asbestos removal budgets should be rejected; The client should insist that all contractors and sub- contractors working on their project have received asbestos awareness training; Construction site managers should receive training in asbestos management so that they have a betterunderstanding of asbestos surveys and how to interpret the information presented. They shouldalso have an understanding of asbestos removalcontracts; The principal contractor can move the project forward once the asbestos has been removed, but all contractors should remain vigilant for other ACMs. When a building is being demolished, ACMs may become apparent that were not accessible even during the most vigilant refurbishment/ demolition survey. BOHS qualications in asbestos (the P400 series) are respected and recognised worldwide. They cover both theoretical and practical asbestos training and are aimed at individuals who need to demonstrate a level of training and competence in order to be able to carry out risk assessments of asbestos containing materials.

It is time for bungalows to be recognised as part of this solution says Henry Robinson, President at the CLA... Since the 1940s, house building in the countryside has stalled. For decades, retirees looking to downsize have been left with nowhere to go. With no suitable alternative housing available to them, and reluctant to lose their support networks by moving into towns and cities, many older people have felt they have no option but to remain in costly- to-run family houses. Not only has this removed much-needed family housing from the market, it has debilitated rural services, limited rural employment and prevented rural employees living close to theirplace of work. With Britain's aging population expected to account for 54 percent of households aged over 65 by 2021 and in rural areas, the number of over-65s rising 2.5 times faster than in towns and cities, this situation can ultimately only lead to the death of rural villages.In the CLA's housing policy document 'Tackling the housing crisis in England' we clearly identify the need to enable elderly owner occupiers, retired rural employees and tenant farmers, to downsize as a key restructuring requirement within villages and oer up bungalows as part of the solution. A solution since echoed by Housing Minister Brandon Lewis. Bungalows provide a smaller, easy to maintain and more manageable living space for older generations who do not feel ready to move into retirement housing. They allow older occupants to remain in the area theyknow and have contributed to, simultaneously freeing up larger, vitally needed family housing. For decades, landowners have been frustrated with the severe and entrenched limits put on bringingfor ward land for any kind of rural development.Housing 62Housing Where small housing units existed, it has paid to extend them as much as possible to cash in on the plot value removing them from the retirement market. Local authorities must look at issuing planning restrictions preventing them from being extended upwards or outwards meaning that they remainavail able for older people. The development of the new National Planning Practice Framework (NPPF)and National Planning Policy Guidance (NPPG) has been an arduous journey, but the results are nally beginning to deliver change. It is my view that thepositive planning changes should be used to deliver new bungalows in rural villages. \"Bungalows provide a smaller, easy to maintain and more manageable living space for older generations who do notfeel ready to move into retirement housing. They allow older occupants toremain in the area they know and havecontributed to, simultaneously freeing uplarger, vitally needed family housing. \" There is still some stigma surrounding bungalows but this can be addressed with good design. The NPPG states that local plan allocations are relevant to all types of settlements and focuses in part on older persons housing, and with the re-launch of Building for Life 12, some of the well-deserved criticism of bungalows on aesthetic grounds can be put to be bed. This is because alongside the design policiesof the LPA, the ubiquitous kit-built, pebble dashed, shallow-roofed bungalows of the past, should beeasier to refuse. The beauty of bungalow developments is that although they require bigger plots than two story homes, they are low-impact on the skyline in instances where the site is highly visible topographically. This is why we have identied deep pitched roofed proper tiesof traditional appearance as appropriate in rural locations. Don't forget, less than 10 percent of the UK land mass is covered by development activity - much less thanmany people believe to be the case. Despite the fact they are more land hungry, in view of our aging popu lation time bomb, bungalows have a role to play in all settlements - not just and Business Association) www.cla.org.uk www.twitter.com/CLAtweets 63 Henry Robinson, President, CLA (Country Land and Business Association) Does new home afforda bility have to compromise energ y efficiency? Julia Evans, Chief Executive of BSRIA gives consideration to missed opportunities when building new aordable homes... In the run up to the 2015 elections, the Conservatives have pledged to build 100,000 new 'starter' homes that will be made available at 20% below the market rate to rst time buyers under the age of 40. In order to help reduce the cost burden on developers and house builders the houses will be built on brown eld sites and will also be exempt from meeting the zero carbon standard that would normally apply to all new homes. The issue of providing adequate new housing has been addressed several times in the last few years. In early 2014, the Lyon's housing review was published on behalf of the Labour Party which highlighted the inability of the supply of new homes to meet demand and called for clarity of government policy to support the house building industry. It stated that while therewas a need to simplify access to suitable land through the planning process, there was an awareness anddemand for high quality development, in terms ofgood design and sustainability, which should not be undermined. The Red Tape challenge launched in 2012 set to ratio nalise the technical housing standards that devel opers and house builders, had to comply with in addition to the Building Regulations. This has led to the development of the Housing Standards that are being currently consulted upon and will help signicantly streamline the compliance procedures for the industry. While further simplication of procedures to support the 'starter' homes proposal may be seen as a savingHousing 64Housing in terms of time and therefore cost, compromising on the energy eciency of the homes appears short sighted. Scaling back the environmental standards of the new homes is likely to transfer the impact directly to the occupants in the form of high running costs. In the Queen's speech earlier this year the governmentreinforced its commitment to meeting the Zero Carbon Homes standard, to build all new homes from 2016with no net CO 2emissions from the use of regulated energy (for space heating and cooling, domestic hot water, fans and pumps, ventilation and xed lighting). To achieve this a three-tiered route is recommended by the government, in which a minimum standardof fabric and services energy eciency must be met along with a limit on CO2emissions for which on-site renewable energy generation may be used. Theremaining emissions would be addressed by mecha-nisms permitted under 'Allowable Solutions' and it was announced that more details on these could be expected shortly. It is important that all new homes address the requirements of current policies and help strengthen the mechanisms for future application. New homes need to be built to be resilient to future challenges of rising energy costs, fuel security and the health and well-being of occupants. An area of increasing concern with new housing is the ability of the homes to deal with rising summertime temperature. The impact of exposure to increased temperatures over prolonged durations can have signicant health impli cations, especially for the vulnerable population that includes young children. The Department for Communities and Local Govern-ment (DCLG) funded the Performance Gap project facilitated by the Zero Carbon Hub to look into the difference between the intended energy performance and the actual energy used by new homes. This saw participation from house builders, developers and academia among other stakeholders of the house building industry, and the ndings were published this summer in their End of Term report 2. This report highlighted a shortage of knowledge and skill within the industry and the urgent need for training and upskilling across the board. It was acknowledged that the industry in its present state does not have the required expertise for mass delivery of homesperforming to the energy eciency standards they were designed to. Reducing the energy eciency required from such a signicant number of new homes would be a huge missed opportunity for addressing the shortcomings identied in several studies looking at housing in the UK. While the shortage in availability of new, aordable homes in the country is widely acknowledged, it needs to be ensured that the issue of aordability does not compromise the provision of a durable product that is a long term Buildings Policy. Source1Addressing fuel povert y in the UK John Perry, Policy Adviser at the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) discusses how housing has a huge role to play in reducing fuel poverty statistics... In 2014 there are estimated to be 2.3 million house- holds living in fuel poverty in the UK 1- and more than 3 million families 2are likely to cut back on food this winter to pay their fuel bills. Housing has a huge role to play in improving those statistics. By far the biggest impact can be achieved by improving the eciency of the housing stock itself - but to secure the full benets of energy-ecient homes it is important to work with tenants on energy use, and not just work on properties. The scale of the challenge is huge. The government's target is to cut UK carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Insulating our housing stock to a high standard has to be a major part of this, because housing contributes more than a quarter of Britain's total emissions. Thegovernment's Carbon Plan aims to achieve 'near zero' carbon emissions from housing by 2050. To achieve these targets, we have to insulate one more house to very high standards every minute across the UK. That's 625,000 per year. Right now the sector isn't achieving anything like the right pace or standards of change. For example, the Committee on Climate Change expected 130,000 solid wall homes to be insulated in 2013; fewer than 25,000 were actually done. The case for a national retrot programme that would achieve government targets is set out by the UK Green Building Council in its report A Housing Stock Fit for the Future 3. Of course all social landlords need to ensure their stock meets the Decent Homes Standard - but this is far below the levels of energy eciency needed to achieve the 80% by 2050 target. While for new homes there is the planned 'zero carbon' standardand currently the Code for Sustainable Homes, there is no equivalent for the existing stock. The National Federation of ALMOs (arms-length management organisations) has called for an ambitious energy- eciency target 4to form part of the Decent Homes Standard for delivery by 2020. The policy environment presents signicant challenges. Policy has shifted away from direct investment ingreening the housing stock towards incentivising households through the Green Deal. We are facing a long-term problem which needs proper investment as well as a long-term plan. So much reliance has been placed on the Green Deal as the centrepiece ofgovernment environmental policy that the extremely low take-up now presents a major obstacle. But could this be turned into an opportunity? The Green Building Council has called for a revived and revamped GreenDeal 5that could be much more attractive to house- holders if it oered lower-cost nance. We also need to revamp the Energy Company Obliga tion (ECO) so that it reaches many more homes and concentrates both on the fuel-poor and on hard-to-treat properties (like its predecessors such as the Community Energy Saving Programme). Leicester CityCouncil used CESP to comprehensively insulate a low- income estate of over 1,000 houses, including right to buy properties. Such schemes make a huge dierence to residents because they deliver high standards andhence real savings in fuel bills, not the marginaleects that often come from (say) only doing roof insulation, which is where ECO now focuses. We badly need to tackle hard-to-treat homes such as those with solid walls. Over 7 million households live in such homes, including half of those aected by fuel poverty. Housing 66Housing As Anity Sutton's Jeremy Kape has argued, the valuable role that social landlords can play in improving the take-up and technical standards achieved by both ECO and Green Deal needs to be recognised by putting them at the forefront of schemes. Many now have thetechnical skill and customer-facing experience to deliver programmes that work and are cost-eective. They should be seen as a frontline resource. Social landlords have also shown how they can contribute towards the shift to renewable power sources, partic ularly through investments in solar PV. While new build is less important environmentallythan dealing with the existing stock, it's vital that we stop building homes that aren't t for purpose because they burn too much energy. We should move to zero carbon new homes across the industry as soon as possible, especially as the typical extra cost of building a semi-detached house to the zero carbon standard is now down to less than \u00a35,000 6. Finally, housing providers have a big role in making the case for change. This extends from the most basic level of their day-to-day interactions with tenants about fuel bills and how they heat their homes, to the installation of new kit like SMART meters that help people understand their energy use, to broaderwork with residents' groups and acting as a powerful lobby for action.Rates of home insulation and of investment in renew- ables are heading downwards instead of accelerating as they need to. We can get back on track, but we don't have any time to lose. And as we make eorts todo so, the housing industry has a huge role to play. About CIH: The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) is the independent voice for housing and the home of professional standards. Our goal is simple - to provide housing professionals with the advice, support and knowledge they need to be brilliant. CIH is a registered charity and not-for-prot organisation. This meansthat the money we make is put back into the organisation and funds the activities we carry out tosupport the housing sector. We have a diverse and growing membership of more than 22,000 people who work in both the public and private sectors, in 20 countries on 5 continents across the world. Further information is available of Housing (CIH) www.cih.org 67 John Perry Policy Adviser Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) Energy efficiency can be the most cost-effective and quickest way to reduce carbon emissions and meet the challenge of increasing energy prices however, the public sector needs to do much more to take advantage of these benefits. Despite considerable effort through government funded schemes, typical homes in GB could still be saving a lot more. It is estimated that a minimum 10% saving on both electricity and gascould be achieved through further simple and cost effective energy saving measures, i.e. measures that save energy and money. That is equivalent to \u00a32.5 billion per year of unnecessary energy consumption. Utilita believes that consumers are not making these savings becausethey do not have easy access to the right information and do not have the right incentives. Utilita believe that offering solutions to help customers monitor and save on their energy usage is a key way to help reduce this spending. Utilita Energy is the leading supplier of prepayment gas and electricity in the UK, focusing solely on the needs of the prepayment market. Issuing free smart metering technology to every customer with built-in features such as Emergency and Friendly Credit supported by remote top-up facilities, allows people to monitor and top-up their energy at the touch of a button, ultimately giving them the tools to stay in control of their energy usage.Despite the rise in energy prices, Utilita recognise the need to keep things affordable, as proven in theservice we already deliver to over 140,000 customers. We pride ourselves on being an alternative pre-pay option to the 'Big Six'. Utilita are passionate and determined to make the pre - payment energy sector fairer andmore accessible and feel that further collaboration with the government would be an important step toward achieving this. A major determiner within the public sector, and potentially responsible for the lack of recognisable savings demonstrated, is a lack of knowledge or understanding around current energy usage and the role smart metering can play, not only in changing energy behaviours, but also in the provision of data which identifies areas where cost savingsEnergy efficiency in homes 68can be best applied. Through Utilita's relationships with Housing Associations and Local Authorities, we are helping to change this with the availability of usage data and the application of energy saving support to residents, delivered via workshops and on an individual level. Smart metering will potentially trans- form householder's understanding of their energy consumption creating new opportunities for better home energy management and engagement with the energy markets. Government conservatively estimates that SMETS1 compliant meters which include the 'In' Home Display (IHD), will stimulate behaviour change resulting in sustained energy savings of between2-3% but other estimates are much higher 2. But smart meters will possibly have their most significant impacts in providing the near real-time andPROFILE historic feedback that allow the effects of installation of measures and implementation of energy advice to be quantified and visualised. Here smart meters can open up flows of information to householders, schemedesigners, installers and others such as energy advisors that can underpin energy efficiency and sustainable energy schemes, thereby encouraging further energy and carbon savings and other social and economic bene- fits. The results of the national trials of smart meters overseen by Ofgem known as the Energy Demand Research Project (EDRP) clearly describe how this feedback was influential for householders when presented in conjunction with particular measures. Utilita want to further strengthen engagement with public sector com- panies and work in conjunction with the government to support this. We're extremely eager to do our part in raising awareness, though campaigns and marketing launches, and have a proven track record in helping customers on lower incomes; ensuring our energy is obtainable and affordable. Utilita are proud to be the first energy supplier to cater solely for the prepayment market, developing user-friendly ways to enable control for our customers. Taking this unique approach to energy means a tighter control on client expenditure andhelps our customers to dictate on their own usage. It's because of this we recognise the importance of working in partnership with public sector organisations for a multitude of reasons. The smart meter rollout will see every household in the UK installed with smart metering technology by 2020,but it is important that we do not forget those wanting a prepayment energy service and the positive impact this could have on public sectorspending. It is often the case that social housing residents are penalisedfor using prepayment meters set at a far higher cost than those who have the choice to pay via a monthly orquarterly direct debit plan for their energy usage. Over the last 10 years Utilita have partnered with a number of housing associations and community organisations, installing their residents with advanced smart metering technology set at the most competitive prepayment rate against the 'Big Six'. This experience sets us apart as one of the most responsive prepayment energy suppliers supporting communities across the UK today. There are about 4.1million households (approximately 16% of the UK population) currently using prepayment meters, which are costing them more than paying via a direct debit service. Although the difference hasdecreased in recent years, these customers still pay on average around \u00a3105 more per year for theirelectricity and/or gas. A prepayment energy service doesn't fit most supplier models and it's these customers who pay the price. A customer of Utilita's for just over 7 years recently said: \"When you know what you're going to spend, you can budget. We see what money we havefor the week, sort out the gas and electric, few other things, then work out what we have spare...\" Allowing customers, especially thoseon the breadline, to take control of their energy usage is at the heart ofBill Bullen Managing 69what Utilita offer. We recognise the importance people put on feeling in control and work hard not to forget that. No one likes large energy bills landing on their door mat or feeling that their energy usage is spiralling out of control - suppliers may know the score but deciphering bills a month after energy has been used puts many customers on the back foot. Opting for a prepayment energy service is becoming more acceptable in today's market, attracting a more energy conscious and savvy customer fed up of receiving regular, overestimated energy bills. The greatest way of reducing energy costs is to encourage people to use their energy efficiently and it's our job to ensure those wanting a prepayment energy service, are equipped with the right tools to do just that. 1 SMETS2: the Smart Meter Equipment Technical Specifications: 2 These are the figures used in the government's assess- ments. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/up- Project Co-ordinator for the Neighbourhoods Green Partnership at the National Housing Federation highlights the importance of investing in the long term sustainability of communities... If you've recently had an energy bill, you might be surprised to learn that in the UK we have low energy prices. You might be more surprised to learn that in many ways this is a bad thing. Historically lowenergy prices have meant the UK has little perceived need to invest in energy eciency. Compared to ourEuropean cousins, our housing stock, which accounts for nearly 30% of the country's energy use, is highly inecient. As a result, in the UK, the sixth richest country in the world, 2.28 million homes are in fuel poverty 1. That's one in 10 households that struggle to heat their home. Why? And, what can be done? Housing Associations, as social enterprises who invest in the long term sustainability of communities are playing a crucial role in creating greener neighbourhoods. Working in partnership with Housing Europe to deliver the Powerhouse Nearly Zero Energy Challenge2, one of the key things we've learned at the National Housing Federation is that with 70% of Europe's 2050 housing stock already built, any attempt to deliverenergy eciency must look at retrot. However, individual homeowners do not represent a large enough market to develop retrot technology at scale. Housing associations with their large stock portfolios, either individually or in partnership with other organisations, are best placed to make retrot happen. Whether it is it the Austrian government's substantial grant funding to ensure all new build is at the rigorous Passivhaus standard or the Dutch government's starter capital for Energiesprong, a radical energy ecient retrot which uses energy performance contracts as tradable commodities to fund improve- ments, the right sort of nancial support is crucial.That's why we're calling for the next government to create a Housing and Infrastructure Bank. Not just toincrease the level of public and private investment in housing but to ensure that there are reliable, funding streams which target strategic outcomes (rather thanthe whim of the government of the day) to deliver energy ecient new buildings and retrot those which already exist. Housing 70Housing Where the business conditions are right, great work is already taking place. We want to ensure this happensmore often and at a lower cost. For example, Alliance Homes 3have procured the UK's largest Social Hous ing renewables contract. Worth up to \u00a3600m and with the capacity to deliver photovoltaics to 75,000 homes across the South West of England, the programme not only helps to take residents out of fuel poverty through localised generation, it reduces the carbon footprint of the housing stock and generates much needed revenue to fund future energy eciency investment programmes. Wouldn't it be great if we had the housing investment bank to support suchrole outs across the country? When we think about greener neighbourhoods, we tend to think about energy but it is by far from the only area. Housing associations are signicant landowners, in many cases they maintain more landthan local authority parks departments. From shading in summer to grey water recycling, integrated land- scaping plays an important role not just in energyand resource eciency but in creating, or recreating, places in which people want to live and in which it is healthy to do so. While the traditional image of a social housingland scape may be more Cell Block than South Downs National Park housing associations are increasingly delivering great places to live with great green spaces. Take Peabody's Islington Estate where the landscape of 173 Grade II listed homes was retrotted with a new rainwater garden to minimise surface waterflooding, provide a great new green space for residents and deliver a Social Return on Investment of 1.95 (higher than HS24). While the Lottery funded Active Neighbourhoods 5project Sanctuary, Midland Heart and WM Housing Group are currently running in Birmingham, and are looking at ways residents can take ownership of and maximise the health opportunities of their green space. That, for me, is the crux of the relationship between housing associations and greener neighbourhoods. There's a great quote by Ralf Protz of Kompetenzzen- trum in Berlin: \"I sometimes have the impression that low energy housing engineers feel that people should stay outside, so that they do not interfere with theperfect energy-ecient house they have created.\" All too often green neighbourhoods struggle because the neighbourhood is forgotten. Housing associations understand that this is not about an adversarial relationship but a complementary one. If places truly are neighbourhoods then all of the green systems, be they energy saving or urban agriculture6work to their maximum potential. People are the thing that can make or break these changes and housing associations are the perfectly placed organisations to join the green Housing Federation Tel: +44 (0)20 7067 1010info@housing.org.ukwww.housing.org.uk 71No two housing associations are the same. Some are registered charities whilst others are not. They are often private organisations but, in the eyes of EU regulations, should be recognised as a public entity for procurement purposes. As a legal entity, they might be considered a company, a trust, a co-operative, or an industrial and provident society. What unites them is their goal -to provide affordable housing and deal with the challenges facing localcommunities. It is therefore a highly diverse board who have the responsibility to make sure the money invested, often from the public purse, goes to achieving this goal. The make-up of the board is likely to include representatives from the local government, members of community groups, business people, politicians, and residents. Many boardmembers are volunteers, but some, particularly in larger housing associa- tions, are paid non-executives. Such a range of people mean it is crucial infor- mation is equally accessible for all. In the case of the Cosmopolitan Hous- ing Group, cash flow problems related to the development programme, ledto the group being brought to thebrink of insolvency. The lack of a pro- active approach in obtaining, storing, and reviewing the relevant information on the financial risks seem to have been the main cause of the catastro-phe. Yet, Cosmopolitan was not the first housing association to suffer from an ambitious development plan, which failed due to weak governance and management. In 2007, Ujima Housing Association experiencedinsolvency for similar reasons. To prevent this happening again, The Homes and Communities Agency made several suggestions and assessing risk has moved up the agenda. The specific recommendations include:many references to the board being aware of the risks, obtaining the advice of expert independent advisors, and keeping aware of the activities ofsubsidiary groups. Boards need to re-evaluate their communication practices and access to information -especially that which builds the risk profile of the housing association. Risk registers are a keyexample of complex documents written and displayed for risk experts, but with the right software, they can be displayed more conveniently for boards. The National Federation of Housing is a perfect example of a board adopting the appropriate software for managing their governance activities. Stephen Bull, Head of Governance and Company Secretary at the National Housing Federation stated: \"As the trade body for housing we want to be seen to be embracing the latest technologyEdward Rees Business Development eShare Ltd 7829 risks Edward Rees, Business Development for eShare, looks at why housing association boards are looking at software to help improve governance and keep informed on risk. 72and leading the way for other boards. We want to set an example that all housing association boards can follow.\" The National Housing Federation use BoardPacks software for their leader- ship team and audit and risk committee. It is a system based on the secure backdrop of some of Microsoft's well- tested architecture, but accessible to board members through either a web browser or their choice of tablet. The apps do not require previous technological knowledge and provide the framework for timely access to vital information. As housing associations are put under increasing pressure to recognise and plan for the risks they take, putting the appropriate software in place has never been an easier decision.

Here Chiara Vitali, Parliamentary Campaigner at the Association for the Conservation of Energy discusses the contributing factors to the crisis... Millions of people this winter will once again face a stark choice between living in a dangerously cold home and spending more than they can aord on energy bills. Many families will spend the coldest months living in one room inside their home, unable to heat the rest. Peoplewill be forced into debt to keep their home warm, or have to choose between putting money in theenergy meter or food on the table. Fuel poverty aects millions of the most vulnerable people in the UK - damaging their health and quality of life. As energy prices continue to rise, the crisis deepens. One of the contributing factors to this crisis - the price of energy - has been the subject of heated discussion over the past year with the main politicalparties variously promising price freezes, energy market regulation and cuts in energy bill levies. Conspicuously absent from the majority of political debate, however, is a clear recognition of the main cause of the high levels of fuel poverty found in this country - the poor energy eciency of our aginghousing stock means a vast amount of energy is required to heat our homes. Homes with modern levels of energy eciency require far less energy to stay warm - as seen incountries such as Sweden where, despite a harsh climate and higher energy prices, fuel poverty levels remain much lower than in the UK. Bringing homes up to a modern standard - energy performance certicate band C or above - is the only long-term solution to fuel poverty. Energy 74Energy Recent weeks have seen some welcome developments as voices in mainstream politics begin to publicly recognise the poor energy eciency of our homes as the driving cause of the energy bill crisis facing the country. Some political parties have even made pledges ahead of the election to make energy e- ciency a national infrastructure priority and launch a national programme of energy eciency retrots. \"Fuel poverty aects millions of the most vulnerable people in the UK - damaging their health and quality of life. As energy prices continue to rise, the crisis deepens. \" These are all positive steps. However, we must go further. At the current rate of improvement people could be left living in dangerously cold homes for up to 45 years. Designating energy eciency as aninfra structure priority and allocating additional resources to provide full-house retrots could bring the homes of all those at risk of fuel poverty up to a modern standard of band C by 2025. While this is an ambitious target, it is achievable with the right approach. Local authorities, with their detailed knowledge of the housing stock, are well placed to play a much greater role in delivering an enhanced fuel poverty programme. An area-based approach focusing on low-income areas will allow ecient and targeted delivery. The most crucial factor, however, is the level of ambition and appropriateresources to ensure that targets are delivered. Allocating a tiny fraction of the infrastructure budget to a retrot programme could boost current rates of improvement and make ending cold homes in 10 years entirely achievable. The case for raising our ambition is unarguable on many levels. Cold homes cost thousands of lives each year and cause misery for millions of households. Age UK estimates that treating cold home-related illnesses costs the NHS over \u00a31bn per year. But beside the cost of inaction, the opportunity presented by rising to the challenge is great. Investment in energy eciencyis a powerful way to boost economic growth. Newmodelling shows that making a major energy eciency programme an infrastructure priority would bring a high return on investment, cut carbon emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs all over the country. It is time to seize the opportunity to end cold the Conservation of Energy chiara@ukace.org www.ukace.org 75 Have you noticed that every time you pick up a newspaper there's an article about how energy pricesare increasing yet again? Every month thousands of householders over Europe are becoming more energy smart in order to combat this trend and they are doingit by arming themselves with home energy monitoring devices that are helping them to save 18% on their bills. What are the benets of energy monitoring? The average energy bill in Europe has risen around 20% over the last 2 years, and energy devices like ours can help the householder recoup this cost by saving on average 18% a year for the home. Here's the interesting part, the devices themselvesare passive and don't automatically save any energy. The devices display the real time energy consumption of the home in a way that's convenient to the user and this constant reminder and checking by the user makes them more aware and more likely to change their behavior in a positive way that encouragesthem to save. What are the dierent technologies? There are a few dierent ways for consumers to view their energy consumption and choosing the right solution can make a dierence to the amount they save. The right product depends on the way the consumers want to see their energy reports. There are basically 3 dierent ways to view home energy consumptionIn-home energy displays (IHD's) In-home Displays (IHD's) do exactly what they say, they sit inside the home and show the homeowner their energy consumption. Home owners will place the display in easily viewable places within the home, some choose the kitchen or their coee table or even their bedside table. Having this device around the house makes it a constant reminder for the user. Our elite In-home display is the world's biggest selling display of its kind and has been adopted by government energy saving projects around the world with much success. Did you know? In the biggest government energy saving project of it's kind, over 340,000 IHD's were use to save the average home in Queensland Australia an average of\u00a3220 (\u20ac277). Click here for more details. Online energy platforms and apps More and more homeowners want to be able to checktheir energy use remotely or while on the go. The engage online platform and app give people the chance to view their consumption in real time from their smartphone, laptop, PC or tablet. Users can also view a history of their usage, the cost so far (day/week/month) and also how they are performing against a preset budget amount.

It's now possible for homeowners to monitor and control individual appliances in their home through a smart phone app. Not only does this allow the user to see how separate appliances are performing it also give them the ability to switch the device on and o from an app. The ego app also allows its user to set timers and automatically shut down appliance that have been on standby for too long.

This encourages the user to become engaged in their own energy use and change their habits. After a while of using these devices this behavioral becomes intuitive. Independent reviews and surveys have shown that by adopting this type of technology the average savinghome in the UK saves around 18% on their electricity bill*.

With winter approaching it is likely that fuel poverty, or more generally the issue of energy unaordability and its impact on the health and wellbeing of the poor and elderly, will once again feature heavily in the news headlines. Around 2.5 million households in England (around 10%) are still classed as living in fuel poverty, and unable to aord to heat their homes, despite years of campaigning by National Energy Action and a government commitment 14 years ago to eradicate the problem by 2016. Fuel poverty is caused by 3 factors - poor quality energy inecient housing, low incomes, and highenergy prices. Of these 3, the popular narrative tends to focus almost exclusively on energy prices, however improving the energy eciency of our housing stock is by far the most eective way to tackle the problem in a long term and sustainable way. Government surveys show that 35% of households living in the least energy ecient properties live in fuel povertycompared to only 2% in the most ecient; that 65% of fuel poor households live in properties with Energy Performance Ratings of E, F, or G (on a scale of A-G), lacking adequate insulation and ecient heat ing systems. There is also a strong correlation between fuelpoverty and general poverty, and capping energy prices and mandating rebates on fuel bills for those inthe lowest 3 income deciles can bring some relief, but improving the energy eciency of their homes could save them hundreds of pounds every year, makingthem more resilient to anticipated future price rises. For over 30 years NEA has promoted the benets of energy eciency, increasing understanding amongst policy makers and building capacity in communities and companies. Last year we assisted 27,000 low-income households - working through our Warm Zone subsidiary company and with project partners we provided insulation, heating, energy advice andEnergy 78Energy income maximisation services. We supported 10,000 stakeholders to improve advice and services for their clients, and trained 2852 front-line advisors working with vulnerable people. Our experience, and theevi dence that we have gathered through research and evaluation, has demonstrated that whilst improving energy eciency is the most eective way to tackle fuel poverty, it also oers much wider benets to society - releasing additional money into the local economy that would have been wasted on energy;enhancing streetscapes, and reducing the burden onover-burdened health services. At a political level this has been recognised, however resources to tackle domestic energy eciency have been inadequate. Whilst 2 million low-income house holds beneted from heating and insulation measures funded directly from the Treasury via the Warm Front scheme, the government's approach to funding these measures since 2011 has been via obligations placed on energy supply companies (ECO). This market mechanism has not been entirely successful in reaching the most vulnerable and a mid term policy review caused a hiatus in delivery and disruption in the supply chain.We are now at something of a crossroads. The government has recently reasserted its commitmentto tackling fuel poverty, this time with a new statutory target for England to ensure that as many fuel poor homes 'as is reasonable practicable' achieve a minimum energy eciency standard of band C by 2030, with interim targets of Band E by 2020 and Band D by 2025. This is supported by a new fuel poverty strategy for England which is currently under consultation, presenting the most signicant opportunity in a decade to influence the future direction of fuel poverty policy in England. However, whilst NEA agrees with the overall aspiration, to reach it will require enhanced and coordinated action and additional resources. Central to the success of the strategy will be the provi sion of a sustainable, long-term, Treasury-funded energy eciency infrastructure programme that is better targeted to meet the needs of fuel poor house holds and will ensure that help is directed to those who need it the most via locally led partnerships. We are urging the government to act on NEA recom-mendations which will ensure that by 2025 95% ofhouseholds currently aected by fuel poverty will have aordable warmth and that future generations will not have to endure the misery of living in cold, damp homes. National Energy Action (NEA) is a national charity which campaigns for greater investment in energy eciency to help those who are poor and vulnerable, and deliver advice and services to eradicate fuel Energy Action www.nea.org.uk 79 Jenny Saunders, Chief Executive, National Energy Action An ambitious Danish strategy for energy efficiency in buildings Rasmus Helveg Petersen, Danish Minister for Climate, Energy and Building details how ambitious goals are helping to reduce energy consumption and create an energy ecient nation... As much as 40% of the overall Danish energy consumption is used for heating, light and ventilation in buildings. As a result energy eciency in buildings plays a signicant role in our climate and energy policy. And, as a consequence the Danish government launched an ambitious and com prehensive Strategy for Energy Renovation of Existing Building-stock in May 2014. The strategy is the largest ever undertaken to reduce energy consumption in existing buildings in Denmark. It contains 21 initiatives, is based on com prehensive analysis, and targets both specic building segments such as single family dwellingsand multi-apartment blocks as well as oce and public buildings. The strategy is the result of a collaborative network process involving key stakeholders within building renovation. I am convinced that this co-creation of the strategy will prove to be the key to a successful implementation. When carried out, the initiatives are estimated to reduce the present net energy consumption for heating and domestic hot water in the existing buildings stock by 35% in 2050. A strategy which covers many areas With the strategy we cover a wide range of issues. The strategy provides a strategic framework for making the energy performance certicates more reliable, giving them a more obvious link to energy renovation. It includes an upgrade of the energy requirements for buildings and building parts, a strengthening of information activities, and an enhancement of data availability. A number of initia tives target training, education and innovation.And nally, the strategy addresses issues like nancing and better compliance. The implementation has already begun for a number of the 21 initiatives. Let me give 2 examples: In October 2014 \"Better Housing - better savings\" was rolled out on a national scale. \"Better Housing - better savings\" takes energy eciency and energy savings right into our homes. A number of trained Better Housing counsellors help homeowners with all the aspects of an energy renovation: a mapping of the home's energy status, an overview of potential solutions, a budget to bring for nancing discussions with the bank, and last but not least, an oer to helpcoordinate and execute the renovation. Another example is the energy labelling scheme. This has been upgraded to create a greater incentive for renovations and is now aiming more directly at increasing energy eciency. Potential property buyers can now go directly from online house adverts to the specic digital energy label. Energy eciency has become a selling point, and the digital energy label oers a quick overview of a building's overall economic prole. With the energy renovation strategy we send an important signal to both building owners and con- struction industries. And I hope that everybody will use these measures as the basis for long-term com-mitments and investments in new energy solutions. We have a tradition for ambition One of the success stories in the Danish building regulation has been the stepwise tightening of theEnergy 80Energy building requirements. Over the years energy eciency has come to play a bigger part in the requirements. Step by step we have successfully increased our ambi tions. As one of the new initiatives we propose to upgrade the energy requirements for windows and other elements which make up the building's environmental footprint. Furthermore, leading by example, the Danish government has committed to reduce the energy consumption in state-owned buildings by 14% by2020 with 2006 as base year. This initiative will ensure implementation of the EU Energy Eciency Directive.The initiative is a continuation of a long term Danish eort (since 2006) to reduce the energy consumption in buildings used by the government. A continuously ambitious energy policy The Danish government has a clear goal to have a society based on 100% renewable energy in 2050. This may be perceived as ambitious, but in fact the goal is a logical consequence of an energy policy which is about both climate and economy.On November 7th the Danish government presented a policy-based strategy for the building sector as a whole, aiming to create growth, productivity, employmentand sustainability. My hope is that we in the years to come will see the blooming of the initiatives from both this strategy and the strategy for energy renovation. Danish energy policy has required courage and investment, but it has in turn reaped many benets, both environmentally and economically. Danish com panies in general have a competitive advantage. They have the important knowhow, and they use less energy than their foreign competitors. So, I see no reason not to continue having ambitious goals. We will all benet from it - and more importantly, our climate, our welfare and our future depend on and Building - Denmark www.kebmin.dk/en 81 Rasmus Helveg Petersen Minister for Climate, Energy and BuildingAfter lengthy debating the European Union recently sharpened its targets for CO2 reductions, and raised its ambitions on renewable energy. The new goals can be reached - but only with further advances in the chemistry behind some of the most promising energy and carbon capture technologies. At DTU Chemistry we are very much aware of this fact. For a decade now, our department at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has had a Center for Sustainable Chemistry. The department and its researchers have taken out a dozen patents. Most of them are withincatalysis. Catalysts enable processesto be carried out under industrially feasible conditions of pressure and temperature. For instance, the strong emphasis on biomass as a renewable energy source in Denmark and a number of other European countries can only be successful through improved efficiency. Not only do we need to take out more energy from each ton of biomass, we also need to deal with environmental issues. In other words we need to ensure, that solving a climate related problem does not create an envi- ronmental one instead in the form of harmful smoke or unwanted wasteproducts.From patent to innovation Innovations at DTU Chemistry address both the energy efficiency side and the environmental side of biomass utilisation. Similarly, a number of the techniques invented here are relevant for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The developments happen in a cross disciplinary effort by our catalyst groups, and the Center for Energy Resources Engineering (CERE). CCS has a strong role in the EU efforts on climate change mitigation. A number of international reports by the International Energy Agency and other authoritative sources have statedCatalysing a sustainable energy future Europe wants to mitigate climate change and promote renewable energy. What will it take? Chemistry! 82that CCS is a necessary measure, as a large proportion of the world's energy supply will continue to come from coal and other carbohydrate sources for at least several decades. A high number of patents do not in itself guarantee implementations that will benefit companies, solve energy challenges, and contribute to the development of society. At DTU Chemistry we are highly conscious of the need to encourage innovation actively. Depending on circumstances this can either be in the form of spin-out companies, or cooperation with existing companies.PROFILE Young talented scientists are the primary driver for transforming science into innovation. The program entitled International Master in Advanced and Applied Chemistry attract some of the best brains in the field form a range of countriesInternational Master Program attracts Young talented scientists are the primary driver for transforming science into innovation. Not only do they contribute strongly to the scientific advances, they are also typically highly motivated when it comes to putting the scientific ideas into practice. Therefore, our department has estab- lished a program entitled International Master in Advanced and Applied Chemistry. For a series of years now, the program has attracted some of the best brains in the field form a range of countries. Fortunately for us, a large proportion of our international candidates choose to continue their career with us, typically as PhD students. We cannot take all credit ourselves. We do benefit from the fact that the Danish PhD system offers much better conditions for young researchers, especially in terms of salaries, but also regarding laboratory facilities, status etc. compared with the international average.Informal contacts aid innovation and careers At DTU Chemistry we are able to enroll approximately 25 new PhD students annually. We note with great satisfaction that a steadily increasing part of these new projects are financed from sources outside DTU. Public funds, private businesses and private foundations all take growing interest in our department. This aids us in carrying out excellent research and proving top level training to our students. Just held for the 5th time in a row, the annual DTU Chemistry PhD symposium is where our PhD students present their projects to colleagues and a growing number of external participants. Besides actual knowledge sharing events such as the PhD symposium will form the basis for informal con- tacts which - as we know - are often the best starting points for future joint projects, either based on science, business or a combination of both. For some years now, the department has held a high level of patenting, and I am pleased to see that a growing number of inventions are taken into industrial use. Some times this is done in cooperation with existing industry, while at other occasions spin-outs are created. The top choice within the natural sciences This activity has not passed unnoticed by our surroundings. For instance, our staff has achieved high \"hit rates\" on prestigious grants such as the Sapere Aude program from The Danish Council for Independent Research. The program is geared for allowing extraordinaryProfessor Erling H Stenby Head of Department DTU Chemistry of Denmark (DTU) EHST@kemi.dtu.dk www.dtu.dk/english 83talents a fast-track, and much in the spirit of the program a number of our younger scientists have established themselves and their groups at the international scene over a short span of years. Much like the success of high profile athletes will spur interest from kids and youngsters, so do excellent young scientists function as role models. This year more than 200 students began a chemistry related education at DTU. For a series of years now, DTU Chemistry has not only kept on breaking its own records in attracting applicants but also conquered the title as the top priority for students of engineering and natural sciences inDenmark. The growth in activity will soon become physically visible. In a years' time, we will be able to inaugurate a new building at the DTU Campus. This will not just be a highly needed extension of our existing office and laboratory space, but also take us a giant step up when it comes to state-of-the art equipment and standards for envi- ronmental and work environment conditions.

It's hard to believe that the Green Investment Bank has only been in existence for 2 years. In that time, we have backed almost 40 new projects which will mobilise up to \u00a35bn into the UK's green economy. More importantly, all of these projects will be protable. Once built, they will generate an annual net prot ofbetween \u00a310m to \u00a315m for taxpayers. Delivering a UK wide impact, we have nanced vital new infrastructure, activated private capital and we are innovating so others can follow. These themes might well be our key messages,how ever, the last one of innovating so others can follow is perhaps more applicable when it comes toreducing costs for public services. We are leading the way in nancing ground breaking technologies, helping to create new markets and building inventive nancial products on fully commer cial terms. Let me give you 3 examples from the last 2 years, at Westernmost Rough in Yorkshire, we are backing pioneering new oshore wind technology and in London, with TEG Biogas, we are turning the capitals' waste into renewable electricity. Lastly, in Glasgow, we used our Green Loan to help the city make the switch to low energy street lighting with the cost of repayments covered by their energy savings. We are working hard to replicate this across the UK as lighting our streets can account for as much as 30% of a local authority's energy consumption. Adding new technology to older infrastructure is one of the best ways of reducing energy consumption and saving money in the public sector. We can help with building retrots, onsite generation, industrial processes and infrastructure. Retrotting technologies, such as LED lighting, heat exchangers and smart metering, could save UK busi nesses \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn a year, according to the Carbon Trust, the energy saving advisory body. This could easily be replicated in the public sector. One of our priority sectors for investment is public sector energy eciency, especially in the NHS and local authorities where we have a track record of activity. We have developed an innovative oering with the Green Loan and the Health Sector Energy Eciency Programme. It allows us to use the full spectrum ofnancing across debt and equity with the ability to fund long-term projects. Our experience with Glasgow City Council Green Loan shows local authorities can retrot their streetlights with LEDs, and using the savings to repay the capital and interest used to nance them, and in certain cases structured with cash left over from day one. In September, we concluded a deal with De Lage Landen (DLL) to announce a new \u00a350m funding alliance focused on NHS energy eciency projects. The rst project funded by the alliance is a \u00a37.5m investment into Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, part of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, where \u00a37.5m is being invested to nance the installation ofa suite of energy production and reduction measures. Energy 86Continued on page 88...Biomass based energy intermediates boosting biofuel production Converting residual biomass into high energy density intermediate energy carriers for heat, electrical power, transportation fuels and chemicals production is the aim of the collaborative EU-project BioBoost (Biomass based energy intermediates boosting biofuel production). BioBoost investigates three promising conversion pathways for several residual biomass feedstocks which are converted by fast pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonisation to intermediate energy carriers for subsequent use in different applications. The applicability of the different energy carriers is investigated in existing and upcoming applications. For environmental and economic assessment of the overall value chains, a heuristic transportation model on biomass and bioenergy carrier transportation is being developed and integrated. The collaborative BioBoost project is coordinated by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and is funded by the 7 Framework programme of the European Union under grant agreement 282873. www.bioboost.euThe project has been developed under the Carbon and Energy Fund (CEF) framework and it will be deliv ered by the energy services company, Interserve. As with previous NHS energy eciency projects, theTrusts and Health Boards that will benet from thenew funding won't need to nd the capital upfront. The money saved by reducing their energy bills more than covers the cost of the repayments. GIB estimates that energy eciency measures could, across the UK, cut the NHS's current \u00a3750m energy bill by up to 20%, saving \u00a3150m each year. Investing in energy eciency isn't just about cost savings and environmental benets. Investment in energy eciency could provide the NHS with more reliable and resilient systems that would signicantly reduce costs and operating risks. Energy eciency technologies can also be used to improve industrial processes such as pumps, refrigeration and heating, motors and how we use water.They can be used to generate heat and electricity on-site, often using renewable fuel sources. And small changes like a switch to low-energy lighting can add up quickly. We recently helped NCP to change all the light bulbs in their 149 car parks to low energy, saving themselves 65% on their energy bill. We don't have to look far for examples of good practice like these. And it doesn't have to be large multi-national companies. We recently helped Bernard Matthews install 179 renewable energy boilers in their turkey farms, helping them towards their target of sustainably generating 100% of their own energy. In the whisky industry we are working with a number of distilleries, helping them lower their costs and reduce their risks. Our rst project at Tomatin distillery, just south of Inverness,cut the cost and carbon emissions of producing the single malt that's exported to 40 countries. As we celebrate our 2-year anniversary, we closed a further round of deals in the energy eciency market. The rst was in the nancial sector, a new area for us. Global banking group Citi put in place innovative energy eciency measures to cut their energy use by 10% at its London data centre with energy ecient cooling units and eciency improvements to thebuilding's air conditioning system. I hope these examples have given you the impression that energy eciency is an option for everyone.

Addressing utility consumption, typically the second highest overhead cost to the public sector after stang, presents an intriguing challenge; rather than losing valuable resources such as front-line sta through cutting costs, utility reductions benet everyone. Reductions in energy, water and waste spend release nances to improve services, mitigate environmental harm, and even help suppliers to meet their government mandated obligations to improve utility eciency 1. It is one of the few cost pressures on the public sector whereby a cost reduction leads to greater organisational strength and flexibility. Real and lasting reductions in utility use are possible and well worth pursuing. However, embedding the principles of sustainability in the organisation is not achieved by accident. For this to really work, it is critical that sustainability is fully integrated into busi ness objectives. Key to success is the development of strategic sustainability plans that are pragmatic and anticipatethe future aims of the organisation. In the case of the NHS, the plans need to empower clinicians to take decisions to enhance sustainability aims, for example through oering reliable and peer-reviewed advice on alternative prescriptions for patients, such as powder inhalers, which have a lower environmental impact and deliver the same or better outcomes than the environmentally harmful alternative 2. In order to succeed in making sustainability relevant to the organisation, sustainability plans need to be developed with and by the people who set the strategic direction of the organisation; the sustainability plan must align with and enhance these objectives, as well as focus on achieving high-level and wide-reaching buy-in to the implementation of the plan. People who will deliver the plan need to design it.Energy 90Energy Sustainability programmes are only as eective as their ability to adapt to the wider objectives of the business. For example, at Essentia, we are workingwith Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust to develop a portfolio of energy eciency works thatwill ensure the Trust achieves its required carbon reduction targets and saves over \u00a31 million each year, as well as improving collaboration across its \u00a3500 million capital development programme. Through the energy savings programme, the capitaldevelopment team is empowered to ensure projects consider energy management, and works across projects to rationalise equipment and make sure the Trust estate can adapt to future service needs. By putting together a strategic plan that delivers a range of projects, you can blend the \"quick wins\" with those that add value but perhaps do not have the necessary dened paybacks. Thus, you can achieve a programme of investment that delivers true and lasting value to the organisation. This is something that has been achieved at Barts Health NHS Trust through their energy performance contract, procured throughEssentia's bespoke framework. An energy performance contract is a partnership with an energy savings com pany (ESCo) that enables an NHS trust to improve the energy eciency of its buildings and facilities. The contract guarantees that the measures implemented by the ESCo will generate sucient savings to pay for the projects, and all savings accrue to the trust. At Barts Health NHS Trust, the investment in building infrastructure to achieve utility savings has released funds that will be used to improve the lives of people in the local area. Fuel poverty will be addressed and signicant investment will be made into the local economy to support the people who live and work in Barts' health catchments, which includes the Londonborough of Tower Hamlets, one of the most deprived boroughs in the United Kingdom. What we've learned through our work at Guy's and St Thomas' and with other organisations, is that sustainability actions deliver nancial, social and environmental value. Sustainability interventions complement and enhance the ambitions and vision of any organisation. Sustainability programmes must be core Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust www.essentia.uk.com 91 Alexandra Hammond, Associate Director Sustainability Essentia, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation TrustPower to the people Utility Networks (UN) - a division of the Energy and Utilities Alliance (EUA) looks at what is needed to keep the utility industry providing 'power to the people'... The UK's energy network is in a cycle of transition. On one hand they have to address the challenge of maintaining a safe, reliable and ecient network, which will allow for future growth, while on the other hand they have to keep taris reasonable and fair without compromising the sustainability agenda. In terms of utility infrastructure the UK's isn't perfect; but the changes that have been overcome; in order to retain a robust and functional system are remarkable. In order to appreciate this, you have to understandwhere the industry has come from and where it is today. Thirty years ago the landscape was somewhat dierent; we had an electricity industry that comprised of 12 regional boards responsible for local distribution, and the Central Electricity Generating Board. The gas industry also comprised of 12 regional boards throughout the UK. Both of these industries were vertically integrated producers, transporters and suppliers of gas and electricity. There were 39 water authorities, 10 of which were state owned and 29 were in private ownership. In terms of utility supply, whether domestic or commercial, your geographic location determined your infrastructure provider. In eect it was a monopoly with no choice of provider or supplier. In the present day the landscape has changed dramatically. Some will tell you it is a vast improvement whilst others will say it's a mess that is dicult tonav igate through. The electricity industry is now split across the countryby 14 licensed distribution network operators (DNOs),and each is responsible for a regional distributionservices area. The 14 DNOs are owned by 6 dierent groups, and are regional based around the board regions, and own and operate the distribution network of towers and cables that bring electricity from our national transmission network to homes and businesses. They don't sell electricity to consumers. This is doneby the electricity suppliers. In addition there are also a number of smaller networks owned and operated by Independent Network Operators (IDNOs). These are located within the areascovered by the DNOs. Since the DNOs are natural monopolies, they are regulated by OFGEM to protect consumers from potential abuse of monopoly power. In order to be able to distribute electricity through the network, DNOs and IDNOs must hold a licence. The licences contain conditions which, among other things, limit the amount of revenue which these companies can recover from their customers. Gas has a similar structure of 4 Gas Distribution Networks (GDNs), with split - not necessarily equally - assets. OFGEM have granted licenses in a similar manner to electricity, but these companies are called Independent Gas Transporters (IGTs) and as such can also construct anywhere in the country within the GDN's networks. Water is not dissimilar; there are now 26 water authorities in the UK regulated by OFWAT. As a consumer, water supply and subsequent sewerage is by catchment area, and unlike electricity & gas there is no independent suppliers, unless you are avery large user or building a very large domesticdevelopment.Energy 92Energy Now it becomes a little more complicated; but benecial to the consumer. Over and above the DNO's, IDNO's, GDN's and IGT's we have some more choice for you. OFGEM and OFWAT have championed 'competition in connections' which for the consumer,domestic and commercial alike is driving prices for infrastructure down, or at least keeping them low. We now also have Utility Connections Providers (UCPs) and a further acronym for their chosen activity as follows: National Electrical Registration Scheme (NERS)- 194; Gas Industry Registration Scheme (GIRS)- 97; Water Industry Registration Scheme (WIRS)- 91. These schemes can be found at www.lloydsregister.co.uk That is, I am sure you will agree an awful lot of competition (and acronyms). However it is a structure that reflects the age of competition and comparison websites we live in. But it is not without its flaws, particularly in electricity and water services, which are fragmented. For example; electricity and water connection operatives face regional restrictions and diering qualication standards. Also the method used for quoting connections, be they for individual or multiple services can be confusing. In the case of gas however, the industry is streets ahead, with streamlined processes and the ability for connection operatives to work anywhere in the UK. This model needs to be replicated across all utilities, and would require OFGEM, OFWAT and Lloyds, with Industry Advisory Panels to let all UCP's self-determine design, connection and commissioning of services & networks. The approach would require no upfrontfunding, as adequate nances are available, the regulators just need to use their powers to resolve unnecessary restrictions. The result would be more competitive prices for the customer.However this is just one - albeit quite signicant - piece of the utility architecture required to maintain a safe, reliable and ecient network. In addition to mobilising the market, the industry also needs tomanage the supply and demand changes, which will accompany the transition to a low-carbon future - all the time keeping prices at levels customers and other stakeholders consider reasonable and fair. In order to do this, the workforce needs to be in place. An estimated 50% of current employees are set to leave the energy and utility sectors and 200,000 new recruits will be needed by 2023. The government and energy and utility employers must 'take the bull by the horns' and continue to strengthen the UK's energy and utility workforce over the next 3 years. The challenges facing energy networks in the near future are very real. Investment and eciencies are needed, and the workforce must be attracted and maintained. To achieve this, the industry needs to work together. It must also communicate its key messages to government eectively, in order to secure an energy policy that will support the needs of the industry and the people it serves. The role of Utility Networks is to facilitate the delivery of industry messages to the government.

European governments have made a long term commitment to decarbonisation with a target toreduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions by 80-90% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. To reach this goal would mean the decarbonisation of the electricity as well as the heating and cooling sectors. So far, the debate has focused on the electricitysector, whilst the issue of heating and cooling, notably renewable heating and cooling, has remained in the shadows. This is despite the knowledge that 47% of the nal energy consumed in Europe is used for heat ing and cooling our homes, businesses, and tertiary buildings, as well as industrial processes, and that around 75% of the gas we import is burned for heat (2/3 in households and 1/3 in industry). As fears about energy security grow and consumers tire of the volatile price of gas, policy makers need to look to more stable, sustainable and competitive ways to keep us warm. Geothermal energy, the energy stored as heat beneath the surface of solid earth, is one such option. Geothermal energy can be divided into 2 categories, shallow and deep. Shallow geothermal resources, coupled with a heat pump, provide heat to buildings and industry, and heat/cold storage. It is the most widely used form of geothermal energy, with a market in almost every region in Europe and about 1.3 geothermal million heat pumps installed today, according to the 2013/2014 EGEC Market report. The potential is, however, much larger. Low renovation rates and a lack of awareness of the holding back development of shallow geothermal. Deep resources can be used to produce power orheat or both (in combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants). This kind of energy was historically developedin countries including Italy and Iceland, but the tech nology has developed quickly and there is now good potential in areas which have yet to be explored, including the UK. Geothermal power plants are base load and despatchable and can vary their output according to system demands; for example, in CHP plants theshare of power and heat generation can be adjusted.The flexibility geothermal provides is important: as the electrical grid increasingly comes under stress due to the integration of fluctuating energy sources suchas wind and PV, geothermal can stabilise the grid. The development of deep geothermal resources for district heating is becoming increasingly popular as local authorities look for ways to make their energysupplies local, competitive and reliable. There are at present 240 geothermal district heating systems with a total installed capacity of 1.1 GWth operating in 22 countries in Europe. The potential is growing as shallower and lower temperature resources are being developed at lower costs than ever before- today 25% of the European population lives in areas directly suitable for geothermal district heating, according to research by the geodh project (geodh.eu). We canCCS and Renewable Energy 94 CCS and Renewable Energy expect a boom in the next few years as more authorities begin to explore the potential in their areas and build the administrative frameworks necessary for development. Both shallow and deep geothermal, and geothermal for power and for heat, can provide secure, reliable and flexible energy, but 5 key issues need to be addressed. Increased awareness and more resource assessment Geothermal Technology has progressed but many, from politicians and public authorities, to nancial institutions and citizens, are unaware of the potential-particularly so if their area does not have a history of geothermal development. There needs to be more transparency about the costs of heat and the options available to consumers, and there must be better communication between installers, architects, planners and consumers. A level playing eld and a secure policy and market environment which enables long term investment The energy market is at present distorted, which makes understanding real costs dicult. Although renewables are ready to replace fossil fuels, they remain subsidised and benet from historical support, and without taxes on carbon and other emissions in non-ETS sectors, this replacement will be dicult. In October, the European Commission published a report on costs and subsidies in for dierent power generation technologies in the Europe. It shows that in 2012, geothermal received only \u20ac70m in support, \u20ac20m of which came from the European level. In comparison, solar received \u20ac14.7bn, coal and onshore wind \u20ac10.1bn, nuclear \u20ac7bn, and natural gas \u20ac 5.2bn. In terms of historic R&D, geothermal was only allocated 0.8% of the total national and EU resources. Whilst national governments need to carefully consider the way the heat market is controlled, sound policy is also needed at the European Level. The removal of regulatory barriers, and simplied procedures for operators, developers and policy makers Geothermal projects are often held back by complicated, insucient and incomplete administrative procedures.Some existing systems need to be reconsidered, and in places where the geothermal resources have nothistorically been developed, systems need to be designed and established. The GeoDH project hasrecently completed an analysis of procedures in dierent EU member states, has made proposals for eective frameworks, and is currently oering training programmes for local authorities. The development of innovative nancial models Geothermal projects are capital expensive and have a risk prole which does not t well with traditional nancing and insurance models. Specic enabling tools, for example specialised risk insurance for geot- hermal projects, need to be developed and nancers should be trained to be able to understand the risksand benets of large scale geothermal projects. The mobilisation of existing funds, for example struc tural funds and EIB loans should be considered, and local authorities are encouraged by the Commission to investigate trans-national procurement. Support for technicians and civil servants In many cases, civil servants are not able to approve or support projects as they have not received sucient technical training. This situation must improve, and regional authorities need to be able to implement specic programmes to facilitate the switch awayfrom fossil fuels. Fundamentally, geothermal for heating and cooling needs to be considered more seriously in order to make the necessary transition to a stable energy future, and the potential for geothermal needs to be better understood. A coordinated push is needed; whilst the industry is ready to provide solutions, policy makers at the regional, national and European levels need to put enabling measures in Energy Council com@egec.org www.egec.org 95Geothermal systems in Iceland Iceland is a volcanic island straddling the Mid-Atlantic-Ridge, a mid-ocean- ridge where two major tectonic plates pull apart from each other. It is also sitting directly over a mantle plume -a localised upwelling of hot magma from the mantle. This unique geological setting makes the island particularly volcanically active with a large number of active volcanoes. This combination is also what makes Iceland the largest volcano island in the world with over 30 active volcano systems. In just the last 4 years there have been three volcano eruptions in three differentvolcano systems and one of these eruptions (Bardarbunga system) is still ongoing at the time of writing. Icelandic volcanoes have accounted for a third of the total global lava output in the last half millennia. Geothermal activity is a phenomenon that is closely associated with active volcanoes. An active volcano means that there is a heat source in the formof a magma chamber, or magma intrusions at a depth of typically few kilometres under the surface. A heat source alone is not a sufficient condition for geothermal activity. You also need water, and to have a sufficient amount of water to set up a hydrothermal convective system, the rocks have to be permeable enough to allow meteorological water (or sea- water) to penetrate it and movearound. The area around many volcanoes in Iceland meets all these conditions, because the rocks are very permeable due to tectonic and volcanic rifting. There are plenty of fissures allowing water to seep deep down to be heated by the heat source. Once enough water is trapped in the permeable rocks above the heat source, capped by impermeable cap rock at the surface, heat transfer by convection instead of conduction will be possible. Hot water deep down moves up toward the surface where it cools and sinks to be heated again. This system of hot rocks and trapped hot water in a convection is called a geothermal system, and the collection of hot water with lot of dissolved solids, the geothermal fluid, is the geothermal reservoir. The surface area above a geothermal system is generally called a geothermal field and usually exhibits visible signs of the activity taking under the surface, e.g., hot springs, geysers, and fumaroles. Geothermal systems are classified as high temperature if the temperature at 1 kilometer depth is above 200\u00b0C and as a low temperature system if the temperature is below 150\u00b0C. There are many geothermal systems in Iceland and four high temperature systems are currently being exploited for the production of both electricity and hot water. Two of these areas aresituated on the Reykjanes peninsulaSilica and scaling problems in geothermal power plants A possible protable solution 96where the Mid-Atlantic-Ridge is uplifted above sea level. The geothermal fluid in these systems is very saline as it is mostly seawater that recharges these reservoirs, and the geothermal fluid is hence called geothermal brine. Utilisation of geothermal systems The most obvious and common way of utilising a geothermal system is to drill a deep enough well into the hydrothermal system in order to bring the extremely hot geothermal fluid to the surface. A typical well or borehole in high temperature geothermal fields in Iceland is somewhat over 2km deep, and up to 3km deep in some areas. The temperature of the geothermal fluid brought up from such conven- tional boreholes can be up to 360\u00b0C. As the geothermal fluid is brought to the surface its pressure drops accom- panied with a lowering of the boiling point of the fluid. At the top of thewell it is most commonly a two phase mixture of water and steam. It is nec- essary to separate the two phases inorder to get high quality steam for electrical generation. This is done in special separator stations which are usually the first part of a geothermal power plant. Once the steam has been separated from the fluid it can be passed through turbines to produce electricity, and the still very hot pres- surised separated water can be put through heat exchangers to heat upPROFILEcold water for district heating and domestic use. Such combined heat and power plants are the most common type of geothermal power plants in Iceland. Silica and scaling problems in geothermal power plants Geothermal power plants can be quite complex and the utilisation of geothermal power is not without problems. Unlike conventional oil or gas fired power plants where the working fluid is simply clean water, the working fluid of geothermal power plants is geothermal fluid which has a complex chemical composition varying from area to area. Geothermal fluid is basically water containing a lot of dissolved minerals and dissolved gases. Complex processes and reactions take place as the fluid depressurises (and boils) on its way up the wells andalso in the separation stations as the fluid as allowed to flash, i.e., to boil at high temperatures and pressure to produce more steam. Boiling of the fluid releases dissolved gases which in turn will drive the pH level of the fluid up making it more alkaline. This typically leads to the formation of metal sulphides and calcites that can form very hard scales on the insides of well casings and also on the inside of surface pipes. The mineral with the highest concen- tration in geothermal water in Icelandis silica or silicon dioxide. Typical silica concentrations in geothermal fluids in Iceland are between 0,6 and 1,2 grams per litre. The hot geothermal fluid dissolves both amorphous (opals) and crystalline (quartz) forms of the rock mineral at great depths and pressures, and at the high temperatures the silica exists in its water dissolved state as silicic acid. Silica while in the form of silicic acid can form hard glassy scales and also combine with various metals to form various silicates that can also cause scaling. There exists various methods 97to control silica scaling so it doesn't cause too much problems for heat exchangers and surface piping in geothermal power plants. This usually involves keeping the water from becoming oversaturated with respect to amorphous silica by carefully controlling the temperature and the pressure of the water. Once the water becomes oversaturated with respect to amorphous silica as it cools further, silica scaling occurs rapidly and in large quantities. This type of scaling is especially problematic for injection wells. The disposal of waste water and the sustainability of geothermal power The mentioning of injection wells brings up the pivotal question of what happens to geothermal waste water and how sustainable the geothermal resource really is. Geothermal wastewater is a mixture of the separated geothermal fluid and the condensed steam after it has been used to produce electricity. Natural recharge rate of geothermal reservoirs varies between areas and is in most places less than the outflow of geothermal fluid due to utilisation. If the geother- mal resource is to be sustainable, great care must be taken to not overexploit the system. This will lead to a pressure drop in the system and reduced flow from wells resulting in less and less power production capacity. In order to avoid this, the water taken out of the system must be returned back into the system. This is accom- plished by drilling deep injection wellsand injecting the waste water back down into the reservoir. This is the preferred method of geothermal waste water disposal but silica scaling canPROFILE A typical high temperature geothermal system.

This is one of biggest and costliest problems associated with geothermal utilisation in Iceland. A look at the problem from a new perspective The silica that precipitates out of geothermal fluid as it cools is called precipitated silica and, precipitated silica is in itself a valuable product that is heavily used in a wide variety ofindustries. Precipitated silica is used as a filler and reinforcing agent in rubber and plastics. It is heavily used in the manufacturing of adhesives, inks, pigments and coatings. It is used in the food and pharmaceutical industries as an anti-caking agent, it is used as a cleaning agent in toothpaste, and as an adsorbent in cosmetics. It is alsoused in skincare products and in silica food supplements. The list of all theapplications of precipitated silica is much too long to list here. The impor- tant point to take from this, is that the troublemaker itself can be made intoa valuable product. The amount of silica that precipitates out of geothermal waste water in Iceland amounts to over 40,000 tonnes annually and if extracted and purified it could be sold for between 1 and 20 USD per kg, depending on its purity and surface area. When used in healthcare products and supplements the price per kilogram can go over 1000 USD. Could large scale extraction of silica from geothermal waste water prior toreinjection be a viable solution to the scaling problems that are making reinjection difficult and costly? And thereby at the same time helping toimprove the sustainability of the geothermal resource in Iceland (and elsewhere), while at the same time creating new revenue streams from geothermal utilisation? GeoSilica Iceland GeoSilica Iceland is an Icelandic start-up company that is already producing high value precipitated silica fromgeothermal waste water for use as a silicon food supplement in the form of colloidal silica. The product is expected on the market late next month. The company is actively researching ways to efficiently extract and purify precip- itated silica from geothermal wastewater on a large scale. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that this is definitely a possibility, at least for some geothermal areas in Iceland. The greatest challenge is to be able control the particle size distribution of the final silica sols and tailor it to specific applications. There are other valuable minerals besides silica in geothermal fluid. An example is lithium. As boreholes get deeper, it is expected that the concentrations of such metals, and even precious ones such as gold, will increase substantially. Extraction of such metals from the fluid has to be done downstream of silica extraction. Drilling extremely deep wells in order to reach 400-600\u00b0C hot supercritical hydrous fluid is the objective of the Icelandic Deep Drilling Project (IDDP). The main benefit of such deep wells is that a single borehole can provide up to 10 times more power than a conventional borehole. A secondary objective of this project is the extrac- tion of valuable metals from the extremely mineral rich fluids from such deep wells. Burkni Palsson CTO GeoSilica this becomes a reality, GeoSilica Iceland wants to be ready with the knowhow and technology required to extract silica from the geothermal fluid produced by such wells, in order to make the extraction of metals easier. In summary: The large scale extrac- tion of silica from geothermal waste water would make it easier to re-inject it back into the geothermal reservoirs, thus improving the sustainability and the utilisation of the resource, while at the same time, enabling the extraction of other precious metals. GeoSilica is currently looking for funding in order to scale up its production capacity and bring its products to European and other international markets. GeoSilica strives to be a socially responsible company and intends to improve the society by conducing towards healthier envi- ronment, creates new jobs, maximising the utilisation of the geothermal resource in Iceland and contribute to EU sustainable objectives. PROFILE99PROFILE Prof. Joan Mart\u00ed is the leader of the Group of Volcanology at the Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera, CSIC, of Barcelona, Spain. The research of his group addresses different aspects of the volcanological science, including dynamics of volcanic systems, hazard assessment and characterisation of volcanogenic geothermal and mineral resources. His work on 3D modelisation aims at improving the imaging of the interior of volcanic systems, thus helping to understand their behaviour and the distribution of geothermal reservoirs, as a way to define better exploration and exploitations guidelines. Volcanos are one of the most evident manifestations of the Earth's energy. Volcanic eruptions are a fascinating natural phenomena, which have attracted the curiosity of humans since the earliest times. Volcanos havecreated spectacular landscapes that today attract millions of visitors from around the world. However, volcanic eruptions may have significant impacts on society and the environment, show- ing us the worst face of the Earth's power. However, this same powermay also show a very different side when we consider its role in creating the Earth's atmosphere, allowing lifeto develop on our planet, and the important energetic and mineral resources associated with volcanoes. Volcanoes are the main source of geothermal energy. Compared to the normal geothermal gradient of about 25\u00b0C per km of depth in most of theworld, when magma (i.e. molten rockgenerated at the Earth's interior) enters the crust, for example, as a shallow intrusion beneath a volcano, this normal gradient is perturbed locally as temperature rises around the intrusion. The extent and duration of such a thermal anomaly depends mostly on the temperature and volume of the intruded melt. The presence of hot magmas below the surface of active volcanic regions offers the prospect of harnessing a huge amount of geothermal energy. The geothermal energy is a renewableresource, as it exploits the abundant Earth's interior heat and water, which once used and cooled, is then piped back to the reservoir. Having the useof this natural energy source hasimportant implications for preservingthe environment. Volcanoes and geothermal energy Taking advantage of the power of the Earth interior The economic and energy crisis that today affects modern society pushes us to look for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, among which geothermal energy occupies a prominent place. Geothermal energyassociated with volcanoes is of much higher enthalpy (i.e. energetically efficient) than other sources such as tectonic or the geothermal gradient itself, so it offers a much better option where available. However, there are some questions we should ask ourselves to ensure that geothermal energy is a suitable and recommend- able alternative to the hydrocarbons derived from other renewal energies. Where does geothermal energy originate? What does it take for a geothermal deposit to be economical? How do we estimate reserves? How can we recover this thermal energy, and how can we use it in practise? Are there any adverse effects for the environment as geothermal energy is tapped and recovered, in particular in comparison with other types of energy? How can we discover that an important geothermal reservoir is nearby? Answering these questions requires us to conduct detailed research on the volcanic systems thathost the geothermal reservoirs, in order to establish correct exploration and exploitation strategies. Otherwise, the lack of knowledge on the charac- teristic of a geothermal reservoir and of its container, as well as on the causes that it originated from, may conduct to extremely expensive and unproductive strategies. It is necessary to improve and standardise the geo- physical, geological and geochemical technologies needed to characterise and monitor enhanced geothermal systems in order to minimise the exploration and exploitation costs byreducing the drilling uncertainties. A better characterisation of the reservoirs should result in reducingthe amount of drilling required to setup a new geothermal power plant. Geological, geophysical and geochem- ical information on the volcanic systems and their hosted geothermal reservoirs must be combined to obtain realistic and reliable 3D simulation and visualisation models that should help to improve the efficiency of explo- rationand exploitation strategies significantly reducing their costs. Europe was pioneering in the explo- ration and exploitation of geothermal energy with the experience of the Larderello, Italy, in 1904 where geot-hermal steam was harnessed to generate electricity. Other projects have been developed later in Italy and in other European sites to exploit geothermal energy. The most successful being Iceland, where more than 26.5% of the nation's energy is geothermal, as well as nearly 87% of home heating and hot water requirements of the country. The European leadership in this field should be promoted byimproving exploration strategies, making them more effective and cost- less, to help make geothermal energy accessible less favourable regions, which are located in active volcanic areas, thus contributing to improve the sustainability of our planet. In fact, several countries in Latin America (M\u00e9xico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Chile), Asia (Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Japan), or Africa (Kenya, and Ethiopia) have already opted for the use of this type of renewal energy.Clearly, the use of geothermal energyProfessor Joan Mart\u00ed Professor of Research Spanish Research Council (CSIC) Group of Volcanology of Barcelona joan.marti@ictja.csic.es www.gvb-csic.esis an important investment in the future in which Europe can not be excluded. 100PROFILECCS and Renewable Energy 101The CCS revolution Jon Gibbins, Director the of UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre (UKCCSRC) details the progress made with carbon capture & storage (CCS), and how it's gaining momentum... The opening of the world's rst power plant to capture its carbon dioxide has started an exciting new phase of activity for the UK CCS Research Centre. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) for power plants is just another stage in cleaning up fossil fuel use. This began with capturing dust, then acid rain gases - oxides of sulphur - and most recently oxides of nitro- gen. Carbon dioxide does not cause local or regionalproblems in the same way as these pollutants, so the politics and regulation are more complex, but the general principle of adding a clean-up process oncethe need is considered to justify the cost is familiar in the electricity generation sector. Also familiar are the stages in how the clean-up technology is perceived,going from necessary'and 'obviously just a routine part of any power plant'. CCS is now in early stage 3 and we are working hard to get it to stage 4 as quickly as possible. The growing number of working CCS power plant projects is the key to making progress. The provinceof Saskatchewan, Canada, with a population of just over 1 million people gained the distinction of being rst in the world to operate a commercial power plant with carbon dioxide capture when its Boundary Dam 3 power plant was ocially opened on 2 October. In Saskatchewan the electricity utility, SaskPower, is a'Crown Corporation', owned by the province. It can therefore take a long-term view on investment and give weight to the benets of securing local jobs through continued coal mining and an extended life for Saskatchewan oilelds, using carbon dioxide injec tion to recover more oil, in contrast to the simpler, but less rewarding, approach of paying a similar price to buy natural gas for power generation.Revenues from carbon dioxide sales for 'enhanced oil recovery', EOR, using the captured carbon dioxide arealso a key factor in enabling power plant CCS projects in the USA. At present 3 coal-red CCS power plantsare being built (Kemper County, Futuregen 2 and Petra Nova) and a fourth is expected soon (the Texas Clean Energy Project, TCEP). The existence of a viablemarket in North America, supported by EOR, is a magnet for global CCS players that seek learning-by- doing and hence keep on the leading edge of powerplant CCS technology. The Petra Nova project has a signicant Japanese stake holding and uses Japanese technology and the TCEP proposal has simi lar major Chinese involvement. The UK also oers the prospect of a viable market for CCS power plants through our 'Electricity Market Reform' (EMR) arrangements that provide a 'level playing eld' for all low carbon technologies through access to feed in taris with a 'contract for dierence' to cover the additional costs for renewables, nuclearand CCS. CCS is expected to be competitive with renewables, based on required support costs and the system benets of providing a controllable electricity output that is always available to meet demand. The UK's use of cost-eective CCS will be greatly facilitated by the recent EU 2030 climate and energy policy framework agreement. This includes national emissions reduction targets but, unlike the 2020 agreement, does not also specify national renewable energy targets. Two power plant CCS projects are being developed in the UK at present, to be funded under EMR plus up to \u00a31bn capital support as a grant to help meet rst-of- a-kind costs. The natural gas-red Peterhead power plant in Scotland uses a 'post-combustion' capture process to remove most of the carbon dioxide in theexhaust from a conventional gas turbine. Interestinglythe technology proposed is a variant of the Shell Cansolv equipment already installed at Boundary Dam, making it a second generation project able to take advantage of some of the lessons already learnt. The coal- and biomass-red White Rose project in Yorkshire has a fairly conventional steam boiler and turbine but, instead of burning the fuel in air, it usesa mixture of recycled combustion products and pure oxygen in an 'oxyfuel' combustion process. Extracosts are involved in initially extracting the oxygen from air but the separation of carbon dioxide after combustion is then much easier. Both the Peterhead and White Rose projects and their associated pipelines and deep (several kilometres below the sea bed) geological carbon dioxide storage sites are being designed and costed at present.Gov ernment decisions on whether or not to fund the projects will be made after the General Election, in late 2015 or early 2016, with the up-front costs of getting a CCS industry started in the UK having to be balanced against the benets. A recent study by the TUC and the CCS Association showed that if CCS is available then the wholesale price for electricity in 2030 could be 15% lower. CCS is also the only way to decarbonise energy-intensive industries such as cement and steel. Estimated Gross Value Added gainsfrom CCS deployment in the UK are \u00a32bn-\u00a34bn per year by 2030, increasing to \u00a35bn-\u00a39bn per year if the UK is in time to get a share in the global CCS market. The UK oshore industry might also be able to use CO2 injection to help maintain oil production, especially if the dierent parts of government involved can work together eectively to ensure the wider potential benets for the UK economy are realised. The UK CCS Research Centre, established in 2012 with funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), is working hard to take advantage of the opportunities oered by the rst wave of CCS projects. Academics need to interact closely with industry to extract the maximum learning from early, full scale CCS experience and to incorporate it in second and third phase projects in the UK and glob- ally. The prize is major cost reductions, through radical improvements in existing technologies and novel approaches. It is also crucial to start now on developing the capacity in people, expertise and facili ties required to support the exponential growth in CCS deployment that is expected over the period 2025-2035 and then again between 2030-2050, to help deliver the very deep emissions cuts required by mid-century. The UKCCSRC already has an agreement with SaskPower for joint research building on the Boundary Dam project and further links with other projects arebeing pursued. As CCS moves out of the laboratoryand o the drawing board, and we have to keep up with the intellectual challenges posed by real worldexperience, UK CCS scientists and engineers are going to get more, not less, and UKCCSRC Director, Jon GibbinsCCS and Renewable Energy 102CCS and Renewable Energy 103Managing Carbon lock-in from Gas-fired Power Generation Dr Ward Goldthorpe, Portfolio Manager for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Gas Storage at The Crown Estate discusses the role of gas-red power in decarbonising electricity systems... Our energy system is changing. Already on windy days as much as 20% of UK electricity is generated from wind turbines and other renewable sources. Over the next 15 years there is an expectation that the cost of producing renewableelectricity will decrease and its share of supply will increase. But what happens when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine? Unfortunately many renewable energy sources are variable, and that is one of the reasons why governments talk in terms of a portfolio of electricity generation technologies. The variability in electricity production has to be matched by sources that canll the gap, virtually at a moment's notice. Currently the best way of doing this at scale is to use natural gas-red turbines that have very fast start-up and shut-down times. The most ecient gas-red power stations use acon guration known as combined cycle gas turbines, or CCGTs, and these emit about half of the carbon dioxide (CO2) per unit of electricity of a modern coal- red power station. So a combination of renewableswith low carbon base-load generation such as nuclear and fossil fuels with CCS, along with CCGTs that can \"load-follow\", is the practical way forward over the coming decades in the absence of cost-eective very large scale electricity storage technologies. CCS is an infrastructure chain comprising technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases of power stations and industrial plants (such as steelworks and cement plants), transport it to a storage site, and then pump it more than a kilometre underground into stable geological formations that will keep it therepermanently like the oil and natural gas accumulations of the North Sea. This pathway to electricity decarbonisation is complicated by a number of factors that together aredescribed as the \"energy trilemma\". Meeting the three requirements of energy security, aordability and decarbonisation over the next 15 to 20 years is a com plex task. New low carbon technologies and power plants cost more than conventional ones based on fossil fuels. In the UK the power station fleet is ageing and there is a pressing need to build new base-load capacity to ensure the total portfolio delivers aordable secure electricity over the next 5 to 10 years. At the same time, however, CO2 emissions need to be curbed. The demonstration of coal and gas red power plants with CCS in the UK is still at the stage of engineeringand design studies, and the rst low carbon power from these is not planned to be generated until about 2019. As part of the response to this trilemma UKreg ulations require new coal red power plants to meet an emissions performance standard (whicheectively mean CCS has to be installed on at least part of the plant) AND new CCGT plant has to be \"carbon capture ready\" (CCR). Carbon Capture Ready The EU Directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide (2009) requires Member States to ensure power stations greater than 300 MW generation capacity consented after April 2009 be \"capture ready\", and species 3 conditions that must be met: Suitable storage sites are available;Transport facilities are technically and economically feasible; and It is technically and economically feasible to retrot for CO2capture. After consulting with industry in 2008, the UK's consenting regime modied these criteria to require that \"a suitable area of deep geological storage offshore exists\" and that the \"economically feasible\" criterion be applied to the full CCS chain. Applicationsfor consent must identify 2 storage sites within thesuitable area. A downside to this \"middle ground\" policy and regula tion both in the UK and across Europe is the risk that CO2transport and storage infrastructure is not built in time to enable retrotting of these unabatedCCGTs so that carbon budgets and climate targets can be met. Because power stations have long operating lives this will lead to carbon-lock in, or the creation of new emissions for which there is no mitigation solution other than osets. The eectiveness of a CCR policy is critically dependent on how realistic the future transport and storageoptions are. The gure opposite shows consentedCCR CCGT plants in the UK, their storage site choicesand some possible transport links. A number of these could never be realistically deployed and thus will eventually lead to residual emissions in the future that will not be abated without prohibitive costs. Any viable decarbonisation plan will need to recognise and account for this eventuality. A key objective of governments' energy and climate policies should therefore be ensuring carbon lock-in is reduced to the lowest possible level. To eectively manage this risk, governments need to be mindful of the negative impact of: Large scale deployment of renewables without a system-level strategy for managing variability; Allowing new CCR CCGTs to be unabated for long periods of 25+ years; Slow progress in demonstration of CCS at scale; and Weak application of the CCR conditions in the EU Directive. The process of appraising storage sites to a suitable level of condence takes time and is undertaken bycompanies outside the power sector, working with dierent investment options and criteria. Ensuring we appraise enough storage over the next 10 years will be one of the most important foundations for the ecacy of the CCR policy and decarbonisation of the whole energy system at lowest cost in Portfolio Manager for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Gas Storage The Crown Estate Tel: +44 (0)20 Renewable Energy 105Biomass to energy in Finland Mika J\u00e4rvinen, Associate Professor at the Department of Energy Technology at Aalto University discusses how burning black liquor for energy can reduce CO2... In Finland, one third of electricity is produced by nuclear power, one third by fossil fuels and last butnot least one third by renewables. The share of renewables is covered half by hydro-power and halfby burning black liquor, and other wood related fuels. Although black liquor may sound a bit exotic; it is just the side product of papermaking. In the papermaking process, the bers of the wood are separated by chemical cooking and then used to make paper. Therest of the organic part of the wood and the residual cooking chemicals forms the black liquor. Liquor is burned in the modern Kraft Recovery boilers very eciently. The burning of organic part releases heat that is used to make electricity and heat. The inorganic part is eectively regenerated and recycled in an almost fully closed process, a very positive thing from an environmental point of view. From the energy point of view, black liquor is a biofuel and CO2 emissions can be considered as neutral. In addition to 10% of electricity and heat produced in Finland from black liquor, Finland has long traditions and history in the development of the black liquorcombustion technology and, currently the main 2 recovery boiler manufactures are operating in Finland. In addition to this, even though the population of Finland is only 5.5 million people, the research community and activity around black liquor combustion is at the same level than in the other black liquor superpowers USA and Canada. Research on black liquor combustion, especially the spraying of black liquor into the furnace was started by Ari Kankkunen in the early 90's, and today the research is carried out on an industrial scale. The most important topics are related to better control of the spray; it is essential that the droplet size, injec tionvelocity, and the direction can be accurately con- trolled. Poorly dened spray properties such as too small or too large droplet size, wrong distribution or too high velocity of the spray will lead to major boiler fouling problems. These could result in blocking the heat transfer section of the boiler, or we could have a poor recovery eciency of the inorganic cooking chemicals. The 2 gures above are just samples on how important the correct spraying temperature is. As here, it is often noted that small details make a huge dierence in large industrial processes. Realimprovements can be achieved only by understanding the processes suciently and on principal level.Long live University Tel: +358 50 4142593mika.jarvinen@aalto. http://energytech.aalto.// Figure 1. Black liquor spray with correct spraying temperature and mass flow results in correct droplet size, no fouling or problems in chemical recovery.Figure 2. Wrong spraying temperature (only 2 \u00b0C lower from optimal), results in too large droplet size, significant problems in chemical recovery and boiler operation.The path to wind power The development of wind farms in the UK could have a bright future with agreeable planning processes and responsible, community-minded owners working together. Here, Adjacent Government delves into the possibilities... Many scientists and governments agree that the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) is causing our climate to change dramatically. Last year the UK government predicted that globalwarming will expose many millions more people to the risks of hunger, drought, flooding and diseases like malaria, and produce irreversible losses of species. Renewable energy sources such as wind power arean essential tool to utilise if we are to address climate change with obvious benets such as the fact that it is clean, safe, abundant (especially in the UK), aordable 1 and helps to create jobs. RenewableUK 1have stated that wind energy already makes a signicant contribution to the UK, with an output of 15.5TWh in 2011 - equivalent to the annualelectricity demand of 4.7 million homes. So, it makes perfect sense that support for wind power shouldbe high. According to Yes2Wind 2, opinion surveys regularly show that just over 8 out of 10 people are in favour of wind energy, but there are still many who are opposed, especially those living in close prox imity to a site. But is this improving through better engagement with communities? Onshore wind provides many environmental, social and economic benets. Research conducted by RenewableUK on onshore sites has shown that for each installed megawatt (MW), around \u00a3100,000 stays in the community and surrounding areas during the lifetime of the project. Not surprisingly, communities are becoming more engaged and are reaping the benets of local development.Planning processes The planning policy for onshore wind is contained in anumber of documents, principally the government'sNational Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), the National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy Infra structure and online planning practice guidance for renewable and low carbon energy. To protect important environmental sites, the govern ment's aim was to make clear that the need for renewable energy did not automatically override environmental protections and the planning concerns of local communities. The government has also proposed that communities should receive an increased community benet package when an onshore wind farm is accepted in their area. The NPPF directs that when determining planning applications for renewable energy development, LPAs should: Not require applicants for energy development todemonstrate the overall need for renewable or low carbon energy and also recognise that even small-scale projects provide a valuable contribution to cuttinggreenhouse gas emissions; and Approve the application if its impacts are (or can be made) acceptable. Once suitable areas for renewable and low carbon energy have been identied in plans, local planning authorities should also expect subsequent applications for commercial scale projects outside these areas to demonstrate that the proposed location meets the criteria used in identifying suitable areas.CCS and Renewable Energy 106CCS and Renewable Energy The NPPF makes clear that renewable energy development is not normally considered appropriate development for green belt land. In such cases developers will need to demonstrate very special circumstances if projects are to proceed. Such very special circumstances may include the wider environmental benets associated with increased production of energy from renewable sources. The Goole Fields Wind Farm - case study In September 2010, RWE Innogy UK received planningpermission by East Riding of Yorkshire Council to build a wind farm on a section of land south east of the town of Goole. Councillors on the planning committee voted unanimously in favour of the GooleFields Wind Farm. \"Renewable energy sources such as wind power are an essential tool to utilise if we are to address climate change with obvious benefits such as the fact that it is clean, safe, abundant (especially in the UK), aordable 1 and helps to create jobs. \" Goole Fields Wind Farm comprises 16 turbines, each standing at 124.8 metres high (from the base to the tip of the turbine blades) generating a total capacity of around 32.8 megawatts (MW). This is enoughelec tricity to meet the average annual needs of thousands of homes each year. The topography of the site is flat arable land with areas of woodland at the southern end and has signicant drainage features under the control of the Environment Agency or Internal Drainage Board. The rst phase of construction started in January 2012, which saw the foundations set and the electrical and civil works completed and has been fully operational since August 2014. In addition, consent has also been approved for a further 17 turbines immediately to the west of the rst phase farm taking the total to 33 turbines.The Community fund The Goole Fields Community Fund is worth \u00a31.6m over the lifetime of the wind farm and is due to bemaking its rst awards in January 2015. The panel in charge of allocating the funds are made up of local people and is facilitated by East Riding of Yorkshire Council's (EYRC) Rural Policy & Partnerships Team - operating a transparent administration process. EYRC requested in the early stages that the provision of community funding is secured through a section 106 agreement (s106). The s106 provides a mechanism which make a development proposal acceptable in planning terms that would not otherwise be acceptable, and in the case of Goole, there is an obligation that RWE Innogy UK provide the community fund with an annual payment based on the totalinstalled capacity of the wind farm. Conclusion This article aims to show how wind farms can be of benet to the UK. The case for wind power is a true'green' option, the planning processes and policies are clear that development is possible, and by showing that investing in the local community benets that community, could this particular case study be a shin ing example of 'how to get it right?' 1If you are interested in developing a commercial wind farm, RenewableUK oer free advice and guidance.

The UK Government's gures show that all wind power will be cheaper than nuclear power by 50 years geosci- entists have gained a much better understanding of just how dynamic the Earth is via our understanding of plate tectonics and the consequences of it. One of the most spectacular dynamic features of our planet is magmatism, which impacts our lives most prominently in volcanic eruptions. Magmatism has helped shape the Earth and its atmos- phere, providing the main conduit for transporting material through theEarth. The magmatic cycle starts deep in the Earth when the mantle or crust begins to melt via processes driven by plate tectonics. A major consequence of continental collision is the thicken- ing and heating of the Earth's crust. When the deep parts of the Earth's crust reach temperatures greater than about 650\u00b0C the rocks can begin to melt in a process we refer to as partial melting or anatexis. Such processes are inferred to be occurring beneath the Himalayas today and affect the way the Earth's crust behaves by rad- ically changing its strength. Once formed, silicate melt may sepa- rate from the solid residue and migrate through the crust. Partial melting is one of the most important processes that occurs in the crust because it is a process that allows material to move between different parts of the crust, and allows the crust to chemically differentiate. As the melt produced is a mobile phase that can leave its source and, being buoyant, typically rises to higher levels in the crust, sometimes making it to the Earth's surface. It is often via such dif-ferentiation processes in the Earth that we get the economically impor- tant concentrations of valuable metals that our society relies on. The difficulty in understanding deep Earth processes is that they cannot be directly observed. Instead, geoscien- tists must study ancient rocks that were once deep in the Earth, under- take experiments at conditions similar to the deep Earth or utilise our under- standing of thermodynamics and mechanics to model the processes. One important way of understanding the high pressure and temperature processes that operate within the Earth is via equilibrium thermody- namics. Thermodynamic modellingallows us to investigate processes that we cannot directly observe and to test hypotheses. This method has been applied to geological processes forModelling the melting process in the Earth's crust 108many decades, but increasingly so in the last twenty years as computing power has increased. Today, thermo- dynamic methods are widely used in geosciences to understand the condi- tions in which different rocks form. A way in which we do this is to produce phase diagrams that show which setsof minerals are stable for different pressures and temperatures. These diagrams can then be compared to the sets of minerals that we observe in a range of rock-types to understand conditions of formation and to make predictions of metamorphic processes. For my work in partial melting, the main aim is to build suites of thermo- dynamic descriptions for minerals and silicate melt that can be used together to predict deep Earth processes, including the melting process. These thermodynamic descriptions definethe thermodynamic properties ofPROFILE minerals as a function of their compo- sition, pressure and temperature such that metamorphic geologists can use these to model what may happen deep in the Earth at high pressures and temperatures. A major challenge we face is to build these models in suf- ficiently complex chemicals systems that would make them relevant to the natural world. Most minerals are not pure compounds of fixed composition but what we call solid solutions that can vary markedly in their composi-tion, for example from iron rich to magnesium rich. To undertake any calculations we need models that describe the thermodynamic proper-ties of a mineral as a function of its composition range. Much of my work is dedicated to building these models for solid solution minerals. Silicate melt presents its own difficulties because it may vary greatly in compo-sition and lacks the defined crystalstructure of solid minerals. However, without a thermodynamic model for melt we are very limited in what we can do.With adequate thermodynamic models, we can make predictions of the melt- ing process, including understanding the pressures and temperatures at which melting occurs, the amount of melt that is produced and the compo- sition of that melt. When crustal rocks melt, they are strongly composition- ally partitioned with the melt being considerably richer in silica, potas- sium, sodium and importantly water than the original rock. Water is a very important component in melting as it lowers the temperature at which rocks melt by hundreds of degrees. Without water, the crust would rarely undergo any melting. When the melt crystallises at shallower levels includ- ing the Earth's surface it releases this water, which in volcanoes may cause large explosive eruptions. To understand the melting process wemust study rocks that originated deep in the crust and have undergone melt-ing. These rocks are called migmatites and are mostly composed of darklayers (melanosome) representing theProf Richard White Institute of 6131 (leuco- some) crystallised melt. In many migmatites, we can thermo- dynamically model the amount of melt produced and compare this with the amount of leucosome in the rock to understand how much melt may have left the source rock and migrated to higher levels in the crust. We are currently embarking on a research program funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) to make new thermodynamic models for partial melting of metabasic rocks (metamorphosed basalt). Our ability to model these rocks at high temper- ature is currently limited by the lack of an appropriate model for melt, and this limits our understanding of how these rocks form. My work forms part of a collaborative research centre at the University of Mainz, Germany called VAMOS (volca- noes, atmosphere magmatic open systems). This centre is aimed at better understanding the magmatic process and its consequences from the formation of melt in the Earth, its transport through the Earth and its eruption. The centre involves collabo- ration between geoscientists and atmospheric scientists to better under- standhow solid Earth and atmospheric processes are connected. PROFILE Migmatites are rocks that originated deep in the Earth's crust and have undergone meltingA new bio-based EU Bio-based industries could help the EU be a leading contender in a global bio-based economy, here Dirk Carrez, Executive Director at the Bio-based Industries Consortium details why... With sustainability at the heart of the bio-based economy, growth can be decoupled from resource depletion and environmental degradation. The bio-based economy is an opportunity for the EU to transition more rapidly to a low-carbonand resource ecient society. It can establish the EU as a leading contender in a global bio-based economy that is expected to reach the \u20ac200 billion mark by 2020. The global race with the USA, China, and Brazil has, however, underpinned the need for public and private players to join forces and to translate the EU's innovation potential into commercial-scale products.This is why the EU has teamed up with the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) - a grouping of more than 70 agriculture, forestry, chemicals, paper, pulp, biotechnology and energy rms, among others - toform the BBI, a \u20ac3.7bn Public-Private Partnership on bio-based industries that will be partly funded through the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. Some \u20ac975m will come from the EU and another \u20ac2.7bn from industry partner BIC. This should provide plentiful business opportunities inEurope's green economy. The BBI, which launched its rst Call for Proposals in July, will fund research and innovation projects in the area of the bio-based economy. Its main objective is to create a competitive, innovative and sustainable Europe, to lead the transition towards a post-petroleum society, and to decouple economic growth from resource depletion and environmental impact. Its vision is that the bio-based industries will optimiseland use and food security through a sustainable,Environment 110Environment resource ecient and largely waste-free utilisation of Europe's renewable raw materials for industrial processing into a wide range of bio-based products,such as advanced transportation fuels, renewablechemicals, biomaterials, food ingredients, feed and bioenergy. In doing so, bio-based industries will play an important role in spurring sustainable growth and boosting Europe's competitiveness by re-industrialising and revitalising rural areas, providing tens of thousands of high-skilled research, development and production jobs over the next decade. And this is mainly due tothe fact that in a bio-based economy, bio-reneries -or the industrial installations that convert biomass into greener everyday products - need to be built close to where the biomass is, i.e. in rural areas. Europe has the potential. It's a matter of deploying it. The BBI is thus a key enabler as it will focus on bringing technology to maturity through specic R&D projects, and by upgrading and building demonstration and flagship bio-reneries (\"rst-of-its-kind\" productionplants) that will process the biomass into a range ofinnovative bio-based products. Equally important isthe BBI focus on building new value chains based on the development of sustainable biomass collection and supply systems with increased productivity andimproved utilisation of biomass feedstock, while unlocking the utilisation and valorisation of waste and lignocellulosic biomass. As per the Horizon 2020 rules for participation, all stakeholders can submit innovative proposals to the BBI and demonstrate beyond state-of-the-art. The BBI is unique in bringing previously unrelated industries together and develop totally new value chains. By nding other ways of generating fuel and other products from plants and waste, the bio-based industries will signicantly cut our dependency on fossil fuels and fossil-based products. \"In doing so, bio-based industries will play an important role in spurring sustainable growth and boosting Europe's competitiveness by re-industrialising and revitalising rural areas, providing tens of thousands of high-skilled research, development and production jobs over the next decade.\" But public involvement is essential. It is often too risky and expensive for private companies to invest in the research necessary to turn agricultural waste into products like plastic and fuel. Moreover, individual companies can rarely bring new technologies to market across the EU on their own. This is where the BBI can make a dierence. At one end of the production chain, the BBI will help nd new sources of biomass,and at the other, it will try to support new markets for bio-based products by, for example, developing newproducts Executive Director, Bio-based Industries ConsortiumThe Nanobiotechnology for Diagnostics (Nb4D) Group belongs to the Institute of Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia (IQAC), one of the institutes of the State Agency CSIC (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edfi- cas), and to the Biomedical Research Centre Network of Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER- BBN). The group is led by Prof. M.-Pilar Marco, Professor of Research of CSIC, and is composed of a multidisciplinary, highly qualified team of investigators. Since 1996 Nb4D investigates the design of new strategies for the development of a new generation of diagnostic tools and devices that increase the effectiveness of the actual methods. A large part of the investigation is centred on combining specific bioreceptors with micro(nano)particles and devices designed to produce optical or electrical signals. Right now, the knowledge generated about the properties that materials have at the nanometre level allow for the design of new strategies for the detection and quantification of biomarkers of interest in different fields. Basic research is performed around 3 lines: (i) the devel- opment of bioreceptors with defined properties (affinity, specificity); (ii) the preparation and characterisation of functional biohybrid materials, resulting from the incorpo- ration of specific bioreceptors on inorganic materials with optical or electrical properties and; (iii) the implementation of these bioreceptors or biofunctional materials onto transducers based on new micro/ nanobiotechnological approaches. All of the research is aimed at providing diagnostic alterna- tives to the clinical and food safety fields. In the clinical field theNb4D group is active in cardiovascular, neurodegener- ative or infectious diseases, therapeutic drug monitoring and adverse drug reactions. In the food safety field, methods are being developed for the detection of residues of pesticides, veterinary drugs or pathogens. Among the capabilities of the Nb4D group it is worth mentioning its expertise and knowhow related to the production of antibodies against a variety of substances,Nanobiotechnology for Diagnostics Nb4D Group 112including small non-immunogenic molecules, for which it is an internationally recognised referent. Also the group has the knowledge to create functional biohybrid materials and nanoprobes resulting from the covalent biofunction- alisation of surfaces and nano particles. Moreover it PROFILE Figure 1. Noble metal nanoparticles can be used to develop specific nanoprobes resulting from the covalent attachment of bioreceptors to their surfaces. These nanoprobes can beemployed to develop optical biosensors based on their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) propertiespossesses the capacity to establish diagnostic methods and technologies based on microplates (e.g. ELISA), micro - arraysand on resonance; amperometric) transductors. The latters permit the development of high performance biosensor-based diagnostic methods or point-of-care (PoC) devices providing rapid responses, selective to the presence of particular biomarkers (even in complex biological matrices) and possibilities for multiplexation, miniaturization or automation. Since its creation, the Nb4D group has participated in more than fifty projects, many of them at the European level, collaborating with recognized research groups from the public and the private sector. Moreover, it holds stable research collaboration contracts with European and US companies. As a result of the research performed, numerous specific antibodies along with immunochemical techniques, including biosensors, with various applications have been developed. The Nb4D group possesses a portfolio of patents protecting bioreagents and technologies, which in some cases are under exploitation by biotech companies. Results have also been published in nearly 200 peer- reviewed international journals of high impact factor. The Nb4D group also trains predoctoral students and partakes in doctorate and master programmes. The Nb4D group has an important collection of specific antibodies and bioconjugates for the detection of cardio-vascular biomarkers, microorganisms, anabolic androgenic steroids, oral anticoagulants, veterinary drugs (antibiotics, steroid hormones etc.), pesticides, industrial residues etc. In 2009 the group created the Custom Antibody ServiceM.-Pilar Marco Professor of Research, Head of the Nb4D group Nanobiotechnology for Diagnostics whose objective is to provide services and scientific assessment related to the production of anti-bodies, whether monoclonal or polyclonal, bioconjugates (proteins, biotin, and the development of immunochemical detection methods.Nowadays, CAbS provides services to a large number of entities including public research bodies (25%) and private enterprises (75%).

Members of the Nb4D teamAccording to the recent Fifth Assessment Synthesis Report presented in Copenhagen by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPCC), to face the irreversible effects of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) need to fall by as much as 70% around the world by 2050 and to zero by 2100. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological, economic, social, and institutional challenges. BFS blue Enterprises has developed a technology to capture, neutralise and transform industrial CO2emissions into products with applications in a range of markets including energy, pharmaceuticals, nutrition, cosmetics, and biotechnology. Using a sophisticated technology to accelerate the power of nature, BFS provide a feasible mitigation pathway for CO2emissions. CO2Capture... and Conversion Because of the way our cycles of production and consumption work, our food, energy and environment are intricately linked. With the consistant global development of the past century, it is increasingly difficult to satisfy our world with sufficient food and energy. Meeting these demands has a direct impact on the environment, especially through the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly atmospheric CO2, which is currently at an unprecedent- edly high concentration of nearly 400 ppm (September 2013). According to the global scientific andenvironmental community (UN, NASA, IPCC, EPA, etc), if current emission rates continue, we will soon reach a point ofno return: irreparable damage resulting in a lack of potable water, changes in food production conditions and increased mortality rates from natural disasters such as floods, storms, and droughts. Climate change is not merely an environmental issue; it has deep economic and social implications. Though many of these natural phenomena have already been documented, energy from fossil fuels has allowed for most of society's modern comforts, making it difficult to implement changes in behaviour. According to the International Energy Agency, $1tn of investment is needed worldwide each year for the next 36 years to stave off the worst effects ofglobal warming and keep the Earth habitable. BFS technology presents some of the answers to the big problems we have represented so far, with lower investment: Technology based on the capture, neutralisation and conversion of the CO2from flue gases. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is a technology that removes carbon from the flue gases and stores it in geological formations to prevent it entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. The big difference is that BFS blue technology not only captures, but also converts the CO 2(not storage) into some other products. Food. Some other products can be essential goods for food.Carbon, Capture, Conversion and Neutralisation (C3N) 114High value products (Omega 3, antioxidants, vitamins, sitosterols, polysaccharides, natural colorants, etc.) from a commercial point of view. True alternative to fossil fuel; storable, high-density energy to be used even to get all the derivate products that currently are obtained from fossil oils (plastics, paints, chemicals, etc). The BFS combination of high value products plus blue petroleum, allows us to produce the first biocrude -fully competitive with fossil oil both in price and flexibility. Unique Technology Human activity is moving dangerously towards the Earth's natural cycle; the CO2absorbed during photosynthesis (reduction) is later reintroduced into the atmosphere through the natural process of combustion (oxidation). Withthe industrial revolution, humans have destroyed this natural balance by drastically increasing the concen- tration of CO2.PROFILE Figure 1. The 3rd cycle of CO2. www.biopetroleo.com. To reverse this situation, BFS has developed a unique technology (3rd Cycle of CO2) to accelerate CO2reduction based on Carbon, Capture, Conversion and Neutralisation (C3N). C3N is an alternative, or in some cases comple- mentary, to the CCS technology. In BFS technology CO2is captured, but instead of being buried, is used to feed marine phytoplankton (the building blocks of life) that capture the CO2via photosynthesis and transform it into valueable bioproducts. With patented technology, BFS blue Enterprises cultivates these marine phytoplankton on an industrial scale with a fully-automated, aseptic process to ensure high-quality, homogenous production throughout the year. Because of the modular nature of the plant (seen in Figure 2), production is divided into sectors to produce different products, making BFS technology highly adaptable to market demand. Crude oil with 0 Emissions To produce 1 BBL of crude oil, BFStechnology permanently neutralises 1 ton of CO 2. Given the average combustion emissions of one barrel of oil being 390 kg of CO2, BFS completely offsets 2.5 barrels for every barrel of blue petroleum, ensuring a net emission of 0 from the combustion ofthe 3.5 total barrels.In this way, we can maintain our present energy model without changing our current lifestyle or infrastruture, even after the end of fossil energy. This means that, 3.7 Million of BBL per day of BFS blue oil will neutralise the EU's CO2emissions from crude oil (EU crude oil consumption is 12.7 MBBL/day). To reach this production of 3.7 MBBL per day of BFS blue Petroleum, would require a much lower investment than $1tn/year (According to the Interna- tional Energy Agency, this is roughly the amount of investment neededworldwide each year for the next 36 years to stave off the worst effects of global warming and keep the Earth habitable). In fact the investment in total, from 2015 to 2050 would be\u20ac1.4tn; \u20ac38.3bn/year, around 0.4% of the GDP every year up to 2050; from this point on, no additional investment would be needed and the plant would generate a revenue of \u20ac544bn per year. Conclusions - Reflection Is \u20ac38.3bn/year an expensive budget to neutralise 100% of the CO2emissions coming from the crude oil in the EU? Clearly not. This budget is not so much if we take into consideration that the economic impact of climate change can suppose expenditures of more than 5% of the GDP every year. There are also figures, unrelated to climate change, that put into perspec- tive the investment needed - proving it is not as high as it seems. For example, the Mobile Apps sector has revenuesEloy Ch\u00e1puli Fern\u00e1ndez Scientific & Technical Management BFS bio fuel systems Tel: +34 966 388 278 echapuli@biopetroleo.comwww.biopetroleo.com 115of more than \u20ac38 bn/year, and \u20ac1.7tn is the annual worldwide budget for military expenditure... spreading peace is worth it, but so is stopping the effects of climate change. The potential of the technology goes beyond the European Union, and does more than just reducing the CO2 emissions coming from crude oil. Here, in figure 3, we can see an ex ample of the worldwide CO2budget (before the non reversible global warming) and the effect of BFS blue technology in a global project. PROFILE Figure 2.

Viscofan BioEngineering is a business unit within the food industry Viscofan (MCE:VIS) which has its headquarters in Spain and an annual turnover of \u20ac800M. Our main operations are located at Viscofan's subsidiary, Naturin Viscofan GmbH in Weinheim, Germany. Our activities are focused on the industrial-scale production of bovine dermal very native collagen type 1, and its further development into products for cell biology and regenerative med- icine. We offer an innovative ultrathinscaffold which consists of intact colla- gen fibrils and builds very stable film structures without the need for fur- ther cross-linking. The suitability and superior performance of these films for cell biological purposes has beenthoroughly assessed in collaborations with a multitude of academic partners in Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the UK for various indications, such as myocardial infarction, age-related macular degeneration, wound care and urethra repair. Of particular rele- vance is our initiative in cardiac repair, where we use allogeneic hADSCs seeded on our collagen membrane totreat ventricular dysfunction fromischemic origin (Arana et al 2013, Arana et al 2014). These studies in rats and G\u00f6ttingen pigs guarantee that our collagen membrane is a very conven- ient substrate for ADSC-based regen- erative medicine approaches.Viscofan committed to co-developing new collagen-based solutions for regenerative medicine with research partners. We will soon be able to offer our collagen products in R&D and CE-certified grade to underpin this development. In an interesting example of corporate entrepreneurship, Viscofan BioEngi- neering is willing to take the lead in promoting the clinical development of collagen-based products bringing ATMPs (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products) or medical devices to proof of concept stage in humans. Viscofan BioEngineering provides a unique opportunity to develop regenerative medicine therapeutic approaches that can be easily trans- ferred to the clinic.

With the cooperation of top quality European researchers and the support of European and National funding institutions, we are willing to contribute to the growth of the regenerative medicine market in the coming years. PROFILE Environment 117Leadership with sustainab ility ethi cs The vision for a sustainable global society requires a core value of ethics. Here, Douglas F Williamson of Earth Charter International outlines their role in promoting sustainable ethics and the training and education oered to achieve this goal... For most people, sustainability or sustainable development tend to mean a focus on how human societies can balance people's needs, environmental protection, and economic health.Sometimes it is framed as \"People, Planet, Prot\". Most often, it is interpreted as a focus on environmental protection and conservation, and what compromises are fair to make between protecting the ecology and ensuring the adequate provision for human needs and desires. The Earth Charter perspective onsustainability is much deeper than that and considers a sustainability paradigm that balances society, the ecology, and the economy as a zero-sum game to be a shallow denition of sustainability. The Earth Charter is a declaration of fundamental ethical values that comprises an emerging consensus vision of a sustainable global society. This vision resulted from a decade-long consultation process in the 1990s that included hundreds of organisationsrepresenting thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of individuals, all major faith and religious groups, including indigenous perspectives, and representatives from all sectors of human societies. No document has ever been drafted with such participation, and the inclusive process of the creation of the Earth Charter is a major basis for its legitimacy as the emerging global vision of a sustainable Earth Community. What makes the Earth Charter vision of sustainability so valuable is its core ethics of respect, care, compassion, and the integral perspective of the interconnected nature of all life on Earth. The view of the Earth Charter is that all life is both interconnected and interdependent, that sustainability comprises not only compromising between ecology, economy, and society, but that it requires a constant attention to ecological integrity,social and economic justice, democracy, non-violence, and peace and that these are all part of the same system. The corruption of an ocial in Asia is just asunsustainable as the clear-cutting of a forest in South America, the shutting o of water in poor North Ameri can cities and the lack of educational opportunity in Africa. Achieving sustainability requires addressingall of these issues. Principle 14 of the Earth Charter states, \"Integrate into formal education and life-long learning the knowledge, values, and skills needed for a sustainable way of life.\" Within this principle are several sub-principles that focus on children and youth, inclusion of the artsand humanities along with science in sustainability education, the role of the media in awareness raising, and the importance of moral and spiritual education. This principle and its sub-principles are a main source of inspiration for what we do at Earth Charter Interna- tional (ECI) and through the Earth Charter Center forEducation for Sustainable Development in Costa Rica. The Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development in Costa RicaFor the past decade, ECI has been actively helping international processes to solidify Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) practices, developing educational materials, and oering training and courses on a variety of topics related to sustainability. A key component of all of the Earth Charter educational programmes is the introduction of sustainabilitylead ership training. One of the most important sustainability leadership attributes is the ability to employ a set of integral and systemic values, such as the Earth Charter. Familiarity with the Earth Charter as a sustainability leadership tool is indispensable as it allows a leader to lter behaviors, choices, and strategic decision makingthrough the high standard set by the Earth Charter. Using the Earth Charter, a sustainability leader willbe able to take both long and short term views, see potential eects both locally and globally, and balance more fairly the multiple aspects and possible impactsof decisions from an interconnected sustainabilityperspective. A good example of sustainability leadership using the Earth Charter is the City of Montpelier, the capital of Vermont, where the leaders used the Earth Charter tocraft the city's 100-year Master Plan 1. ECI has been running youth education programmes, mostly online, for almost a decade. These programmes attempt to unite young leaders from all around the world, and particularly from developing regions. These programmes all have a strong focus on sustainability leadership training. Since 2007, ECI has trained hundreds of young people and provided them with a variety of skills, including sustainability leadership capacities using the Earth Charter. In 2012, ECI opened its training Center in Costa Rica, which operates under a UNESCO Chair for ESD. The Center oers short intensive training programmes, mostly targeting professionals in a variety of elds. In the rst half of 2015, the Center is oering programmes, mostly in English but also some for Spanish speakers, on transformative learning and teaching for educators, on the systems view of lifefor private sector and governmental leaders, and on sustainability communications for emerging leaders,communicators, and CSR professionals. All of these programmes rely heavily on the Earth Charter as anethical framework for sustainability, and all of them seek to augment the sustainability leadership capacity of their participants.

By continuing straight ahead on the current road we will adhere to the behavior of indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels.This behavior will cause CO 2in the Earth's atmosphere to rise to 450 ppm (parts per million) by 2050, which, together with other greenhouse gases like methane, will cause the Earth's average temperature to increase by at least +2\u00b0C compared to its pre-1850 average. Without severe cutbacks in greenhouse gas emissions, by 2100 the CO2will reach 550 ppm and it is estimated that the average tempera- ture will rise by +3\u00b0C compared to its pre-industrial level. These temperature increases are very high, meaning our society, as we know and desire it, will be unsustainable. Essentially, the road we are on ends at a cliff. We are alreadyfar along this road of severe increases and climate change, which will only become worse in the decades to come. \"What do we require for changes to happen? One central need is for leadership. Such leadership cannot be the result of simply occupying a position that exists, but rather is the result of a person who acts with conviction and dedication toward an unselfish goal and on behalf of the common good.\" Over the last 400,000 years the CO2 concentration in the Earth's atmos- phere (as preserved in deep ice cores) has varied between 200 ppm and 275 ppm. At no time during that period has CO2been above 300 ppm. ForA need for leadership 1000 years prior to circa 1850, the Earth's atmospheric CO2averaged narrowly around 275 ppm and the global climate during that time wasrelatively constant. Such stability allowed a flowering of the humancommunity from 0.1 to 1.5 billion people and expansion to virtually all habitable land masses. In the last 150years since 1850 we have grown to a society of over 7.3 billion people and are increasing at about 1 million everyweek. In the next 25 years we will add 2.5 billion more people. At the presenttime, as CO 2shoots past 400 ppm (about 2.0 ppm increase per year), all ice forms on the Earth are melting toadd freshwater to the oceans. This added water, together with the large thermal expansion of water already there, means that humans living in coastal areas (over 100 million within1 meter of sea level) will have to relo- cate to higher elevations, resulting in a massive number of climate refugees to be cared for. They will have to move or else build expensive dikes to keep the water out. Ocean rise is only one calamity that awaits us on this current road. More frequent and intensive storms will occur; food production will be compli- cated by droughts on one hand, or excessive flooding of cropland on the other; the spread of disease will occur more easily; energy requirements will skyrocket causing yet more CO2emis- sions; conflicts between people, both local and international, will become commonplace between people fighting for the necessities of life. The net result of going down this road and over the cliff is an unsustainable society in chaos, one in which our children and their children will suffer much lower standards of living than we hope for them, their lives will be insecure and they will inevitably be forced to deviate from the values that mark a civilized society. We need to take an alternate road, one different from the one paved with deregulated for-profit constant growth with its excessive reliance on burning fossil fuels to meet its insatiable appetite for energy. We have to cut back on our dependence on energy from fossil fuels and this means reducing our consumption of energy. We have to ramp up existing tech- nologies which are based on renew- able energy sources. And we must dothis quickly. Each year we do not act hurls us closer to the cliff. What do we require for changes to happen? One central need is for lead- ership. Such leadership cannot be the result of simply occupying a position that exists, but rather is the result of a person who acts with conviction and dedication toward an unselfish goal and on behalf of the common good. Leadership in climate change requires intelligence and imagination, both of which are necessary for proper vision. A leader must be a visionary, seeing clearly how people can get from point A to point B, and articulating this in terms that are understandable and suitable for the values held by the people being led. A leader is able to explain the \"why\" and the \"how\" of the needed changes and inspires others to work for the stated goal. We know from past examples of lead- ers that they are people who have charisma. We mean by this that the leader has the strength of character, integrity and a deep and obvious ded- ication to do what is right. Like all human activities, however, there will be some people who view the leader as too aggressive in his/her desire for change. We do not need to look very hard for examples like Jesus and Gandhi, who were opposed because they were devoted to making changes certain people could not accept. The response to climate change will not be immune to such potential conflict. The changes needed for our society to turn away from systems and beliefs that have permeated virtually everyBruce R Conard PhD 153 Balsam Drive Oakville Ontario Canada L6J3X4 www.brconard.comaspect of our society will be signifi- cant; there will be groups of people, often powerful and entrenched in the current paradigm, who will be unwill- ing to follow a new road. And that means that the leader of society's response to climate change will have to have courage, and must be able to stand with resolve as others try to tear their vision down. So where are such potential leaders today? I believe they exist in all levels and sectors of our society. They must be encouraged to step forward by thecries they hear from common people. When potential leaders appear, we must quickly evaluate their strengths of character and visions and, if found compelling, support them. Do we really have any other choice? Continuing the way we are headed is unsustainable and is doomed to chaos and extensive human suffering. Changing our path gives us the chance to create a new sustainable way of living. 120PROFILECosmogenic Radionuclides invaluable quantitative tools for Earth's sciences LABORATOIRE NATIONAL DES NUCLEIDES COSMOGENIQUESLABORATOIRE N N C www.cerege.fr The production of cosmogenic radionuclides on Earth result from nuclear reactions initiated by primary and secondary energetic cosmic ray particles which, during their passage through the atmosphere and into the first few meters of the Earth's crust, interact with various atoms of atmospheric gases and surface rocks. They allow quantitatively investigating 1.) superficial deformations, thus permitting the analysis of certain natural hazards such as seismic and gravitational events, 2.) continental paleo-climatology and in particular, the chronology of the most recent deglaciations, 3.) interactions between erosion - tectonics - climate, 4.) processes of development and evolution of continental surfaces, 5.) developments of alteration profiles, and 6.) estimations of denudation rates on the scale of the watershed.Accomplishing this mission requires a bedrock commitment to ensuring that humanity has the resources sustain its journey deep into time. All those on the journey ought to care for the disadvantaged, distant future generations and the global environment now and in the future. It requires the application of the full scope of human knowledge. It is a mission that should resonate with governments worldwide. It is also the mission statement for Three3, a non- profit research organization founded by Dr. Bruce Tonn and two colleagues, Erin Rose, MSSW, and Beth Hawkins, MSLA. The statement also expresses the theme underpinning Tonn's excep- tionally interdisciplinary research, which is essentially driven by twooverarching concerns and an oppor-tunity. To begin, Tonn, along with numerous philosophers and futurists, is concerned with meeting obligations to future generations. It is no small undertaking to embed concerns for future generations into everyday policy making. This is because sustain- ability policies with respect to future generations must embrace time frames that extend way beyond election cycles to hundreds of years and even thousands of millennia. Thus, a funda- mental component of the concept ofsustainability is concern about human survival. In recognition for his contri- butions to futures studies, he is nowan Associate Editor of Futures, an Elsevier journal based in the UK. Tonn's is also concerned about factors that prevent societies and their governments from implementing effective long-term policies to foster equitable sustainable futures. His graduate urban planning education at Harvard and Northwestern Universities impressed upon him the numerous barriers that prevent the achievement of this goal. Tonn's research with respect to this concern addresses institutional barriers and decision- making. At the local level, Tonn and colleagues at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) have worked with many eco- nomically distressed communities in Appalachia to overcome institutional barriers to sustainable developmentMission: Foster Equitable Sustainable Futures 122planning. These proud communities really want to preserve their environ- ments and ways of life but often lack the political leadership. Tonn and his UTK colleagues also recently worked with four major cities in Tennessee to overcome institutional barriers to the installation of rooftop solar (e.g., multiple time consuming and uncoor- dinated approval processes). To help overcome barriers in both contexts, Tonn and the UTK team acted as neutral and technical experts in facili-tating meetings to bring together community residents in one case and local power companies and staff from numerous municipal units in the other to develop sustainable develop- ment plans and work to streamline approval processes, respectively.PROFILE Tonn's sustainability decision-making research follows two paths. One path falls under the rubric of program eval- uation, an activity that can provide important information to policy makers. For the past five years, he has headed up Oak Ridge National Labo- ratory's (ORNL) evaluations of the U.S. Department of Energy's low-income Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). These rigorous and compre- hensive evaluations indicate that the program saves energy, reduces low- income households' energy burdens, and yields a range of significant non- energy benefits (e.g., emissions reduc- tions, improved occupant health).With respect to the evaluation of sus- tainability-related programs, Tonn offers these two observations: 1) policy makers need to value evalua- tion more highly; and 2) evaluations need to move well beyond desk audits of program outputs to go into the field to collect data to actually measure program outcomes. 'Tool development' is a catchall term to describe the second path, which encompasses methods, frameworks, and quantitative approaches needed to assist sustainability policy analysis. This area of research, maybe surpris- ingly, has offered Tonn numerous opportunities for innovation and cre- ativity. With respect to climate change, Tonn is known for his equity-first approach to global carbon emissions and a multi-criteria method developed with a colleague at ORNL to attribute credit to countries for sequestering carbon in hardwood products. He has explored ways to better represent the huge uncertainties that plague long- term policy analyses. He and a UTKcolleague developed a framework to help the Tennessee Valley Authority to strategically think about potential future environmental regulations and one for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to quantify the synergistic benefits accruing from their 40+ efficiency programs. For the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he developed a method to quantify the results of envi- ronmental scanning exercises and an innovative method to estimate the costs of remediating all of the hazardous waste sites in the U.S. Given the lack of progress govern- ments have made in meeting a host of global problems, including climate change, Tonn believes new technology is necessary for achieving long-term sustainability goals. Immersion in Silicon Valley as an undergraduate student in civil engineering at Stanford University and reflections upon the achievements of various tech savvy Stanford alumni, who founded Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo, and Google among many highly suc- cessful and transformative companies, inspires his technological optimism. His experience as a co-chair of a U.S. National Science Foundation panel on the convergence of science, knowledge and technology was quite uplifting. He visited IMEC in Leuven, Belgium, as well as to Korea and China, to meet with science and technology leaders. He was encouraged by the innova- tions shown to him during these trips and by progress being made to reshape research institutions, teams and careers to foster convergence. To further his understanding of con- vergence and long-term sustainableThree3 412 innovative, convergent designs for sustainable communities, industrial ecosystems, national energy systems,and even a judicial system designed to be resilient to environmental catastro- phes. One of the designs, called Willow Pond, which is a scenario of a totally sustainable American subdivision, appeared in a special issue on low- carbon futures of Futures that featured several papers from like-minded EU researchers. Going forward, Tonn and his Three3 colleagues intend to expand their evaluation of the health benefits of low-income weatherization and work with communities around the world on resilience and sustainability issues. With respect to technology, they are interested in designing an integrated system of advanced and extremelyaffordable technologies to promotethe self-sufficiency of low-income homes. Finally, they are working on integrating the concept of unintended consequences into their ethical frameworks related to obligations to future generations. PROFILEThe va lue of time Olivier Lateltin, Head of the Swiss Geological Survey at swisstopo explains how time can impact our ever changing environment... Aquote made by the British statesman and author, Lord Chestereld in the 1700s said - \"I recommend that you take care of the minutes, for the hours will take care of themselves.\" Even in those days, man was occupied with the loss of time. Nowadays, what counts is that which is digital, minimalistic and above all fast. We do not infrequently replace minutes with seconds and measure in thou sands of seconds for example, when it comes to precision in sport or science. Nevertheless, what isthe meaning of fast and what is slow? Scientists have discovered that man does not recognise a millisecond gap between 2 notes as a pause - our detection limit is 3 milliseconds. That is equivalent to the wing beat of a house fly. However, it also functions another way: the existence of time and space started 14 billion years ago. Initially,energy was concentrated in an innitesimally small space, which has in the past been described byastronomers using various terms, in some modelsalso as a single point. Then there was an explosion - the Big Bang - and the universe was born. The cause of this explosion is till today still unknown. There wasneither light nor sound up until the time of this event. The Big Bang, which was indescribably short with its initial phase of 10 -43seconds, evades our powers of imagination. 10-43seconds - that is a span of time which no human being can envisage, not even an astrophysicist. The physicists call this hint of nothingness Planck-time. It is the shortest possibleduration according to our current understanding. Geologists readily look back to the beginning of time. At that time, a period began in which the changes ofthe world lasted millions of years. The age of visible life started 542 million years ago. Hundreds of millions of years is therefore behind this geological evolution. The relatively short daytime and night time cycle divided up the immediate time scale, other changes occurred in an unimaginable time span of millions of years. The Alps are still rising after millions of years - currently at a rate of approximately 1 to 2 millimeters per annum. This is about 10 times slower than the rate at which a tree trunk grows in diameter. Over the span of a million years, the Alps grow assuming a steady growthrate - by 1000 to 2000 meters. At the same time, they are being eroded at a similar rate by wind, water and ice. This would for example equate to a one to two meter thick layer of rock falling from each mountain peak over a period of a 1000 years. Are the hours of the distant past the minutes oftoday? What is a second worth these days? Thatwhich we nowadays accomplish in minutes, often took our forefathers hours to achieve. Today we write letters in a short space of time using a computer andsend them in a fraction of the time by email to the recipient. What happens to the time that we save as a result of this? Lord Chestereld would today advise us to mind our seconds rather than our minutes in keeping with the spirit of modern global ef fort Eective action is required to tackle soil degradation for our food security and sustainable development. Moujahed Achouri, Director of FAO Land and Water Division hosting the Global Soil Partnership sheds light on the eorts being made on an international scale on addressing sustainable soil management... Soils constitute the foundation for healthy food production and thus contribute to food security globally and locally. There is an urgent need to address soils' sustainable management for feeding a growing population that is expected to reach 9.5 billion people by 2050. In response to these challenges, a new body, the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) was put in place in 2012by FAO and its members. It acts as a major vehicle to catalyse eective and concerted actions against soil degradation and promote sustainable soil management as a priority in relation to food security. The mandate of the GSP is to improve governance of the planet's limited soil resources to guarantee healthy and productive soils for a food secure world and boost the provision of other essential ecosystem services, in accordance with the sovereign right of each State over its natural resources. Why the Global Soil Partnership? Soils constitute the foundation for food production and thus contribute to food security locally and globally. Despite the critical role that soil plays in people's lives, there is an alarming increasing degradation of soil resources due to inappropriate management practices. Recent ndings show that one third of our global soils are facing moderate to severe degradation, aecting the productivity of one billion smallholders whose livelihoods depend on natural resources. There is an urgent need for concerted eorts toensure worldwide sustainable soils management, key to food security but also in order to face the challenges of climate change and competing demands over this resource. FAO's \"State of the Land and Water Resources for Food and Agriculture\" (SOLAW, 2012) estimates that on average only a 0.20 ha of arable and productive land will be available per person in 2020 compared to 0.43 ha in 1960. By 2050, only 0.10 ha may be availableif soil degradation is not signicantly reduced. It's exactly why, to address these concerns and respond to these challenges, that in 2012 FAO established the Global Soil Partnership, with the aim to advocate and promote sustainable soil management at all levels. Sustainable Soil Management and GSP The area of productive soil is limited and under increasing pressure from intensication and competing uses to satisfy demands of growing populations for diverse products: from croplands, to forests and pastures/rangeland, from settlement and infrastructure to raw materials. If soils are degraded, they are very dicult and costly to restore or rehabilitate within a human time frame. Therefore, sustainable soil man agement is simply a must. Sustainable use of soils has been dened by the new World Soil Charter as: \"Soil management is sustainable if the supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services provided by soil are maintained or enhanced without signicantly impairing either the soil functions that enable those services or biodiversity\". In this respect, the GSP is designed to raise awareness, contribute to the development of capacities, build on best available science, and facilitate the exchange ofknowledge and technologies among stakeholders for the sustainable management and use of soil resources. While there have been numerous regional and international projects, initiatives and actions in the past, the GSP aims to provide an international governance body to advocate for soils with a unied voice, coordinate soils' related initiatives among partners, and ensure that knowledge and soil's recognition are appropriately represented in the global dialogues and decision making processes. The GSP is organised around 5 main pillars of action: 1. Promote sustainable management of soil resources; 2.

Sustainable manage- ment of soil resources contributes directly and indirectly to all 3 Rio Conventions (UNFCCC, CBD and UNCCD) in terms of sustainable soil management, soil fertility and productivity, soil carbon fluxes, and soil biodiversity. Opportunities to embrace Soils, which have been overlooked for some time, are now under discussion in global agendas and are being given greater attention. The 5th December has been recently declared by the United Nations GeneralAssembly as \"World Soil Day\" (WSD) while 2015 has been designated \"International Year of Soils\" (IYS2015) under the framework of the Global Soil Partnership. There is therefore, real momentum for a collaborative and eective action towards achieving sustainable soilmanagement at country, regional and global levels,thus improving food security. The IYS is to be a major platform for awareness raising. Its key objectives are: To achieve full recognition of the prominent contri- butions of soils to food security, climate changeadaptation and mitigation, essential ecosystemservices, poverty alleviation and sustainable development; To promote eective policies and actions for the sustainable management and protection of soil resources; To sensitise decision-makers about the need for robust investment in sustainable soil management activities, to ensure healthy soils for dierent land users and population groups; To catalyse initiatives in connection with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) process and Post-2015 agenda; To advocate rapid enhancement of capacities and systems for soil information collection and monitoring at all levels (global, regional and national); and nally To create full awareness of all stakeholders about the fundamental roles of soils for human life. Every activity that national governments, international organisations, academic institutions, NGOs, civil society and general public will carry out in connection withthe WSD and IYS will play a role in mobilising the global community to take action towards sustainable soil management. A formal launch event of the IYS will be organised during the 69th session of the UN General Assembly on 5th December 2014 in New Yorkto coincide with the rst ocial and Water Division Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Moujahed.Achouri@fao.orgwww.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership\"Sustainable use of soils has been defined by the new World Soil Charter as: \"Soil management is sustainable if the supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services provided by soil are maintained or enhanced without significantly impairing either the soil functions that enable those services or biodiversity. \"The Experimental Poultry Centre (Proefbedrijf Pluimveehouderij) is the provincial research insti- tute for applied poultry research in Belgium. The Experimental Poultry Centre performs open and neutral research in the same conditions as are used in commercial practice to keep laying hens and broilers. Theoretical knowl- edge is tested and demonstrated under field circumstances. There is a focus on poultry industry's efficiency and economic sustainability next to solutions for public concerns on animal welfare, both for laying hens and broilers. Through direct communication with the poultry farmers, current topics can be investigated to address the present and upcoming questions and needs from the field. The Experimental Poultry Centre has all the necessary facilities for this purpose. We even cooperate with other research centres and poultry farmers. Besides we collaborate with experimental research for the biolog- ical poultry farm. The Experimental Poultry Centre became an internationally respected centre for expertise that works closely with Flemish universities and other important national and international research centres. A team of experienced experts (6 researchers and 10 animal caretakers) can guarantee state-of- the-art practical poultry research. In 2014, the Experimental Poultry Centre has opened its new laying henand broiler houses. The complex now has a capacity for 37,600 broilers and 31,000 laying hens. This investment means the Experimental Centre is ready to play its role in Europe with future-oriented practical research. Manager Johan Zoons says: 'The open- ingof these new stalls means we are ready to play our European role. Wenow have the infrastructure to research parameters which are revo- lutionary for poultry farming. Theseultra-modern houses also enable us to look for answers relevant to today's sector, but also to anticipate future legislation and challenges. Together with new European partners, we hope to raise our research to even higher levels.' The new broiler houses have space for 18,000 extra broilers. This raises the capacity of Experimental PoultryExperimental Poultry Centre 128Centre to 37,600 broilers. The new stall consists of eight completely separate climate sections for 2,250 broilers in each case. Each section has a separate climate regulator, which also registers all climate data. Outdoor air comes in via openings in the house side wall. The air passes first through a condi- tioner zone where it can be heated or cooled. The outgoing air is sucked into two exhaust towers by means of ventilators. These towers have a space where it will be possible in the future to analyse techniques for air purification. PROFILE The new layer house has a capacity of 31,000 laying hens. They are accom- modated in the most modern systems and are subdivided into 12 experi- mental departments: 4 departments with an aviary where the laying hens can move upwards within the system; 4 departments with an aviary where the laying hens can move upwards outside the system;4 departments with furnished cages. Each department has a separate climate control. Part of the incoming air can be heated by a heat exchanger. Outgoing air is sucked away via a central channel to an exhaust tower. This is a computerised system which provides enough fresh air with minimal energy consumption. This makes it possible to recycle the heat, dry fertiliser more efficiently, and research techniques to reduce the emission of Johan Zoons Manager Proefbedrijf Pluimveehouderij vzw Fax: 014 56 28 71 proefbedrijf@provincieantwerpen.be 129fine dust, ammonia, and other harmful substances. Eggs are collected automatically for each experimental group. This means the eggs in the various experimental groups can be compared to each other. They are transported via the central spindle belt to a brand new sorting and packing machine. This machine uses camera-technology to determine the quality of the eggs and it records this information for further analysis. After that, the eggs are sorted automatically and packed by one and the same machine. In 2014 the Exper- imental Poultry Centre opened new sheds for both laying hens and broilers at its location in Geel. The construction and use of the experimental sheds will be completely in line with the new European legislation. The Experimental Poultry Centre invest in a strong dialog with the poultry farmers, in Flanders and abroad. Yearly lectures are given, newsletters and announcements are spread. They are your point of contact for every question about poultry farming. PROFILE Soil is an integral part of our environmental, social and economic systems. It stores carbon, helps maintain the balance of gases in the air, protects water environments from contamination,and provides us with the basis for food and forestry production. Soil also regulates water flow and therefore influences flooding risks, preserves our cultural heritage and supports habitats and biodiversity. Despite these many functions, there is no over-arching Scottish or European legislation in place to protect it. While soils are partly protected through other environmental legislation, (such as emission controls of air pollutants, which help control soil acidication), the importance of soil as a non-renewable resource needs to be more fully recognised by soil policy measures. Soil organic matter is vitally important in terms of soilquality. This is because it increases the ability of soil to hold and supply nutrients and water, enhances soil structure and supports biodiversity. Crucially, organic matter also acts as a signicant carbon store, thus helping to mediate climate change.Scotland's soils are estimated to contain around 3,000 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon (C), of which peatlands contain about 1,600 Mt C. Loss of soil organic carbon in Scotland would therefore increase greenhouse gas emissions and further contribute to global warming. Soil management also impacts on water quality. In the Scotland river basin district, a large number of water- courses have been identied as at risk of not meeting Water Framework Directive requirements due to diffuse pollution from agriculture. Annual losses from agriculture have been estimated to be around 46,000 tonnes of nitrogen, 2,800 tonnes of phosphorus and 774,000 tonnes of soils. In May 2009, the Scottish government announced the rst ever Scottish Soil Framework. Bringing together policy makers, regulators, soil scientists and land managers, the Framework has been formed specically to \"promote the sustainable man agement and protection of soils, consistent with the economic, social and environmental needs of Scotland\". The Scottish Soil Framework acts as an overview for soil protection in Scotland and while it does not set 130 The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) highlights the reason why soil is so crucial to society... Soil matters in ScotlandAgricultureout new policy measures, it does raise awareness of the need to improve policy integration across organi sations. It identies 13 'soil outcomes' to mitigate these risks and lists a wide range of actions which will contribute to achieving them. In Scotland we have a strong track record in soil protection. Research shows our soils are generally in good shape, and this is due largely to the sustainable techniques employed by land managers. However, rising pressures on the land, such as the drive for higher agricultural output; more developments on soil including buildings; and the conversion of sensitive land areas for renewable energy, pose a growing riskto soil quality. Climate change and loss of organic matter have been recognised as the most signicant threats to Scottish soil quality, while other threats such as soil erosion, compaction and loss of biodiversity, may themselves be exacerbated by climate change. The importance of protecting and enhancing Scotland's soils for the future is reinforced by the 2011 State of Scotland's soil report. It highlights the need for policyintegration, the identication of gaps in knowledge and data and the role of environmental monitoring in trying to help ll in some of those gaps. It also describes how soil can be part of the solution to anumber of challenges that the world faces, and describes a range of potential options for sustainable soil use and management. One of the key ndingsof the report is the need for a comprehensive soil monitoring programme in Scotland to provide us with a coherent view of the true condition of www.sepa.org.uk 131 AgricultureThe pig farming industry in Denmark is longstanding with 90% of pork produced exported worldwide. The Danish Agriculture & Food Council provides insight to how Danish pig farming has evolved over the years... Since 1887, farmer ownership of the processing industry has been the bedrock in success of Danish pig production Today Danish pork and bacon is enjoyed the worldover. It is reckoned that Denmark, a comparatively small country with just 5 million inhabitants, producesenough food for a population of 15 million. Over 90% of the pork produced in Denmark today is exported to over 140 dierent countries. Britain has a longstanding association with the Danish food industry and the rst recorded shipment ofDanish Bacon took place in 1847 and, apart from the inevitable interruption of the war years, Danish Bacon has been sizzling away in Britain every year since then. Danish Bacon was one of the rst food products to be advertised on TV when commercial television was launched in Britain during the 1950s, and the famous strapline 'Good bacon has Danish written all over it' entered into advertising folklore.It is recognised that the Danish co-operative model hasbeen the bedrock in the long-term success of Danish agriculture. The rst pig farmers' co-operative was established in Horsens in Jutland in 1887 and it quicklybecame the industry standard, where pig farmers are stakeholders in the production and processing of meat from their animals. Around 90% of pigs produced inDenmark still go to market via the co-operative system and, today, just 2 large co-operative organisations remain - Danish Crown and Tican. For a pig farmer, being a member of a co-operative extends his interest 'beyond the farm gate' and the transparency inherent in the system allows trust to develop between the primary producer and the organisation to which he delivers his pigs. The co-operative ethos in Denmark has also encouraged the common funding of world-class research anddevelopment to make sure that the country's pig farmers remain at the leading edge of global competition. Agriculture 132Farmer own ershi p bey ond the farm gateAgriculture The closer links between the farmer and his market- place means that Danish farmers are well placed torespond to new customer and consumer demands. New quality initiatives can be easily assimilated rapidly across the whole industry, once it has beendecided that these are necessary. Good examples are the Danish industry programmes to control zoonoticbacteria, such as salmonella, and the many practical steps taken in recent years to eliminate unnecessary use of antibiotic medicines in pig production, as public concerns about the spread of antibiotic resistance have emerged. In both areas, Danish farmers have provided a template that other countries now seekto follow. The Danish co-operative system operates comprehensive documentation throughout the production chain and is well placed to meet current requirements for more robust standards of traceability. The vast majority offarmers in Denmark deliver nished pigs to their local co-operative slaughterhouse on a weekly basis. Concerns about the welfare of livestock have grown signicantly in recent years, and the Danish pig industry has given priority to maintaining the high health status of its pig herd in order to produce thriving animals in systems, which deliver good welfare standards. All Danish pigs are produced within independently monitored assurance schemes, requiring a monthlyvisit by the local veterinarian. The Danish authorities also run an annual programme of 'unannounced' visits to ensure compliance with all welfare legislation. The Danish industry runs a huge programme of farm- based research and development, which has a major focus on improving many aspects of the welfare of pigs reared in indoor systems. A good example isthe testing of new systems for freedom farrowing. Traditional farrowing pens restricted the movement of sows during the period of lactation, but signicantly reduced the risk of the sows crushing her young. The aim of the Danish research is to develop practicable systems, which allow the sows total freedom of move- ment without compromising the welfare of her piglets.All livestock producers are facing increased pressuresto limit the environmental impact of their production. The Danish pig industry has been subject to some of the strictest environmental legislation in Europe since the mid-1980s. These rules have included rigid limitson the number of animals that may be kept in relation to the land available for the spreading of manures, as well as detailed rules on its storage and application in the elds. \"Concerns about the welfare of livestock have grown significantly in recent years, and the Danish pig industry has given major priority to maintaining the high health status of its pig herd in order to produce thriving animals in systems, which deliver good welfare standards. \" The Danish pig farmers can document signicant improvements in achieving more sustainable production. They produce a kilogram of pork today with approxi- mately half the environmental impact as that of 1985. Danish farmers lead the way in the application of new eco-ecient technologies to reduce the environmental impact of modern pig production and are committed to targets for further reduction in the years ahead. As for the future, the Danes are condent about their bacon and pork industry. A shared commitment toachieve the highest standards 'across the board', founded on the Danish cooperative model, will continue to be at the heart of the Danish Council Tel: +45 33 39 40 00 info@lf.dkwww.lf.dk 133 Old but still up front Dalum Landbrugsskole - Dalum Academy of Agricultural Business Denmark - is Denmark's largest and oldest agricultural college - today a modern international college for further agricultural education with proud traditions and a historical atmosphere. 20% of Danish Ag-production is performed abroad For more than 150 years vocational skills have been rooted in the Danish folk high school movement educatingfarmers for the future. The College situated in Odense, the heart of Denmark, provides all levels of Agricultural -management education. The fact that 20% of all agriculturalproduction performed by Danish farmers and staff takes place abroad, calls for a strong international profile. It is likely that students, through study trips and international projects,become more confident working abroad and seeking management positions around the world for an Agricultural /Ag- business career. Throughout the past 4-5 decades agriculture has developed consider- ably, constructing highly efficient,large scale production units based on excellent breeding material and technology, but also causing increasing impact to the environment. Exporting experience and knowledge The valuable knowledge and experi-ence gained, has today become an export article in great demand from all over the world, expressed as a need for: Advanced technology Animal welfare systems Food safety systems Traceability certification Sustainability in all productions Environmental considerations Farm waste management and technology. Exporting Danish agricultural skills and turn-key solutions Reputable Danish Agricultural College in potential and innovating partnership Exporting Danish Agricultural Education & total solutions 134Dalum has developed its international profile through a broad global network of farm enterprises, colleges, politicians and organisations. Dalum has helped develop vocational training systems in the Baltics and Eastern Europe. The Danish \"Sandwich Model\" alternating school education and farm apprentice, building up production and management skills gradually, has been transferred successfully to many countries. Asian and African students Throughout the year students from China, Korea, Japan, Nepal etc. interact with Danish and African students creating new and prosperous collabo- rations across borders and languages. Lately Dalum, being a semi-public Vocational College, has joined forces with private enterprises promoting the \"DANISH FARM CONCEPT\". International customers, governments and agricultural organisations are looking for turnkey solutions providing \"All you need\" to investors, including the education, follow up, mentoring, audits and progression set up through initial target settings and contracts. Exporting valuable genetics, advanced technology, ventilation, storage, handling- and feeding systems as well as waste management calls for thorough and targeted education for the investment to be profitable. PROFILE The KZN-model Currently a group of South African students from Kwa Zulu Natal province are taking part in a 10 month management program including 10 weeks on farms, exchanging valuable production and management tips from experienced Danish farmers. The college hope that merging the best from both cultures, these students will be able to generate higher agricultural production and jobs inprimary and secondary food chains on their return. The ideal scenario could be a future pork or dairy production set up by ayoung South African farmer partnering with a senior Danish agricultural student and Danish/international investor. The Dalum College serves as a reach back and extension facility ensuring that the achieved knowledge, the genetics and technology brought back home will be used for asustainable and environment-friendly production. So far the initiative and export concept has gained a lot of political attention from countries like China and other South African provinces.The Danish and South African Ministers of Agriculture recently praised the model, at a seminar inNiels Erik Jespersen International Relations Officer Eric C O Wanscher Vice President Dalum Landbrugsskole - Dalum 135Pretoria SA, as \"an example to be followed\", and support the program by governmental funding. Model farm Dalum Vice-president Mr Eric Wanscher is strengthening the international profile through the new partnership. Bringing international students to Denmark for inspiration and education is a valuable experience to be brought back, but it should never be left as the only initiative, he points out. It is absolutely necessary that this transfer of knowledge is used and maintained through cooperation with partner schools or by establishing model farms in collaboration with local organisations supporting these initiatives. As the demand for food, sustainability and food safety grows, Dalum will continue exploring new opportunities around the world to share knowledge and know-how - but will always be founded in Denmark gaining experience from the world's best agricultural businesses and productions. PROFILE The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition (KIAP&N) of the Polish Academy of Sciences is one of the leading research centers, whose mission is to conduct fundamental and applied research in the fields of farm animal nutrition and physiology. Pigs and ruminants, as well as poultry and lab- oratory animals are the main subjects of interest. Studies are carried out by a staff that includes 9 professors and 25 researchers with doctoral and doctor habilitated degrees, working in five departments and two interde- partmental laboratories. The studies related to animal nutrition encompass both physiological funda- mentals and elements of feed science. Their objective is to determine the nutritional requirements of animals, which change as the result of genetic improvement and consumer expecta- tions as to the health-promoting qualities of animal products. To reach these goals it is necessary to under- stand the metabolism of particular nutrients in the digestive tracts of animals, including the involvement of microorganisms colonizing its various sections, and the role of these nutri-ents in the metabolism of the animal itself. As the digestive tract is formed at an early age, the influence of various feed components on its development and functions is investigated, including the quality and quantity of protein, fiber and biologically active supplements. A well-developed stream of researchconcerns modifying diets in order toobtain a functional product with health-promoting characteristics. This applies to supplementation of dietswith vegetable and/or fish oil, as well as antioxidants protecting against oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. The final meat product is to have a balanced omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids ratio and a high nutritional value, thus playing a role in prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is also important that these health parameters could be maintained after food process- ing, since numerous treatments may reduce the health promoting traits. An important social problem is the lack of acceptance for using feed containing genetically modified crops (GMO) for livestock. The resultsobtained at the KIAP&N showed thesafety of GMO materials used inAnimal nutrition in the company of physiology 136animal feeding, however it is possible to partially replace them with non-GMO legumes which meet expectations of substantial group of consumers. If we do not want humans to consume GMOs directly, the discussion on GMOs must include their favorablerole in animal nutrition. The main research areas on animal physiology are those related to themechanisms regulating growth, mat-uration, and reproduction of animals, as well as the development of the structure and function of the digestive tract. The topics of studies include the activity of neural tracts at the central nervous system level and secretory activity of the pituitary gland and other endocrine tissues pancreas) in various physiological states.PROFILE The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition (KIAP&N) in Jablonna administrative and laboratory buildingThe KIAP&N is a recognised entity in the study on the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary neuroendocrine axes of sheep and rats. Much attention is being paid to envi- ronmental factors, especially those that disrupt the normal functioning of organism (nutritional deficit, stress, inflammation). Biologically active sub- stances that are ingested with feeds and interact with endogenous regula- tory compounds are also an important research topic. Modern research techniques, especially from the field of molecular biology and confocalmicroscopy make it possible to study cellular signalling pathways and the genes activated by them. Detailed knowledge about regulatory mecha-nisms may enable better control over important life functions and may alsohave a bearing on human physiologyand be of value in the treatment of diseases stemming from the disordering of these mechanisms.

The ventilation company Munters and the Danish Research Center for Pig Production have shown how optimal regulation with partial air cleaning instead of 100% air cleaning will create and maintain jobs in the live- stock industry. In a world-first, Munters has developed a relatively maintenance-free air cleaner for both poultry and swine. Many companies have solutions for pigs,however no companies have a relative maintenance-free solution for poultry. Normally, the greasy dust in a poultry facility can block the filters in the air cleaners. However, Munters has developed an air cleaner without filters. Once exhausted air from the poultry or pig house has passed through the air cleaner, the ammonia concentration is reduced by 80-90%. Partial air cleaning It is not necessary to clean all the air from a poultry house. In colder climates you will still get a huge ammonia reduction, even if you just clean part of the exhausted air. But what exactly is partial air cleaning and why do we get a huge reduction when we only clean a part of the air? Well, as previously stated - only a portion of the exhausted air is cleaned during partial cleaning. This means, when it is cold outside all air from the house is exhausted through the aircleaner, but as the outside tempera- ture gets warmer and the animals get bigger the fan in the air cleaner does not have sufficient capacity to maintain the desired temperature in the room, then the other fans in the house will start to run. Let's take a layer house in northern Europe as an example. If the desired room temperature inside a house is 21\u00baC and the total ventilation capacity is 10m3/h per bird, the ventilation will be running under 20% of full ventila- tion capacity for 40% of the yearly running time (see figure). This means that if you install an air cleaner to this house, which cleans the first 20% of the exhausted air, all air in the build- ing will pass through the air cleaner for 40% of the yearly running time. More for less For farmers it is not economically viable to clean 100% of the air. Both the installation and running cost willbe high. If the requirements to meet production get unrealistic the produc- tion of meat will move to areas in the world with less restrictions, therefore costing jobs in Europe, not to mentionthe fact that the green technology will not be used.

Ammonia reduction Let's again take the example from north Europe. Passing the first 20% of exhaust air from the layer house through the air cleaner with a cleaning efficiency of 80%, around 58% of the total amount of nitrogen that is normally discharged through the chimney is collected. For example, if the annual ammonia emission from the chimney is 3560kg from 13,000 birds, the air cleaner can thus collect 2060kg of ammonia.

Farmers and an impressive array of agri food-chain actors provide us with a plentiful supply of safe, healthy and aordable food. European consumers, who are accustomed to this ready and steady availability of food are often unaware of the global challenges facing agriculture. Agriculture has to produce more raw materials tosat isfy the increasing and diversifying demands of a growing world population, which is expected to grow by more than a third (around 2.3 billion people) between 2009 and 2050; these gures are often repeated, and for good reason - the challenge they present to global food production is enormous. Projections show that feeding a world population of 9.1 billion people in 2050 will require raising overall food production by some 70% between 2005 and 2050. Our demands on agriculture don't stop at production, the sector must also contribute to economic prosperity and the social wellbeing of rural areas, and help preserve natural resources such as land, water and biodiversity - in the face of pressures from urbanexpansion, industrialisation and a changing climate. There is also a pressing need to protect and restore the quality of existing farmland. Highly productive and resource ecient agriculture mitigates the problems associated with all of thesechallenges, because it enables us to have more of everything - more crops, and more biodiversity and natural habitats. Protect habitats, conserve biodiversity Agriculture is a major contributor to land use change, which often implies the destruction of natural habitats -the single most important driver of biodiversity loss.By protecting crops from pests and disease, farmerscan optimise yields on the existing agricultural land base, make ecient use of resources (inc. fuel, time, and capital) and prevent the loss of natural habitat that occurs when agricultural land expands to compensate for crop losses. Without crop protection, losses for certain crops can exceed 80% of potential yield, and low input farming - as typied by organic agriculture - is estimated as averaging up to 34% lower yields than productive agriculture within the EU. If we wish to maintain and improve yields and make ecient use of natural resources, the use of plant protection products must continue; there are currently no viable alternatives to pesticide use in either conventional or organic farming. Ecient production technologies are imperative to allow us to close yield gaps; however, society must use these technologies in an appropriate way to ensure that agriculture plays a central role in delivering sustainable solutions. No unacceptable aects on the environment Pesticides are formulated to protect crops by discouraging, confusing, altering the behaviour, or killing target pests, diseases and pathogens. When we consider biodiversity protection, this raises questions about the impact on non-target species that may be unintentionally exposed to pesticides. Modern pesticides are characterised by their high ecacy and targeted modes of action; the biologically active characteristics of pesticides that pose risk to non-target species are acknowledged and accommo- dated in European pesticide regulations. Pesticides are one of the most regulated product classes on theAgriculture 140European market, and the real drivers of the large- scale loss of biodiversity (including land use change) are not subject to regulation as rigorous as thatapplied to pesticides. Science, research and development have given us sophisticated crop protection solutions. While their use is certainly not without risk, a sensible, risk-based approach to EU legislation ensures farmers haveaccess to products that when used correctly have no unacceptable eects on their health or the environment. This same stringent legislation allows European consumers a high degree of condence in the safety,availability and aordability of their food. Supporting Best Management Practices for productivity and biodiversity protection Our industry is committed to providing sustainable crop protection solutions; we believe that for agriculture tobe sustainable, it must be ecient, productive andcontribute to a resilient natural environment. We are acutely aware of society's demand that crops bepro duced with minimal environmental impact - and we know that this can only be achieved if farmers have access to appropriate tools and knowledge ofbest management practices. The European crop protection industry is not directly engaged in the management of agricultural land, but industry led stewardship initiatives and outreach tokey stakeholders see expertise in crop protection, risk management and biodiversity conservation come together to promote guidance on practices benecial to both harvests and biodiversity. Maintaining Europe's position as a world leader in agriculture As society embraces the challenge of sustainable agriculture, there is growing consensus on the need to combine high agricultural productivity with well considered environmental protection; however, Europe's full potential will only be realised with ambi tious science-based policy and political support for innovation. The combined challenges of agricultural production and biodiversity protection require that we exploit proven technologies whilst continuing to invest in the research and development of solutions for tomorrow. Strong public support for biodiversity protection, a knowledgeable and passionate community of famers, and the engaged expertise of industry can be combined to make the rural environmental more biodiversityfriendly and more productive. We are always working to make things better; and believe that solution-oriented dialogue with farmers, public, and policy makers, is critical for a sustainable productive future and maintaining Europe's position as a world leader gavin.whitmore@ecpa.eu www.ecpa.eu 141 AgricultureWhy is Corn Yield so Important? The key to feeding a growing world with less demand on scare resources and lower environmental impacts lies in increasing yield. Research has shown that increasing corn yield results in better efficiencies in nutrient and water use thanks to the fact that corn plants that yieldmore also have bigger root systems and more effective leaf area. The challenge for corn producers is to findmanagement practices that allow them to maximize yieldgiven the soil and environmental constraints they are operating with. Among the many management options that corn producers have what practices will provide thebest return on investment in terms of increasing yield with the lowest cost and risk. This publication discusses some of the key principles and practices corn growers should consider when seeking to increase yield in corn. It is All About Intercepting Light At the most basic level corn is a starch factory that depends in turning light energy into starch. Therefore themost critical practice in managing for higher yield is maximizing light interception. There are three management practices that can be used to increase light interception. These are growing longer season hybrids, increasing seeding rate and plant population, and decreasing row spacing. Of these three the most effective practice is increasing seeding rate and plant population. While growing hybrids that require a longer growing period increases the amount of light intercepted it also increases water requirements and does not improve root mass or leaf efficiency. Using narrow rows only increases light interception for a short period of time. In contrast high plant populations increase light interception across the entire growing period, result in improved efficiency in light interception, and along with other key management practices increase root mass in the field. Figure 1 shows the impact of increasing plant density on the morphology of corn plants. As plant population increases the cornplant grows taller resulting in more effective placement of leaf area to intercept sunlight. This results in optimum yield potential. However, there is a limit to this response. As plant density increases so does the need for water and nutrients. When the demand for water and nutrients exceeds the ability of the environment to provide these to the plant the corn plant responds by reducing its height and yield potential is reduced. Note that in Figure 1 there is a narrow range of plant densities over which the plant reaches maximum height and productivity. Corn producers must precisely match plant population to the environment of the field. Supporting Plant Density with the Right Management Practices As is apparent in Figure 1 planting at a higher seeding rate is not the only step producers should use to achieve higher yield. Higher plant densities result in individual plants that have smaller root systems and thinner stalks.THE EVOLUTION OF YIELD IN CORN Dr. Ronnie Heiniger North Carolina State University Figure 1. Change in plant density from 29,343 plants ha-1 on the left to 107,593 plants ha-1 on the right.These negative effects must be compensated for. There are two key practices that must be used in a systems approach along with higher seeding rates to make higher corn yield possible. These two key practices are starter fertilizer and multiple applications of nitrogen. The root is the first plant part to be developed in the growth cycle of the corn plant. The faster the corn plant growers from germination to flowering the more root mass will be produced. Since the root system is the key to better nutrient and water use efficiency this is a critical component of a high yield corn plant. Starter fertilizer which contains small amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus increases the early growth of the corn plant (Figure 2). Research shows that increasing early growth by using starter fertilizer results in a plant with more root mass and thicker stalks overcoming the negative effects of higher plant populations. Likewise, a corn plant depends on nitrogen to maintain leaf chlorophyll levels and efficient conversion of light into starch. Unfortunately, most growers only apply nitrogen at the beginning of the season or, at most, twice at planting and again at canopy closure. Since nitrogen is mobile in the soil and subject to loss these applications often don\u00edt cover the full season nitrogen demands of the plant (Figure 3). Growers often apply more nitrogen than the plant actually needs to cover the fact that some nitrogen will be lost by the time the plant reaches the reproductive stages. A better system for producing high yield corn is to apply small Oamounts of nitrogen throughout the season. This approach allows growers to just meet the needs of the plant at a given time resultingin little or no waste while ensuring optimum growth andyield. Furthermore, nitrogen rates can be adjusted as the growing season progress to match changes in weather (particularly rainfall) resulting in maximum nitrogen use efficiency. In Summary - A High Yield Corn System Capturing more light while increasing root mass and lightuse efficiency requires a systems approach to corn production. The future of high-yield corn production lies in precisely matching plant population with the environment of the field and then supporting that population with starter fertilizer and regular feeding with small amounts of nitrogen. This approach has thepotential to increase yield resulting in less demand on land resources. Research at the Vernon G. James Research and Extension Center at North Carolina State University over the past three years documents that this systems approach consistently produced maximum corn yield ranging from 21.1 to 23.7 mt ha -1. Only by using a systems approach can growers increase water and nutrient use efficiency in corn production resulting inbetter utilization of scarce resources and improving the amount of carbon fixed in a corn field resulting in less climate impacts.

Extreme weather events cause severe damage. Examples are hurricane Sandy, windstorm Xynthia, and, more recently, the floods in south ern England. Insurance companies need to reserve a sucient amount of money to cover claims following an extreme weather event. Estimates of expected losses are determined by the tail width of the probability distribution describing the likelihood of extremes. Hence, computing accurate estimates of the tail width is an important challenge. Mathematical modelling oers a fruitful approach towards an understanding of meteo-climatic extremes. Models for the atmospheric and oceanic circulation are typically derived from rst principles, such as Newton's laws, conservation of energy, global balances, etc. This approach leads to a set of equations describing the temporal evolution of quantities like pressure,temperature, and wind speed. Often these equations can only be solved numerically using high performance computers. Subsequently the output of the modelcan be studied using statistical techniques. The so-called Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution describes the distribution of the large values observed in a time series. The GEV distribution is a universal model for the statistics of extremes inthe sense that the underlying distribution of the datais irrelevant. Using the GEV one can compute the probability of the occurrence of future large values of a quantity, given a sample of past measurements. For that purpose, one must rst estimate the parameters of the distribution. Of particular importance is the so-called tail index because it determines the tailwidth of the distribution and therefore the frequencyand intensity of extreme events. Estimates for the tail index are often obtained by the so-called block maximum method. In this method onedivides a time series, either obtained from data or numerical simulations, in suciently long blocks. Underthe assumption that the block maxima form a random sample drawn from a GEV distribution the parameters can be estimated using standard statistical methods. Itis an open question how much data is needed in order to obtain an accurate estimate. Research has shown that already for very simple models the computation of the tail index requires prohibitively long time series. If this is also the case for state of the art climate models, then quantifying the extreme behaviour in such models might be a serious problem. Future research could be aimed at developing novel techniques for estimating the tail index that do not rely on computing long time series. The rst preliminary,but promising, results in this direction have already been obtained. The challenge is to extend their applicability to more complicated models eventually also including state of the art climate Dynamical Systems Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Groningen Tel: +31 50 363 3959h.w.broer@rug.nlwww.math.rug.nl/dsmp/People/HenkBroer Dr Alef E SterkAssistant Professor Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Groningen Tel: +31 50 363 3975a.e.sterk@rug.nlwww.math.rug.nl/dsmp/People/AlefSterkIceland: their road to a low-carb on future Climate change is one of humankind's greatest challenges in the coming decades and beyond. Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson, Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources in Iceland highlights how the country is working towards combating it... We are already seeing many changes in the natural environment caused by global warming. The latest IPCC assessment gives little comfort to those who hope that we may see global warming halting soon. We will have to adapt to the changes ahead, and we must try to halt the rate of change. The world is looking towards a new climate change agreement in Paris in 2015 to guide us in this. How can we halt human-induced climate change? First and foremost by reducing the use of fossil fuels - and replace them with clean and renewable energy, because global demand for energy is not going down. A second priority is to halt deforestation and soil erosion, and reclaim vegetation where this is possible. Iceland is making progress on both these fronts, and we think we have a story to tell and expertise to share. Almost all stationary energy - for electricity and heat ing - in Iceland comes from renewable sources, hydro and geothermal. This is mostly due to ampleresources of renewable energy, but the government has also made it a priority to nd ways to locate and utilise geothermal energy in rural areas in Iceland. This has resulted in the development of great expertise in this eld; in science, engineering and util isation of geothermal. Globally, Iceland is now amongst the leading contributors of expertise on geothermal energy. The United Nations University Geothermal Training Program has for over 3 decades strengthened geothermal development capacity in more than 40 countries. Iceland's most recent initiative in this eld is an Open Compact with the World Bank, which aims to enhanceArctic Environment 146Arctic Environment geothermal development in East Africa, along the Great African Rift Valley. There is much less focus on geothermal than for example wind and solar energy in the global discussion on clean and renewable energy. Indeed, accessible geothermal resources are not found everywhere. There is, however, huge potential globally, and the technology is tried and tested. Untapped geothermal capacity can benet hundreds of millions of people around the world, much of it in the world's energy poorest regions. Another area where Iceland has expertise to share is in the eld of land restoration. Iceland's volcanic soil is very prone to erosion, and deforestation triggered a large-scale land erosion problem after settlement some 1100 years ago. Ocial government bodies have been ghting and reversing soil erosion and conducting reaorestation for over a century, with considerable success. A new United Nations University Land Restoration Training Programme in Iceland shares that expertise with trainees from developing countries. Aorestation and revegetation are important parts of Iceland's climate mitigation programme. Iceland has also brought the issue of wetlands to the global climate negotiations. Draining of peat-rich wet- lands results in carbon emissions to the atmosphere,and reclaiming such wetlands reverses this process. Iceland is now formulating an initiative to reclaim wetlands in Iceland, which will benet both the climate and biodiversity. Iceland is at the edge of the Arctic, and feels the impact of climate change in the northernmost regions of the world. We can even see the eects, as our glaciers are retreating. Other eects are less visible, but perhaps more profound. Ocean acidication is of great concern for Iceland. We still know too little about the likely impacts of acidication on marine life, but there are clear reasons to worry. There is no known remedy for ocean acidication except to limit carbon emissions. The sea ice north of Iceland, and in the Arctic as a whole, is also retreating. This is a worrying trend, but also a development we must adapt to. Shipping is increasing in the Arctic, and it is possible that we will see an opening of shipping lanes for large-scale trans port at some point in the coming decades. We must prepare for such possibilities. The risk of accidents and oil-spills must be addressed, as well as other threats to the fragile ecosystems of the Arctic. Iceland is an active participant in the Arctic Council and works with other countries in the region to prepare for changes ahead, and to minimise adverse impacts of increased economic activity. Iceland's greenhouse gas emissions are only 0,01%of global emissions. Even if Iceland would cease its emissions altogether tomorrow it would matter little in the global context. Iceland can, however, have an impact by championing climate-friendly technologies where it has expertise, like in geothermal energy and land restoration. Iceland will of course shoulder its responsibility in the UN Climate Convention, in the Paris conference in 2015 and beyond. We will continue on our road towards a low-carbon future, and seek for practical ways to reach that goal soon, by learning from others and by sharing our the Environment and Natural Resources in Iceland Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources www.environment.is 147 Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson Minister for the Environment and Natural ResourcesThe UNU-FTP was established in Iceland in 1998 and is managed as a collaborative effort among research institutes and universities in Iceland. Through its training activities, the UNU-FTP works to enhance institutional and individual capacity in developing countries to achievetheir developmental goals in fisheries and use living aquatic resources in a sustainable way. The UNU-FTP aims to serve as a global competencycenter for applied, post-graduate level academic training which addresses real-world challenges in fisheries development. The six month training, as described here: www.unuftp.is/en/programme-structur e, is an opportunity for practicing pro- fessionals from developing countries to gain a global understanding offish eries and work toward solving pressing issues from home. Among the largest challenges in fish- eries in less developed countries are significant post-harvest losses. These can be direct losses due to birds, rodents and insects, but more impor- tant are nutritional and economic losses attributable to poor fish handling and preservation practices. Some estimates are as high as 30% of the potential value of fisheries is lost post-harvest. Fish is critical for nutritional security and livelihoods in many impoverished nations. FAO estimates that fish con- stitutes roughly 20% of the animal protein consumed in developingcountries. The proportion is even higher in LIFDCs, where an estimated 25% of animal protein comes from fish. Sustainable fisheries development is a path to improve the livelihoods and incomes of poor communities. It is estimated that roughly 10% of the global population depends to a largeextent on fisheries and aquaculture for its livelihood. Beyond protein, fish provides vital micronutrients such as iron, Omega 3 fatty acids, and vitamin A. Micronutri- ent deficiencies and malnutrition are particularly devastating for pregnant women and young children as it may compromise their ability to develop totheir full mental and physical poten- tial. The societal costs of illnessesUnited Nations University Fisheries Training Programme Institutional Capacity Building in Fisheries 148associated with micronutrient defi- ciency are high, and in recent years, international agencies like the FAO have emphasised food-based solu- tions, including fish. Given the urgent need to improve nutritional security, food safety and develop export earnings in developing countries, the Quality Management in Fish Handling and Processing line of specialisation offered through the UNU-FTP has run every year since the programme began in 1998. This work is undertaken in cooperation with the Mat\u00eds Food and Biotechnology Research laboratory in Iceland. A total of 96 fellows from 30 countrieshave undertaken specialist studiesPROFILE Poor handling and preservation of fish can lead to food borne illnesses and diminish nutritional benefits usually gained from eating fish. Seen here are women drying small pelagic fish in the sand of the beaches of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Post-harvest losses are high and the fish contaminated by dirt and fecal bacteria. relating to quality management in fish handling and processing. These fellows have produced a variety of individual research projects. As build- ing access to export markets is an important part of fisheries develop-ment strategies in many countries, it is common for fellows to carry out research related to fisheries inspec- tion with a focus on pathways to meet standards for high value export markets like the EU, US, and Japan. Increasingly,fellows choose to research safety, improved handling technologies and value addition potential. Through its scholarship programme for former fellows, the UNU-FTP aims to developresearch capacity in our partner countries. To date, the UNU-FTP hasfunded five Master's and six PhD studies in the area of food science. The UNU-FTP has together with partners in developing countries andinternational partners developed and delivered a large number of short courses in partner countries. Though the UNU-FTP is primarily financed through the Icelandic ODA budget, many activities are co-financed by others. The UNU-FTP has conducted eight courses on topics of quality management in fish handling and processing and inspection in five partner countries, training more than 260 people.

Elisabeth Aspaker, Minister of Fisheries in Norway explains how the nation is contributing to this... Norway is a country with a small population, located in the far northern corner of Europe. However, the ocean area of Norway is vast, more than 6 times the land area and in terms of living marine resources Norway is one of the most productive countries in the world. Norway has a long tradition for harvesting from our seas and oceans, and over the last 40 years we have also developed a successful aquaculture industry and a high level of expertise within the marine sector and biotechnology. The oceans role in food security The oceans cover 70% of the earth's surface, and will become increasingly more important in food production. According to a United Nations report,the current world population of about 7.3 billion is projected to reach 8.1 billion in 2025, and 9.6 billion in 2050, with most of the population growth occurring in developing regions. Ensuring adequate food and nutrition security to this growing population is adaunting challenge. The oceans can play an important role in global food security. This was highlighted in the UN Declaration\"The Future We Want\" in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The term food security has been dened as \"when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sucient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences foran active and healthy life\" (FAO 2014). The sheriesArctic Environment 150Arctic Environment and aquaculture sector already plays a prominent role in global food security, and oers a valuable and nutritious contribution to diversied and healthy diets. The oceans are an important source for food production, and coastal regions already account for 40% of the gross domestic productions of Europe, but a sustainable use of ocean resources will only be successful if conducted within a framework of international coop eration. \"The oceans can play an important role in global food security. This was highlightedin the UN Declaration \"The Future WeWant\" in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.\" The challenges are also substantial. The environmental status of our oceans, climate change, ecosystem man agement, and sustainability are some of the challenges that need to be addressed. Improving the understanding of causes and eects in these systems is so demanding that they call for concerted eorts. New blue growth in Europe Norway is part of the internal market through the European Economic Area agreement, and we havebeen involved in the development of the maritime policy of the European Union. EUs integrated marineand maritime policies put wealth creation from the seas and oceans at its heart, whilst at the same time addressing challenges caused by pollution, over exploitation and climate change. European governments and institutions must contribute by providing the necessary regulatory framework as well as the funding for projects. In Norway we are considering to develop a new centrefor maritime research and education - Ocean Space Centre. The project will support the objectives of Hori zon 2020 and increase the volume and quality of RDI in ocean space technology in Europe. The EU's new programme Horizon2020 facilitates international marine and maritime research. Norway supports and partakes in this new research programme. The Norwegian government has decided that Norway will take an active role in the joint programming initiative on \"Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans\". The great potential of our oceans require great responsibility, and the management of our seas and oceans needs to be based on sound science and international cooperation. The oceans have potential for producing more food and other products from renewable resource, but I think the future holds promises for an increased blue growth and we must harvest the of Industry, Trade and Fisheries - Norway www.regjeringen.no/ 151Super Chilling is a fish processing technique developed by the Icelandic pioneers of Skaginn. Tests have confirmed that by using the Super Chilling technique the shelf life of products can be up to doubled. An environmentally friendly solution, Skaginn's mission is also to minimise, even eliminate, the use of ice for cool- ing. Currently undergoing a patenting process, the revolutionary technique has already thrust Skaginn into the limelight as one of the seafood indus-try's brightest innovators of the modern era. The quality challenge The quality of seafood caught in the pristine waters around Iceland has been well documented for decades. Adequate on board chilling methods immediately after catch - the impor- tance of which has been outlined by various Icelandic scientists and their counterparts the world over - is now a pivotal element in the catching process. Through the Super Chilling technique the initial quality loss, mainly explained by autolytic changes, is significantly slowed down. While temperature mapping of chilled supply chains has underlined the importance of thermal protection of packaging during transport and storage, especially in air transporta- tion chains, a rising demand for fresh seafood products has presented local seafood processing companies with a challenge. The sheer distance from Iceland to its most important markets presents a major logistical hurdle. Acknowledging the importance of the initial cooling process at sea in maintaining product quality, this was a challenge eagerly embraced by Skaginn's team of specialists. The result is the company's Super Chillingtechnique that is now taking the seafood industry by storm. Added product value Driven by the ingenuity and innova- tional vision of its co-founder and now pioneer CEO, Skaginn's Super Chilling solutions offer a range of benefits.Through highly automated features, Super Chilling increases yield, preserves quality and adds to product value. The efficient processing - now with a revolutionary high speed, gentle handling, quality controlled weighingand packing system - eliminates allunnecessary product transport.Super Chilling is forward thinking A revolutionary technique by Icelandic pioneers of Skaginn welcomed by the seafood industry 152Reduced carbon footprint Skaginn's Super Chilling technique makes a significant contribution to product quality and shelf life. As a consequence, the rigor process onboard is slowed down resulting in firmer flesh. By using the Super Chilling technique, the desired temperature of -1\u00b0C is reached in just one hour, whereas chilling down to 0\u00b0C by traditional cooling methods with ice can take up to 48 hours. Moreover, the technique reduces carbon footprint through various benficial factors. With the Super Chilling technique on board, vessels do not need to store ice for cooling. A lighter vessel subsequently saves fuel. The technique also means fishing ves- sels can extend their stay at sea up to 72 hours and double their catch. Fewer trips to the fishing grounds contribute to a significant reduction inPROFILE the use of fuel while optimising the investment in the vessel and theequipment on board. The Super Chilling technique Through a patented technology, theSuper Chilling technique on land involves superchilling the skin side offillets through a freezer tunnel on a Teflon coated aluminium conveyor belt at a temperature of approximately -8\u00b0C and simultaneously blasting cold air over the fillets, allowing for a rapid lowering of fillet temperaturedown to -1\u00b0C. Prior to Super Chilling the fillet goes through fluid-ice with about 2.5% saltcontent to avoid freezing of the flesh in the tunnel. This process facilitates further handling of the fillets, in particular deskinning and effective cooling prior to packaging. A report by Mat\u00eds, Icelandic Fisheries Laboratories, confirms tests have reveleaed that the Super Chilling treatment of fillets contributes to a slower quality degra- dation rate at early stage, extending the freshness period of the product and its shelf life.* Tailor made solutions Already an industry leader in Iceland when it comes to efficient pelagic processing, freezing and chilling solu- tions, Skaginn's growing reputation for its adaptability to tailor make solutions to individual assignments if needed, is fast establishing the company as a key player in a fiercely competitive international environment. Skaginn's recent acquisition of an 80% stake in 3X Technology - another leader in its field in Iceland - has further fortified its position, coupled with an 1800 square metre expansion of its manufacturing facilities. The two companies, established in traditional Icelandic fishing towns, have a history of co-operation on a range of projects, making closer ties between them a logical progression. Volumes replaced by values Iceland's fishing industry has been through some tough years, emerging as not only one of the most modern in existence, but also one of the most progressive. When quotas are tight, values replace volumes.

With the signing of an agreement to collaborate on further development of the two arctic conferences Arctic Frontiers and the Arctic - Territory for Dialogue the scene is set for a long lasting channel between Russia and the West. Let us go back 22 years Late July 1992, the Akvaplan-niva researchers left Norway for a voyage to the eastern Barents Sea and the Kara Sea. For 70 years this kind ofvoyage with participants from the neighboring countries Norway and Russia had been impossible. With our scientific colleagues from the Acad- emy of Science, Murmansk Marine Biological Institute, we set off to study the marine life in the Russian arctic seas for 4 weeks. We visited seas and islands where Norwegian trappers and fishermen used to travel before the First World War. We landed on Novaya Zemlya, and visited the infamous testing ground for nuclear weapons during the Cold War for joint studies of radioactivity. Later the same year our Russian colleagues went with us to Svalbard to study the environmental situation at the Norwegian and Russian settlements on this northern Norwegian archipelago. Pomor Trade Before the Russian Revolution closedthe border, the social and business contact between Norway and Russia in the north had been very importantfor both parties for several hundred years. It was named the \"Pomor Trade\" after the Russian settlements at the White Sea. The expedition in 1992 was later to be copied by many, and is an example of the re-opening of a closed border. Ukraine crises In the spring of 2014 the world watched in surprise as the Ukraine crisis devel- oped very quickly - apparently from nothing. Soon the two closely related countries, Ukraine and Russia were almost at a state of war. Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula, and backed the separatists in eastern Ukraine politically; equipment and volunteers crossed the border. As a result the west boycotted Russia, and Russia launched a contra boycott towards the western countries. Very rapidly much of the business and research cooperation came to a standstill. This was also the case across the Norwegian-Russian border. A need for dialogue Akvaplan-niva and the Russian Geo- graphical Society entered an agree- ment the 9th of September this year aimed at keeping up the dialogue. One of the measures is strengthening the two most important Arctic confer- ences, Arctic Frontiers taking place in Troms\u00f8, Norway, and Arctic - Territory of Dialogue arranged in Russia. Climate and Energy Arctic Frontiers has ran annually since 2007. Every year, the Russian delega- tion of businessmen, politicians and scientists and NGO's has been the second largest after the NorwegianSalve Dahle Director Akvaplan-niva Tel: 77 75 03 www.twitter.com/AkvaplanNivaArctic Frontiers, a channel for cooperation 154event. The theme for January 2015 is \"Climate and Energy\", and will discuss main issues and challenges presented by the IPCC, including how to achieve the necessary cuts in emissions of cli- mate gasses as well as energy secu- rity. The aim is to be a stepping stone towards the COP 21 meeting in Paris in the autumn 2015. A channel for cooperation The Arctic is facing increased interest from a growing number of actors. Somehave an arctic history, and some are new to the region. Some call for industrial development and exploita- tion of the vast arctic resources, and some call for preservation. Both ArcticFrontiers and the Arctic - Territory for Dialogue are arenas where these interests meet and different views on arctic development are discussed. It isin the interest of both Europe and Russia to continue the cooperation. Europe needs Russia and Russianeeds Europe. The Arctic is an arena of interest to many countries; Arctic Frontiers is a channel for cooperation. PROFILEReibo Photo: NASAUnderstanding extractives in the Arctic: reality check Adam Stpie, a Researcher at the Arctic Centre, University of Lapland discusses how changes in the Arctic environment have impacted on extractives... Over the last years much has been said about the extractive industries bonanza emerging in the Arctic as a result of climate change. Indeed, the changes in sea-ice, terrestrial snow and ice cover, thawing permafrost, and shifts in ecosystems amount to profound transformation of region's land- scape. Against this background, media, policy-makers and some researchers claim that the melting Arctic Ocean sea ice is opening the Arctic to intensive resource extraction, especially in unexplored oshoreareas within Arctic states' exclusive economic zones. The 2008 estimates produced by the US GeologicalSurvey 1suggested that the Arctic holds 13% of the world's undiscovered but recoverable oil reservesand 30% of the natural gas reserves. It is rarely remembered that this landmark, albeit dated study was based on statistical probability rather than eld data. Nevertheless, together with consecutive September sea ice minima and the process of dening extent of Arctic states' continental shelves, it has resulted in anincreased interest in Arctic resources. The \"Arctic boom\" was supposed to be just round the corner. However, the reality has not matched the enthusiastic or grievous - depending on the point of view - narratives. \"While climate change is seen by many as a key factor shaping Arctic extractive industries, so far its role has been chiefly symbolic. One exception is the predicted increase in Arctic marine shipping, facilitating the transport of Arctic resources. \" First, and rather obvious, any analysis needs to distin guish between onshore and oshore activities, oil, gas and particular minerals, as well as between Arctic regions. The Arctic is not a uniform space and each activity has specic dynamics and impacts. Second, the pace of developments and expectations for the future are generally moderate. Low gas prices derailed major schemes such as Stockman oshore gas project in the Russian Barents waters. Oil exploration o theArctic Environment 156 Image: \u00a9 GettyImagesLNG plant in Hammerfest, Norway. Installations process the natural gas from the Barents Sea shelf. The plant is considered to be one of the most technologically advanced installation of its kind in operationArctic Environment Greenlandic coast or in the Barents Sea has been so far disappointing, even if these areas have high potential. Shell has encountered numerous technical problems during exploration activities in Alaskan waters. In Fennoscandia and Greenland, the earlier notion of approaching mining boom is now replaced by the perception of crisis due to falling prices of min erals. The exploration and exploitation in the Arctic are relatively costly and connected with major envi ron- mental risks. Environmental organisations and local, especially indigenous, communities are often terried with the prospect of a major oil spill or a mining accident occurring in the fragile Arctic environment. Despite the technological progress, the companieshave had limited success in convincingly responding to these concerns. In terms of oshore oil extraction, the industry itself appears to be very cautious andfol lowing a step-by-step approach. While climate change is seen by many as a key factorshaping Arctic extractive industries, so far its role hasbeen chiefly symbolic. One exception is the predicted increase in Arctic marine shipping, facilitating thetransport of Arctic resources. For terrestrial activities climate change may be a challenge rather than an opportunity as the winter roads - dependent on snowand ice conditions - are crucial for accessibility in remote Arctic locations. Therefore, not climate change but the demand for Arctic resources constitutes the key driver for devel- opments. That has practical consequences: the boomand bust character of extractive industries as well as disadvantaged position of local actors in relation to powerful market forces. Demand is not an omnipotent force, as political decision and regulatory frameworks prove critical. For example, the opening of new areas for hydrocarbon exploration (e.g., in the Barents Sea or Alaskan waters) is always a political choice. Arctic states have made much eort to create regulatory frameworks conducive to extractive activities. This has been for instance the case in Sweden and Finland, which, as a result, ranked top among mining jurisdictions in an industry survey by the Cana dian Fraser Institute.2Despite the perception of Arctic regions as remote, sparsely populated and underdeveloped, and despite numerous environmental risks, it is the social issues rather than environmental considerations thatare usually pivotal for decision-making. Resourcedevelopments are often seen as an answer to social ills troubling northern communities, including unem ployment, poor quality of social services and dependence on governmental transfers. Those involved in nature-based activities, such as reindeer herders or shermen, are usually far less enthusiastic. Although the Arctic is in general free from volatile conflicts fueled by resources, extractive developments exacerbate tensions, often dividing northern commu- nities. Even for oshore activities, the community context needs to be taken into account due to onshore installations and interactions with livelihoods such as shing or subsistence game harvesting. Increasingly, it would seem, the long-term perspective is taken into account. Boom and bust cycles, the socio-economic role of nature-based activities, the economic and intrinsic value of Arctic nature become again a part of the equation. The Arctic will see numerous extractive projects in the future, but not without chal lenges for the companies, Arctic environment and northern communities.

The shipyard is a forerunner in developing and applying technological innovations and has 150 years' experience in shipbuilding. The first vessel classified as an icebreaker was delivered more than a century ago. Today about 60% of the world's icebreakers have been built by Helsinki Shipyards. The growing interest towards Arctic oil and gas resources has increased demand of all types of vessels capable of operating in ice. Arctech's building dock accomodates the building of vessels up to panama size, however Arctech's main focus is on smaller vessels eg. icebreakers and icebreaking offshore vessels, supply vessels, stand-by vessels, and construction vessels. These can be built with any ice class, from 'low' Finnish-Swedish ice classes to the'highest' polar classes. PSV and SBV for Sovcomflot Arctech Bering and Alexey Chirikov to Sovcomflot, the biggest Russian shipping company, in 2012 and 2013. Earlier this year Arctech signed four new contracts with Sovcomflot. First Arctech were awarded a contract concerning one platform supply vessel based on a further developed design of Vitus Bering and Alexey Chirikov. Then Arctech signed three more contracts for stand by vessels. These are based on a concept design developed by Aker Arctic Technology Oy. PSV for Sovcomflot The new vessel will be built for the North East Sakhalin Offshore region oil and gas field where she will be used as a platform supply vessel for Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (SEIC). The vessel (delivered in June 2016) brings together the very latest innovations in arctic shipbuilding. The new icebreaking supply vessel measures 104m in length and 21m in breadth. The six main diesel generator sets have the total power of about 20,000kW and the propulsion power of 13,000kW. The vessel is designed for extreme environmental conditions in the Sakhalin area. The main duty of the vessel is to supply between land bases and the offshore drilling and production sites, and will be able to safely convoy and transfer cargo on deck and bulk cargo underdeck in all seasons. SBV for Sovcomflot The series of 3 state-of-the-art icebreaking stand-by vessels will be delivered to Sovcomflot between September 2016 and March 2017. The vessels are designed for stand-by and rescue duties and for oil spill recovery. They can also be used as supply vessels for cargo transfer e.g. for low-flashpoint fuels. The vessels measure 95m in length and 22m in breadth and are based on Aker Arctic concept Aker ARC 121. The four diesel generator engines have the total power of about 20,000kW and the propulsion power of the vessel is 13,000kW. The design fulfils demanding requirements set forth by SEIC with a total capacity of 98 persons onboard. The PSV and the SBV vessels will be operating in thickdrifting ice for ice management and icebreaking in temperatures as cold as -35\u00b0C. The icebreaking capability of the stand-by vessels is extremely high; the vessels are able to proceed independently in 1.5m thick ice. The vessels will be outfitted for emergency evacuation, Breaking the ice Arctech Helsinki Shipyard Oy P.O.

Oil Spill Response All the new vessels for Sovcomflot will be equipped for oil spill response both in open water and winter conditions. They will also be equipped with systems capable to detect an oil slick on a sea surface as well as oil in ice, mainly using radars and thermal cameras. The vessels will be equipped with 800m of ocean type oil booms stored on reels with quick deployment mechanism. Booms deployment may be assisted by the Fast Rescue Daughter Crafts, which most of the vessels are equipped with. The two different types of oil skimmers will provide the ability to operate in both open water as well as icy conditions for light crude oil spill. The total capacity for recovered oil will be about 1500m3. The 20 tons onboard dispersant can be spread by means of erectable spray booms. When needed the vessels can receive additional oil spill response equipment in containers. Emergency evacuation capabilities All the vessels are designed to meet the Oil & Gas UK 'Emergency Evacuation and Response' requirements for group B vessels. The vessels will have the ability to temporarily accommodate up to 150 evacuees. For platform evacuation purposes the production platforms are fitted with enclosed survival crafts as well as 'Skyscape' chutes. Both can be used to for evacuating the platform to the sea. If ice conditions would not allow evacuation into sea the survival craft may also be lowered directly onto the deck of the assisting vessel. The 'Skyscape' chutes are designed for use in icy conditions to allow them to be lowered directly onto the evacuation chute landing area on the bow of the vessels. Environmental impacts The design criteria for the vessels requires environmental certification, encompassing not only full compliance with all applicable Rules and Regulations but also a policy of design and construction in accordance with a special notation issued by the Classification Society. In addition, the vessels will comply with the forthcoming IAPP (International Air Pollution Prevention) requirement, including the NOxregulation set out by IMO (Tier III). The design and layout of the vessels will be made to reduce the risk of harmful pollution in case of emergencies, this means e.g., that no pollutant or waste liquids will be in direct contact with the outer hull of the vessels. Special attention will also be given to limit the sonic footprint of the vessels -reducing the impact of harmful underwater noise on marine life. When in operation 2016-2017 these vessels will bring a significant boost to the region's transportation capacity of both cargo and crew. But these vessels are not only bringing a solution to transportation needs, they also increase both the oil spill response capacity as well as the emergency evacuation capacity to a new level. Both personal and environmental safety are a high priority in this Sovcomflot and SEIC project. Awareness is growing of the complexity, sensitivies, risks and expense of developing large, undiscovered oil and gas resources in the Arctic region. How- ever, the reality of such a hostile, and volatile, terrain is driving the need for innovation and collaboration to over- come extreme technical, and natural, challenges as Olga Shiplova, senior researcher, with DNV GL explains... DNV GL has been a pioneer in risk management in the Arctic, dating back to vessel classification during the earlydays of scientific exploration. Though the risks associated with oil and gas exploration in the polar regions have been well documented, experience has also revealed gaps in expertise. Muchof the current practical knowledge is localised and limited to a relatively small number of specialists. Companies with an interest in the region have an obligation to educate employees of the operational and practical realities involved in any Arctic activity and share those learnings. Arctic Risk The Arctic is not a monolithic area and the risk picture varies accordingly. Whilst declining sea ice is creating new possibilities for industrial activities in the Arctic, the region is highly variable in its resources and conditions, creating a complex risk picture. There are visibly increased activities related to industry, population and 162transport in the exposed Arctic waters. Large parts of the Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea and the Russian Kara Sea -which are most likely to hold significant oil deposits -experience similar operating conditions to fields in the Norwegian Sea. However, they bear witness to severe Arctic conditions for several months of the year. In order to source solutions to unique technical and environmental challenges across all areas and under all arduous condi- tions, R&D activity must be a united, and to some extent, transparent endeavour for the industry as a whole. Joint industry projects (JIPs) are effective working platforms in whichindustry players are brought together in a neutral environment to facilitate speedy innovations and the develop-PROFILE Arctic advancesment of products, practices and standards that set the industry benchmark. Winterisation Sea spray icing is one of the many challenges when operating in Arctic conditions. It poses a threat on multiple levels, from blocking the operation of essential components to jeopardising stability and integrity and in extreme circumstances, such as a capsized vessel, a heightened risk to life. A number of standards, for example DNV GL's offshore standard 'Winteri- sation for Cold Climate Operations (DNV-OS-A201)', currently provides guidance on mitigating ice accumula- tion using specified anti and de-icing procedures. However, the standards available today are performance based, so they give requirements to safety functions and to some extent describe mitigation solutions, but do not give a specific answer to how and where they should be implemented. DNV GL is initiating a JIP called 'RigSpray' to provide a methodology which would link requirements for structural design and the actual envi- ronmental conditions leading to icing. The methodology is to be used during design and winterisation giving the basis for the procedural implementa- tion of the requirements when icing risk is acknowledged. Despite making headway in addressing the challenge through the 'MarIce' JIP last year, where DNV GL worked together with the Norwegian Univer- sity of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Statoil to create the world's most advanced marine-icing model, furtherinnovation is required to present an accurate representation of sea spray.The 'RigSpray' JIP will firstly develop a software tool to further understand sea spray icing using mathematical modelling and measurements and will undertake more experimental and modelling studies. This will provide a solid basis for extending local iceestimations to a wider spectrum ofmetocean and structural conditions, which in turn will lead to safer and more cost-efficient winterisation solutions for drilling rigs, production platforms and vessels operating in cold climate areas. Currently, the Norwegian regulation NORSOK N-003 is being updated and ISO (International Organisation for Standarisation) is developing a new standard on the collection and analysis of data for design and planning of operations in the Arctic. One of the goals for these activities is to makeOlga Shipilova Senior www.dnvgl.com 163regulations and standards more specific and provide more information to be used during design and operation of the Arctic vessels and offshore instal- lations. As an independent body, DNV GL takes an active role to ensure that regulations, technologies and standards are harmonised and adapted to the harsh Arctic conditions and that any increase in industrial activity has a strong focus on safeguarding life, property and the environment.PROFILE Investing in sustainable transport in Ireland The Minister for Transport, Tourism & Sport in the Republic of Ireland, Paschal Donohoe explains how investment in transport is essential to the economy... Awell-functioning transport system is essential to a well-functioning economy. If we fail to invest in, and facilitate, ecient transport, we impose a range of costs on society and create abarrier to future economic growth. Due to our economic crisis in recent years, the scope to implement major investment programmes in areas, like transport, has been tightly constrained. This government has, however, taken this opportunity to consider what the appropriate level of investment in our transport system should be as we seek to iden tify future needs, where demand will arise and how best to advance and manage Ireland's transportnetwork. This is being done so that we can prioritise the projects that will oer the greatest economic andsocial return for the resources we can provide. Ireland weathered a very dicult economic storm over the last number of years. Thankfully, due to a recovery plan implemented by the government and the sacrices made by the Irish people, we have seena considerable return to economic growth. With that comes a rise in the number of cars on our roads. To address this, a high priority is being put on tackling urban congestion, principally through public transport , walking and cycling and a better integrated transportsystem. The need to rebalance transport policy in favour of public and sustainable transport is a key policy priority of mine and, despite the economic diculties of recent years, this government has continued to invest in the appropriate sectors. We have targetedour investment where it will deliver the greatest return by providing options to encourage people to make smarter travel decisions.The allocation nalised by my Department in October in our Budget 2015 negotiations, allows for the maintenance and, where possible, expansion ofcapacity in our transport networks where projects such as the LUAS cross-city for Dublin are concerned. Targeted investment in our roads, the delivery ofe cient public transport services and the promotion of safer and more sustainable transport options have all been prioritised. A rolling programme of Public Service Obligation bus replacement will continue to be funded for Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann. In a bid to ensure that public transport remains an attractive option, a number ofmeasures such as improvements to bus stops and shelters, on-going enhancement of the Leap card (which facilitates cheaper travel), upgrades to Real Time Passenger Information and journey planners will also continue. As our economy develops, it is essential that investment in our public transport system keepspace. Ensuring that those who are returning to work are supported in their eorts to get there is key to enabling our future progress. Targeted investment in our national, regional and local roads; the maintenance of our rail network and upgrading of our bus fleet are all central to this. Transport 164 Paschal Donohoe Minister for Transport, Tourism & SportTransport Funding programmes to support the Smarter Travel Policy is also central to encouraging sustainable travel. There are 3 such policies being administered by my Department over the period 2012 to 2016; Smarter Travel Areas (STAs), Active Travel Towns (ATTs) and National Cycle Network (NCN). My Department also funds and works closely with the National Transport Authority (NTA) to administer arange of behavioural change programmes, namely Smarter Travel Workplaces, Smarter Travel Campuses and Green Schools Travel, all of which are designed toraise awareness of more sustainable travel options, and to encourage a shift away from the car to more sustainable modes. The NTA also supports the development of moresus tainable travel through the provision of infrastruc- ture under its Sustainable Transport Measures Grants(STMG) Programme and also manages the DublinBikes scheme, the success of which is facilitating the roll out of the scheme this year to the regional cities of Cork, Galway and Limerick. A reduction in car use will benet us economically by reducing congestion and our reliance on imported fuels. Improved facilities for cyclists and pedestrians will increase activity levels to make for a tter and healthier population and also help to make Ireland an international destination for activity based tourism. Providing safe cycle routes is a key factor in encouraging more people to cycle for both transport purposes andleisure. I will continue to support this key policy. The sustainable travel and transport agenda, and in particular cycling, is continuing to gain momentum. Given the economic benets that sustainable travel and transport can confer, as well as the environmental ones, this is very welcome indeed and will continue to receive my Transport, Tourism & Sport Department for Transport, Republic of Ireland www.dttas.ie 165 With the new dynamics in the Rail Industry Asset Management has become a very important topic. The leading European Rail companies are organising themselves to cover Asset Management as an integrated part of their operations. Several as guidance use ISO 55000. This article gives the outlines why it is used. ISO 55000 is the new international standard for asset management, released in January 2014. Simply put, the essence of this standard is value realisation from your assets, which achieves the desired balance of risk, cost and performance. It will provide assurance that the right things are being done right, and that these activities support the achievement of the mission and objectives of your organisation. ISO 55000 requires that an Asset Management System (AMS) be developed and documented which is the \"Set of interrelated or interacting elements to establish asset management policy, asset management objectives and processes to achieve those objectives\". Asset Management (AM) is defined as the \"Coordinated activity of an organisation to realise value from assets\". The organisation's assets, which are within the scopeof the AMS, must be identified. The standard calls out the following benefits that organisations will achieve from adopting ISO 55000: Marcel van Velthoven is the managing director of ZNAPZ (www.znapz.com) an IBM partner that sells and supports Asset Management systems for Rail and other industries. Improved financial performance taking account of the short term and long term view Managed risk reducing financial losses and liabilities, improving safety, reputation and environmental impacts Improved services, e.g. punctuality and output through better asset performance Demonstrated social responsibility with respect to environmental and societal impacts Demonstrated compliance with legal, statutory and regulatory requirements Enhanced reputation through improved customer satisfaction and stakeholder confidence Improved organisational sustainability effectively managing short and long term effects Improved effectiveness and efficiency by improving the organisation's ability to reach their objectives ISO 55000 is a strategic approach as opposed to a tactical approach and encompasses the following aspects: Organisation: ensuring that asset management objectives are consistent and aligned to the organisational objectives, that the stakeholders are identified and satisfied, and the scope and boundaries of the AMS are defined. Leadership: ensuring that the asset management leadership is put in place by top management, the asset management policy has been defined and reviewed, and the AM leadership is given the authority, responsibility and resources to achieve the identified objectives. Planning: ensuring that risks and opportunities are identified and plans are put in place to address them and support the achievement of the organisational objectives. These integrated plans should address what will be done, when it will be done, by whom and how it will be undertaken and evaluated. These plans should address risks and opportunities and howRail and ISO 55000: An Overview they change over time achieving a balance of risk, cost and performance. Support: ensuring that competent resources required to achieve the plans are made available, the information systems are available to support the process and the information is documented, controlled, communicated and auditable. Operation: ensuring that the plans, implementations and processes are reviewed and controlled, including any activities that are outsourced, and encompasses change management activities as well. Evidence that the organisation carried out the plans and processes is required. Performance evaluation: ensuring that the asset performance and the effectiveness of the AMS is monitored, measured, analysed, evaluated and auditable. Top management should review the AMS for suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. Improvements: ensuring that non-conformities or incidents with respect to the assets, asset management or the AMS are documented and evaluated, and corrective action is taken. Asset management and the AMS should be continually improved. Asset Investment Planning and Management (AIPM) AIPM is focussed on solving the problem of how to realise the highest value from your assets while balancing cost, risk and performance. If you want assurance that the right things are being done right, and that these activities support the achievement of the mission and objectives of your organisation, then AIPM is a best practice to help you decide what are the right things to do. In the case of ISO 55000, the right things to do arethose that collectively create the most value for the corporation given the cost, risk and performance objectives. Investments must be evaluated based on how they contribute to the achievement of the corporate objectives. AIPM efficiently identifies the optimum mix and timing given a myriad of potential investments and their alternatives and any organisational constraints or timing requirements.Realising value from your assets with AIPM starts with: Bringing all the knowledge within the organisation to bear on the decision-making process in an integrated manner: what risks you are facing and how will these risks evolve over time, the opportunities that are possible, and creating a risk-informed evidence-based approach to decision making Understanding the corporation's values, defining these items explicitly and adopting them as your decision-making criteria Identifying \"the right things to do\" with your scarce resources that will deliver the highest value Efficiently create, compare and contrast multiple what-if scenarios to understand the risk, value and benefits of various investment strategies Gaining organisational buy-in through collaboration and transparency in decision-making Arriving at defensible decisions using a rigorous, consistent, repeatable and auditable process Learning all along the way, to continually improve based on: evaluating how you are doing, and how you did, with respect to the value creation you planned to achieve and the actual cost to achieve it. AIPM supports every aspect of the process above and Copperleaf's C55 is an excellent example of how to realize that today. Marcel van Velthoven Chief Executive Officer Tett, Leader of Buckinghamshire CC, tells why more investment is needed from central government to improve his county's transport system... Buckinghamshire is on the road to economic recovery thanks to prudent government policies, but our desperately poor transport infrastructure is creating a real barrier to growth.Traf c congestion, unreliable journey times and poor connections to major employment centres make theneed to invest in transport an absolute priority. However, our County Council has been hit - like most of local government - by signicant funding reductions, making it dicult to invest heavily beyond our major priorities of protecting vulnerable children and elderlyresidents. Nevertheless, we have spent over \u00a350m on capital upgrades to our existing roads over the past 4 years and are planning to invest another \u00a365m over the next4 years. We have also invested \u00a315m in East-West Rail. But this is not enough. We need national investmentin major new local schemes. For example, a new or upgraded junction on the M40 would make a signicant dierence to Wycombe area residents and businesses, reducing journey times, unlocking valuable employment land and creating jobs. Some people may say that transport has to take a back seat in these austere times, but investing in roads and rail supports the entire economy of the country. To neglect transport, even in these dark nancialtimes, would be a catastrophic error. For those not familiar with our county, Buckinghamshire's road network is still largely composed of single carriageway roads, which are now struggling to cope with the rapid housing growth that is taking place. There are no major roads that run directly between the south and north of the county (e.g. between the economic centres of High Wycombe, Aylesbury andTransport 168Transport Milton Keynes). This can present serious issues when people have to drive between these towns for work or to hospitals. And yet, there is so much potential here, because our county is just a short trip by road and rail to both of the UK's largest cities, London and Birmingham.Many routes between these cities pass through Bucks, indeed the housing-led growth in Aylesbury isamong the fastest in the country, demonstrating thepotential that is there to be unlocked if we could only improve the infrastructure fabric of the county. Last year, Buckinghamshire Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership ranked second among LEPs for housing completions. This, combined with the fact that Buckinghamshire is the second most 'porous' LEP in the country (with only 62.3% of residents work ing in the LEP area and 92,000 people out com muting) means congestion continues to be a signicant constraint. There is some good news as far as investment is concerned. Earlier this year, the Buckinghamshire Thames Valley LEP secured \u00a344.2m from the govern- ment's Local Growth Fund to support mainly transport schemes - with \u00a38.9m of new funding conrmed for 2015/16 and \u00a327m for 2016/17 to 2021. This substantia l investment from government will bring forward at least \u00a328.8m of additional investment from local partners and the private sector. Combined together this will create a total new investment package of \u00a373m for the Buckinghamshire Thames Valley LEP . By 2021, this deal will enable at least 4,000 jobs and allow an additional 600 homes to be built. The investment allows progress to be made on new link roads in Aylesbury and delivery of the transport components of the High Wycombe 'Southern Quadrant' strategy to open up land for employment and improve access in our major towns. Meanwhile, North-South Connectivity will be improved by delivering the A355 Improvement Scheme that enables the redevelopment of former Ministry of Defence land, providing a new strategic link in Beaconseld. However, this can only be a start if such a key part of the UK is to grow and perform as it should. The South-East is seen by many as already prosperous, so we are often ignored when it comes to transport investment. In Buckinghamshire we are doing our very best to improve our existing roads and rail. But we say it's time we stopped being taken for granted in this way, and it's time all governments recognise how vital it is to 'invest in success' in order to deliver the economic return to the Treasury that will fund future investment across all regions and bring success to all the Martin Tett Leader Buckinghamshire County CouncilDriving change to our highways The Highways Agency provides Adjacent Government with an insight into the changes in store for the organisation as they prepare to become a 'government company' tasked with delivering up to 3 times more investment... England's most important roads are managed and operated by the Highways Agency. These are the motorways and major A roads that variously host holiday makers, commuters and the fleet of hundreds of thousands of trucks travelling between ports, businesses and homes. If you were to lose all 4,300 miles of the Agency's road network there are estimates it would cost \u00a3111bn to replace them. \"We've got no plans to do that,\" said Graham Dalton, Chief Executive of the Highways Agency. \"Our minds are focused on \u00a324bn of investment the government has asked us to deliver and how as an organisation we will change to meet that goal. This is going to lead to a transformation of the strategic road network, improving journeys on already well used roads and freeing up pinch points at busy junctions.\"But it's not just the look of the roads that the Agencywants to change. \"What most of our customers want is a predictable journey that they can plan in advance and be sure as possible of trac conditions,\" Dalton stressed. \"What they really want is a smooth journey into work, for example, that isn't aected by frustrating stop-start trac. This is about how drivers feel on the network and that's something we want to change soon afterbecoming a company.\" The transformation of the Agency into a government company stemmed from recommendations in 'A fresh start for the Strategic Road Network', written by the former Chairman of the Agency Alan Cook and published in 2011. The report suggested that in orderTransport 170 Image: \u00a9 Highways AgencyTransport to become a high performing company, the Agency needed reform that mirrored the flexibility and certainty given to utilities companies over the last 30 years - but, crucially, without privatisation. The Infrastructure Bill will change the Agency into a government-owned company in April 2015, ready for the next nancial year. In the meantime, the Department for Transport and the Agency are working hard to put everything in place to get the new company ready. In June, the Department published a set ofdoc uments that outline how the company would function. The next milestone is the publication of the Roads Investment Strategy (RIS). \"What most of our customers want is a predictable journey that they can plan in advance and be sure as possible of tracconditions, \" Dalton stressed. \"What they really want is a smooth journey into work, for example, that isn't aected by frustrating stop-start trac. \" \"The strategy [RIS] is due to be published by the end of the year and will give the company a clear direction for the rst 5 years in a similar fashion to other utilities companies,\" Graham said. \"This, combined with the flexibility of being a company, allows us toplan a generation in advance to see where we canimprove sections of motorways or particular pinch points on the roads.\" But focusing on the immediate term, Dalton makes clear that the organisation is going to shift to becoming even more customer orientated. The Agency has recently become a member of the Institute of Customer Service and its 1,000 person strong customer panel is already providing feedback about how the Agency isperforming now. The Agency is embracing this even though the Bill will mandate customer oversight with a new role for Passenger Focus. The Oce of Rail Regulation will evaluate the eectiveness of the new company's spend.\"We already have a brilliant customer service function in our Trac Ocer Service as the recent documentary [which aired on BBC2 in September] showed,\" says Dalton. Between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day High ways Agency Trac Ocers dealt with more than 1,200 incidents across England while many of us were in front of a TV full on mince pies. \"While we are proud of our record there is more forus to do. We must continually strive to clear incidents more quickly and ensure that when there is construction we keep disruption to an absolute minimum. We can do this in partnership with our supply chain by inno vating and working smarter.\" The roads revolution must still gain approval fromboth Houses of Parliament but Dalton and colleagues remain focused on the task at hand - as well as the future. \"While I am excited about the future, we're already delivering major improvements on the M25, M1 and A1 as well as freeing up congestion at pinch points across the country. These improvements keep driversmoving and underpin growth cars: the mobility revo lution Automatic cars are set to change the way we view driving, here Andrea Balluchi, President of Pure Power Control explains how and why automomous driving is the future... Vehicles that drive themselves will start to be commercialised in 10 years. The introduction of autonomous cars is set to revolutionise mobility, increase transport safety, as well as fuel economy and improve the transport environmental footprint. Car sharing will spread out, due to the capability of cars able to pick passengers up when they ask for a ride. This will make autonomous cars convenientand cheap to use, resulting in fewer numbers of cars, but far more heavily used. At the beginning of this century, autonomous driving was perceived as being years away, mainly due to the lack of technology. However, in the last few years we have seen advances in sensor technologies (i.e. camera,infrared imagers, radar, lidar, GPS, etc.) now available at competitive costs; exponentially increasing processing power of electronic control units, and break-through achievements in image processing and control software technologies. Today top-class cars are equipped with navigationsystems, adaptive cruise control, lane departurewarning and automatic parking systems, which represent industrialised elementary functions of autonomous driving. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications will be exploited for autonomous driving. V2V communication allows similarly equipped vehicles within a few hundred meters of each other to trade information about location, speed, and direction of travel. V2I communication can share information about trac-signal timing, the number of lanes a highway has, whether a curve is coming up, surface conditions, and so forth. Places where much of the infrastructure is only now being put in (e.g. the Far East) may see a quicker implementation of autonomous driving. All major car manufactures are working on autonomous driving, with. Nissan among the most committed to this - with the introduction of a line of automatic cars planned by 2020. Volvo's investment in automatic driving technology is signicantly growing. The company is working in a 100-car test fleet that are already able to handle lane following, merging trac all by them selves and follow in line behind a human driver truck. Intense programs on autonomous driving are also being carried out by Audi, Daimler AG-Mercedes Benz, Ford, Toyota and other companies. The most aggressive initiatives for autonomous driving are led by Google - a non automotive company with huge business in map data management.Google's self-driving cars have made impressive progress in the past few years, logging over 700,000 accident-free miles without human intervention. Last September, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) handed out its rst 29 permits for testing autonomous cars: 25 were won by Google, 2 by Audi and 2 by Daimler AG-Mercedes Benz. According to Jean Shiomoto, director of the California DMV: \"Autonomous vehicles are the future of trans- portation. The potential safety and mobility benets are enormous. Testing on public roads is one step to developing this technology, and the DMV is excited in facilitating the advancement of autonomous vehicles 1133 andrea@purepowercontrol.comwww.purepowercontrol.comTransport 172173 Innov ative technology for armoured vehicles for the frontline Professor Bryn James, Senior Fellow from the Physical Protection Group at Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) outlines how new technology is helping frontline troops stay protected... The pace of delivery of new technology to frontline troops has increased signicantly over the last few years. This acceleration of delivery is illustrated well in the provision of protection technology for armoured vehicles and for dismounted troops. Previously, it could take a decade to implement a new armour system on a vehicle and that system might be extant for several decades. Recently, some vehicles have had 4 or 5 protection upgrades over a period of 3 or 4 years in response to changes in threat, and as new and better protection has been developed. In some cases, the time from idea to eld ing could be measured in weeks. The pace of development of other types of technology for armoured vehicles has also increased signicantly,resulting in the tting of new, more capable sensors,communications and electronic countermeasures along with the protection upgrades. Much of this new technology has been implemented on legacy platforms that were not designed initially to take advantage of such rapid developments. Consequently, many of our armoured vehicles are currently crowded with bespoke ttings of electronic equipment and have applique armour systems that are dicult and expensive to t and maintain. The answer to this predicament is to design armoured vehicles in such a way that upgrades, improvements and enhancements in capability may be most easily accommodated. We would like armour systems toImage: \u00a9 Crown copyright. MoDExterior of Foxhound Light Protected Patrol Vehicle - picture by Cpl Mike O'Neill RLCDefencebe modular and adaptable, so that layers can be added or removed dependent upon threat levels. We would like changes and additions to the electronic architecture to be \"plug and play\". To facilitate this ideal, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) has developed the Land Open Systems Archi tecture. The part of this that refers to vehicles is the Generic Vehicle Architecture (GVA) standard (Def Stan 23-03) that species the mandatory standards tobe used in the design and implementation of infra- structure and interfaces for Land platforms. The GVA has already achieved a lot. The Scout SV armoured vehicle, the latest platform under development for UK MOD, is GVA compliant, as in the Foxhound (pictured). However, GVA is a work in progress that will eventually allow us to specify all the interfaces of all the compo- nents that go to make up the integrated structure of an armoured vehicle. It may not seem like rocket science, but the implications of the GVA are huge. The potential for even quite a basic concept such as a \"quick-t\", common armour mounting conguration across multiple platforms carries with it some very attractive consequences: signicant reductions in logistic complexity, ability to upgrade very quickly in response to a change in threat, ability to add layers (low threat: low weight, high threat: higher weight, more layers), ease of repair and replacement, addition of functionality(camouflage, sensors, etc.). Most of all though, such a concept would allow much more rapid, much easier implementation of new protection technology, as it is developed. Eventually we may move away from having vehicle types all congured in the same way. With advances in modularity it is feasible that we might have a store of dierent protection technologies that could be tted as required to a small number of platforms tomake them ideally suited for a particular operation, or even for a single particular mission, taking advantage of developments, as they arise, to give vehicles the very best possible protection and capability.

MoD Interior of Foxhound Light Protected Patrol Vehicle - picture by Graeme Main 174Defence175PROFILE Mines and IED's have become the weapon of choice for any terrorist or insurgent organisation worldwide, and over 70 countries currently suffer from the problem, with vehicles regularly being destroyed and people killed and injured. To counter these threats ABBS and DREHTAINER have agreed to work together to take their respective Active Mine Protection Systems to theglobal market as a combined system. The two systems working together can provide complete protection against under-belly blast mines within the system specification. The DREHTAINER Zero Shock\u00ae system consists of a suspended floor inside the vehicle on which the crew seats are located. This floor is held in position at a specified height above the vehicle floor by cables tensioned between the roof and floor. The cables have a link arrangement which is separated explosively as soon as a mine blast is detected, so that the Zero Shock\u00ae floor then drops downwards under gravity, completely isolating the occu- pants from the initial shock effects that can cause significant internal and lower limb injuries. The system also provides sufficient clearance from thevehicle floor to ensure that any floor deformation does not contact the platform on which the occupant's seats are located.This simple method of isolating the vehicle crew from the mine blast effects works well for the first 5 - 10ms of the event, and it is during this short period that the ABBS VGAM (Vehicle Global Acceleration Mitigation) system comes into play. The novel, exceptionally fast-acting, powerful rocket motors developed by ABBS push the vehicle down against the mine blast lifting forces and prevent its acceleration upwards. As long as the vehicle belly plate can sustain the blast loads without being penetrated, and the vehicle floor design and the spacing between the floor and the DREHTAINER ZeroShock\u00ae floor is sufficient to prevent floor deformation effects becoming aproblem, there is no theoretical limit to the mine blast specification that can be dealt with by the combined systems. The DREHTAINER Zero Shock\u00ae system has been developed and fully tested by several European OEM's and is inRoger Sloman Managing Director Advanced Blast & mine blast effects ABBS Joins Forces with Drehtainer to Beat IED's service with the Swiss Army, and will shortly enter German Army service as well. The ABBS AMPS technology is currently undergoing full system testingand will be available for trial on customer vehicles early in 2015. Both systems can be retrofitted into existing vehicles to upgrade their mine blast capability and extend their service lives, helping to improve survivability and combat effectiveness within current budget levels. time in msimpulse impulse Impulse curve acting on vehicle without AMPS Resulting curve with AMPS AMPS force curve Sphere of action for DREHTAINER's Zero Shock\u00ae systemSphere of action for ABBS' Active Mine Protection System (AMPS)6 8 10 14 16 18 20 2 4 12 Typical Mine Blast Impulse Curves, with and without Counteraction by ABBS AMPS System.I'm sitting next to my severely wounded soldier comrade waiting impatiently for the field ambulance. A traumatic situation for all of us - what to do? We are in desperate need to do something for our friend and also for ourselves - it's horrible to just wait. It feels like an eternity\". Unfortunately this is not a unique scenario. Traumatic incidents affect everyone involved both the injured and bystanders. However, research has shown that 'eliminating' the feeling of uselessness by proceeding with determined actions minimises the risk of being severely traumatised. The last four decades the focus ofcasualty evacuation (CASEVAC) and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) has increased as a result of nations being engaged in conflicts far away from their own countries, an increasingnumber of terrorist actions and large nature catastrophes. With an almost ever-present media transmitting images of people in distress or of seriously wounded or even deceased into our living rooms, it is vital for nations to have satisfactory routines, procedures and equipment. Authorities need to assure soldiers and citizens that they are able to take care of their own people when wounded abroad, and bring them home for treatment and recovery. After more than 60 years developing the routines and procedures, both within each nation and within coali- tions, one would assume that termsand abbreviations as well as equip- ment interfaces would be harmonised between nations to ensure interoper- ability, flexibility and cross training. A lot has been done in the past 20 years to achieve this. NATO has devel- oped standards for equipment as well as terminology; several yearly conferences - both military and civilian organised - contribute to the transfer of knowledge and experience between services and nations. Nevertheless, most nations still have huge areas of improvement before they can claim perfection. Standardisation and harmonisation between services and nations While trying to ensure interoperability of services as well as national forces,When minutes feels like hours A traumatic scenario we know that it is impossible to meet all interests. For example, the infantry soldiers want super-light and compact stretchers. For the vehicle operator it is vital that the stretcher fits into the actual stretcher support in the vehicle. The helicopter or aircraft operator needs a stretcher approved for aerial evacuation, while the wounded soldier has the best chances of survival andleast pain if he is brought throughout the chain of evacuation on the same stretcher. Very often the result is different stretchers in different services, which arguably does not serve the patient. Can the industry contribute to the process of harmonising, equipment, and assist armed forces in developing and maintaining flexible solutions with high capacity across services and nations? \" Photo: Erik Skjerven Defence Media Archive 176PROFILE177PROFILE There is a significant level of expertise and knowledge in the industry as well as in the medical services. NODIN Aviation suggests that this knowledge can catalyze the best solution for the customer and the industry can further improve their services to theircustomers by: Developing collaboration between companies to extend competence and capacity; Participating in arenas where the customers share their experience in field; Knowing, understanding and being loyal to applicable standards whendesigning solutions; Focusing on the patient and the medics, not the equipment, when doing innovative design solutions. What can the customers do to make the suppliers better prepared to develop solutions, products and services that meet the needs of the patients? NODIN suggests to: Improve the arenas where users share their experience in patient evacuation; Allow and encourage informal discussions between users andindustry, enabling industry to fully understand the need; Describe the issue and/or the need, not the solution. The best solutions may not yet have been invented. There is a significant effort in many nations to improve their CASEVAC and MEDEVAC capability and if these activities are fairly coordinated the international community will see a huge increase in the total capacity to bring injured people out of disaster areas. Back to the introductory traumatised scenario As a company focusing on products and concepts for CASEVAC and MEDEVAC in wars and catastrophes we are obliged to support with solutions focusing on the patient, the medics and everyone involved when developing innovative and first class solutions. Olav Kaarstein R&D Director NODIN Aviation AS kaarstein@medevac.no www.medevac.no Our new CASEVAC KIT was developed to change the role of any vehicle and mobile platforms in the battlefield or catastrophe area. The KIT consists of a four-folded Field Stretcher and a Shock and Vibration Damped Stretcher Suspension System, all packed in a handbag. Using this kit, a vehicle or any mobile platform will be convertedinto a CASEVAC-Unit in 1 to 2 minutes. The MEDEVAC Field Stretcher is designed and manufactured in accordance to military and civilian requirements for all platforms on land, at sea and in air. In addition to increase the evacuation capacity this solution enables the comrades of the wounded soldier to contribute in a positive way and the action itself make the soldiers handle the traumatic situation better. Some potential CASEVAC-units:A strong focus on internationalisation Studying abroad can have great benets to students, and here the Danish Agency for Higher Education details how the Danish government has launched an action plan to increase internationalisation... More and more Danish students are choosing to participate in an exchange or internship programme in Europe. In the 2012/13 academic year 31% more Danish students went abroad to study or undertake an intership in an international company compared to 2010/11 and the positive trend continues in 2014. By 2020, the Danish government has a target of at least 50% of all students studying or working abroad as part of theireducation. Thus, in 2013 the government launched an ambitious action plan for increased internationalisation. Europe is becoming more and more appealing toDanish students - so much that a record high number of students decided to study abroad or undertake an internship with an international company as part of their education with support from the EU Erasmusprogramme in 2013. The Erasmus programme was replaced by EU's new education programme Erasmus+: Higher Education in January 2014. In the academic year 2012/2013, 3646 students received support from Erasmus to study abroad or undertake an internship in Europe. According to the European Commission's Erasmus statistics that is more than a 10% increase on the previous year. And the increase in Danish students taking part in the Erasmus programme is greater than the European average which saw 6% more Erasmus students in 2012/2013 than the previous year. The University of Copenhagen, which is the largest higher education institution in Denmark, is also the institu- tion that con tributed to most Erasmus students in 2012/2013. Whereas University College VIA in2012/2013 received more Erasmus students from other European countries than any other Danish institutions. Encourage students to go abroad The positive trend continues in the academic year 2014/2015 where more than 4800 higher education students are going abroad on either an exchange or internship with the Erasmus+ programme. That is an increase of 34% compared to the previous year. The new programme has been very well received by Danish higher education institutions and students. The Danish National Agency for Erasmus+ strongly encourages students to study in another European country or to undertake an internship with an inter- national company as part of their education, seeing that it enhances not only language skills but also cross national understanding. A new Erasmus Impact Study carried out by the Euro pean Commission shows that young people with international experience have much better chances on the job market and are less likely to experience long term unemployment. That is a good argument for going abroad . Enhanced insight through global outlook By 2020, the Danish Government has a target of at least 50% of all students studying or working abroad as part of their education. In 2013 15% of the Danish higher education students went abroad in order to study or undertake an internship. In order to reach the 2020 target the Danish government has launched a two-part action plan for increased internationalisation of the higher education institutions in Denmark. Education and Training 178Education and Training The rst part of the action plan was launched in June 2013 and focuses primarily on the eort to strengthen the international competences of Danish students and on the international learning environments that Danish institutions are involved in. In order to realise the vision of strengthening the internationalisation of Danish higher education, the rst part of the action plan comprises 31 concrete initiatives aimed at accomplishing the following 3 objectives: more students studying abroad, stronger international learning environments and better foreign language skills.1 In order to motivate students to study abroad, the Ministry of Higher Education, among other things, launched the website gribverden.dk (meaning seize the world) in 2013. The website serves as an information portal to confront the notion that it is dicult to organise studying abroad. The aim of the website and the accompanying Facebook page is to facilitate student debate and to provide students with knowledge of and inspiration to studying abroad via contributions from higher education institutions, private organisations and other students. Denmark - an attractive study destination The second part of the action plan was launched in April 2014 and focuses on how Denmark can attract and also retain talented international students in the future. Read more about the action plan for attracting and retaining international students: 2 Denmark actively promotes its Higher Education Insti tutions and their programmes by way of the study portal, studyindenmark.dk and its aliatedsocial media platforms. The portal aims at supplying potential future students with relevant information about e.g. what to study and where, whom to contact, where to live and how to thrive, student careers, jobfutures, rights and regulations. An ongoing active dialogue with Danish Higher Educa tion Institutions, international students, Danish Embassies and the Danish Innovation Centers keeps the information concurrent, and relevant forinternational markets. Each year about 900,000 users visit the webpage in order to nd information about studying in Denmark. In 2015 the studyindenmark.dk site plans to increase its current reach by investing one million Danish kroner in an expanded content and marketing strategy. The strategy will primarily be aimed at new and growing markets, but also European markets will benet from the strategy.

With nearly one in 5 secondary school age children and a quarter of adults obese, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health calls for prevention, early intervention - andcollective action. It's certainly one of the biggest public health threats facing the UK, and was recently dubbed by new NHS England Chief Executive Simon Stevens as 'the new smoking'. A quarter of adults and one in 5 school children are now obese, up from 15% just 20 years ago. It's no surprise that diabetes and other obesity related conditions are on the up too. The result of this increase is costing the NHS - a service severely under strain - an estimated \u00a35bn a year. What's most concerning is that these conditions are increasingly developing earlier in life. So what was once expected to occur in adulthood, now actually become apparent at a much younger age. In fact, it was announced last year that hospitals in England and Wales had seen a four-fold increase in the number of children being admitted with conditions linked totheir weight. Collective action Action must be taken, and it must be taken soon if we are to win the race against this ever increasing problem. Overweight or obese children are much more likely to become overweight or obese adults, so getting it right in childhood is essential if the UK is to shake o its title as the 'fat man of Europe.' This is by no means an easy task though - if it was, it would have been solved many years ago. What's needed is collective action from many groups of people including healthcare professionals, thegovernment, parents, food manufacturers, supermar- kets and advertisers. There are role models in the community such as pharmacists, school nurses and midwives who are advocates for healthy living by promoting healthy eating. By contrast, in Brussels, legislators work hard to regulate the sugar contents of toddler milks. The question is - what steps can be taken to make a real dierence on a wider scale? Food and politics The RCPCH, as part of the Academy of Medical RoyalColleges (AoMRC), made a series of recommendations as part of the Academy's 'Measuring up' Report, which launched back in February 2013. Many of these recommendations begin in the classroom - educating children early on what constitutes a healthy meal and teaching them how to cook at a younger age. There is also an emphasis on supporting parents to make healthier food choices.Policies we stand by today and policies still needing to be incorporated in all school syllabuses. Alongside the Academy's report, the call for improve- ment in schools accelerated from the classroom to the canteen, with initiatives launching such as 'The School Food Plan,' led by the Children's Food Trust, and supported by a number of organisations including the RCPCH. Over the last year, the number of children eating school dinners has also dropped. So whilst school meals have become healthier - thanks to campaigns like Jamie Oliver's 'Food Foundation' and the School Food Plan - it's clear that more work needs to be done to make them more appealing for the children who eat them. Menus don't necessarily have to dropHealth and Social Care 180Health and Social Care burgers in favour of salads and couscous, but the ingredients used in these 'attractive' meals could beadapted so they are healthier and more nutritious. But it's not that simple. Families' lives are busier than ever before so cooking from scratch is becoming a thing of the past. The price of food has also rocketedover the years making buying fresh food much more dicult for families living on lower incomes. The healthy option must be the easy option, and we can only do that with support from the government, food manufacturers and supermarkets. That's why, as part of the 'Measuring up' report, we ask all supermarkets to provide clear labelling on products and to ensure deals on fresh food are as prominent as those on confectionary. We would recommend a one-year pilot of a 20% tax on sugary drinks. Despite further evidence conrming this measure would be benecial, together with back ing from the Chief Medical Ocer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, there remains reluctance to make this a reality. But bold strategies are required if there is serious intent to make an impact. Food promotion - especially that of fast food - aects children's food choices, parents' purchase behaviour and ultimately consumption. This is why we want to see a ban on fast food advertising before the 9pmwatershed and a restriction on new takeaway restaurants being established within short distance of schools and colleges. The Marathon A combination of measures need to be put in place to begin tackling obesity eectively, and at the heart ofany overarching plan must be tackling the problem in pregnancy and childhood. If healthy eating and active lifestyles become a part of this country's culture - and people whatever their income and whatever their background are supported to make that real - we're much more likely to make inroads. As with all marathons, there will be challenges. But a collective eort with direct support from a range of organisations and individuals can improve the health for children and young people. This campaign demands greatercollaboration in changing times. Truly, food of Paediatrics and Child Health Nutrition Committee www.rcpch.ac.uk Halting the rise in ob esity Obesity is a worldwide problem that can lead to other healthcare challenges. Jo\u00e3o Breda and Margarida Moreira dos Santos from the World Health Organization (WHO) detail how they are helping to tackle the problem... The core mission of the World Health Organization (WHO) is to address public health on a global scale. This is tackled by monitoring health trends, providing leadership on matters critical to health, articulating policy options for health and shaping the health research agenda. In September 2011, the United Nations held a Summit Meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the second high-level meeting of its kind ever held to focus on a global disease issue. Two years later, in the 66th World Health Assembly, the WHO Member States have agreed on 9 voluntary global NCD targets, one of which is to \"halt the riseon diabetes and obesity\" by 20251. Over 50% of the adult population in Europe is over- weight, and at least half of those adults are obese. Obesity prevalence has tripled in many countries since the 1980s. It is already responsible for 2-8% of health costs and 10-13% of deaths in dierent parts of the region, and the numbers of those aected continue to rise at an alarming rate, particularly among children. Excess weight drastically increases a person's risk of developing a number of NCDs, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Together with chronic respiratory diseases and mental disorders, these 5 health conditions are responsible for a large part of the disease burden inEurope, accounting for an estimated 86% of the deaths and 77% of the diseases burden in the 53 countries covered by the WHO European Region. The risk of developing more than one of these diseases (co-morbidity) also increases with increasing body weight. Obesity became a primary focus of current worldwide eorts to tackle the increasing epidemic of NCDs, which are worldwide severe public health problems.Obesity can be attributed by large to social changes, since obesity has been related to diet and physical inactivity. Both societies and governments need to act to curb the epidemic. National policies should encourage and provide opportunities for greaterphysical activity, and improve the aordability, availability and accessibility of healthy foods. They should also encourage the involvement of dierent government sectors, civil society, the private sectorand other stakeholders. To assist on these matters, the Nutrition, PhysicalActivity and Obesity Program at the WHO Regional Oce for Europe in Copenhagen develops norms and standards, provides technical support and building capacity, guidance and public health tools to helpcountries implement eective programs and addressrisk factors, amongst other actions. Highlights on the ongoing work at the region level include establishing the world-leading Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (for primary school children) and providing innovative technical advice to Member States in the full range of policy areas (including recent work on nutrient prole models that countries can use as a tool to implement the recommendations on restrictions on marketing of unhealthy food to children) and producing guiding documents on governance. In September of the current year, the Food and Nutri tion Action Plan was endorsed by the WHO Regional Committee for Europe2. This was a major breakthrough towards the promotion of healthy food environments for everybody and throughout life. It should be used by Member States to adopt specic measures related to the coordination of trade, food and agricultural policies with the protection andpro motion of public health, encourage consumers toHealth and Social Care 182Health and Social Care demand for healthy foods and meals and promote healthy nutrition of infants and young children. Tailored to each country, measures on both increasing public awareness and facilitating healthy choicesneeds to be adopted. Policy makers may consider: creating healthy food and drink environments and encouraging physical activity for all population groups, promoting healthy diets throughout life, especially for the most vulnerable (e.g. promoting, protecting andsupporting exclusive breastfeeding in the rst months and introducing healthy school meals and school fruit schemes as standard), reinforcing health systems to promote healthy diets (nutritional counselling and obesity management should be available) and engage everyone in making change (e.g. engaging governmen- taldepartments outside the health sector and identi- fying joint goals and actions, in a health-in-all-policies approach). National recommendations should support a diet that is healthy, aordable, accessible to all, culturally acceptable and environmentally sustainable. The WHO recommends adults to walk, cycle or make sports 150 minutes per week, since this can signicantly reduce the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, breast and colon cancer and depres sion, keeps bones strong and helps weight control. However, 6 in 10 adults never or seldom exer cise or play sport, and 3 in 10 never engage in any kind of physical activity at all (average for theEuropean Union). Increasing physical activity is a soci- etal, not just an individual responsibility. Promoting physical activity demands a population-based, multi- sectoral, multi-disciplinary and culturally relevant approach. A Physical Activity Strategy is under development, to be adopted next year. Individuals should be supported in following the recommendations, through sustained political commitment and the collaboration of many public and private stakeholders; regular physical activityshould be promoted and healthier dietary choices available, aordable and easily accessible to all - especially those of poor and disadvantage groups,who appear to be more exposed to at least some unhealthy food. Overweight and obesity are more common in low socioeconomic groups and, in some countries, the gap is widening, thereby contributing to growing inequalities in health3. The WHO considers health a fundamental human right, and directs allits eorts to assure that everyone has the highest possible level of health. 1Global Action Plan for The Prevention and Control of Non-communi- cable Diseases 2013-2020.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) - mainly diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory disease are major threats to public health in the 21st Century. An estimated 36 million deaths, or 63% of all deaths globally in 2008, were due to NCDs 1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represent the largest percentage of these deaths and is consistently ranked as the number one cause of death in the world. Low and middle-income countries bear a higher burden, of deaths caused by CVD, than high-income countries that have better access to human and nancial resources 2. The impact that NCDs have on both a family level and an economic level is catastrophic and aects all of us. NCDs are associated with the extreme social burdens of prolonged disability, diminished resources, reducedproductivity and tremendous demand on health systems. Cumulative economic losses to low- and middle-income countries due to NCDs are estimatedto surpass USD $7tn over the period 2011-2025 (an average of nearly USD $500bn per year) 3. This is mainly due to the fact that people are dying from NCDs, including CVD, in their most productive years. Early detection is essential in ghting the growing trend of CVD. Often there are no symptoms or warning signs and a heart attack or stroke could be the rstoutward indication of underlying disease in the blood vessels. Fortunately, most CVD can be prevented by addressing risk factors such as tobacco use andharmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and obesity,physical inactivity, high blood pressure, diabetes and raised blood lipids. In addition access to aordable health care is critical for prevention and control of CVD . At the 66th World Health Assembly last year the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed theHealth and Social Care 184Health and Social Care Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020. The main objectives are to reduce exposure to risk factors and to strengthen health systems capacity to address NCDs including CVD to improve early detection and equitable care of peoplewith or at high risk of a NCD. It serves as a road mapfor governments to take coordinated actions to lower the risk NCDs by making evidence based policies. Policies that create conducive environments formaking healthy choices aordable and available are vital for motivating people to adopt and continue healthy behaviour. If a combination of cost-eective health-care interventions and population-wide interventions is implemented in a sustainablemanner, a signicant impact can be made on the burden of CVD. A population-based approach would target risk factors that CVD, diabetes and cancer have in common such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco use 2.The aim is to reduce exposure to behavioural risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use by increasing taxes and mandating warning labels on products. Implementing awareness campaigns around theharmful use of tobacco, alcohol and salt have also been shown to be eective. The regulation and reduc tion of marketing for tobacco products, alcohol, and foods high in salt, sugar and trans-fatty acids, especially to children, can help decrease CVD. Maintaining at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week is another paramount factor in the prevention of CVD. Governments can do their part by creating public policies promoting physical activity and utilise cross sectoral collaboration in transport, education, workforce, sport, and urban design. In addition to these population based measures, toreduce the cardiovascular disease burden individual interventions to reduce total cardiovascular risk need to be implemented through a primary health care approach. The WHO's Global Action Plan strives to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by 25% by 2025. WHO and other UN Organizations support national eorts with upstream policy advice and tech- nical assistance, ranging from helping governments to set national targets and to implement cost eective interventions. 1Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)Fact sheet N\u00b0317. Updated March, 2013 by WHO 2From Burden to \"Best Buys\": Reducing the Economic Impact of Non-Communicable Diseases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. 2011 study by WHO and the World Economic Forum. 3Global status report on noncommunicable diseases for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health World Health Organization (WHO) www.who.int 185 Oleg Chestnov, Assistant Director-General, Cluster for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental HealthOver the last 50 years, the fight against cardiovascular disease has attained immense success, and improvements in medical and surgical care have been the main reason for the prolonged life expectancy in \"western\" countries. The main achievements -heart valve replacement, coronary bypass surgery, antihypertensive, lipid lowering, anti heart failure and antithrombotic treatments, pharmacological and mechanical reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction, as well as electric therapy for cardiac arrhythmias have all been shown to reduce mortality in the most frequent cardiac diseases. Increased awareness of the negative effects of smoking and unhealthy lifestyle may have contributed to mitigate the detrimental effects of the contemporary urban society on the cardiovascular system. All these obvious improvements in care have resulted in increasing numbers of survivors with advanced cardiac disease, and in an aging population whose primary cause of inability and death will be cardiovascular. On the other hand, countries with an emerging economy are now experiencing the impact of an increasing burden of dismetabolic cardiovascular disease. Projections to 2030 predict doubling of the current global burden of diabetes, with its cardiovascular sequelae. This fast changing landscape will need a drastic shift in strategy toward themanagement of cardiac disease, with reduced diagnostic but increased preventive and therapeutic commitment from the health care systems. Prevention of cardiovascular disease (or promotion of cardiovascular health) is a task for political and social planning, as well as for primary medical care. Facilitation of physical activity, tight restrictions againstsmoking, and availability of low-cost drugs to treat hypertension, diabetes and dislipidemia should form the basis of sustainable primary prevention both in high income and lower income countries. In this area, high-tech expensive diagnostic examinations have almost no yield and no incremental value over the very basic clinical examination and first line diagnostics, such as the electrocardiogram and a handful of biochemistries. Widespread use of this simple approach and surveillance of patient compliance to first line treatments has the tremendous potential of reducing the global burden of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. A similar approach, butwith more oriented treatment goals should be applied to secondary prevention. However, the management of high- risk and complicated cases requires sound expertise, adequate technology and more clinical research in orphan areas. The high-tech care of high-risk cases is increasing with fast pace, due to industrial support. The typesA double-faced strategy to prevent and improve the outcome in myocardial infarction 186and numbers of sophisticated and expensive devices are expanding continuously, though the time required to prove long-term efficacy is longer than the time required todevelop more efficient models. Therefore, once a device has been proven effective (or ineffective), it is also obsolete, being surpassed by new technology. Also, cost-effective - ness of new technologies remains in most cases disputable and restricted to high-income countries or patients. Treatment strategies which do not necessarily involve high-tech, butrequire expertise and sound clinical judgement evolve more slowly. This field of research is seldom supportedby any industrial budget, remains the playground for passionate clinical scientists, and should be funded by academical and political bodies. An example of this endeavour are the studies on the treatment of acute coronary syndromes in high-risk patients, such as the elderly, thosewith chronic kidney dysfunction and those with cardiogenic shock. This kind of independent front-line research is the mission pursued by some investigators, such as thoseworking at the Cardiovascular Department of Manzoni Hospital in Lecco, Italy, with their manycollaborators around the country and elsewhere. In the Italian Elderly ACS study, dr Stefano Savonitto (director of Cardiology at Manzoni Hospital) and 23 collaborating Centers of the Italian Society of Inteventional Cardiology (GISE) have investigatedPROFILEtreatment strategies for elderly patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes, showing that those at higher ischemic risk benefit from an almost 60 percent reduction in follow-up cardiac events when treated using an aggressive interventional approach. The ongoing Elderly ACS 2 trial is aimed at refining pharmacological strategies in elderly patients with an ACS undergoing urgent angioplasty. Efforts to improve outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock are also frustrating and only a few groups of investigators dare to undertake clinical trials in this condition still causing almost 50% mortality during hospital stay. The European Union is currently supporting the largest of these efforts, the Culprit-Shock study, chaired by Professor Holger Thiele at the University of Schleswig-Holstein in Lubeck and involving 10 European countries. Investigators at Manzoni Hospital in Lecco are coordinating the Italian contribution to this study. Patients with advanced kidney dysfunction are also at particularlyhigh risk in the event of an acute coronary syndrome, and should deserve more attention and tailored interventional strategies. This is also an area of particular expertise at Manzoni Hospital where a dedicated trial to improve outcome in thesepatients is currently under planning. Finally, since life expectancy is continuously increasing, the study and prevention of coronary disease in women after menopause is a new area which has been undeserved. Hormone replacement therapy has been discarded after initial negative trials focussing on late treatment in secondary prevention, a fact that has discouraged further research. Coronary intervention in the acute phase is made more difficult, as compared to men, and there has been a lack of materials dedicated to women, who often have smallercoronary arteries. The ongoing Ladies ACS study is investigating the relationship between menopausal age, established cardiovascular risk factors and severity of coronary artery disease in the post-menopausalDr Stefano Savonitto Director of acute myocardial infarction. The results of this study, a collaboration of Manzoni Hospital and 8 cardiology Centers in Italy analysed in the sophisticated Rome Imaging angiographic corelab, led by Professor Francesco Prati, willbe presented in 2015 in a major medical congress. PROFILETackling cardiovascular diseases Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and President of the European Heart Network, highlights the eects of cardiovascular diseases and the progress made to drive down deaths as a result... Cardiovascular disease (CVD) blights the lives of millions of people across Europe every year. From the tiniest newborn burdened with a congenital heart defect to a great grandmother ght ing a daily battle against heart failure, it can aect anyone at any stage in their life. The eects can be devastating, and in the worst cases fatal. Mending these broken hearts has been the mission of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) for more than 50 years and still the ght goes on. Signicant progress has been made to drive down the number of deaths from CVD across Europe in the last 10 years. In many countries death rates have more than halved since the early 1980s. In the UK this has been driven by decades of research, much of which has been funded by the BHF. Thanks to years of ground-breaking science and our determination to push for more life-saving treatments, we are signi- cantly better equipped to ght cardiovascular disease. More people are surviving a heart attack because we now know that early stenting or thrombolysis to break down the blood clots and reopen an artery immediately is the most eective treatment. Thanks to a scientic breakthrough in the genetics behind hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pioneered by BHF researchers, we can now identify people atgreater risk of sudden cardiac death. Important legislative changes have also paved the way for a healthier nation, such as the banning of smoking in public places. But the work is not doneyet. Although the news that CVD death rates are falling across Europe is encouraging, CVD remains a leading cause of death in Europe, claiming 4 million lives each year. There also remains an unacceptable divide in survival rates between countries in Europe. In central and eastern Europe overall death rates are generally higher than elsewhere. Health and Social Care 188Health and Social Care As the newly appointed President of the European Heart Network an early task will be to meet withmembers from these countries to share knowledge on how to reduce the number of people dying from CVD. But even for those countries that appear to be doing better, the challenge of tackling inequalitieslies within their own borders. For example, in the UK a person living in Glasgow ismore than 4 times as likely to die prematurely fromcardiovascular disease (CVD) than someone living in Hart in Hampshire. We must do more to tackle this postcode lottery in the UK by understanding why these inequalities exist and helping prevent people from developing CVD in the rst place. But that's not the only challenge we are facing. Obesity levels are high and increasing across Europe in both children and adults, increasing the risk of peopledeveloping coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and some cancers. In the UK almost two thirds of adults are overweight or obese which paints a worrying picture. Leading an inactive lifestyle is also becoming increasingly common across Europe and smoking remains a serious health concern, with nearly 1 in 5 adults in the UK smoking. We have the power to change our cardiovascular health for the better, to help protect against these devastating conditions, but unfortunately the message still isn't getting through. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) set targets to reduce preventable deaths from non- com municable diseases by 25% by 2025. If the UK and other European countries are to meet this target then we need to do more to promote health prevention policies, engaging political leadership at all levels, communities and individuals in a shared endeavour to save lives. Important steps have already been made to help peoplemake healthier choices such as increasing the size of health warnings on cigarettes packets and introducing front-of-pack labelling to food and drink products. We must keep building on our past successes if weare to save more lives. That's why the BHF is pushing for the introduction of a 9pm watershed ban on junk food marketing to children in the UK, to help stop young people being tempted into making unhealthy choices. We also want the UK government to nalise legislation that will strip tobacco products of their glitzy packag ing to prevent more people taking up this dangerous addiction. By working with colleagues from other heart patients' groups we can also push for changes beyond our own borders. The European Parliament has recently passed the EU Tobacco Products Directive - a law which aims to make cigarettes less attractive to children by enforcing tighter restrictions on the tobacco industry. These include new regulations on e-cigarettes and changes to health warnings. This landmark legislation marks an extremely positive step but we must put the pressure on all European countries to bring their national law into line as soon as possible. Research is key to winning our shared ght. So we are also closely following the proposed EU Data Protection Regulation which has the potential to seriously inhibit vital research involving patient data which is currently being conducted across Europe. To protect potentially life-saving research we will be working with our European partners to make sure the proposed regulation is amended. By working together in this way we can help drive down CVD deaths across Europe even further, bringing us ever closer to a world without heart Chief Executive - British Heart Foundation President - European Heart Network www.bhf.org.uk 189Improv ing mental health ser vices throughout Europe John Bowis, President of Health First Europe details how community care can support better mental health services in Europe... My rst involvement with mental health on the European stage was working with the 1999 Finnish Presidency initiative on mental health promotion. Later, as the rapporteur of theEuropean Parliamentary Report on improving themental health of the population - towards a strategy on mental health for the EU, l had the opportunityto open the European debate on mental health and mental illness. Since then, several initiatives have been carried out at the European level to promote services for mental health, raise awareness and minimise the stigma of mental disease. However, despite recent actions at European level, such as the Joint Action Plan on Mental Health and Well-being, many European countries continue toneglect mental health services by under-resourcing the sector. For example, between one-third and one- half of people with disorders do not receive treat ment1. One of the major reasons behind the gap between the needs of citizens and the availability of mental health services is the lack, or inadequateprovision of, community services. Where we can improve mental health services In 2006, Members of the European Parliament agreed with my Parliamentary report2that while health has continued to be prioritised on European and national agendas, European healthcare systems have not been able to overcome 5 key flaws elevating mental health as part of the public health agenda. Namely: the inadequacy of community services; the failure to listen to service users and their carers;the inability or unwillingness of dierent agencies to work together; serious underfunding; and a policy for mental health promotion that is in most countries notable by its almost complete absence. To tackle these obstacles, there is a clear need for improved community care policies that are aimed atre-organising care around the patient. For mentalhealthcare, this is especially important because many common conditions such as depression and anxiety are often highly treatable, but too often patients mustt into a system that does not oer adequate funding for mental healthcare services, does not have theappropriate stang to treat common mental health conditions, and does not provide easy access for patients to specialised services. Strengthening mental healthcare services Europe's role in promoting mental health services is often controversial, given the principle of subsidiarity on health related issues. However, the EU can play an important role in supporting the expansion of mental health services by sharing best practices in community care, strengthening anti-discrimination rules where applicable, and by supporting employment policies which incentivise private companies to adopt internal policies to support employees aected by mental-illness3and promote the mental wellbeing of all their workforce. Additionally, the EU should continue to drive the shift of national health systems towards primary care byHealth and Social Care 190Health and Social Care incentivising care in the community. To achieve this, Health First Europe developed a model which provides a road map for Member States to the substantive changes required to release the value and power of community care services for all citizens, including those suering from mental health conditions. AsHonorary President of Health First Europe, I believe that this model provides a strong basis for generating EU action on mental health and supporting Member States to nd ways to better support primary care professionals to diagnose, treat and manage mental illness. The Health First Europe Model outlines 6 areas of needed reform, all applicable to the provision of mental health services: 1. Community Care Policy: Establishment of a dedi cated community care policy and political leadership to implement the policy; 2. Patient-Centric Care: A system designed in response to citizen health needs;3. Innovation and Value: Incentivising innovative solutions involving key actors (citizens, carers, technology) across the health system of value to improve health outcomes for the well-being of citizens and society;4. Access and Reimbursement: Flexible funding to increase access to innovative community care solutions including community care products, treatments and services; 5. Care and Treatment: Creating a mobile and flexi ble health and social care workforce bound to the citizen, not the system; 6. Quality Care and Standards: Generating quality of care assurance in the community. The implementation of needed reforms should begin at EU level under the new Commissioner- designate for Health, Vytenis Andriukaitis. By creatinga dedicated policy on community care at EU level, the EU can take the lead with Member States to develop best practices on community care services which better support mental health services. After almost 15 years of closely following EU develop-ments on mental health, I believe it is time to support signicant changes to health organisation and help citizens receive the treatment they need and deservefor mental health conditions. 1Making Mental Health Count, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 8 July 2014 2European Parliament resolution on improving the mental health of the population.

Even Platon (42 3-374 BC), in his work called \"Politeia\", makes age a subject of discussion focusing, however, on the aspects of experiencing age. He underlines the individuality of age and describes the phase of aging as being deter- mined by one's lifestyle in youth and mid-adulthood (cf. Schubert & Zyzik, 1968). Lehr (2003) establishes that here is historical evidence for the widespread assumption that gero-prophylaxis starts in early life. According to the saying \"You made your bed, now sleep in it\", everybody would be responsible for his aging? Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately, it is not that easy. Just imagine the pressure that would arise if this was the case. In truth, aging is a multidimensional, multifactorial and multidirectional scenario, and with \"pattern of aging\" (Lowton, 1999; Thomae 1979) it was even given a specific technical term. Meanwhile, the proportion of older people in the overall population has risen worldwide. Thus, the question now increasingly being asked is -to what degree and under what circumstances can older people maintain their inde- pendence? Since 1991 Prof. Dr. Oswald and his employees have studied this question in a longitudinal study. On the one hand, the aim was to identify factors being significantly correlated with the maintenance of independence; on the other hand, investigations should reveal how far intervention approaches fostering mental and physical performances on several levels could help to maintain independence in old age. In intervention gerontology, there are 3 approaches of particular importance: Medical perspective: prevention -health education and promotion of healthIndependence in old age - a training in practice 192Gerontological psychological per spective: measures to foster cognitive performance and to psychologically handle emerging crises. Sports science perspective: measures to foster physical performance, prevention and therapy measures. Additionally, in his 2002-2003 research project \"Rehabilitation in Nursing Homes for the Elderly\", Prof. Dr. Oswald and his team examined the question whether the remaining independence of people living in nursing homes could be maintained and fostered on a cognitive and functional level. In the following, results gained from the studies and lessons learned from working with the training program are presented. 1. The prevention study \"Independence in Old Age\" (SimA\u00ae-50+) At the beginning of the study in 1991, the 375 participants were aged 75 to 93 years. The training phase lasted almost one year. The participants met once a week and trained for a total of 90 minutes. Each session comprised 45 minutes of cognitive training and 45 minutes of psychomotor training. Between 1992 and 1996 extensive medical and psychological follow-up assessments were conducted annually.PROFILE 1991-0,6-0,4-0,200,20,40,60,8 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996z-Value Cognitive Status (1992-1996 lineare Regression, 1991-1996 p global Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test 2-sided, falling number of cases)Memory and Psychomotor training Control Group Fig. 1. Cognitive performances, Oswald, 2012 SimA\u00ae 50+ in keywordsWhen examining the aspects \"cognitive performances\", \"health\" and \"independence\" it was noted that in all aspects the participants of the intervention group had important advantages over the participants of the control group. In all aspects, the participants of the intervention group were able to achieve a growth which they could maintain over the years in comparison to the control group. Up to 2005, the participants were also tested for dementia in line with the World Health Organization criteria. Altogether, even almost 15 years after the start of the study, a significantly smaller number of cases of dementia was found than might have been expected from the participants' age. Only 10% of the participants suffered from dementia even though the youngest participant in 2005 was already 89 years old. 1932. The intervention study - SimA\u00ae-P Rehabilitation in Nursing Homes for the Elderly At the beginning of the study in 2002, 294 participants were aged 70 to 90 years. All participants of the geriatric facility were in need of care, i.e. they were classified accordingly by the care insurance. Two days a week, the participants of the intervention groups underwent a 60 minute training, respectively, in the inpatient facility. The training session consisted of 20 minutes of psychomotor activation, 30 minutes of cognitive activation and 10 minutes of relaxation. Regularly, several abilities of the participants of the inter- vention groups and the control groups were examined. Among them were: general cognitive performance, memory functions, the aspects of the activities of daily life (ADL) such as mobility, food/clothes, furthermore hygiene, emotional state, depressiveness, quality of life, functional performance, strength, mobility, falls and frequency of falls. In all aspects besides hygiene, a significant positive change could be achieved. The quality of life of all participants of the intervention groups was sustainably increased, memory functions and cognitive performance could be improved and due to an improvement of strength and mobility the frequency of falls could be reduced.

The Mini-Mental Status Test is used as a diagnostic tool for dementia. Here evidence was provided that all participants improved their abilities, and the process of decline could also be decelerated considerably. Additionally, the training had a positive side-effect on the staff of the participating facilities. Their job satisfaction improved. 3. Conclusion - SimA\u00ae in Practice We use this program in day-care centers for senior citizens with a focus on dementia and, additionally, we offer SimA\u00ae courses in cooperation with local facilities (Senior Citizens' Office, Adult Education Center). At the beginning of 2012, we only worked with the book material to check if we, as day-care facility, can work with it. Several female employees were educated as SimA\u00ae trainers and we have extended our work with this program. Since our guests visit us between 1 to 5 days a week, the extent they benefit from the training varies. Paul Bomke CEO 194Every day, we offer one training group. The training con- tents can be adjusted to the individual physical and mental abilities. Even in case of advanced dementia it is still possi- ble to experience a feeling of success. In the training groups in cooperation with Senior Citizens' Offices and Adult Education Centers, we offer this program as a prevention service. The side effect of social activity in a group additionally supports the success of the training program. In summary, not only the results of the conducted studies are positive, but also the lessons learned from our practice of implementation. Especially the possibility to have a preventive effect on one's independence distinguishes this program from others. Particularly impressive is the observation that, thus, the deficit-orientated way of looking at man can be changed. This holds true for female employees, female team leaders, relatives of persons suffering from dementia, patients with dementia themselves and the aging human as such. Abilitiesyou have not been aware of are discovered, lost abilities are found and other abilities are saved from being lost. Last but not least the myth that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks is broken. You can learn at any age, just the method and the speed are different. PROFILE Author: Rita Becker-Scharwatz, Dipl.

Hospital Caterers Association (HCA) National Chair, Andy Jones outlines how the Association consistently promotes, develops and implements standards throughout the 4 Nations to ensure they are adhered to... Food is the best form of medicine when you are ill. Whether it is in hospital, in care or in your own home, you look for food that will assist in your recovery, and make you feel better. As the recovery progresses you look for more nutritious foods which assists in your recuperation. The standard of catering in hospitals is one of the highest priorities. As such, it is key that menus and beverage choice meet and are suitable for the patient groups as well as being flexible in both their oering and adaptability. Good nutritious food helps patients to recover quicker, which means caterers have just as importantrole to play as the clinicians. Therefore it is important for all members of the clinical care team, as well as caterers, to recognise the role that it can play toimproving the patient's clinical outcome. As part of a wide-ranging drive to raise standards of hospital food across the UK, the NHS now has a Food Standards Plan for England. Plus we have the 'Food in Hospitals, National Catering and Specication for Food and Fluid Provision in Hospitals in Scotland'1; 'The All Wales Catering and Nutrition Standards for Food and Fluid Provision for Hospital Inpatients'2, and 'Promoting Good Nutrition - the '10 A Day' strategyfor good nutritional care for adults in all care settings in Northern Ireland'3. Hospitals will be ranked on food quality for NHS patients and sta. The recent PLACE in England results have once again highlighted the disparity in spend in patient food across the NHS. The Association has shown by caterersleading that costs need not rise, so the HCA is still calling for a mandatory minimum expenditure on all patient meals to be introduced in ALL Trusts across the UK. However until this happens, HCA Members are tasked with getting their CEOs and Directors of Nursing on-side to make their Trust/Organisation's Food and drink Plan a Board issue and to embed food and drinkas part of the patient's recovery plan. With a better protocol in place for every single patient which can be followed by all members of the team - from ward to kitchen and throughout a patient's stay - patients will then receive the optimum nutritional care they expect and deserve. For sta and visitors the emphasis is on healthy eating. Their wellbeing also impacts the patient's recovery, so ensuring that we oer a balance ofhealthy choices foremost is something that caterers must lead upon. To assist in this aim we are ensuringthe healthy dishes/options are more cost eective and we are encouraging our Members to put the calorie content on the menus for sta and visitors, making it easier for them to choose a healthier diet. The new Hospital Food Plan for NHS England goes a long way in helping to achieve this. We know there are people who want nutritional standards made mandatory, however these are already in place with the British Dietetic Association 'Food Counts Digest'. These are the standards which every caterer in the UK has to achieve in all the menus they provide; and when I say the UK, for the HCA that means the 4 Nations. As England welcomes the introduction of the newstandards, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have been working to standards for several years. We don't need to re-invent the wheel; we just need to ensure that people adhere to them. By working with and listening to the patients we serve, we can provide menus and dishes they want toeat. That can vary according to the patient group as one size does not t all. We not only have to cover the dierent age groups, we are now into an ageing population and obesity is on the rise. We are also mindful of rising malnutrition, which we believe coststhe NHS more than obesity, and which will grow withthe ageing population as the challenges in social care become more prevalent. There needs to be far greater recognition of the nutri tional value of food in the treatment of patients. This is why we support and work with one of our fellow organisations, the National Association of Care Catering (NACC) to raise awareness and improveunderstanding of good nutrition and hydration and toprotect the NHS from the burden malnutrition of the elderly patients will undoubtedly place on the budget. For patients, the emphasis is on eating for good health, and for sta and visitors as already mentioned, healthy eating and we need to focus on that. This is something that has been driven through in the various guides we have published, and indeed utilise, and in the campaigns we are running, and we are very proud that our Ward Guide is in England's Hospi tal Food Plan. One of the key elements to the HCA is ensuring thatwe have seasonal menus; the 'Buy British' idea is part of the government's buying standards mandate which could be easily met as we introduce seasonal menus. These are the things we need to get back to; strawberries for the patients in summer, English apples in the autumn, thinking about what is suitablefor the patients at the same time. Andy Jones, National Chair, Hospital Caterers AssociationHealth and Social Care 196Health and Social Care 197Whether it's from Protected Meal Times, which ensure that patients can eat their meals undisturbed, giving them the dignity they deserve, to making sure the area is well-lit; while ensuring that the meal is presentedcorrectly on the plate with a little garnish; to providingassistance in opening the packaging, it is essential that our menus and beverage choices are suitable for the patient groups we serve. To improve the quality of all aspects of continuous patient food and drink provision, the caterer should be allowed to take responsibility for the whole of the ward service to ensure consistency and support for apatient's total food and drink provision. The HCA is constantly looking at our service oering, and exploring how improvements can be made, with equal focuson the ward end - referred to as the 'last nine yards'. It's not just about meeting their food needs, it's alsoabout customer care, how you speak to patients, notjust the smile that you give, and just as important, it's how you treat them and give them time. For instance, hydration is extremely important for patients to assist in the absorption of any prescribed drugs, so we must also look at our mealtimes. Twelve noon is not a suitable mealtime if that is when hospitals have the drugs round. And that is one of the great things this Association is doing; we are challenging the status quo and changing the way we serve the meals to patients. Working with fellow associations and like minded partners we listen to what patients want, and this is the ethos I want to foster. We don't want to see patients coming back into hospital, so going back to our partnership with the NACC, we are tackling the problem of why they are coming back into hospital, especially elderly people. We are part of the PS1004group, looking at the whole aspect of public sector catering. We are also looking at what we oer to patients.We need to ensure that we use natural sugars andnatural salts more, working with the clinicians toensure we achieve a true balance, meeting both themedical needs and patients' needs. The benets of the 'Food Standards Plans' across the 4 Nations areuniversal, so we're asking all caterers to lead anddrive the Plans to ensure this standard of service is accepted as an integral part of the patient's recovery plan and sta and visitors' wellbeing. Food is a critical part of a patient's hospital experience. It needs to be nutritious, appetising and accessible to patients, their visitors and NHS sta. I am proud to lead the Association as National Chair, ensuring thatthe patients are at the core of all we do and that they are involved in their food service oer. But above all, our mission is to see that food is embedded in allhealthcare establishments, with CEO and Directors of Nursing buy-in, as part of the recovery plan. Consequently the Plans are the beginning and not the end of the process and we as Caterers have to lead this. 1Scotland - The rst standards to be implemented were in Scotland in 2008. 2Wales - 'The All Wales Catering and Nutrition Standards for Food and Fluid Provision for Hospital Inpatients' were launched in 2011 following a Welsh Audit Oce report. 3Northern Ireland - comply with 'Promoting Good Nutrition - The strategy for good nutritional care for adults in all care settings in Hospital Caterers Association NationalChair@hospitalcaterers.orgwww.hospitalcaterers.orgIt only takes a minute for chefs to appreciate the advantages of choosing induction equipment over gas or electric. Induced Energy has spent eighteen years as the UKs only manufacturer specialising in high-quality induction equipment for professional kitchens. The hobs are designed and manufac- tured at IEs factory in Brackley, Northamptonshire from where a team of engineers are on hand to provide a personal product support service. All IE products carry a two year parts and labour warranty. Catering units switching to induction have seen significant savings on energy bills - minimum power input producing maximum heat output. Induced Energy can supply single, 2-ring and 4-ring induction hobs, all of which feature the unique 0-99 power control. The hobs can either be incor- porated into the worktop (drop-in) or can stand alone. As well as being safe, clean and efficient in the kitchen, the IE 3kW table-top single ring hob is ideal for use in meeting rooms and marquees. The robust 4-ring hob can be used on a mobile cooking station with oven or storage cabinet under- neath and provides a cooking area for up to 12 pans. The innovative IE iPlate is the first full- sized hot plate that is powered by induction and is the winner of a CESA Sustainability award. With no need to switch on the unit before service, theiPlate reacts instantly on contact with the dish. The serving area and staff can be kept cool and safe - there is no danger of customers touching a hot surface - while the food is kept fresh and served at optimum temperature. Food waste is also reduced. Induced Energy has recently launched the induction Stockpot Trolley - a portable trolley which accommodates the IE single ring hob. Offering flexibility over where it is positioned in the kitchen,the trolley runs from a standard 13 amp plug. Unlike a gas stockpot, there is no need to position it under aventilation hood. Another product introduced by IE this year is the unique SLR (slimline remote) hob which will see a revolution in kitchen design. The engine is located away from the induction rings enablingInduced Energy specialist 198designers to more easily incorporate ovens, hot cupboards and fridges or to utilise additional storage space underneath the cooking surface.

PROFILE Health and Social Care 199 Promoting a healthy Europe Adjacent Government gives thought to how the European Commission are promoting sustainable health systems to create a healthier European population... The new President-elect Jean-Claude Junker and his team assumed their new role in the European Commission on November 1st. Following approval from MEP's at the end of October, the new Commissioners-designate will now follow on from where their predecessors left o. The new Commissioner for Health & Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukatis, will be following in the footsteps ofCommissioner Tonio Borg. During his years as Commissioner for Health, Commissioner Borg has shown he fully supports and understands the importance of a healthy population, constantly striving for the most ecient healthcare for Europe. In the speech on sustainable health systems in Malta, Commissioner Borg said he understood that in recent years health systems in some EU member states came under pressure due to the economic crisis. He said: \"No health system in the EU is sustainable unless it is reformed. In the absences of reforms, health spending will increase sharply due to factorssuch as population ageing, ever growing citizens' expectations, and the availability of better but costlytechnology. \"Therefore, and at the request of the Member States, the Commission has put the issue of sustainability of healthcare systems under the microscope.\" In 2014 the European Commission recommended that 16 EU countries reform their healthcare systems and were encouraged to make more cost-eective use of public resources. \"Such reforms may have high upfront costs, but in the medium to long-term they will lead to more cost- eective use of public resources, including through better coordinated delivery of health serv ices,\" said Borg. In the speech, Commissioner Borg also discussed how e-health can have a positive impact on healthcare systems, explaining that e-health can help deliver a more eective and personalised healthcare.\"It has the potential to reduce errors, and shorten hospitalisation,\" he explained. \"When applied eectively, e-health can facilitate inclusion, quality of life and patient empowerment through greater transparency, access to health services and information. \"To help realise this potential and the deployment of interoperable solutions, the Commission has set up an eective cooperation body: the e-Health Network. \"Over the past 2 years, the e-Health Network has proved its worth in securing strategic and technical agreements, for example the Patient Summary Guide lines, the forthcoming guidelines in e-Prescriptions, and the Patient Registries.\" 1 Promoting eective and quality health services is high on the agenda at the European Commission, and during his 2 year term Commissioner Borg made it his mission to ensure that all residents in Europe have access to the best possible healthcare. The EU Commission's Health Strategy, 'Together forHealth', aims to invest in sustainable health systems, in people's health as human capital, and in reducing health inequities. The Health Strategy supports the overall Europe 2020 Strategy, which aims to turn the EU into a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy promoting growth for all. This includes a population in good health. Speaking in September 2014 to The Parliament Mag- azine, Commissioner Borg discussed the importance of promoting health for economic prosperity. 2 \"As the outgoing European health commissioner, I am pleased with the progress made in the EU in promoting health both as a value in itself and as a pre-condition for economic prosperity and social cohesion. \"I am pleased that the values enshrined in the EU health strategy, such as universality, access to good quality care, equity and solidarity continue to be widely shared across Europe, in spite of the economic crisis.\" The Commissioner also commented that identifyingmore innovative and sustainable ways of managing healthcare systems is a key concern. He said: \"In this respect, the commission has helped EU countries to tackle this challenge through the European semester - the EU's annual cycle of economic policy coordination. \"Each year, the commission analyses the EU's national economic and structural reforms and provides recom mendation for the year ahead. This year, 15 EU countries received tailored recommendations linked to health systems reform.\" Handing over the responsibilities to Vytenis Andriukaitis, Borg hopes that his successor will maintain the momentum in improving health systems throughout the EU. \"As I pass the baton onto the next health com missioner, I am condent that solutions to today's healthcare and health systems related challenges are well underway. I would encourage my successor, as well as policymakers in member states to maintain the momentum in making EU health systems t for purpose.\" 2 In his introductory statement to the European Parlia ment, Andriukaitis said: \"Health is a key element of social market economy. I believe we need 'a new boost for health in Europe'.\" \"Spending on health is not just 'expenditure'. Timely and universal access to care and medicines are investments in human capital and productivity. We must thinkbeyond nancial expenditure and gain. We must thinkabout people's health as a key Social Care 200201PROFILE Cell function depends on many factors, some are specific for the process or the cell type, and others are general, required for all functions in the cells. Chromatin remodelling is one such general func- tion, required for all processes thatneed access to the DNA. DNA in all eukaryotic cells is organised with protein in a structure called chromatin. The chromatin structure has emerged to be one of the most important contributors in maintaining genome stability and in regulating gene expression. The chromatin structure is dynamic and can adopt several different states; the compact hete- rochromatin structure to the moreopen euchromatin structure. Gene expression requires accessible DNA and actively transcribed genes aremainly found in the more loosely packed euchromatin. The chromatin structure is changed in several ways, by methylations of the DNA, post translational modifications of the specific DNA binding histone proteins, or by moving the histone proteins. Several enzyme complexes are involved and often work together. Changes inthe chromatin structure are essential during the development of different tissues, and several types of chromatinremodelling have been associated with each step. Chromatin remodelling Each cell has several enzymes that are responsible for chromatin remodelling and histone modification and many ofthese complexes are redundant but in certain cases specificity for genes or processes have been demonstrated. Specific enzymes have also been asso- ciated with certain developmental transistions, such as the chromatin remodelling proteins ISWI and CHD have been associated with unpacking of the sperm chromosomes during fertilisation, in gastrulation and germ- layer formation. Other chromatin remodelling proteins, such as compo- nent of the (SMARCA4) and well as ISWI and INO80 complexes, are alsoimportant for early steps, since knock out mice never reach preimplantation. Similar results have been obtained with knock out of histone modifica- tion enzymes. Chromatin remodelling and brain One of the most complex tissues in the human body is the brain. It con- sists of several types of neurons and non-neuronal cells, all of which specif- ically respond to several environmental signals and neurotransmitters. The response in the brain is heavily relying on remodelling of the chromatin structure, and the different cell types exhibit different set up of chromatin remodelling and histone modifying enzymes. Many of the components are isoforms specifically expressed in the brain, either under the control of specific brain factors or by microRNAs. These complexes in turn recruited to brain specific genes by specific tran-Chromatin remodelling and histone modifications in the brain scription factors regulate the chro- matin structure. Chromatin remodelling and neuronal development Embryogenesis is driven by environ- mental signalling pathways that induce the expression of specific genes at certain stages. During differentiation into different cells types, the chromatin landscape changes due to the activa- tion of developmental transcription factors and chromatin remodelling complexes. This results in the induc- tion or silencing of specific genes, and gives rise to the cell specific expres- sion of the seen in different cell types. Keeper of pluripotency Cells early in development, referred to as embryonic stem cells (ES cells), have the capacity to divide and to develop into many different cell types. They are characterised by specific post translational modifications at developmental genes; they carry both active and silent marks (H3k4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively). This bivalent mark gives the opportunity to either close or open up the genes during differentiation. The self-renewal and pluropotent states are kept by activation of environmental signalling pathways, transcription factors, and chromatin remodelling complexes. The transcription factors involved are Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, all of which are important to regulate developmental genes. The expression of these genes also reprograms already differentiatedcells, such as fibroblasts, into induced pluripotent cells (iPS), less mature cells that can differentiate to different cell types. The core transcription factors require several chromatin remodelling complexes to function properly and keep the chromatin landscape in ES cells in the right state. Specific forms of SWI/SNF complex, the esSWI/SNF, with the subunits BRG1 (SMARCA4), and BAF 45a are required to activate pluripotency genes. A CHD containing complex, NURD and histone demethylases LSD1, are required to silence pluripotency genes and necessary in differentiation. Recently, it was shown that BRG1 and BAF250a interact with NURD, which suggests that the factors act in fine tuning the state of the pluripotency genes. Driver of differentiation Different signalling pathways induce differentiation genes, inducing spe- cific lineages. Chromatin remodelling complexes are important contributors in different lineages, for gene activa- tion or repression. Different CHD pro- teins have been shown to operate in the differentiation of spleen and in osteogenensis, while histone deacety- lases are involved in the differentia- SWI/SNF complexes are involved in the devel- opment of neurons and the central nerve system. The neuron specific SWI/SNF complex contains specificisoforms of, such as BAF45c and BAF53b, BAF60c and a further protein, CREST. The switch in subunitsdepends on the expression of these subunits, but also on the expressionof neuron specific mirRNA. The neuron specific SWI/SNF complex will then be recruitment to neuronal specific genes. Other subunits must also be changed, since a large study of expression of chromatin and epigenetic genes in cortical neurons compared to ES cells, demonstrated that the ATPase BRM (SMARCA2) inSWI/SNF is expressed me3,and EZD1, for H3K27me3, are highly expressed in together with the argenine methylase PRMT8. \"The chromatin structure has emerged to be one of the most important contributors in maintaining genome stability and in regulating gene expression. \" Challenges All the interactions in the gene expres- sion network driving embryogenesis and development are not fully elusi- dated. Activating other pathways to activate the core stem cell transcrip- tion factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog has resulted in a different ES cells, with different DNA methylation pattern and expression pattern of key genes. This 2iES cells has been proposed to represent an earlier state in embryo- genesis from the commonly used ES cells. These results raise new ques- tions about the order of events in development. Furthermore, develop- ment of the neuronal tissue and the function in the adult brain are poorly understood.

Defects in ribosome biogenesis, a process required in all cells, result in intellectual disabilities and defects in haematopoiesis. We have isolated a chromatin remod- elling complex involved in transcrip- tion of ribosomal RNA, the B-WICH, complex, whose components are deleted in Williams syndrome. It is tempting to speculate that some of the symptoms are related to a deficiency of the B-WICH complex in ribosomal transcription. 202PROFILEHealthcare Innovation 203The potential of the digital revolution and telehealth Paul Rice, Head of Technology Strategy at NHS England outlines how innovative technologies are helping us to lead healthier and more independent lives... Information technology is playing an increasingly pervasive and enabling role in many aspects of our lives, in a host of dierent ways. It keeps us connected to our loved ones as we video call on Skype or Facetime, blog, connect via social media or share the vivid highlights of our day via Facebook and Instagram. This coming Christmas is expected to see a boom in sales of wearable biometric devices as the new Apple Healthkit suite and Fitbugs, and Fitbits flood into the consumer market, providing detaileddata to the user about their general health and tness and more specic insights into such things as sleeping patterns, body mass index or resting heartbeat. When insight converts to ambition and commitment it isanticipated that more of us will adopt health seeking behaviours and alter our diet and exercise patterns. For the engaged and connected the internet provides access to a huge amount of expert information from a multitude of professional disciplines. It also enablesus, as individuals, to strike up conversations andestablish relationships with people we identify with,and whom we share characteristics and experience. \"Apps\" provide a plethora of information and resourcein handy bite-sized chunks extending our ability topersonalise our support networks and build self-care competencies. What is the relationship between these opportunities and capabilities, our health and care system, the NHS, and in particular the experience of the elderly or vulnerable? The term telehealth has emerged over the last decade to describe a range of interventions and activities where the health and care system has actively engaged with the potential of information technology to elimi nate some of the limitations of time and distance. It also encompasses the ability of the individual to capture, track and trend biometric information, about their health status and wellbeing, on the move or at home in a manner that previously wouldn't have beenpossible outside of the 4 walls of a hospital. Why has this become so important? Growing numbers of people with multiple conditions are living longer and resources to support their continued wellbeing are increasingly stretched. Health and social care professionals are expert resources that need to be targeted at those most vulnerable at precisely the right moment. The very experience of travelling for face to face consultation with a health orcare professional can be burdensome for patients and their carers, particularly where underlying poor health or a specic feature of their condition (impair-ment, mobility, cognitive diculties) makes travel challenging. Through innovative use of technology a consultation can be undertaken between clinician and patient via video link without either of them having to move location. The range of expertise that can beaccessed is determined by the skills and experience of the available professional. Increasingly educational and rehabilitation content - for example pulmonary rehabilitation advice and support for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can be oered remotely. The application of this technology isalso not limited to physical ailment or disease. An increasing range of mental health services, covering psychological advice, support and treatment arebeing delivered by this method too. In addition to connecting to professional or \"expert patient\" resources remotely, when an individual uses a biometric or telemonitoring device the clinician hascontinuous access to an extended range of key data - \"vital signs\" - and insights - how am I feeling today? Having determined, on the basis of this information, and their knowledge of the patient's history, whether they are stable or deteriorating, the clinician can intervene proactively, advise them to alter their medi-cines' regime. They can rapidly schedule a face-to-face contact where an immediate and severe need has been identied. The patient too, with appropriate education, can become more aware of the impact of the decisions that they make on their health and wellbeing; this may encourage them to modify their lifestyle decisions accordingly. The common thread that joins these new models of care is that digital technologies are necessary but not sucient. On each occasion they deliver the potential to organise services and engage patients and the wider population in a more personal and consistent way, both in managing disease and sustaining inde-pendence. For the individual to experience a greater level of control and self- determination the professional patient relationships has to be rooted in collaborating and co-creating health and wellbeing. The current generation of frail vulnerable elderly can benetfrom being connected to the community around them, friends and family as well as health and care professionals, enabled as appropriate by technology. They may benet from specic simple innovations based in the home that directly protect them from environmental risk, the threat of re or flood, or alert others where they wander unsafely. These telecare technologies, including simple pendant alarms, may provide much needed reassurance. With appropriate support and as user centred design and consumerism makes the technologies themselves increasingly intuitive and easy to use there is clear potential, as detailed earlier, for their introduction across the generations. As \"digital natives\" move into their mature middle years there is a building expectation that service models will be suciently flexible and designed around the needs of the individ ual. This is coupled with increased awareness that individuals and communities want and need to take a bigger stake in managing their own health and wellbeing. Information technology can play a huge part in releasing this untapped resource. The NHS has signalled in its Five Year Forward View document that the NHS needs to evolve to meet new challenges and adapt to take advantage of the opportunities that science and technology oer. An engaged relationship with patients, carers andciti zens promoting wellbeing and preventing ill health is a prerequisite for this and information technology and telehealth can play a crucial role in realising this ambition. The National Information Board recently launched the Personalised Health and Care 2020 framework - more info can NHS Englandwww.england.nhs.ukHealthcare Innovation 204Healthcare Innovation 205Technology and the Care Act The Care Act 2014 has the potential to revolutionise the way social care is delivered. Lyn Duncan, CEO of cloudBuy argues that we must seize this opportunity to improve the lives of millions of people while making social care administration more sustainable... The historical disconnect between health and social care systems has unfortunately seen many vulnerable people fall into the gaps between services. Consequently by the time individuals are admitted to hospital, or come to the attention of the local authority, many care options that deliver better outcomes and are more cost-eective are no longer available to them. What follows is a loss of independ-ence and increased reliance on the state, leading to higher costs to the local authority and a signicantly poorer quality of life for the individual. That is why Iwelcome the Care Act 2014 as a real opportunity to change things for the better. There is no doubt that the Care Act creates newchal lenges for local authorities. It makes them responsible for early intervention, cutting the overall cost of care and facilitating access to preventative services that maintain people's health. It gives individ uals greater power and choice over how their care is managed and their own personal budgets todecide where money is spent. Furthermore, withoutadditional resources it requires them to provide asolution to the 90% of residents that are self-funders, leading to a tenfold increase in demand. This situation seems daunting. However Adult Social Care is under increasing pressure and the current model is no longer sustainable. As the status quo is not a viable option, it is time to rethink our whole approach to helping councils become more ecient. In particular, new technology can play a key role here. Forward-thinking councils such as Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire and Staordshire are already leading the way and demonstrating best practice. On paper asimple online directory can meet the basics of theCare Act. However, these 3 authorities have committed to something far more visionary in order to deliver on signicant permanent improvements to care for the elderly and vulnerable. Under the current system, most authorities are only able to provide nancial support to the poorest 10% that they assess as having genuine care needs. The rest are required to source and pay for suitable care assistance themselves. Much of the council's budget is spent setting up and managing approved health and social care providers and keeping track of all the transactions that are taking place. On the supply side many of the best providers struggle to stay afloat as they must pay the cost of council procurement and accreditation. They also need to meet stringent cost controls simply to provide care services to residents who qualify for nancial support. An online directory does little to deliver key objectives underpinning the Care Act or statutory duty to secure best value. For example directories do not make administering care more aordable for the council. While directories may make the suppliers a little easier to nd, they do not maximise choice, convenience, information or make it any easier for members of the public to actually do business with them. Most directories are unable to facilitate a dialogue between customers and suppliers, assemble a range of services against an individuals care plan manage transactions or handle secure multiple payments This is the reason that past attempts at personalisation have, although well intended, ultimately failed. Personal budgets can only work if there is a simple and well-signposted means of engaging with a broad range of quality providers 24x7, so residents can make eective choices. Northampton County Council, in partnership with cloudBuy and Grassroots, has launched an innova- tive solution under the Breeze-e brand which changes the whole dynamic of how it (and other participating councils) can facilitate and administer social care. Self funders and recipients of direct or managed payments benet along with their family, carers or other who provide personal support. It provides an engagement experience that customers have become familiar with in dealing with Amazon, Argos or other major retailers and enables citizens to nd, rate and buy a broad range of care products and services with a cash card. It is intended that almost all of council commissioned services will be delivered directly through the platform This approach eliminates the majority of the on-going costs to coun cils of admin- istering social care but just as important is the data that is being collected that alerts the authority to potential problems and helps to enact targeted inter-ventions. For example, based on signicant events, common searches and what users go on to buy it ispossible to begin identifying recurring care pathwaysand target intervention ahead of time. In implementing the Care Act local authorities have a choice. Commission a simple online directory that ticks the box, yet fails to meet the key objectives of theCare Act or deliver any signicant benets to residents. Or take the more innovative and imaginative step of creating a fully transactional marketplace that makes social care more sustainable, helps safeguard vulnerable citizens and paves the way for individuals to access appropriate 963 7000 www.cloudbuy.comhttps://twitter.com/cloudBuyplc Healthcare Innovation 206Healthcare Innovation 207Modernising healthcare the nuclear way Adjacent Government spoke to Dr Arturo Chiti, President Elect of the European Association for Nuclear Medicine (EANM) about the role nuclear medicine plays in modern society, and its challenges... In modern society there are a number of healthcare challenges that researchers are ghting against to nd new prevention methods and treat ments for. Diseases such as cancer can be treated more success- fully if caught and diagnosis is made much earlier. Nuclear medicine plays a pivotal role in this and can help give medical sta the early diagnosis for the patient, and a more localised point for treatment. The European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) works to educate people in the method of nuclear medicine, and further advance methods to help with that all important early diagnosis. However, when people hear the word nuclear, it can generate a fear in some,and without the correct information patients don't understand how nuclear medicine can help prevent and treat some of those major health challenges. In order to help give patients more information aboutmolecular imaging and nuclear medicine techniques, The EANM have put together information for patients to remove the fear regarding this form of treatment, and set their minds at ease. Editor Laura Evans spoke to Doctor Arturo Chiti, President Elect of the EANM about how nuclear medicine ts into modern society, and the challenges that come with such a complicated eld. \"One of the advantages is that nuclear medicine is able to see molecular alterations - what we call functionalalterations in cancer,\" explains Doctor Chiti. \"From research we have learnt that these alterations normally proceed the multi-functional alterationsthat we see with a CT scan. This is important because when you suspect cancer is present it helps in giving a very early diagnosis compared to morphologicalimaging.\"The method of nuclear medicine can be quite compli cated, but it can help a number of healthcare problems from cancer to thyroid problems. DoctorChiti explained the process, and the advantages this has with diseases such as cancer. \"Nuclear medicine or molecular imaging uses small probes that are called tracers, and these probes are able to localise particular tissues within the human body. \"These probes help to visualise diseases like cancer, or even evaluate how the blood flow goes into the heart. With this principle we are able to treat diseaseslike cancer, because these probes have radio-nuclides imbedded into the molecule, and radio-nuclides helpyou to localise exactly where the problem may be in order to treat it,\" he says. \"Nuclear medicine helps us to do what we call person- alised or precise medicine, because we can visualise the target and we can treat accordingly to this.\" Over the years nuclear medicine has evolved tokeep up with modern medicine, and the constant health challenges faced throughout Europe. There area number of ways in which this has happened, as explained by Doctor Chiti. \"We have 2 main tracks, the most important is the research of radiopharmaceuticals. These are the probes that are used in the process of nuclear medicine,\" he says. \"In an eort to get more specic molecules to visualise or treat specic targets, we are carrying out research of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis, biologicalchar acterisation, and therapy. We can also designmolecules which are exactly the same or similar to drugs which are used - non radioactive drugs. \"So the key aim is to be able to visualise the targetsof drugs, which are used in oncology. This means you can select those patients that are going to benet from a particular treatment.\" Technology also plays a vital role in molecular imaging, and one of the main challenges that Doctor Chiti pointed out was keeping up to date with sophisticatedtechnology, as it evolves. \"We are using big hardware in order to track the radiopharmaceuticals which are injected into the patient, and this means that from that point of view we are aiming at having more and more sophisticated technology in order to visualise very small alterations in the human body,\" says Doctor Chiti. \"Of course the imaging we use is always multi-modality imaging, that means that you have the molecular imaging, but you always have a CT scan or an MR scan as a companion in order to be able to have morpho logical and functional imaging in the patient at the same time. This increases the accuracy of the diagnoses we can do.\" Radiopharmaceuticals are the core of Doctor Chiti's discipline, and it is the regulations relating to this areathat he believes are one of the main challenges that faces the nuclear medicine eld, as he explains. \"Regulatory issues are challenging because every radiopharmaceutical has to be approved at a European level, and then at a national level. Sometimes this is cumbersome and quite slow. \"Another issue is that radiopharmaceuticals are not developed at the same level throughout Europe. There are some countries where they are further developed than others. So, for example, there might be in country A, radiopharmaceutical for diagnosis or therapy available, but in neighbouring country B it is not. What we are aiming for is harmonised regulations throughout Europe - at least for radiopharmaceuticals.\" Looking ahead, Doctor Chiti would like to see nuclear medicine integrated with other clinical departments, in order to gain the best possible outcomes forpatients. \"It will mean integrating nuclear medicine procedures with the other diagnostic imaging procedures - multi-modality imaging, and be more integrated in the oncological tracts, cardiological and neurological and also in those clini cal tracts which are related to infection imaging,\" he concludes. \"In my mind there will be more clinical speciality within this eld of medicine, with more technology specialists working with the Elect European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM)Healthcare Innovation 208209PROFILE Ultrasound is named for the fact that this technology deals with waves traveling through a medium at frequencies above the threshold of human hearing. Within this article the term \"sound waves\" are used which are more accurately described as pressure waves produced by the transducer that travel through a medium. The commercially available ultrasound machines available for bedside and critical care applications utilise frequencies between 2 to 14 megaHertz. Several probes are often available for selection, depending on the application or procedure performed. Two important properties of the ultrasound wave important to probe selection are frequency and wavelength. Wavelength is the distance between successive crests of the sound wave. Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event (for our purposes, the sound wave crest) over a unit of time. Frequency and wavelength are inversely related. The longer the wavelength, or greater the distancebetween the wave crests, the less frequent the crests occur over a unit of time. In other words, large wavelengths have low frequencies. Lungs are relatively superficial compared to intracavitary organs, so less distance is required to visualise the pleura. A higher frequency probe (5-14 MHz), with a shorter wavelength is required. In addition to ultrasound wave properties, the ultrasoundtransducer surface is also considered in probe selection for pulmonary ultrasound. Flat footprints of varying length and square or rectangular shape are available. Various modes are utilised to visualise intrathoracic structures, including B mode, M mode, and Doppler assessment. B-mode stands for\"brightness\" mode and presents a 2dimensional display in varying shades of gray (Figure 1). M-mode stands for \"motion\" mode, and selects an \"ice pick\" single dimension sample from pixels of the B mode image (Figure 2).The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents themotion of reflecting echoes. Manymachines simultaneously display B and M mode imaging. Doppler assessment is obtained either through continuous, pulse wave, or color flow mapping. Continuous wave Doppler has the ability to measure high velocities without aliasing. Aliasing occurs when the pulse repetition frequency is too low, and the high frequency measured \"wraps\" back around the scale and is visually misrepresented in the negative direction. Continuous wave Doppler is also highly sensitive to low flow states. It is the simplest form of Doppler and uses a dedicated probe that has two crystals within the transducer. Once crystal configuration transmits ultrasound waves 100% of the time, and the other receives Doppler information returning from tissuesPoint of Care Pulmonary Ultrasound From the Basics to Bedside Protocols that reflected the ultrasound waves. The Continuous wave transducer must be held with an incidental angleof 0\u00b0 or kept parallel with the interrogated structure. Due to the shape of the chest, this may limit the utility of Continuous wave Doppler for lung ultrasound. Additionally, continuous wave Doppler is displayed only as a waveform. In contrast, Pulse wave Doppler uses a single crystal that transmits the ultrasound wave, then \"listens\" to receive the returningDoppler information. The returning pulse is a snapshot of the position of the reflecting surface position within the sample. B mode images are displayed along with information about pleural movement in relation tothe transducer surface. Pulse wave Doppler information is displayed acoustically or is converted into color. A color map indicates flow direction, as in a red and blue scale, or simply the presence of movement. Figure 3 demonstrates orange scale power Doppler as it detects pleural Figure 1: B mode imaging of normal lung. Acoustic shadowing of ribs (R) marks the pleural line (*) in this longitudinal view movement relative to the transducer surface. Pulmonary Ultrasound Examination and Pathology Air is a poor medium for an ultrasound wave due to its low density and slow propagation velocity. Healthy lungs contain air, and are surrounded by the highly reflective bones of the ribs. Rather than visualising lungs directly, pulmonary ultrasound is highly dependent on identification of various artifacts or detection of movement. In a longitudinal view, the acoustic shadowing of the ribs marks the space where the pleural line may be identified. In Figure 1, the acousticshadow of the ribs (R) is created bythe strongly reflective bony cortex,and marks the pleural line (*). Since bone reflects ultrasound waves, no signal is detected behind the cortex,creating the dark shadowing. Normal pleural movement demonstrates a \"shimmer sign\" with B mode imaging. Poor respiratory effort, operator experience, operator fatigue, and other factors may make the identification of a \"shimmer sign\" difficult. M mode imaging is used witha high frequency probe to depict lung movement. A normal lung that is moving has a homogenous granular appearance under the brightly visualised pleura. Figure 2 depicts this \"seashore sign\", with the homogenous granular appearing lung reminiscent of sand and approaching waves. The loss of granular appearing \"sand\" on the bottom half of the screen is indicative of pneumothorax. Lung sliding is also detected by Doppler. Power Doppler (Figure 3) utilises an orange scale to detect movementrelative to the transducer surface, which is more sensitive for movement as compared to the red blue Color Doppler map. A patient with a pneumothorax will not have lung sliding relative to the transduce surface, and no color will be detected in the sample selected (Figure 4). The pleura surface itself creates an ultrasound artifact. A reverberation artifact is created when the ultrasound beam encounters a strong reflective surface and there is a difference in acoustic impedance between two tissues, such as the pleural line and the less dense lung. The ultrasound beam is transmitted back to the transducer several times,and each time the signal is slightly weaker. This gives the appearance ofthe reflective surface being distal to, or in the far field from the actual structure. A lines are the reverberatio n artifact of the pleural line (Figure 5). B lines, also known as comet tail artifacts, represent the common border between the interlobular septa and the alveolar wall.1B line artifacts start from the pleural line, and are hyperechoic, or brighter than the surrounding field (Figure 5). B lines move with lung sliding, whereas A lines are static. In normal lung the B lines appear to wipe side to side over the stationary appearing A lines. The lack of B line movement also indicates pneumothorax. B lines are key to identification of interstitial lung disease due to pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other pathologies.2 Due to the pleural traction created from underlying fibrotic lung andthickening of the interlobular septa, B lines appear at least 7mm apart in interstitial lung disease. 3Ground glass appearing lung on chest tomography appear on ultrasound as B lines that are at least 3mm apart.4 The lack of B lines is seen in pulmonary consolidation due to the replacement of the alveolar air with fluid or blood. Consolidated lung may appear homogenous or heterogenous. Doppler evaluation of lung assistswith evaluation of a vascular blood supply indicating lung cancer rather than an infectious etiology of consolidation. 5 A lung that is compressed from pleural effusion, tumor, bronchial obstruction, or other atelectasis Figure 2: M mode imaging of normal lung Figure 3: Power Doppler visualisation of normal lung 210PROFILE211PROFILE appears wedge shaped and brighter, or more echogenic. Pleural effusions and hemothorax are typically anechoic, or black, on ultrasound. Dynamic evaluation of the lung demonstrates lung floating in an anechoic effusion. Interpleural distance of greater than 50mm at the lung base represents a pleural effusion of at least 800mL.6Figure 6 demonstrates a pleural effusion withcompressed floating lung. Several scanning protocols exist for pulmonary ultrasound. As a general rule of thumb, it is recommended to visualise more than one lung field, and over any area where there is clinical suspicion for pathology. The BRIPPED protocol is a screening tool for undifferentiated shortness of breath that may be performed with the patient in any position, and utilises high and lower frequency probes using a portable bedside ultrasound machine. BRIPPED Protocol: The BRIPPED scan is an effectivescreening tool for undifferentiated shortness of breath that evaluates B-lines: Sonographic pulmonary B-lines have been shown to correlate with congestive heart failure. 2A two- zone scanning protocol has beenshown to perform similarly to an eight zone protocol. 7A high frequency linear probe is used to evaluate atminimum two mid clavicular apical lung windows. RV strain: Right ventricular (RV) enlargement can be caused by a Pulmonary Embolus (PE), acute RV infarct, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), pulmonary valve stenosis or pulmonary hypertension, and is a risk factor for early mortality in PE.(8) Alow frequency phased array probe is used to evaluate RV strain in an apical four-chamber view. IVC-size and collapsibility: Using an IVC size cutoff of 2.0cm has been shown to have a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 85% for a Right Atrial Pressure (RAP) above or below 10 mmHg. The collapsibility during forced inspiration of less than 40% has even greater accuracy for elevated RAP (sensitivity 91%, specificity 94%, NPV 97%).(9) A low frequency phased array or curvilinear probe is used to visualise the IVC long axis, anddynamic imaging is used to assess collapsibility as either complete or less than 40%. Pneumothorax: Bedside ultrasound is more accurate than supine chest x-ray with diagnostic ability approaching that of CT. (9,10) The same windowsfor B-lines are utilised for pneumo - thorax screening. Additionally any area of decreased breath sounds, or crepitus palpated along the chest wall is evaluated for pneumothorax with a high frequency linear probe. Pleural effusion: EUS has been shown to have an accuracy similar to a CXR for evaluation of pleural effusion. 11 A low frequency phased array or curvilinear probe is used to evaluate each mid axillary line at the costophrenic angle in the sitting patient. Pericardial effusion: EUS has a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98% compared to formal echocardiography.12A low frequency phased array probe is used to evaluate pericardial effusion from an apical four-chamber view and a parasternal long axis view of the heart. EF: The qualitative assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction by emergency physicians has been shown to correlate well with an assessment by a cardiologist.13-15The same low frequency probe and parasternal long axis used to evaluate pericardial effusion is used toevaluate ejection fraction. Dynamic qualitative assessment of ejection fraction is classified as normal, depressed, or severely depressed. DVT in lower extremities: Ultrasound was performed by emergency physicians using a two-point compression venous ultrasound on patients with suspected lower extremity DVT. This approach had a 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity in diagnosing DVT, compared to a Figure 4: Power Doppler visualisation of pneumothoraxreference venous ultrasound in radiology.16A high frequency linear probe evaluates compressibility of the common femoral and popliteal veins with dynamic scanning. If pretest probability is higher for DVT, then additional fields are included, starting below the inguinal ligament at the common femoral vein, and each segment of vessel is compressed every 2cm to the trifurcation of the popliteal artery distally. The BRIPPED protocol can be performed in its entirety from a head to toe approach, switching between transducers, or completing the examwith one transducer then switching to the next. An example of the latter would be to first use the low frequency probe to evaluate the parasternal long axis and apical four- chamber, noting the presence or absence of pericardial effusion, ejection fraction, and RV strain. Thenthe long axis of the IVC is evaluated for dynamic collapsibility. Moving laterally, the costophrenic angles are evaluated bilaterally for pleural effusion. The probe is switched to thehigh frequency probe to evaluate each lung apex is evaluated in the mid clavicular line for the presence of pneumothorax and B lines.

The European Wound Management Association (EWMA) aims to promote best practice in wound management and to advocate for the rights of people with wounds, to receive the bestpos sible care in a timely manner that meets the needs of the individual and the health service. The document Home Care-Wound Care (HCWC)1was developed by a group of experts within EWMA and supported by representatives of organisations in the UK and Germany, to provide a set of recommendations on wound care in the home care sector at a Europeanlevel. The document sought to generate critical dis-cussion and debate of what prerequisites, conditions and knowledge/skills of healthcare practitioners are required to manage wounds in the patients' home. The document provides examples of the organisation of wound care across Europe with 3 case exemplars. The need for this document is underscored by rising costs of healthcare driven mainly by increased costs of medicines and devices, increased capital costs and an increase in the numbers of people with chronic conditions requiring primary and secondary healthcare support. In tandem with this has been the shift in the delivery of services from hospital to the home care setting and this shift is clearly seen in the eld of wound management 2, 3. The increasing pressures for early discharge from acute hospitals means that more wounds which heretofore weremanaged in acute settings are now being cared for in the community, and in patients own homes. In Europe today, it is estimated that around 70-90 % of wound care is conducted in the community, the majority of such being delivered by nurses 4, 5. At least 50% of the work load of the primary care nurses is spent on provision of wound care, and a study from Ireland sets this gure at 68%6. The challenges of providing wound care in the homewithin Europe is underscored by the patient chronicity as 76% of patients with chronic wounds have 3 or more comorbid conditions including hypertension, vascular disease and arthritis and up to 46% have diabetes7. Home care clients today are becoming older and have more complex health needs than previously known. Thus, home care patients tend to require extensive help 8, 9. \"For most patients caring for a chronic wound in the home care setting is a challenge as all aspects of daily life are aected including limitations of mobility, personal hygiene and simple things such as choosing shoes and clothes. \" The role of the patient and informal carers There is a paucity of research which focuses on the subject of HCWC from a clinical perspective10-14. This gap can be illustrated by the fact that there are no guidelines or recommendations of minimum requirements for providing best care to patients withwounds and their families in the home care setting. Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that many patients receiving health care services at home never have their wound aetiology diagnosed 10, 11. Patients' needs in chronic wound care often continue over weeks, months or even a lifetime. Therefore, planning wound care requires empowering patients and their informal carers by involving them and allow ing them to contribute to decision making and ensuring that they are satised with the care they receive. Probst et al.15reported how patients and their informal carers receive little support and practical information from healthcare professionals. Otherliterature shows that healthcare professionals need to include patients and their informal carers in their care by providing information and advising them on how to manage a wound in the home care sector, where to get dressings and how to choose the appropriate dressing, and how to cope with wound-related symp toms 16-18. Chronic wounds are common in primary care settings and require a high level of resources, and can have a profound impact on a patient's quality of life. Hence, collaboration between the patient and practitioner is important. However, living with a non-healing wound at home can have a pervasive and profound eect on the daily lives of patients 19. The impact of physical, psychological as well as social eects and quality of life are overwhelming. For most patients caring for a chronic wound in the home care setting is a challengeas all aspects of daily life are aected including limita tions of mobility, personal hygiene and simple things such as choosing shoes and clothes18. We must recognise the challenges inherent to being treated in the home environment. Often, practitioners work alone, so they must adapt what they have toprovide a suitable home care setting for delivery of wound care. Building a team approach with the expertise, views, and opinions of the patients and their informal carers are also critical. Together, team- building and adapting to the environment are important factors for successful HCWC. The HCWC document places specic emphasis on the underrecognised role of the informal carer in the provision of wound prevention strategies and wound manage- ment. These carers are often family members with no formal training in wound care. However, this Healthcare Innovation 214Healthcare Innovation 215group requires special attention as they may feel overwhelmed and overburdened by their new role and responsibilities. Conclusion Home care is organised and funded dierently within Europe. In taking care of patients with a wound and in helping to prevent the onset of a wound, a needsassessment is mandatory and is best performed by specialists in wound management. Health care professionals need to acquire skills and knowledge on how to manage wounds in the home care setting, and develop a team based approach to care delivery.Inclusion of patients and informal carers is vital to the success of this process. Already this document has seen EWMA initiate a follow-up project in the UK todevelop a network of experts and implement a UK- focused guidance document together with key players in the elds of wound care, home and communitycare, and patient organisations. Another project in Germany is also being planned and more national projects are likely to follow.

Education is an increasingly important issue. M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care try to fulfil the demand for training and provide clear, comprehensive outcomes to educational objectives with a wide range of courses, seminars and online learning. A significant number of our field staff are clinically trained with registered nurse status. We share our clinical expertise by giving advice and our best practice to our customers. Continuously creating and delivering clinical education and evidence is one of the mostimportant ways of securing that the products we offer are both safe and efficient. Additionally M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care run a Wound Academy whereby we produce a library of educational materials and best practice documents through the working of Special Advisory Groups. We aim to disseminate these to healthcare professionals engaged in wound care across the UK. As part of the Academy every year we present a series of awards and scholarships to health care professionals which aim to celebrate innovation in patient care, whether through a patient case study or service improvement. These awards recognise some great developments in advanced wound care, and rewarding the winner with a bursary and providing mentorship through the academy enables them to carry out personal andprofessional development.Helen's story, 2014 Scholarship Winner (Helen Mountford, Staff Nurse, Acorns Children's Hospice, Walsall) Acorns Children's Hospice in the Black Country provides both palliative and end of life care, and offers short breaks for families in the hospice and at home. We support children aged from birth to 18 years, covering a large geographical area within the West Midlands. As a staff nurse at Acorns I feel very rewarded and satisfied as each day is different, offering new opportunities for learning, using new skills, facing new challenges and developing new therapeutic relationships with families and children. Care at the hospice is given to the highest standards and staff work together to ensure that individualised care plans are formulated for each child and family, recognising individual diverse needs and differences. I have been able to focus and draw upon my interest and experience in tissue viability (TV), which I believe is essential during palliative/end of life care for children. Not only does it ensure that the child is as comfortable and as pain free as possible, but it also encompasses children's dignity and respect. As part of my role, I develop and update TV services which are evidenced based and current. This drive stems from witnessing poor care and prevention of pressure ulcers in children and seeing how a lack of care, knowledge and understanding prevented or delayed the healing process or caused unnecessary discomfort. Lucy Beddoes Marketing Communications Manager, UK Tel: 01582 \u00ab\u00ab I entered for the M\u00f6lnlycke Scholarship to raise the profile of TV within paediatrics, particularly in palliative care, as I discovered that there is limited evidence, information and research within this field. I also wanted support from the specialists within the Academy network to help me develop both from a clinical and theoretical basis. I was extremely pleased (yet stunned) to win and have already achieved success in many of the areas I had identified initially, and made advances in other areas. The objectives for the coming year include: To provide a specialist TV trolley for staff to use in-house and in the community; this will facilitate assessment, monitoring and evaluation of individuals, choice of treatment, therapy or dressing for the child, contact details for help and guidance; To develop a new information leaflet to give to all parents and carers, outlining why TV care is so essential and who to ask for help and advice if they have any concerns; To ensure all staff are trained to a high standard using evidence based research; To ensure the organisation and all staff recognise and prioritise TV; For all staff to know who to ask for help both within Acorns and externally. I am hopeful that this year will be the basis for setting up the foundation and culture for the future where TV will be no longer an adjunct to care, but totally encompassed with generic care of the individual child. Wendy Luke, Deputy Manager at Chester Court Care Home Another one of the M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care Wound Academy winners this year was Wendy Luke, Deputy Manager at Chester Court Care Home. Wendy outlined a case study of a patient with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It showed how Wendy and the team had worked together to find a suitable dressing that would both maintain the seal on her ventilation mask, and allow treatment to be applied to the smallpressure ulcer on her face. Mepitel\u00ae One as a primary dressing was used as it could be removed without pain or trauma. The wound healed, and the patient continued to use the dressing prophylactically. Wendy was presented with her award by Dr David Foster, Deputy Director of Nursing for NHS England, who tweeted the Director of the Barchester Group (whom she works for), telling him about Wendy's achievement. We are delighted to report that, following her innovative achievements and award, and this further exposure on social media, Wendy Luke has been invited to 10 Downing Street to have tea with the Prime Minister, in recognition of her outstanding contribution to Nursing in the Healthcare sector. M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care are tremendously proud of all our Wound Academy winners, and look forward to this year's applications. Innovation is part of our DNA and we will continue to invest in the future of wound care to keep delivering new cost effective solutions and continue to support both service improvements andpatient case studies through the Academy. M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care is one of the world's leading providers of wound care and surgical solutions to the health care sector. For more information please visit: www.molnlycke.co.ukTaking action on e-cigarettes Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries, MEP at the European Parliament details what actions should be taken in regards to e-cigarettes and their regulation throughout Europe... In April this year, MEPs and governments from the 28 EU Member States agreed a new law regulating tobacco sales across the European Union. They also used the pretext of the review for the TobaccoProducts Directive to over-regulate e-cigarettes, in the opacity of trilogue meetings. From the beginning the Commission and Council wanted to make life dicult for e-cigarettes, suggesting that similar rules should apply to them as to medicinal products, making them available only in pharmacies, on prescription by doctors. Not the easiest way to facilitate access to the market. After the deal, we now have a normative status on e-cigs made up of 1 article, 13 paragraphs and 33 provisions without any prior impact assessment. The least we can say is that this is not an example of good legislation as the scope is really unclear and presents a real risk of overlapping. No less than 4 legal classications are authorised: related tobaccoproducts, medicinal products by presentation if claim of therapeutic added value are made by the manufacturer (this route was already foreseen in the original proposal by the Commission), and 2 othernew routes: medicinal product by function ( that the national agency of each Member State will decide) and fourthly, to classify e-cigarettes and their devices as medical devices if the cartridge is sold separately on the market. However Member States retain broad discretion as to the legal classication given to the e-cigarette, which seems inconsistent with the stated goal of strengthening the internal market. Amongst the main stringent provisions of the new Tobacco Products Directive: We have now an immediate ban for tanks bigger than 2ml to be used in rechargeable electronic cigarettes; 218 Healthcare InnovationHealthcare Innovation Audio-visual commercial communications such as advertising to the general public, are prohibited for electronic cigarettes and rell containers as of 20 May, 2016; Concerning the global category of rellables, the Commission shall report on health risks of rell-ables by 20 May 2016 and whenever appropriate thereafter; The addition of a safeguard clause on restriction of rellable cartridges and tanks in the market. In practise, where certain types of rellables have been prohibited in at least 3 Member States, the Commission shall be empowered to extend the ban to all Member States on justied grounds. \"Member States retain broad discretion as to the legal classification given to the E-cigarette, which seems inconsistent with the stated goal of strengthening the internal market. \" This last measure means an application of the precau- tionary principle, only postponed in 2 years' time. It is regrettable that some lawmakers have forgotten that the main added value of the European Union's public health is to support patients who want to get rid of their addiction, which obviously is justied, not by measures of restriction or prohibition, but by incentives.Hopefully, some of the Member States with a mature market such as the UK and France are taking a prag-matic view related to the \"smooth\" implementation of those provisions. On the other hand, the European Commission will have a second chance in 2016 with the adoption of secondary legislation foreseen under the TPD, to adopt a balanced position on this drugwashout tool. Not only because it makes sense to take into account scientic studies carried out by hundreds of pulmo- nologists and European researchers who found the electronic cigarette is a valuable tool in the ght against smoking, but above all because it is crucial for the EU to send the right message to 8 million of vapers that forever want to turn away from cigarettes and their addiction that slowly 45549 frederique.ries@europarl.europa.euwww.frederiqueries.be 219 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries MEP Parliament In February 2014, the British Stan- dardsInstitute (BSI) approached ECITA to discuss the possibility of creating a standard for the electronic cigarette ('ecig') sector. Since ecigs are such an emerging technology, it was deemed unfeasible to create a fullBritish Standard, so it was decided that a Publicly Available Specification (PAS) would be the best solution. ECITA's members agreed to sponsor this project in March 2014, and BSI invited ECITA's Tom Pruen and Katherine Devlin to provide Technical Authorship. The base document was completed and submitted to the Steering Group in September 2014, and their amend- ments have now been incorporated. The Public Review phase will start on 3rd November 2014. The UK Depart- ment of Health has 'Observer' status over PAS 54115, and they have indi- cated that they would like to use PAS 54115 to help them with implementing regulations for the revisions to the Tobacco Products Directive. There will be final Steering Group consultation and review in early January 2015, and the PAS will be published on 15th March 2015. This PAS is the first ever attempt to do a voluntary standard for ecigs. We have been delighted at the positive engagement from the vaping commu- nity, our industry colleagues, PublicHealth and the regulators. The PAS gives recommendations for the manufacture, importation, labelling, marketing and sale of vaping products (\"VP\") including electronic cigarettes,e-shisha and directly related products, as well as recommendations for test methods to inform the safety assess- ment of both eliquids and hardware. The PAS recommends a test solution, a test bed atomiser, the method used to operate VP to gather emission samples, the method and materials for gathering such samples, and an outline for the toxicological and chemical analysis of the emissions from both eliquids and hardware separately.For these analyses, the emphasis is focussed on required outcomes ofsuch testing, allowing a wide variety oftesting houses to perform the tests, which should ensure that no producer wishing to have their products tested will have too long a wait. The PAS is applicable to producersand distributors of VP in the UK, and forms a Code of Practice for commercial operations in this sector. There are some exemptions from certain testing requirements for small producersECITA and the British Standards Institute: PAS 54115 220manufacturing hardware exclusively. The PAS is also applicable to laboratories and testing houses engaged in, or plan- ningto be engaged in, the testing of VP. PAS 54115 is not intended to cover those VP which are licensed as medic- inal products or medical devices, nor does it cover products which can be used in or as VP, but which are sold for other purposes, such as food flavour- ings sold in supermarkets. For all the emissions gathering tests, all the devices and eliquids are tested at a range of power inputs, to represent the range of product options available. This ensures that the testing is as rep- resentative as possible of 'real world' use of the products, and can fully inform the safety assessment of the products' toxicological profile. A number of analytes of interest arelisted, some of which should not be added to eliquids, e.g. formaldehydePROFILE ITEM NO. PART QTY. 1Base 1 x 4mm Stainless Pan Head1Test-bed atomiser(which will be present, since it is a ubiquitous chemical, but should not be added as an ingredient), respira- tory sensitisers, etc., as well as some which should be monitored to ensure they are only present at appropriately safe levels, e.g. metals, etc. The testing of both eliquids and the emissions gathered from both eliquids and hardware is recommended to be carried out by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), because we are looking for volatile emissions, although other analytical techniques may be used, providing they are able to offer sufficiently detailed analysis to the appropriate detection limits. Separate testing is required for the detection of metals, e.g. atomic emis- sion spectroscopy/inductively coupled plasma (AES/ICP). The PAS also gives recommendations for a test method for the safety of batteries and chargers - testing whichECITA has already introduced for itsmembers, and made available to non-member companies, too. We identified that the existing British Standard for battery cells is not terribly well suited to the lithium ion batteries used in ecigs (and in mobile phones, laptops, etc.), so developed a variety of tests to ensure that batteries will both operate and charge safely, but also fail safely. It is our sincere hope that all industries placing lithium ion batteries on the market will adopt such rigorous testing, so that explo- sions and fires - and their associated injuries and deaths - can be avoided. Perhaps the most significant test, therefore, is the 'bake-it-til-it-blows' test, where the battery is effectively baked in the scientific oven, with the temperature being gradually increased to just over the thermal runaway temperature, which is 150\u00b0C for cobalt chemistry batteries and 250\u00b0C for manganese chemistry batteries. This allows us to see exactly how the batteryKatherine Devlin President ECITA (The Electronic 324438 katherine.devlin@ecita.org.uk www.ecita.org.uk www.twitter.com/ECITA_EU 221will fail. If it just vents, but does not explode, then this is regarded as 'failing safe'; but if it is unable to vent properly, and vents dramatically, possibly includ- ing light shrapnel and fire, this is a catastrophic failure. Such products should be recalled immediately from the market. (We have not identified a catastrophic failure in any ECITA mem- bers' batteries tested to date, but have been able to see just how dramatic this can be with some other products.) We are working with our colleagues in other Member States, and together, we have discussed with CEN the possibility of starting the process to create a European Standard for this sector. We hope that this process can begin quickly, and run as smoothly and efficiently as our experience with the BSI has, so that an established European Standard is in place before the revisions to the Tobacco Products Directive destroy the sector. That said, the case for a Judicial Review of the legal validity of Article 20 of the Direc-tive (which relates exclusively to ecigs) brought by Totally Wicked E-Liquid has been passed to the European Court of Justice, and is scheduled for a hearing in 2015. PROFILE VG 18% PG 78%Nicotine 2%DIW 2%Test solutionCancer prevention has never been more vital or urgent. Here Rachel Thompson and Sarah West from the World Cancer Research Fund - with a focus on liver cancer, explain why... In the UK, cancer now aects at least 1 in 3 of us during our lifetime and the risk of being diagnosed is rising. The good news is that there is a growing body ofevi dence on the factors that aect our cancer risk, providing us with increasingly robust information about how we can reduce our chance of developing the disease. Reviewing cancer prevention research World Cancer Research Fund's Continuous Update Project1is an on-going programme that analyses global research on how diet, nutrition, physical activity and weight aect cancer risk and survival. Among experts worldwide it is a trusted, authoritative scien tic resource, which underpins current guidelines and policy for cancer prevention. The ndings from the Project are used to update our evidence-based recommendations for cancerprevention2, ensuring that everyone, from policy makers to members of the public, has access to current information on how to minimise the risk ofdeveloping the disease. As part of the Continuous Update Project, scientic research from around the world is collated and added to a database on an on-going basis and systematically reviewed by a team at Imperial College London. An independent panel of world-renowned experts then evaluate and interpret the evidence to make conclusions based on the body of scientic evidence. Their conclusions form the basis for reviewing, and where necessary revising, our recommendations forcancer prevention. In the UK today we now know that around a third of cancers could be prevented through a healthy diet, physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight - that's around 89,000 cases of cancer prevented every year. 222 Taking control to beat cancerHealth ResearchHealth Research A focus on liver cancer - the facts Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with 782,000 new cases diagnosed in 20123. While the majority of cases (about 83%) are found in less developed parts of the world, over 4,700 cases of liver cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK, About two-thirds of these cases are in men. Survival rates are often poor because symptoms often do not appear until the disease is advanced - just 5% of patients survive their disease for 5 yearsor more. The liver is one of the largest organs in the body and has many important functions. It digests proteins and fats, removes toxins like alcohol and helps control blood clotting. Any cause of liver cirrhosis whetherviral or chemical is likely to cause cancer of the liver. Cancer prevention evidence on liver cancer The global evidence on liver cancer was reviewed in 20074(an updated report will be published next year). It showed strong evidence that drinking alcohol increases the risk of liver cancer. We estimate about1 in 6 cases could be prevented if we all stopped drinking alcohol5. Smoking is another signicant risk factor6- about 1 in 5 cases could be prevented if no one smoked in the UK. Alcohol, when combined with smoking is particularly harmful. Other established causes include chronic viral hepatitis and liver flukes2. To reduce the risk of liver cancer it's best not to smoke and limit alcohol consumption. In our review of the evidence no safe level of alcohol was identiedand so for cancer prevention the advice is to avoid drinking alcohol as much as possible. If alcohol is consumed it should be limited to no more than 2 drinks a day for men and no more than 1 drink a day for woman. Tips for reducing alcohol intake include; opting for the smallest serving size, dilutingalcoholic drinks, drinking low calories or low-alcohol alternatives and keeping a few days each weekalco hol free. Alcohol also increases the risk of other cancers, including: breast, bowel, mouth and oesophagus. Scientists are still researching how alcohol can lead to cancer. One theory is that alcohol can directly damage our DNA, increasing our risk of cancer. While there is still much to learn about preventing cancer, we do have growing evidence available to help us take control and reduce our cancer risk. Cancer treatment alone will not free us from this epidemic. It's time to take control and stop cancer before it starts. World Cancer Research Fund is the leading UK charity dedicated to the prevention of cancer through diet, weight and physical activity. We fund and support research, develop policy and provide health information so people can make informed lifestyle choices toreduce their cancer risk.

Overweight, MS and NAFLD is becoming a relevant risk factor of developing several cancer types, especially malignant hepatic tumors - currently the second most common cause of cancer related deaths in humans. This frightening development is best observed and followed in the US, with approximately 90 million people currently suffering from NAFLD and at high risk of devel- oping its subsequent pathological forms - the so called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver cancer. Liver cancer has become the fastest growing cancer in the US right now. In Europe a similar increase can also be observed. What does all of thismean for the future? Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malig- nancy. It is the fifth most prevalent type of cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a rising incidence in developing and industrialised coun-tries. The most prevalent risk factor for HCC development is still chronichepatitis, mainly due to persistent infection with hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV or HCV) or long-lasting alcohol consumption. Importantly, a stronglink between obesity and cancer iswell-established and a body mass index (BMI) >25 substantially increases the risk for developing cancer. The latest WHO cancer report prospects a dramatic rise in cancer incidence - doubling within the next two decades - the great majority attributable to modifiable risk factors such as high caloric intake, smoking and sedentary lifestyle. Even a modest rise in BMI causes a significantly elevated risk for HCC and other cancers (e.g. pancreatic carcinoma, kidney and gastrointestinal cancers). In recent years, obesity leading to metabolic syndrome, steatosis andsteatohepatitis, caused by energy- dense food with high fat content, has attracted increased attention due to an increased HCC incidence in Western countries. In line, the most commonetiology for HCC in industrialised countries has recently switched from viral infections to obesity, making HCC the most rapidly increasing type of cancer in the US. Similarly, incidence of NAFLD and NASH is dramatically rising in Europe with foreseeable consequences. Today we know that enhanced fat uptake by hepatocytes leads to non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), comprising a spectrum of liver disor- ders ranging from fatty liver (steatosis) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis which can subsequently lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC. Thus, increased fat uptake, hepatic lipid accumulationand NASH represent incremental Fatty liver and liver cancer: Persistence of chronic inflammation matters 224risk factors for HCC development, however at the same time there is no established pharmacological treatment for NASH, and currently established standard of care therapy for HCC is limited. A \"two-hit hypothesis\" has been pro- posed for NASH progression from simple steatosis. Lipid accumulation in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes is considered the first step in NASHdevelopment, however, a second hit promoting oxidative stress, inflamma- tion, DNA damage, hepatocyte cell death and fibrosis is needed. In order to find novel drugs that could be applied to patients with NASH oreven NASH induced HCC, experiments in rodents have been performed. In mice, NASH could so far be modeled by feeding them with special diets. However, although these mice develop NASH, all mice lack either obesity or metabolic syndrome, a key co-feature in human individuals suffering from NASH. Moreover, all these diets have to be discontinued after a few months due to weight loss (up to 40%) or occa- sional cachexia. Thus, in the past this approach did not recapitulate NASH and its consequences in humans. Deficiency in the essential nutrient choline was described in NAFLD patients to exacerbate NAFLD and NASH. Moreover, humans with inade- quate choline uptake were shown to lipoprotein secretion, oxidative damage causedPROFILEby mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. Deprivation of choline leads to fatty liver development and at least90% of the US population (similarnumbers exist for Europe) does not meet the recommended daily intake for choline. Based on the above and the clinical observations of choline deficiency in NASH patients, we combined choline deficiency with a high fat diet (CD-HFD). Long-term CD-HFD led to steatosis, liver damage, fibrosis and NASH, thus delivering the 'second hit' promoting dietary-induced liver carcinogenesis - similar to the human situation. This model enabled us to investigate the relationship between chronic fat uptake, liver damage, immune activation and lymphocytic infiltration causing hepatic steatosis, NASH and HCC. Unexpectedly, in this study we could uncover the cellular and molec- ular mechanisms of NASH development and NASH to HCC transition (Wolf et al., Cancer CELL, 2014). This data, for the first time indicates that immune cells in the liver contribute to the development of a fatty liver and subsequent liver cancer. Potentially anti-inflammatory regimens or therapies that prevent an influx of inflammatory cells into the liver might be used in the future to prevent NASH and HCC. It is foreseeable that within the next decade the incidence of NASH and HCC patients will rise enormously (similar to what has already happened in the US). Because of the fact that both diseases are currently hard to treat, it will be imperative to find novel therapeutic approaches to treat these diseases. Still, this is not the only solution - preventive measures in relation to our life style and diet must be taken now to reduce the number of those individuals that will suffer from this disease. Unfortunately, the past pre- ventive strategies in the US and Europe have shown that a lot of addi- tional education is needed if we are to prevent or at least get this disease under control in the future in Europe.

Prof Dr Mathias can cer Daniel Bridge, Policy Manager at Cancer Research UK gives consideration to how science has contributed signicantly to cancer research... Medical research provides the foundation of modern medicine; it is vital to tackling thehealth challenges of the future. We know this because of the remarkable results research has produced to date. Forty years ago patients' chances of surviving cancer was 1 in 4; now because of the advances driven by research 2 in 4 survive cancer. The burden of cancer continues to rise nationally and globally. In the UK, more than 330,000 patients are diagnosed with cancer each year. As the population continues to live longer into old age we are expecting425,000 patients to be diagnosed annually by 2030. Our ambition at Cancer Research UK is to accelerate progress through more research and see three-quarters of patients surviving the disease within the next 20 years. The UK has traditionally been a powerhouse in terms of research. Considering our size and relatively modest investment in both public and private R&D we punch well above our weight in terms of research output and international recognition. From the discovery of DNA to leading mapping the human genome UK science has contributed signicantly to the overall understanding of human health and delivered benets to patients. But research isn't a production line simply churning out breakthrough after breakthrough, delivering health gains at a consistent rate. Taking the ndings and discoveries that are achieved in a lab, and translating them into treatments that help patients, is at the heart of medical research and is complex. Naturally 226 Health ResearchHealth Research sciences of biology and chemistry lend themselves most closely to understanding biological systems and changes that take place in the body on a molecular level. However we now know that relying solely on these traditional elds of science is no longer enough to continue to deliver progress on cancer. Most funders including Cancer Research UK are exploring models that include disciplines such as physics, engineering, materials science, mathematics and population sciences, to tap into their potential to deliver innovation by bringing multiple perspectives to bearon the cancer problem. This has happened before. While physicists knewhow to bend a beam of radiation, it took engineers, biologists and doctors working together to turn this into the radiotherapy machines that are so vital in treating cancer. As we move forward into an era of genetic medicine it's clear that we need to draw in expertise from math ematicians and computer scientists to analyse vast quantities of data. Being able to process genetic data fast enough to assist clinical decision makingwill move us closer to personalised medicine where treatments are tailored to individual patients. While organisations such as Cancer Research UK already fund this type of research more needs to bedone to ensure that very dierent disciplines actively collaborate and are able to focus their eorts on a single problem. We have recently launched a new multi-disciplinary scheme to further encourage team working in this area. Collaboration between researchers and dierent parts of the medical research/healthcare infrastructure drive forward new discoveries by sharing expertise and ideas. Having a collaborative healthcare system is critical to our success. Unlike other countries in theNHS we have an entire patient population under a single health system that could potentially participate in a variety of forms of research.The problems lie with ensuring everyone within the NHS has the time and space to do research. And it's understandable why research can quite easily be seen as an extraneous activity on top of a workload for doctors and nurses who are already overburdened. But without research in the past we would not have the treatments we have today. We need to nd ways to ensure that research is interwoven into all forms of care to make sure it doesn't fall o the agenda of anyone in the health services. Hard-wiring research into the NHS has additional benets. For example, over the past few years, Cancer Research UK studies alone have leveraged over \u00a3300m of free drugs given by pharmaceutical companies. This gives us an opportunity to understand the eects of drugs on particular groups of patientsand opens doors to new treatment regimes. While the importance of clinical research cannot beoverstated it isn't the only important piece of the puzzle to beating cancer. Cancer Research UK, for example, funds studies that determine the lifestyle factors that cause cancer and explores ways to diagnosis patients earlier. It is this multipronged approach that gives us betterunderstanding of all forms of prevention, diagnosis and treatments that are driving up cancer survival rates. Investment across the research pathway and across dierent scientic disciplines needs to be maintained and increased to unlock the potential within the Cancer Research UKwww.cancerresearchuk.org 227 Cancer and Cancer Stem Cells: New paradigms and approaches to therapy Professor Alan Clarke, Director of the European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute at Cardi University, outlines the aim to develop more personalised therapies for patients with cancer and how targeting the cancer stem cell could be crucial in this development... Cancer remains the second largest cause of death in the western world, and although we are continually and gradually increasing survival rates for most types of cancer, treatment forcertain types remains remarkably poor, with a weak understanding of the mechanisms that underpin treatment failure. In approaching therapy, we currently tend to view individual patient tumours as single'entities' which either do or do not respond to therapyand then subsequently either disappear or reoccur - a relapse. However, it is now increasingly clear thatthis is a somewhat na\u00efve view, as each individual tumour is actually heterogeneous, comprised of subpopulations of tumour cells that dier in their growth characteristics, their ability to respond or indeed evade therapy and in their capacity to drive relapse. Key to this understanding is that certain sub-populations may mimic some of the properties of normal stem cells and be ultimately responsible for tumour growthand treatment failure. It is this population that has been termed the 'cancer stem cell' and which opens up dierent perspectives for both basic cancer research and also the development of novel treatment strategies. For example, one of the key characteristics of a normal stem cell is its capacity to continually recreate a copy of itself - termed self-renewal. Given that cancer stem cells share properties such as self-renewal with normal stem cells, is it possible that the cancer stem cells may arise from within the normal stem cell population? In the intestine we have been able to ask this question experimentally and show that this isindeed the case, with the normal stem cell population serving as very eective 'cell of origin' for cancers if they become mutated. If this is true for many dierent cancers, it eectively identies the subpopulation of cells which is likely to drive tumourigenesis and sochanges our perspective on which cells we need to target to prevent tumour formation or relapse follow ing therapy. From the translational perspective, the 'cancer stem cell' concept also changes the way that we might evaluate how ecient a new therapeutic approach might be. Traditionally this is judged on relatively rapid shrinkage of tumours in a clinical trial. Therapies that do not achieve this are considered ineective and discarded. However, if cancers are actually drivenby a small population of cancer stem cells, as webelieve is the case in many solid tumours, eective therapy resulting in the death of the cancer stem cell population may actually lead to very small changes in tumour size in the rst instance, to be followed by a gradual reduction in tumour volume. In this scenario, eective therapies may be erroneously discarded and conversely poor therapies may be advanced becausethey initially shrink the tumour, but are ultimately ineective as they do not kill the cancer stem cell. A major objective of our current cancer research is to develop and utilise therapies tailored to individual patients. The ultimate goal here is to develop 'personalised medicine', based on the nature of each individual tumour. To reach this goal, several major hurdles must be overcome. First, we need to improve our arsenal of drugs so that we can target a wider range of molecular lesions. The current drug discovery pipeline fails to bring in new agents to the clinic in a timely and cost-eective manner. One reason for this failure is the poor match between compounds with activity against human cancer cell lines in vitro and their subsequent behaviour in patient trials, a disparity that may be reduced if drugs could be analysed in cellular systems that more closely mimicHealth Research 228Health Research the normal and tumour state. A second issue arises from tumour heterogeneity, since, as described above, cancer stem cells are considered to be more eective drivers of tumourigenesis and relapse. It is therefore critical that we better understand the nature of tumour heterogeneity and that the drugdis covery programme recognises and reflects this. Cancer stem cells may again help us to address these issues, as great strides are currently being made in our capacity to grow tumours from patients back in the laboratory. Previously we have been limited to usingcell lines that have been adapted to 2-dimensionalculture conditions. As stated above, the power of these cell lines to predict drug-tumour interactions in patients is poor. However, recently, we have learnt how normal stem cells can be grown in 3-dimensional matrices to recapitulate normal tissue structures, and these techniques have subsequently been applied to tumours to allow 3-dimensional tumour 'organoids' to be grown and maintained in culture. These approachestherefore open the way to deliver personalised culture systems which better reflect the situation in the patient. Ultimately the aim is to develop this approach to provide platforms that allow basic biologicalques tions to be addressed, more rapid and accurate drug testing, and the influencing of treatment options on an individual patient basis. For example, one potential endpoint would be to grow organoid cultures from a patients' biopsy at diagnosis, which couldthen be genotyped and challenged with a range of potential therapies in culture, the response to whichwould dene the subsequent treatment regime - so truly personalising their therapy. For the concept of 'stemness' to be fully exploited in cancer biology, we will need an approach underpinned by signicant investment and multiple partners. Multi ple potential scientic and translational endpoints are currently being pursued in individual laboratories and also, in some instances, by entire institutes such as the European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute. However, even single institutes are limited in their capacity to eciently unlock the full potential of cancer stem cells, and we need to foster the development ofboth national and international networks to fullyexploit the potential these perspectives oer for new, and individually, tailored therapies. This will require crosstalk between all funders to deliver a mixed port folio of support that will truly maximise the impact of this eld on Stem Cell Research Institute Tel: +44 (0)2920 874 829europeancancerstemcell@cardi.ac.ukwww.cardi.ac.uk/research/cancer-stem-cell 229 Prof Alan Clarke Director European Cancer Stem Cell Research InstituteThe cancer stem cell (CSC) concept hypothesizes that a malignant neoplasia maintains a similar hierarchical structure to the normal tissue of origin, i.e., the bulk of the tumor represents differentiated progeny of rarer so-called CSCs with self-renewal capacity. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is universally regarded as providing the strongest evidence in support of the CSC concept. Fialkow and his colleagues first suggested that CML arose from rare transformed hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) nearly 40 years ago, when they showed that both granulocytes and red blood cells from CML patients were derived from a common cell. The term tumor/cancer stem cell was also first coined nearly 40 years ago to highlight the observation that only a minority of multiple myeloma cells were capable of clonogenic growth. The last decade has witnessed an increasing re-appreciation of the role of these heterogenous cellular cues in cancer development and therapy. This re-evaluation represents a rather crucial detour from the widely held view that the neoplastic phenotype resulted from uncontrolled prolifera- tion of tumor cells. The CSC concept would explain not only the low clonogenic capacity of most malignancies, but also why complete treatment responses translate into cures in only a minority of cancer patients. Initial responses in cancer represent therapeutic effectiveness against the bulk cancer cells, while rarer resistant CSCs could be responsiblefor relapse. Accordingly, improving the results of cancer therapy would require identification and better understand- ing of the biology of CSC. Within this framework, fundamental determinants of neoplastic disease are to be found within the CSC and, thus the role of CSC regarding cancer biology, management and therapy needs to be evaluated. It should be noted that partial tumor responses to therapy mean little if CSCs are the major cells determining outcome. Because of the difficulty of assessing the effects of therapies on the rare CSCs responsible for cancer mainte- nance and relapse, the development of new clinical approaches will require new clinical paradigms and method- ologies that should rely heavily on preclinical modelling, using novel preclinical assays to evaluate the fate of CSC. Preclinical studies should assess the effects of therapies on CSC and differentiated cancer cell popula- tions. This could allow us to take a fully functional new approach directly to the patient. A related concept is that the exact definition of \"stemness\" is elusive and stemness may be more of a cotinuum or a property that may be regained in cancer, which would suggest that neither the hierarchical nor the stochastic model are exclusively right. Furthermore, I must call the attentionto the fact that the fundamental con-cept essential to the CSC hypothesis does not have anything to do with the absolute frequency of these cellsThe therapeutic implications of Cancer Stem Cells 230within the tumour; indeed, what the model states is that there is a func- tional heterogeneity within the tumor cellular components, and that there is only a defined population of cells that can initiate/maintain malignant growth in vivowhile the remaining cells cannot. Thus, the therapeutic implications of the CSC concept are equally important whatever their fre- quency is within each tumour type: they are the cells that must be effec- tively targeted to achieve a definitive cure in the long term. This may even- tually allow correlation between CSC frequency and clinical outcome. It is plausible that the clinical aggres- sive cancer types may also contain a higher proportion of CSCs. In this regard, it has been recently shown that the proportion of CSCs might underpin differences between poorly and well-differentiated breast can- cers. Also a pending question is, would CSCs arising from transforma- tion of a normal stem cell yield a more aggressive cancer than one derivedfrom a more committed progenitor cell? It is our task not only to addressthis and other questions, but to deter- mine the CSCs relative importance for each stage and type of cancer. Our group has recently discovered that the growth potential of a cancerdepends on CSCs and on oncogenes that can function by a tumor stem cell reprogramming mechanism, suggesting that genetic lesions that initiate the cancer process might be dispensable for tumor progression and mainte- nance. Thus, it seems important to knowPROFILEhow to eradicate and/or inactivate this tumor stem cell reprogramming mechanism. Similarly, assessing the ability of any candidate therapy to destroy these new mechanism of CSC formation would seem crucial to predicting its efficacy. The evidence for the existence of CSCs and tumor stem cell reprogramming mechanism in human tumors is based on the creation of mice that are sufficiently immunodeficient to tolerate the growth of primary human cells into them. However, this growth does not exclude the possibility that engraftment rather than cancer stem cell activity correlates with a particular phenotype. Tumor stem cell reprogramming-based models allow bypassing the limitations and experimental variability of the xeno- transplant models. An enormous advantage of our tumorstem cell reprogramming-based models is that they not only enable syngeneic transplantation but they also allow studying the disease at its early stages in order to analyse the changes in CSCs long before the cancer can be phenotypically, i.e. clinically, detected. Besides the therapy per se, an essen- tial element in cancer management isthe evaluation of treatment efficacy. Therefore, new clinical methodologies need to be developed to evaluate the efficacy of tumor stem cell reprogram- ming-based therapies and here again the tumor stem cell reprogramming-based models will be pivotal to achieve this aim. It is to be expected that CSCs from dif- ferent cancer types will share many similarities, implying that similar tumor stem cell reprogramming-based ther-apeutic approaches could be used in many different cancers.

PROFILE232PROFILE Life expectancy in the western world has been on the rise, leading to an upshift in median age that will continue in the next decades1. As a consequence of popu- lation ageing, the incidence of ageing- related ailments has escalated; not only degenerative diseases such as Parkinson or Alzheimer, but also the number of people affected by cancers has risen drastically. Notwithstanding its impact on society, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood, translating into relatively coarse and unspecific cancer treat- ments. Only in the last few years has the treatment of some forms of cancer evolved into a more guided approach, and years of investigation will still be needed to design intelligent treatments for a wide variety of cancers. Stem cell biology of cancer Stem cells have a central role in most if not all ageing-related ailments. In most of the diseases studied, the depletion of stem cells and reduction of their proliferative capacity seems to be the main cause of tissue degener- ation. In cancer, however, excess growth is the central underlying mechanism. The role of stem cells in tissue home- ostasis depends on the equilibrium between differentiation and self- renewal. Whereas stem cell differen- tiation into more specialised cell types is the mechanism that produces the somatic tissues, self-renewal assures the maintenance of an undifferenti- ated cell population that maintains aproliferative capacity. In cancer, the equilibrium between differentiationand self-renewal is disturbed, provok- ing the accumulation of a population of poorly differentiated but highly proliferative cells. The identification of a stem cell popu- lation at the heart of tumor growth 2 comprises yet another link between ageing and cancer; the role of stem cells in cancer is just as important as in degenerative diseases. Whereas stem cell depletion and their uncon- trolled growth appear unrelated phenomena, they are in fact closely related; whereas a proportion of stem cellsare lost during ageing, theStem Cells and immunity Stem cells, Chromosomal instability and Cancer surviving stem cells have an increased chance of chromosome alterations. Chromosomal Instability (CIN) A key difference between healthy, normal stem cells and tumor cells is the acquisition of genomic alterations by the latter. Most carcinomas present some form of genetic instability, either as an accumulation of intragenic mutations or as a large-scale alter- ations -translocations, deletions and numerical changes -termed chromo- somal instability (CIN). Although the hypothesis that CIN itself can cause cancer has taken a long time before being accepted, CIN is frequently detected in tumors before intragenic 233PROFILE mutations and thus comprises a driving force in carcinogenesis3. Curren t theories suggest that CIN can induce cellular transformation through gene dosage or gene translocation; the genome fragments gained or lost in CIN frequently contain hundreds of genes, each of which can affect a pathway regulation step. The extra copies of many genes in CIN cause a gross imbalance in cellular regulation, which easily spills over into other pathways including cell cycle control4. Pathway interconnectedness thus appears to be the Achilles\u00b4 heel of genomic stability in mammals. Stem cells, CIN, and cancer therapy Because of their unique role in tissue renewal, stem cells have a combina- tion of characteristics that renders them susceptible to genetic damage, transformation, and tumor initiation. Stem cells not only undergo rapid growth and division, but also seem to be tolerant for gene dosage effects that would induce apoptosis in other cell types. Notwithstanding their resistance, cancer stem cell theory clearly indicates that this population must be targeted to treat carcinomas efficiently. Traditional anticancer therapy depends on tumor cell eradication by cytotoxic drugs, through the induction of addi- tional chromosome defects that lead to apoptosis or necrosis. Although the efficacy of the classical cancer treatments has advanced tremen- dously, they still suffer from side effects, such as the shutdown of stemcells in skin, intestine, and immune system. Thus, a drawback of many chemotherapeutics is the low capacity to distinguish between cancer cells and rapidly dividing non-cancer cells. In addition, most of the chemothera- peutic compounds favor selection of resistant and aggressive cancer cells. The last decade has seen the develop- ment of new therapies, aimed at a more specific elimination of cancer cells while reducing toxic effects. One phenomenon in particular, oncogene addiction, might yield novel targets for anticancer therapies5. In oncogene addiction, the cancer's need for survival leads to activation of the corresponding signal pathways, to an extent where cells become completely dependent. Oncogene addiction has been characterised in only a few types of cancer so far, but preliminary results are promising. Oncogene addiction seems to increase withtumor progression, so targeting sur- vival pathways might be the way totreat advanced cancer, where classical therapies loose efficiency. For example, the high level expression of HER that characterises the most aggressive forms of breast cancer is exploited for treatment with the neutralising antibody Herceptin\u00ae, improving the prognosis of HER-positive tumors. Novel targets in signaling pathways must be seen as an addition to classical therapies for now, but further charac- terisation of pathways might help to treat a wide range of cancers. Especially the targets that overlap with stemness and differentiation are interesting, for the possibility to attack cancer stem cells. Karel van Wely Antonio Bernad Carlos Martinez-A Department of Immunology and Oncology National Center of Biotechnology - CSIC Campus de Cantoblanco Madrid www.cnb.csic.esConcluding remarks The fundamental way in which cancer is treated is just recently being mod- ernised. New therapies will hopefully be able to discriminate better between cancer cells and healthy stem cells, and be tolerated better by the patient than current treatment schedules. The combination of data from stem cell biology, tumor evolution, and genetic analysis of patient material has greatly improved our understanding of cancer biology. Still, continued efforts are needed to use this knowledge for the benefit of cancer patients. References 1http://www.ageing.ox.ac.uk/ 2Gupta et al. (2009) Nat. Med. 15:1010-1012 3Pihan et al.

Med. 3:623-636 Permanent tissue damage to or partial loss of an organ or limb can be debilitating or lethal due to our limited ability to regenerate. Such outcomes therefore generate a need for therapeutic strategies to regenerate human tissues and restore their lost functions. These strategies can come from research into how other animals, such as the zebrafish, that regenerate their organs and appendages. While the response of most human tissue injury is to produce a durable scar tissue - crucial for maintaining the integrity of the tissue, but not its function - the zebrafish responds by replacing the loss with regenerated tissue. Therefore, this fish will allow researchers to answer several funda- mental questions that need to be addressed to promote adult human cells to regenerate adult tissues. These fundamental questions are: 1) What can induce quiescent, differentiated adult cells to become progenitor cells (cells that behave like embryonic cells, which develop tissues); 2) What is needed to control thegrowth and correct tissue pattern- ing of these progenitor cells to make structures, not tumours; and 3) What instructs these progenitor cells to stop regenerating once the correct size and proportions of the regenerated organ or limb to the body have beenreached (so as not to regenerate one leg longer than the other leg, for example). The laboratory of Christopher Antos at the DFG-Center for Regenerative Therapies is researching the cell biology and molecular mechanisms through which the zebrafish regenerates tissue: how the fish tissues \"know\" when to regenerate, where to grow, how to make the correct pattern, andwhen to stop growing after injury. The zebrafish is a very valuable animal model to answer these questions for several reasons: First, this fish regenerates many of its organs andappendages completely e.g. heart, retina, pancreas, liver, fins, etc. Second, fish tissues are similar in their compo- sition to human tissues. Third, subtle differences between fish cells and human cells should explain why manyfish tissues regenerate and many human tissues don't. Fourth, two of the primary regeneration strategies to regenerate human tissues in culture (use of stem cells and conversion of differentiated adult cells in the resid- ual appendage or organ stump into embryo-like progenitor cells) are used by the fish to restore lost tissue. Fifth, zebrafish are easy to maintain and can be used for genetic experiments to identify genes involved in regener- ation. Sixth, many of the tools used tostudy mammalian biology can also be used to study regeneration in the fish. And, lastly, humans can regenerate certain structures such as the liver, hair, skin, blood vessels, blood, immune cells, which means that the geneticcapacity in humans to regenerate exists, and work with the fish can leadUnderstanding organ and appendage regeneration 234to the knowledge required to expand this capacity to human organs and limbs that have \"lost\" the regenerative capacity. The Antos laboratory uses the zebrafish fin to learn how the fish activates, and controls the cells that regenerate new tissue and, impor- tantly, determines when tissue regen- eration needs to stop once the correct dimensions of the regenerating tissues have been achieved. Although the fish fins are architecturally different from the human limbs, they contain almost all of the same tissues: bone, peripheral nervous system, vasculature, connective tissue, joints,skin, melanocytes, etc. Using the fin,PROFILE Figure 1: Calcineurin-regulated proportional growth control. (A) Like our limbs, zebrafish grow fins to a specific proportion to the body size, and after amputation (B), they regenerate their fins to the original proportion (C). (D) The original size of the adult caudal fin before treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506. (E) After amputation, treatment results in the enhanced outgrowth of the regenerated fin beyond its normal dimension (F).the Antos laboratory discovered that an enzyme named calcineurin regulates the proportional regenerative outgrowth of the zebrafish appendages. Inhibition of this enzyme results in enhanced regeneration of the appendages so that they continue to regenerate beyond the normal dimen- sions of the original structure. Thus, the importance of this discovery is that it allows the Antos Laboratory to identify the molecular biology that regulates the size of an organ or limb to the correct proportions to the patient's body; that is, if you wish to regenerate an arm or leg, you need to know not only how to start the body's ability to regenerate the arm or leg, you need to know how to stop it once it has regenerated to the correct size. This research also has implications on the biology of tumourigenesis and cancer. Furthermore, this enzyme is regulated by calcium, an ion, and calcineurin may also regulate theactivity of enzymes that regulate other ions used by cells. Thus, this work has implications to determine how bio- electricity may be involved in tissue growth. In addition to this work, the Antos group has identified several genes associated with regeneration; includ- ing those encoding growth-promoting proteins, chaperones that regulate protein folding, and proteins control- ling cell proliferation. One gene that the Antos lab is working on is sim- plet/fam53b (smp). This gene is acti- vated in the progenitor cells at the onset of tissue regeneration. The Antos lab also found that this gene is present in multiple regenerating zebrafish tissues: fin, heart, brain and liver. It is likely in other regenerating zebrafish tissues as well. The research in the Antos lab determined that this gene is required for the proliferationof the progenitor cells that regeneratefish tissues and that it is required forChristopher Antos PhD expression of other genes that are important for regeneration. To find out how the smp gene func- tions in progenitor cells, the Antos group subsequently determined that the gene regulates a component of a previously defined molecular mecha- nism that is involved in stem cell maintenance, tissue patterning and even cancer biology. Smp regulates this component by facilitating its accumulation in the cell nucleus, which promotes the activation of other genes associated with stem cell maintenance, tissue patterning and tumorigenesis. Consequently, by studying the activities of this gene, theAntos lab is not only dissecting the biology of regeneration, but it is also providing greater understanding on the biology of cancer and embryonic development. Thus, the results coming from the Antos Laboratory at the DFG-CRTD are full of potential, and while tangible applications in humans still need to be developed, the remarkable physiology of the zebrafish is producing the potential to understand how to control human genes to induce and control regeneration of human tissues.

Chemical sciences play a major role in everyday life and are crucial to economic development. One area where they are key is the healthcare sector. Chemistry is vital in order to develop newtreatments and drugs for major healthcare challengessuch as cancer. Chemical sciences are also crucial in improving healthcare and helping doctors to understand an underlying disease and developing better diagnoses and treatments. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) accounted for 8.2 million deaths in 2012, with the most common causes being, lung, liver, and stomach cancer. The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) is committed to ensuring that chemical science contributes its full potential to tackling the major global challenges oftoday and tomorrow. The RSC has been working with doctors, academics, and manufacturers since 1841 to help advance excellence in the chemical sciences. As the world's leading sources of reliable chemicalsci ence knowledge, the RSC's global chemistry community contains the expertise of hundreds of thousands of people, and have over 170 years' worth of top-quality chemical science research publications, data, and reports stored in a cutting-edge online platform. The goal of the RSC is to connect people with chemical science knowledge by harnessing their informationand expertise and making it easily accessible. In orderto help support the importance of tackling major healthcare challenges, the RSC understands theimportance of drug discovery and new treatment methods for all areas of healthcare. At the RSC they support the vital contribution that chemistry plays in medical research and drug development in the UK. The RSC believes that over recent years there has been an increasing acknowledgement that the pharmaceutical sectorneeds to change. 1 Speaking at a seminar at the RSC in May 2014, Dr Mike Waring from AstraZeneca discussed the relevance of chemistry to the real world and explained how he believed chemistry plays a bigrole in the treatment of cancer. \"Cancer research is often considered the realm of biology and medicine - but chemistry is an equal player in that arena. History - a lot of people think of cancer as a modern disease but earliest reports go back to Egyptian scientists - Imhotep - to my knowledge that's the earliest written knowledge of cancer - under the therapy section he wrote 'there is none' which remained true for many years and of some cancers even now,\" he explained. \"One of the big problems is a number of people have said, it's a disease that has been encoded into our own DNA, so inevitable for some people really. I guess as I say in many cases you may say there is no adequate treatment. \"I hope and believe that one day we will beat cancer and certainly see great advances over the next few decades, but I also feel the solution to this lies rmly in the discipline of chemistry. The great advantage ofHealth Research 236chemical treatments is you can treat the whole body and target the cancer cells wherever it is. \" As well as treatments for cancer, chemistry also plays a crucial role in developing antibiotics for bacterialinfections that not only create healthcare challenges in the UK, but worldwide. The Royal Society ofChem istry also supports the development of antimi- crobial resistance through chemistry. It is estimated that around 25,000 people a year die from drug resistant microbial infections in Europe alone. The UK government have a ve year antimicrobial strategy in place (2013-2015), which aims to accelerate progress made and build upon previous work done in the UK to tackle antimicrobial resistance. UK Chief Medical Ocer, Dame Sally Davies supports the strategy and has raised the issue in her own annual report. \"There are few public health issues of greater importance than antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in terms of impact on society,\" she said in the Foreword to the Strategy.\"Many existing antimicrobials are becoming less eec tive. Bacteria, viruses and fungi are adapting naturally and becoming increasingly resistant to med icines used to treat the infections they cause. Inap propriate use of these valuable medicines has added to the problem. \"Coupled to this, the development pipeline for new antibiotics is at an all-time low. We must therefore conserve the antibiotics we have left by using them optimally. The process of developing new antimicrobials and new technologies to allow quicker diagnosis and facilitate targeted treatment must be accelerated,\"Dame Sally Davies problem of application of biochips is a need to use fluorescent markers, what can negatively influence reliability of detection and low sensitivity of analysis, what is the main drawback in application of this technology in early diagnosisof diseases. Thus, biosensors emerged as an alternative to biochips to address the main drawbacks of biochips. A battlefield glycomics Ultrasensitive vs. biochips Use of biochips is behind fundamental discoveries of the role of complexsugars (glycans) in important processes inside the cell. Moreover, biochipstogether with other sophisticated instrumental techniques helped to discover new prospective disease biomarkers, so important in diagnostics. There are however some limitations of biochips including a need to use special fluorescent markers for signal reading, influencing reliability of assays and the method is not applicable for early stage disease analysis.Contrary biosensors can effectively address biochip limitations working in a sensitive manner without fluorescent markers, thus being a viable alternative to biochips for possible future diagnostics. A competition has started. Glycan and lectin biochips DNA biochips are effective for high-throughput gene assays and currentlytwo such small biochips contain the whole human genome i.e. 25,000 genes. There are two forms of such devices applicable in glycomics either glycan or lectin biochips developed from DNA biochips. Glycan biochips mimic the human cell surface and can be applied for analysis of proteins or cells (i.e. viruses) infecting our human cells. Lectin biochips utilise lectins,proteins binding to glycans, for specic analysis of changed glycans for example in human blood or tissues signalling presence of some disease including various types of cancer with possible utilisation in diagnostics. Two Affymetrix DNA biochips are shown. A match for size comparison is depicted, as well. Images were taken from Schutz: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Affymetrix-microarray.jpgGlycomics There is no doubt that glycans are involved in numerous physiological (i.e. classication of human blood into different blood types) and pathological processes (viral/bacterial infections, development and spreading of various types of cancer) in living organisms. Thus, glycomics, a scientic eld studying the role of glycans, is developing at an increased pace. Every day new discoveries are emerging, further underlining essential functional role of glycans for the cell to stay t and healthy. It is estimated that 70-80% of all proteins within and on the surface of the cell have this \"sugary\" coat. Attachment of glycans to proteins is quite time- and energy-consuming process with substantial involvement of the cell building machinery. Since evolution only preserves the most effective survival strategies this fact further points out to the importance of glycans for every cell. This \"sugary\" coat is kind of an identity key, which after being \"hacked\" makes the cell vulnerable to attack or change of this identity can be behind disease progression. Remarkable discoveries in the eld of glycomics have been achieved using various types of sophisticated instrumentation, which had to be in many cases combined, to get information about function of glycans in the living system depending on a precise structure of glycans. These days' biochips and biosensors can provide useful information applicable for diagnostic/prognostic purposes without any need to apply quite complex instrumental techniques. BiochipsBiosensors Biosensors, devices integrated with biological molecules, can selectively detect a wide range of clinically important molecules (glucose, alcohol, but also disease biomarkers). Various different biosensor congurations are available and some of them are much more sensitive compared to biochips. Especially application of nanomaterials helped to provide detection limit of suchdevices down to detection of single molecules, what is amount much lower that the amount of disease biomarkers present in human blood. Thus, convenient and reliable early stage diagnostics is possible using some biosensor concepts. Moreover, some biosensor detections schemes (electrochemistry) allow detecting ultralow amount of disease biomarkers without a need to use fluorescent markers, enhancing reliability of analysis. There are two students responsible for development of especially electrochemical glycan and lectin biosensors in the group Tom\u00e1 Bert\u00f3k and Jaroslav Filip. The biosensor developed so far were applied in analysis of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis, but our current effort is aimed to design biosensors for diagnostics of prostate and colon cancer; and for detection of various forms of viruses. For more information: http://www.adjacentgovernment.co.uk/stakeholders/electrochemical-lectin-and-glycan-biochips-integrated-with-nanostructures-elena/Nanoscale biosensors There are two ways for nanoscale controlling a biosensor design. The rst one is a careful density adjustment of molecules on the surface to achieve high sensitivity, selectivity and reliability of analysis. The second one is utilisation of nanoparticles, nanotubes and a hot material of today\u00b4s science - graphene to do the same. Control over protein density on the surface with individual proteins (shown in the gure on the left) is achievable.

Behind all the innovations the basic rules of the chemical and physical sciences still apply governing what will work and what won't. It's the skill and imagination of the scientist and technologist that brings things together to create innovation. Or in the case of biology, it's time and evolution that work together. When I look out of my office window I see objects from both nature and technology: trees, flowers, painted objects, dyed banners, for example. I've picked or implied colours because colour is the visible manifes- tation of one of the most important branches of chemistry; scientists call it heterocyclic chemistry. Basically, it's defined as the chemistry of com- pounds containing atoms joined in rings, mostly with 5 or 6 atoms, most of which are carbon but others are nitrogen especially, oxygen, sulfur, or phosphorus and sometimes metals and other elements. I've worked in heterocyclic chemistry all of myresearch career from PhD onwards and for me, heterocyclic compounds make things happen . I can argue this both from the point of heterocyclic compounds that occur in nature and heterocyclic compounds that we havemade in the laboratory.Let's start with nature. Everyone has heard of DNA and knows that this is the molecule that codes the information that makes us, and all living things, what we are. Some people will know about the 'double helix' structure of DNA. Only a few will know DNA con- tains a heterocyclic component as the major part of its backbone (the sugar,ribose) and that four specific hetero- cyclic rings are responsible for carrying the information (the so-called bases, adenine, guanosine, thymidine, and cytidine). When DNA is active, its information is converted in a series of steps of copying and editing into the proteins of the organism, plant, animal, or microorganism. Now let's jump into the laboratory to make some new heterocyclic com- pounds. One of our major projects at Strathclyde concerns designing and synthesizing small compounds that bind selectively to DNA and in this waycan control its operation; this class of compound is known as a minor groove binder (MGB). The picture shows DNA in blue with one of our MGBs boundProfessor Colin J Suckling OBE DSc FRSE Research Professor of Chemistry Department of Pure & Applied Chemistry University of Strathclyde Tel: 0141 548 2271 www.strath.ac.uk/chemistryIt's chemistry 240(green, red, white, yellow; the yellow atoms represent sulfur which is part of a heterocyclic ring, the other atoms being carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen). We've been able to obtain MGBs that act highly selectively to kill disease- causing bac teria and one of these has been taken forward by our partner company, MGB Biopharma, to clinical trials for Clostridium difficile infections. Becausewe can target DNA in differ- ent ways using MGBs we think that there are many diseases that will be susceptible to treatment with medi- cines containing MGBs. Indeed we have some early information that viruses such as hep atitis C virus can be attacked. This leads to the thought that even the infamous Ebola virus might be treatable with the right MGB. We're trying hard to set up the right teams with partners who can handle Ebola virus safely so that we can put heterocyclic chemistry to work chal- lenging this global health problem. PROFILE Health Research 241The role of chemistry in drug discovery and development Sriram Radhakrishnan a Healthcare Analyst at Frost & Sullivan details the vital role chemistry plays in drug discovery and development... Drug discovery and development is one of the most complex and expensive activities within the framework of the pharmaceutical industry. It encompasses a wide array of end-to-endactivities with a plethora of supply chain and support services. It is estimated that the average cost to research and develop each successful drug is between $800m to $1bn. Drug discovery and development can be classied into discovery phase, preclinical phaseand early stage development, mid stage development and late stage development. Drug discovery has undergone many changes over the years but the goal has remained same: to uncover safer medicines for all diseases. Drug discovery and development is driven by the knowledge of chemistry of the molecules and their association with life process. The classical or traditional method adopted by medic inal chemists involves modifying bio-active molecules from natural products. These natural prod ucts are the source of active ingredients in most of the existing drugs. The current era has witnessedan ever changing role in modern drug discovery. Thechemical methods adopted for the discovery of the molecules have also undergone changes leading to the development of technologies such as combinatorialchemistry (combichem), microwave assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) and high-throughput (HTS) biological screening. These new technologies have enabled medicinal scientists to accelerate the discovery process. Drugs are designed, synthesised and puried as the rst stage of the development process. The medicinal chemist leverages knowledge of synthetic chemistry, medicinal chemistry and biology to achieve the lead molecule for further clinical development. The contribution of chemistry is not conned just to the discovery stage. It carries its purpose along the entire spectrum of clinical development. Each and every stage of clinical development involves surplusamounts of formulated drugs for studying potential benets in human trials. All drugs are manufactured under strict Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) stan dards to ensure they meet the compliance require- ments drafted by regulatory bodies. Drug developers leverage on the analytical chemical testing and process development for meeting the regulatory compliances. It is estimated that about 50% of the analytical chemistry services are outsourced. The majority of these support services are now being rendered by Contract Research Organisations such as Charles River Laboratory, Covance, Quintiles, PPD, Eurons, SGS Life Sciences, Wuxi AppTech, etc. Analytical methods and instru- men tation are regularly used in the preclinical testing, toxicity testing, ADME analysis, product release testing, formulation and quality control. Various techniques are adopted by the pharmaceutical industry, commonly known as purication chemistry, to separate the large molecules like monoclonal antibodies, vaccines in order to meet the standards of the regulatory bodies. The current era is witnessing a growth of biologics such as vaccines, growth factors, monoclonal antibodies and biosimilars for the treatment of cancer, diabetes, asthma, rheumatic arthritis, etc. The complexity here is multifold owing to the highdegree of purication standards that are required to develop these biologics. In short, chemistry remains the most invaluable scienceand plays the most critical role in the drug development process. It serves as the backbone to framework the drug discovery and bolstering the growth of need for special education in bio banking Tanja Macheiner, Berthold Huppertz & Karine Sargsyan from Biobank Graz explain the importance of knowledge transfer and education for the future of biobanking... Human biospecimens in combination with their associated data derived from certied biobanks serve medical research in a pivotal way, leading to a better understanding of diseasesand improvement in diagnosis and treatment 1. The eminent benet of supra-regional biobanks and biobanking networks can be illustrated by the rapid set-up of large cohorts for investigations on rare diseases or genetic association studies, all of which need large numbers of subjects to deliver signicant ndings. Likewise, studies using epidemiological information of a population over time benet from a broad collection strategy. Moreover, biomarker research for personalised medicine heavily relies on biobanking 1. Standardised sample quality is essential for ecient use of biospecimens, even if collection is performedby various biobanks. One way to reach this goal is the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for collection, processing and storage of samples anddata. Such SOPs are already in place in some large biobanks 1and represent an important topic within the European infrastructure \"Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure - European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC)\" and the \"International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER)\" 2. However, the demands on biobanks increase consis- tently with the growing number of biospecimensand scientic applications. The preservation method combined with the storage type is often pivotal for further use of a biospecimen. In correspondence tochallenges in cryopreservation, quality control of cryoconserved biospecimens represents an important research topic. An interruption of the cold chain may have ruinous eects on a sample. At the same timequality monitoring of samples stored long-term is difcult to perform 3. Therefore, biobanks have become a real scientic battleeld, which is proven by increas ing numbers of publications on biobanking science and procedures in the last decade. Here we discuss the increasing amount of know-how and knowledge of biobanking science to be transferred and the necessity of experts in biobanking in the future. Biobanking science and the demand for experts in future The high demand for educating experts in the eld of biobanking creates the need for a well-structured postgraduate training and education system 4. Such occupational education should include the following key aspects: Handling of dierent types of samples and storage conditions (pre-analytical chain); Cryobiology; Research knowledge in e.g. molecular biology, biochemistry, -omics and histology; Workflow creation skills; Knowledge about clinical trials and scientic applications; Quality management, quality assurance and quality control; IT and data management; Ethics and law; Risk management and disaster planning; Biostatistics; Epidemiology; International networks. Currently, there are few opportunities for such biobanking courses. Approaches to teaching in biobanking include (a) the traditional face to faceHealth Research 242Health Research teaching and (b) online teaching, the latter becoming more and more common. Both types can be combined with workshops or placements in the eld of biobank ing. These educational opportunities are (1) postgraduate master education with academic courses teaching all technical, scientic and legal/ethical aspects of human and environmental biobanking, or (2) specic biobanking training modules or workshops without academic graduation. Examples of biobank education already in place The postgraduate biobanking education at theCatholic University of Lyon (France) oers a traditionaleducation which includes hand-on training for 9 months within a period of 2 years and a diploma which is equivalent to the Master of Science. Generally, this education is taught in French with the exception of methodological tools, which are also taught in English. Likewise the King's College London (UK) oers a postgraduate biobanking education in English whichincludes 2 ve-month placements. The course isfocused on sample preparation, preservation, staining techniques as well as collection and storage techniques for oncology. Additionally, students learn how to prepare and analyse circulating DNA and tumor cells. However, only 6 to 8 students are accepted per year. The University of Luxembourg oers a certied biobanking course for three weeks in a face to facestyle, while Biobank Graz (at Medical University of Graz, Austria) oers biobanking training modules and workshops related to collection and biopreservationof biospecimens and their associated data for their national and international cooperation partners. In contrast, some biobanking training courses are pri- marily performed online. For example the biobanking training of the University of British Columbia (Canada) is available online year-round. This overview of biobanking education opportunities demonstrates that only a small number of institutionsoers a solid education that contains practical place- ments and theoretical units during longer periods for a sustainable and solid biobanking education. Training, workshops and courses represent ideal supplemental education for scientists. However, they cannot replace a professional biobanking educationfor biobank personnel, since those people need toknow everything about sampling, storage, ethics, applications and management. Europe is now going towards a rst agreement on minimal standards for such education strategies within biobanking networks such as BBMRI-ERIC to yield a better harmonisation in the eld of biobanking. First eorts in this direction have already been successful creating a white paper for biomarker research standards within BBMRI-ERIC at the workshop \"Tissue-based Biomarkers for Advancement of Personalized Cancer Treatment\", held on March, 28 to 29, 2014 in Graz.

Muscle mass and strength are critical for maintaining physical function, mobility andvitality. Sarcopenia was rst coined to repre- sent the loss of muscle that normally occurs duringthe aging process. Loss of muscle as a result of dis- ease can be referred to as myopenia, keeping in mind that many older individuals may have lost muscle due to co-morbidities (chronic disease), recent hospitalisa- tion, or medications. Regardless of the cause, or how it is dened, individuals with severe muscle wastinghave diculty performing daily tasks. Disability, poor functional capacity and shorter sur- vival contribute to high costs as a result of reduced quality of life, increased caregiver burden and health service utilisation. It has been revealed that low muscle mass is prevalent in every body size. Function of muscle is dependent in part on muscle quality. Muscle tissue normally contains only small amounts of fat not intended for long-term lipid storage, butrather as a short term energy source for skeletal muscle contraction. Myosteatosis, characterised by excess deposition of fat into muscle, is considered tobe a pathological phenomenon. The more fat a muscle contains, the less dense it becomes, and low density muscle is poor quality muscle. Low muscle density has been described in conditions of aging, detraining, various types of muscle atrophy, insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes and most recently, cancer. Both low muscle mass and myosteatosis have been identied to increase the risk of poor function and death in a variety of patient populations. The causes of myopenia and myosteatosis are multi- factorial and may share common pathways for devel- opment. The complexity of relationships between various tissues is emerging. There is communication(cross-talk) between tissues through the release of mediators from one organ system to another in response to physiological stimuli. Involvement of other tissues to alter amount and quality of muscle adds several orders of complexity to the problems of myosteatosis and myopenia. Many underlying factors contribute to a decline in muscle health, includingcatabolic humoral mediators (i.e. pro-inflammatory cytokines), anabolic failure (i.e. insulin insensitivity) and activation of proteolytic systems. Finding a treatment for low muscle mass is on the agenda of many pharmaceutical companies. To date, there are no approved drugs to reverse muscle loss, however several phase 2 and 3 trials are in progress investigating promising potential treatments for muscle loss that occurs during aging and disease. The ability to modify muscle wasting and intramuscu- lar fat accumulation has a broad scope of application to aging, diabetes, obesity and various forms of muscle atrophy, which share these common features. While treatment for these conditions remains limited, a number of mechanisms may contribute to the abil-ity various drugs and nutrients to alter body composi- tion, however, a more complete understanding of the features of the muscle characterised by wasting and fat Metabolism University of AlbertaTel: +1 78 04 92 80 48 vera.mazurak@ualberta.cawww.afns.ualberta.caHealth Research 244Communicable Diseases 245Reducing the risk of Ebola with strong health systems Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe details the measures being taken by WHO to help combat the Ebola virus and how strong health systems are crucial... The current outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa is the largest in history. But why are we facing so serious an emergency that WHO calls it a \"humanitarian crisis\"? Many are asking this question. This is the rst outbreak involving movements of large groups of people and aecting big cities and multiple countries at once. It is the rst to make around 13,000 people sick in so few months and kill 5,000 of them. Countries' coping capacity has not been adequate to face such a large outbreak. The response eorts required go beyond medical needs; they need to take account of the social, economic, development, logistic and security challenges that are aecting these countries and the region as a whole. Having only recently emerged from long periods of conflictand instability, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have weak health systems, lacking infrastructure and human resources. All these factors have led to a crisis that is running ahead of control eorts. Another question WHO often receives is: \"What risk does Ebola pose to Europe?\" The answer is that the risk of it spreading in Europe is very low. This assessment is centred on the role of health systems in responding to Ebola. A strong health system will be able to prevent the disease from spreading, and European countries have a high standard of preparedness for viral haem orrhagic fevers, which include Ebola. I am glad to see that this focus on strong health systems is in line with Health 2020, WHO's European health policy framework, launched in 2012. Health 2020 calls on European countries to strengthen theirhealth systems and public health capacity, including preparedness for and response to all health threats and emergencies. This in turn builds on the requirements for countries to enhance surveillance and response under the International Health Regulations (2005). This call has never been more relevant, or more urgent. Stronger health systems to respond to Ebola mean strong surveillance systems; laboratory capacity for safe, rapid and reliable detection; arrangements for tracing and following contacts; case management; and risk communications. They mean well equipped hospitals with isolation wards; trained doctors and nurses; and strict adherence to infection prevention and control measures, such as correctly using protec tive gear. \"The response eorts required go beyond medical needs; they need to take account of the social, economic, development,logistic and security challenges that are affecting these countries and the region as a whole. \" While a traveller may bring Ebola to Europe and health care workers treating an infected patient may be exposed to the disease, good preparedness makes each European country ready to detect, inves tigate and treat Ebola cases in people coming to or living in Europe. All this tells people in Europe that they should not worry, as they have an extremely low risk of being infected. They need to stay informed of developments and follow the advice of their health authorities. If they travel to aected countries, they should avoid all contacts with infected people or animals, living or dead, and carefully follow routine hygiene practices such as washing their hands. Any who develop Ebola- like symptoms should immediately see a doctor and say that they have just returned from a country with Ebola. The WHO Regional Oce for Europe is working closely with partners in the European Commissionand the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to provide guidance to countries in the WHO European Region - which includes 53 countries extending from the Atlantic Ocean in the west tothe Pacic Ocean in the east -on a number of issues, including disease surveillance, diagnostics and management of people suspected to have Ebola at airports, sea ports and land crossings. The Regional Oce is also assisting European countries in investigating suspected cases originating from WestAfrica and evacuating patients infected with Ebola. An Ebola core team is now available upon request toassess country preparedness and to be deployed to European countries at need. But the real ght cannot be conducted in Europe. The most eective way to prevent Ebola infections in Europe is to control the epidemic in the heavilyaected West African countries. That is where eorts should focus now. That is why the Regional Oce has sent its experts to support the Ebola response in West Africa since spring 2014, and will continue to do so. That is why the international community is massively scaling up the response: an increasing number of countries are deploying their experts, their doctors,nurses and military forces to build treatments centres, make beds available, diagnose Ebola and support logistic. They are ensuring their people are trained and protected to do so.

Proper is e hygiene es Prope h 100% is essential Professor Tom\u00e1 Hanke of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford details the diculties in developing vaccines for HIV... Since the rst report of AIDS in 1981, an estimated 60 million people have become infected with HIV, of whom some 25 million have died. Over 90% of new infections take place in countries with limited resources. Despite proven methods of prevention, all eorts to slow the rateof new HIV-1 infections are failing in most countries around the world. Over 30 drugs have been developed inhibiting a number of essential steps in the HIV growth; thesecan be used to treat HIV infection thus prolong lives of HIV-positive individuals and can also serve as a prevention of HIV acquisition. Indeed, optimism has been spreading that the control of AIDS epidemic hasbecome possible: it is now a matter of a 'businessplan' to provide drugs to everybody who needs them. However, still almost half of people who are infected with HIV do not know their HIV status. In addition, because of drug unavailability on a regular reliable basis particularly in resource-poor settings, long-term side eects, requirement for rigorous daily compliance, potential development of resistance and unwillingness to take drugs in a surprisingly large proportion ofinfected individuals even in the US, a safe, eective, accessible vaccine against HIV-1 infection will be key to any solution of the AIDS epidemic. Developing a vaccine against HIV is not easy. Traditional vaccine approaches cannot be used for HIV: killed HIV does not work and live attenuated HIV is too dangerous. Thus, safe subunit vaccines represent the most explored 248Communicable Diseases current strategies. These consist of small parts (subunits) of HIV, typically a protein or polysaccharide, which the immune responses learn to target, and a means of the subunit delivery and presentation to the immune system, often using other safe non-replicating viruses, which determines the magnitude, type, location and durability of the elicited immune responses. Both the subunits and their delivery have to be right to achieve protection against either infection or development of disease. The diculties in development of an eective vaccine are numerous. First, HIV infects and destroys the very cells in the body, which orchestrate the generation of protective responses against invading microbes andcancer. The biggest challenge for development of an eective HIV vaccine is the HIV variability, which allows HIV to change and escape (become unrecognisableby) the mounted immune responses; escaped HIV variants rapidly overgrow their parental strains sup- pressed by existing immune responses. Furthermore, HIV has evolved in a way that during natural infection, the generated responses rst target the most variableparts of HIV, which HIV can easily change and become invisible. By the time the immune responses refocus on the functionally conserved regions of HIV proteins, which HIV either cannot change or can change at a great cost to its tness, it is too late, because the damage to the body's ability to ght infections hasbeen incurred. \"Developing a vaccine against HIV is not easy. Traditional vaccine approaches cannot be used for HIV: killed HIV does not work and live attenuated HIV is too dangerous. Thus, safe subunit vaccinesrepresent the most explored currentstrategies.\" My research focuses on development of HIV vaccines targeting precisely this Achilles heel of HIV, the most conserved regions on HIV proteins, which are required for proteins' structure or function in order for HIV to survive. These conserved parts are common to all global HIV variants and also escape mutants in infected individuals. Therefore, if this conservedsubunit approach works, we would have a vaccine, which could be deployed in Africa, Asia, Europe, America and Australia: it would be universal. My group has done lots of pre-clinical renement and optimisation of this vaccine design, and have together with colleagues pio neered the conserved region strategy into clinical trials in humans. The initial results are highly encouraging in terms of safety and induction of robust immune responses in human volunteers. Now, we have a platform that can be tested in high risk, but HIV-negative adults as a preventive tool. Because also over 700 children are infected with HIV every day mainly with their mother's virus, we also plan to test this approach in the paediatric setting to protect neonates against mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast milk. The same approach is very appropriate for stud ies aimed at controlling or even eliminating HIV from the body in conjunction with antiretroviral treat ment and reactivation of the latent virus. Here, refocusing killer T cells to conserved regions of the HIV proteome is greatly preferable to simply boosting the pre-treatment responses that had failed to control the virus in the rst place. An eective HIV vaccine would have a dramatic impact on the quality of lives of millions of people, social structures and economies in the most aected countries. HIV-1 vaccine development is admittedly of high risk, but vaccines cannot be discovered without testing novel ideas and technologies backed by a sustained nancial and +44 1865 617630tomas.hanke@ndm.ox.ac.ukwww.jenner.ac.uk 249 Taking care of people includes caring for the environment. Healthy ecosystems support global security by providing us with the resources we need to thrive. But sometimes advances can come at the expense of the environment. This means we need to find ways of addressing public health and agricultural challenges without the big environmental price tag. Investing in new environmentally friendly technologies that help us achieve our Sustainable Development Goals1is a clear way forward. The Oxitec control of insect pests is a good example of this kind of technology because it has a light environmental footprint. A major challenge that cuts across environmental protection, human health and agriculture is the effective control of insect pests. Insect pests spread disease and damage crops, creating a massive burden for healthcare systems and farmers. One example is the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries dengue fever, yellow fever and chikungunya virus. This mosquito has spread to over 100 countries and because the females blood-feed predominantly on humans they quickly transmit diseases from person to person, leading to epidemic outbreaks. A popular method of control is fogging with insecticides, but these mosquitoes live inside houses, close to their human meals,and can reproduce in little pools of water just about anywhere, so there are lots of breeding sites that never get treated. There's understandably a big demand for better control methods. Another major pest is the diamondback moth that destroys brassica crops and costs farmers billions of dollars each year. These moths have been devel- oping resistance to insecticides, which makes them difficult to control. Plus, consumers are increasingly demanding foods with less spray residues, so new environmentally friendly control options are needed as part of inte- grated pest management systems. This is where Oxitec comes in - a Tackling farming and human health challenges Using tech that's clean and green 250spinout from Oxford University -whose scientists have developed an effective and safe method of pest control for insects such as the dengue mosquito and diamondback moth. The idea is based on the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) which has been used for the last 50 years to sterilise insects with radi- ation. The insects are then released to mate with wild ones to prevent them from having offspring. One drawbackof radiation is that it can reduce the fitness of the insects, limiting their mating effectiveness. This inspired Oxitec scientists to adapt the SIT approach by using genetic engineering , which is more carefully targeted than radiation, and produces a highly effective and stable form of control.PROFILE Insect pest control solutions for farming and public health can be both effective and environmentally friendlyTo tackle wild pest populations, Oxitec has genetically engineered insects such as the Aedes aegypti mosquito by introducing two genes - a colour marker to track the insects, and a self-limiting gene that prevents the offspring from surviving. Oxitec releases male mosquitoes because they don't bite or spread disease, and they do all the hard work of finding the wildfemales to mate. Their offspring don'tsurvive, so after successive releases the pest population is reduced and this means fewer mosquitoes to bite humans and transmit disease. Thesystem is similar for agricultural pests except that the self-limiting gene tech- nology specifically targets the females that lay eggs and damage crops.Oxitec has done mosquito outdoor trials in several countries, and in every case the local Aedes aegypti population was reduced by at least 90%. In cage experiments with agricultural pests such as diamondback moth and Mediterranean fruit fly, the pest pop- ulation was completely suppressed, so the technology is extremely effec- tive. But what makes this solution even more appealing is its light envi- ronmental footprint. The insects die and do not persist in the environment. The modified insects target their own species so the genes do not spread. And this species-specific targeting along with reductions in insecticide use allows beneficial insects like bees to thrive.Oxitec Ltd insect pest control strains are now in field trials and more are in development, with collabora- tions in countries such as the US,Panama, Brazil and India. \"In cage experiments with agricultural pests such as diamondback moth and Mediterranean fruit fly, the pest population was completely suppressed...\" The philosophy in designing the Oxitec approach was to place ecological considerations on the same level as efficacy. With many technologies, such as insecticides, efficacy and the envi- ronment are trade-offs that are weighed against each other. But by using a self-limiting approach, whichdoes not 'spread' in the environment, and by combining it with an in-built monitoring system, the twin objectives of combatting insects and improving our environment can be met at the same time. 1Open Working Group proposal for Sustainable Development Goals http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/focussdgs.html PROFILE One of the insect pests Oxitec has developed a solution for is the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella)Leading in learning Learning & development plays a vital role in enhancing employees and organisational performance, as detailed by Ruth Stuart, Research Adviser at CIPD... Learning does not stop when you leave the class room. It's a life-long continual process of insight, reflection and growth. Increasingly organisations are tapping into this potential fordevel opment and connecting learning to tangible business outcomes. The CIPD 2014 Learning and Development (L&D) survey report1(completed by over 1000 learning professionals) nds that greater integration of L&D activity and business strategy is the most anticipated change in the next 2 years. Also expected is more emphasis on monitoring, measuring and evaluating training eectiveness. Some organisations are already making progress. Greater business focus is cited as the number one change for organisations over the last year. This is a welcome development. Business and learning leaders are recognising that in order to enhanceemployee and organisational performance they need to work hand in hand. But doing so may require a shift in mindset in some organisations and increased focus on measuring the impact of L&D activity, for 3 key reasons. 1. Demonstrating value can help to enhance L&D credi bility across the organisation. 2. Evaluating true learning impact means investment can be justied, and made where it's needed most. 3. Data can help you to understand what works, so you can stop/start/continue activity to achievemax imum business impact. In this regard the ndings of the report initially appear to be promising. The research shows that organisations are investing signicantly more time and attention on measurement. The 2014 survey ndings 252 Human Resources show a marked improvement in assessment methods used to measure the impact of learning. The proportion using business metrics (such as protability, revenue and market growth) increased from 38% (in 2013) to 54% in 2014. Those calculating the return on investment (ROI) of interventions increased from 26% to 48%. So we are increasingly measuring impact. However, this isn't the end of the story. 60% of organisations say that they have diculties measuring the eectiveness of L&D activity. While a quarter rarely use the data they collect. The old adage of 'what get's measured get managed' may not be true in this case. So what stops us? Two-thirds say that managers and leaders don't prioritise L&D evaluation. 60% feel it's dicult to access data consistently. Almost half admit that they don't have the skill or resource to focus on metrics. Over a third can't get access to key business information and data. It seems that the key to solving these challenges is collaboration and integration. L&D departments need to build relationships across the organisation to ensure they understand the business model and have the skills to interpret business data. In many cases this may mean further integration into the heart of the business.The benets of doing so can be substantial. When aligned to business priorities learning and development activities have the potential to help organisations transform performance. Leadership development activities can help set a new direction to forge a new culture and focus. Raising the skills of the workforce can lead to enhanced engagement, commitment and ultimately individual performance. Whatever the busi ness challenge it is highly likely that eective L&D interventions have a role to play. With this in mind weoer '2 calls to action' reflecting the ndings of our latest report, in collaboration with Towards Maturity, Aligning business and learning 2. Call to action to business leaders Embrace your L&D team as a partner in change; Demand that your L&D function focuses on outcome measures, not just inputs; Recognise your own power to role model eective learning.

(2014) Aligning business and learning: Why now, - L&D CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development http://www.cipd.co.uk/ 253 Ruth StuartResearch Adviser - L&DThe only constant in business, private or public, is Change ; and most people whether they admit it or not do not like change enacted upon them. It is therefore important as you approach designing and implementing a Continuous Improvement (CI) programme that you fully recognise and manage the change aspects. Continuous improvement is not a new concept, well promoted in manufacturing businesses; it requires intensive teamwork with team members that have the delegated responsibility to improve the processes they are part of. Leadership is key in selling the vision of the future beyond the proposed improvements and designing a reward and recognition scheme that has a personal dimension to it. Change Management is multi-dimensional including education and training, business process modelling, and communications. All of these elements are then designed to match the organisational culture. External Intervention and facilitation can be effective, in challenging thestatus quo, providing analysis tools and programme management; but sustainability can only be achievedfrom within and enthusiastic partici- pation can only be guaranteed if the process is enjoyable. Making this process enjoyable requiresthat you ensure that each of the participants: Has a sense of control over the out- come. Understand their personal benefit. See how they will improve their skills making them more employable inside or outside the organisation. Receive recognition of their achieve- ments through the monitoring of benefits and the difference the change has made. Why does this make it enjoyable? Firstly, if you can see and feel in con- trol of your own destiny you are morelikely to participate in changing it. ThisMaking business improvement enjoyable and sustainable Benetting from business process management means leaders need to be able to project a vision of where they think continuous improvement is going to take the business, and then what part the participants will play in it. Leaders also need to emphasise and promote the personal benefits such as training as well as monetary rewards. For example demonstrating that by participating in programmes such as this so they can progress within the business and in some cases this pro-gression might be significant enough that they move out of the business into a new career. Sustainability requires that the busi- ness: Provides a strategic framework in which continuous improvement is 254PROFILE255PROFILE managed through process improve- ment targets set over a 3-5 year period. Provides for the monitoring of these targets as part of departmental 'business as usual' activities. Continues to provide training in analysis, communication and deci- sion making skills perhaps using the early practitioners to develop others. Communicates regularly describing how the business is progressing and the contribution from CI. What are the key elements of a successful CI programme? We consider the corner stone to be a dynamic business process model. By understanding the present maturity of the processes, comparing to best practice provides the 'Gap' that must be closed by the CI programme. We debate process performance in a qualitative manner in cross-functionalworkshops. The maturity of these processes will vary and this will lead to different categories of improvement such benchmarking, step change and break through. When redesigning processes we take into account that different processes have different values within the busi- ness, therefore there should be little discussion about streamlining activi- ties and removing rework from back office processes and can be set to a 'best practice' standard; whereas 'added value' processes need careful design to ensure we deliver the most beneficial outcome. The benefits model of the continuous improvement programme will directly be related directly to these processesalso. Executive workshops enable senior managers to define the type of benefit and the degree of difficulty to achieve it. We use 3 categories Displaced Costs, Improved Productivity and Increased Revenue; and three degrees of diffi- culty High, Medium and Low to enable mangers to allow for the level of control they have in implementing the process improvement. This qualitative method engages managers better than tradi- tional single target benefit measures. Throughout a CI programme a signifi- cantlevel of honest communication is required, all stakeholders need to be understood and communication will vary from results notification to visioning. All the communicators will need to have a good level of skill and beable to address their work col- leagues and senior managers in equal measure. This ability requires structured training and to ensure good 'internalisation' of change we use workshops to engage the change agent in all participants; other skills training will include the ability to communicate with colleagues, facilitate workshops and present analysis and assessment results to senior managers. The senior managers role in this is to be listening, facilitating and mentoring, guiding; not managing and implementing. In Summary Throughout the next 12 months we will be looking at some of these tech- niques and approaches in more detail, but in conclusion the implementationand management of a successful continuous improvement programme requires good planning, a shared vision of the future, skilled internal change agents and extensive open communication. Rod Horrocks CEO and Founder H3 Partners Ltd Tel: +44 (0) (0) 845 118 0072 rod@h3partners.co.uk www.h3partners.co.ukWe hope that we have shown that the human element is the key issue in the whole process; take your staff with you. In addition do not think you can delegate the whole process to outside agencies though they can help to pro- vide tools and techniques and create initial momentum. For example there are many examples of where a change have been made without performing business modelling and in some cases this has resulted in extremely effective , short term cost reductions in head count, but an inability to perform the processes effectively after the programme stops. Finally CI should be seen as redirecting your resources to add more value in activities that you may not be able to perform effectively because they are either not recognised, there is not enough resource in the business to do them or they are being protected by departmental approaches to process design and management that are ineffective in today's agile business climate. How many times have you heard the words continuous improvement in the last twelve months? Here we look at the upside and downside of continuous improvement, as provided by the people we come into contact with. At the end we summarise these ndings from which you can make up your own mind. Let's start with the negatives: \"It is too costly to train and implement continuous improvement\" \"It can be a complicated tool to understand and implement\" \"It takes too long to see a return on investment\" \"We want to do it, but our senior management don't\" \"Our people don't like change!\" These are the most common reactions we hear when the words continuous improvement is spokenand we have to say that we agree with some ofthem - but only some! If we deal with each in turn, then, emanating from this we can see that there are opportunities to overcome all of these. 1. It's too costly to train and implement continuous improvement It is well documented that the public sector are challenged with huge cost reductions. Eciency is the name of the game right now and will continue to be for years to come. But... given the budget constraints it makes it very dicult to justify thisinvestment. Why? Because typically organisations lack condence in the realisation of a return on investment. Consider this: A healthcare provider recently invested \u00a35k in continuous improvement training (Lean Six Sigma) and realised a return on investment of almost \u00a3100k - in just a few months. 2. It can be a complicated tool to understand and implement We agree! It can be complicated. With the vastarray of tools and techniques that Lean Six Sigma brings it is often dicult to understand which tool to use and when to use it - particularly those within the Six Sigma tool-box! The question is' \"Should itbe complicated?\" Our answer to that is no! It is only complicated if you allow it to be. We have come across some organisations that try to deploy every tool available! The message quite simply is keep it simple. Try using the simplest of tools in the early stages e.g. 5S or Value Stream Mapping rather than trying to create excessive control charts or process capability analysis. Consider this: An administrative centre decided to implement 5S as a means to gaining buy-in from the team and to demonstrate the power of clean ecient processes. This was a huge success (the importance of implementing ALL components of 5S and sustaining is key) from which they achieved strong engagement and the appetite from the team to progress with other continuous improvement tools. Result: great engagement and a total of 18 hours saved per day. 3. It takes too long to see a return on investment It can take some time to see a return on investment depending on your project(s) and the complexity that resides within them. Major transformational projects will undoubtedly take far longer than thoseThe trouble with Continuous Improvement! www.dembridge.co.ukThe top 5 reasons why organsations resist embracing continuous improvement.that can be considered as functional or local projects. However, there are many small projects that can be undertaken which can realise fast results - quick wins or the 'low hanging fruit.' Like above, the key is to start o with these smaller projects (it really helps the learning), get some quick results under your belt and then progress to the larger projects. Rapid Action Teams (RAT's) and Kaizen events are great for achieving this! Consider this: As shown by the healthcare project illustrated in point 1, results CAN be achieved a lot quicker than some may think. It is all about choosing your projects carefully at the outset and then ramping up the larger projects as you become more andmore familiar with the application of the methodologies i.e. Lean and Six Sigma. 4. We want to do it, but our senior management don't!Without senior management demonstrable commitment to continuous improvement, your ventures are likely to fail. Fact. This is not a questionof whether members of senior management do not wish to embrace continuous improvement, rather, as is often the case, cost springs to mind instantly. How often have you heard the question \"How much is this going to cost?\" Wouldn't a better questionbe \"How will this investment help the organisation become better?\" It is the fear of investment that inour experience is usually the root cause of this lack of 'commitment.' The key here is to provide evidence of success through the deployment of quick wins asdescribed above. Consider this: A site general manager was very keen to introduce Lean Six Sigma into hissite to the extent that he funded his traininghimself - all as a means of 'proof of concept.'Armed with his newly acquired 'Belt' he setabout a project with his team and achieved (as he put it himself) \"Results beyond hiswildest dreams!\" Result: A saving of almost\u00a3500k, with an investment of just under \u00a310kAND an increase in yield of almost 17%. 5. Our people don't like change! Not many people do like change. There is always resistance to change due to many reasons (far toomany to mention here!). One of the most commonreasons is that the change is imposed on them - they are/were not part of the solution (they don't see the problem or they see the problem but they don't see the solution). But we all know that change is inevitable, because if organisations don't change they fall behind, play catch up and continue to reght. However, there is one overriding factor asto why people don't like change - because they are not involved in the change process. Consider this: A head of department made a decision to change the way invoice processing was undertaken. She communicated the changes that were to take place through an e-mail. Resistance was so rife that the unions demanded the proposed changes be withdrawn. As a consequence, the head met with the union leader and outlined the reason for the changes. The union representative accepted the reason for the changes after considerable probing and the $million question \"Why?\" After detailed explanations on the value to the people as well as the organisation, arrangements were made for the head of department to communicate the benets to the people as the prime motivation for the change. The fear factor that instigated the resistance had now been virtually eradicated. Result: engagement of the people and their inclusion in the change process (the Voice of the People) resulted in improved working conditions and the achievement of the project objective: reduce invoice errors by 25% within the next quarter (in fact this target was exceed to a 34% reduction). So, whichever way you look at it, it is fair to say that the trepidation that commonly exists when considering deployment of continuous improvement can - and indeed will - be overcome. It just needs the right approach! www.dembridge.co.uk www.dembridge.co.ukHigh Performance Team' is a concept that refers to groups that are highly focused on their goals and that achieve superior business results. The High Performance Team outperforms all other similar teams and they outperform expecta- tions given their composition. Which all sounds very good! With increasing pressure on budgets, efficiency and performance, the term 'High Performance Team' is often used in the context of increased output: i.e. High Performance Teams deliver more, faster - so let's crank the wheel and get things moving! But there's more to it than that. A High Performance Team can be defined as a group of people with spe- cific roles and complementary talentsand skills, aligned with and committed to a common purpose, who consistently show high levels of collaboration and innovation that produce superior results.Team members are so devoted to their purpose that they will surmount any barrier to achieve the team's goals. And I'm sure each and every one of us can think of teams in our own organisations who would count these qualities as their own. But what fosters the dedication, the desire to meet the goal? What sepa-rates the High Performance Team from any other team? The single most critical factor is the Leadership Skills of the manager. BENEFITS OF BEING IN A HIGH PERFORMANCE TEAM Those times you were at your best, performing with ease and feeling part of a motivated team are examples of when you were in the high perform- ance zone - in what we would term Flow - and it's most probable thatyour manager was a key part of that experience. Leadership skills for a high performance team 258During that time, several things were going on: Your productivity was much greater You had higher levels of accuracy People really trusted you to get on with the tasks you had It was a pleasure to come to work You were so absorbed in your role that you sometimes didn't even notice the time You felt both valued and valuable to the organisation Stress [the opposite of Flow] was all but non-existent You had an overwhelming sense of Wellbeing Not only did it not feel like hard work,PROFILE 'but it all came so naturally. By being focused on a task or role that played to your natural strengths, doing the things that you loved to do, in a team of like-minded individuals you found yourself on the path of least resist- ance. You were highly motivated and engaged. People trusted you to get on with your job and do it really well - and this you did. By contrast, if a team is out of sync - or out of Flow - things happen slowlyor at worst not at all. Accuracy levels decrease, absence increases, motivation is lacking and an unhealthy degree of competitiveness can enter the work- place. If Trust levels are low, the team fails to work effectively and perform- ance suffers. But everyone has the ability to be in a High Performance Team, especially when their manager puts in place the environment that will make Flow most likely. THE HIGH PERFORMANCE LEADER Leadership of a High Performance Team starts with four key characteristics:TEAM IN FLOW: staff confidence in a leader who understands their qual- ities and has the abilities to get each individual into Flow. CLEAR DIRECTION: staff knowing what is expected from them - unam- biguous goals and quick feedback on performance. LOCUS OF ATTENTION: staff per- ceiving that their leader/manager is interested in them, in what they are doing in the present, in their feelingsand experiences now. UPWARD MOMENTUM: staff expe- riencing that their leader/manager is dedicated to providing adequate oppor- tunitiesfor team members to grow. THE DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE A High Performance Team needs a very talented leader and as a starting point it is absolutely crucial they understand their team and how to draw the very best from each individual member.

It is fair to say that change for change sake is unlikely to achieve anything. But bearing in mind how averse most organisations are to change, even when the many reasons are staring them plainly in the face, it is also fairly unlikely to take place. Much more likely, when an organisation can indeed muster the desire and courage, is change aligned to strategy, driven by an understanding of business needs with at least some idea of the benets being targeted.And this will carry a change initiative some distance, but in terms of having a signicant and sustainable impact on an organisation's overall eciency and eectiveness, this business centred approach will always fall short. Unfortunately, the problem is that just as common-place as strategy alignment and the like, is for changeto be designed by a small team of senior managers and delivered in a boom and bust cycle. For change to have the greatest impact however, and this is often left unconsidered, it has to empower the organisation, or to put it another way, be people centred. From the boardroom to the frontline, no brain should be left unturned. When the structures are in place for change to be initiated and led at all levels, for the aect implemented ideas have on performance to be understood in real time, and for all sta to receive recognition for their part, signicant impact will be witnessed. When it becomes part of what all sta do every day, embedded within a culture of innovation and creativity, change can start to transform. 260Human Resources Lean Lean, done properly, can benet all sectors in exactly this way, by providing both the philosophy and methodology to enable sta to more fully engage with improvement. By focusing on the encouragement and release of individual creativity, enabling people to realise theirfull potential as part of a team that works together for mutual benet, the Lean approach can revolutionise. People make organisations. To leave their problem solving abilities untapped is to rob the business of huge amounts of value and the sta who work there, of a happier, more fullling work life. It is quite simply the choice between embedding a negative cycle or a positive one. One lesson we can learn from organisations whohave seen transformation through the application of Lean thinking is that when the ideas for change and improvement are born by all sta, iteratively, without fear of error, mountains can be moved. Fundamentally, it's about changing how people feel and think about their work and then giving them the means to do something about it, and indeed vice versa. Lean helps organisations focus on the customer andwhat adds value from their perspective, it centers in on the removal of activities that don't contribute to this and as a result optimises flow, whether it be onthe production line or the delivery of service. Yet despite how obvious these principles are, they are too easily forgotten or assumed. Another lesson we can learn from organisations that have implemented Lean, therefore, is that common sense is not so common and in fact in some cases is a radical shift. Lean success But of course doing Lean 'properly', as mentioned so nonchalantly above, is not easy. So what must organisations do to ensure success?Well rst o, they must support the endeavor from the very top - publicly, and this endorsement must be constant because culture change is not achieved overnight. Organisations must trust and support their sta and commit to a culture of taking risk and time in the pursuit of improvement - using data to measure success. It is important also to ensure participation is broad based, internally across all levels of an organisation including supporters and doubters but also beyond the enterprise boundary with suppliers and customers. Lean gives the chance to move away from the creativity of the few to the agreed cohesive creativity of themany and from a management model of control, to one of facilitation. Lean is about creating capacity for growth, not for reduction and so it is vital organisations never lay people o as a result of Lean. Instead they must usetheir sta to improve what they do. What follows from this then is promotion based on interpersonal skills and commitment to improve the work area. Finally, organisations must strive to decompartmentalise Lean. Even to the point where they stop 'doing Lean' or 'being Lean' and start seeing observers coining St Andrews Tel: +44 (0) 1334 462784fgm@st-andrews.ac.ukwww.st-andrews.ac.uk/lean/ 261 Recently, Jeremy Hunt claimed that \"basic mistakes in hospitals in England cost the NHS up to \u00a32.5bn a year\" and \"the NHS could afford to hire more nurses if the errors were cut out\"1. He's right of course. However, he went on to say that \"more resources should be invested in improving patient care rather than wasted on picking up the pieces when things go wrong\"1. Which is not right. You need to pick up the pieces when things go wrong. And when things are going wrong a lot, you have many pieces to pick up. You can't stop wasting money on picking up the pieces until you spend some money figuring out why the pieces needed picking up in the first place. And has the Government done this? Have they figured out the root causes of poor patient care through a dedicated Lean improvement programme? Have they designed and implemented improvements to eliminate the root causes of poor patient care that is costing loads of money? No. What they are doing though, is spending money on a poster campaign warning staff about the financial problems basic errors cause1.Let's think about that for a moment. Are we suggesting that nurses are making mistakes because they fail to realise that this costs the taxpayers money? That by somehow letting them know it costs money (with shiny posters!) that will make them less likely to make a mistake? So the next time a nurse decides to fit a catheter incorrectly, they'll think twice. All because of our shiny new posters advising them that mistakes cost money. It's this kind of management thinking that does precisely nothing. The reason this does nothing, is that you haven't correctly identified the root cause ofthe issue and therefore you haven't fixed the problem. The root cause of poor patient safety is most definitelynot 'because nurses are unaware this costs us money'. The counter-point to this line of thought was offered by Dr Peter Carter from the Royal College of Nursing who said \"the government needed to invest in more staff before patient care can be improved\". They argue that \"mistakes were the result of understaffed wards\"1. This is also not right. Dr Peter Carter makes the assumption here that we don't have enough staff and that this is the cause of the prob- lem. But this line of thinking assumes that the staff we do have are working efficiently and effectively. NHS - both sides keep getting it wrong 262In the business world, high performing operational environments will measure something called 'shrinkage'. This is broadly defined as the percentage of time colleagues spend NOT doing the productive work they are there to complete. In a call centre, this would be all the time spent not taking calls. In a retail shop, this might be all the time spent not serving customers. Every organisation has shrinkage. In the case of nurses, this would be any and all activity not spent directly on patient care. It includes discharges, admissions, report writing, one-off projects, chasing authorisations, fetching supplies, chasing doctors and super- visors, care plans, incident logging, appointment making, checking others work, rostering, timesheets... I could keep going. How much time is lost to these activi- ties? How much more time could beinvested in direct patient care if less time was spent on the above? Then there are all the policies that create waste. For example, when my wife and I were expecting our first child we called up the hospital to book in our 12 week appointment. We were speaking directly to the nurse respon- sible for booking these appointments. But could we make an appointment? No. We had to wait until a referral had been received (via the post!) from our GP. The very same GP who we toldPROFILEwe were pregnant. The GP who didn't perform any tests or check to see if we were actually pregnant. They simply accepted our word for it. But the hospital wouldn't accept our word for it - the policy was to wait until theyheard it from the doctor (who heard it from us). This is waste. In the time the nurse was speaking to us to tell us they couldn't make an appointment, theycould have just made the appoint-ment. Instead, we needed to waste the doctors time writing a referral. The GP surgery staff wasted time sending the letter to the hospital. The hospital wasted time receiving that letter and delivering it to the correct person. The person wasting time processing the letter and making abooking. The hospital then wasting time contacting us to advise the time of the appointment.Cameron Turner Director Lean Consulting Tel: +44 (0)208 660 5964 info@leanconsulting.com www.leanconsulting.com 263There are literally thousands of poor policies like this that drive waste into our hospitals. Waste that is more often than not, absorbed by our wonderful nurses who could better spend the time doing what they do best - caring for all of us. I love the NHS. I'm proud that we have a service like this available to all of us here in the UK. It frustrates me that despite the huge amount of money we spend on it, it's not as good as it could be. Silly hospital policies waste time which means we don't have enough time to look after patients properly. Maybe THAT should go on a shiny new poster, Mr Hunt. 1Source - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29639383 PROFILE Rebekah Haymes, Senior Consultant at Towers Watson outlines the importance of wellbeing programmes in organisations to ensure employees remain productive and engaged... More employers are turning their focus to the preventative measures oered by health and wellness benets rather than their traditional reactionary provisions. For many employers, taking steps to help employees develop a healthierlifestyle in order to reduce the risk of illness has now taken on greater importance. It is widely consideredthat employers should share the responsibility withemployees for their health and well-being. However, many employers are unclear how to plan and deliver programmes that will engage employees and demonstrate value to the business. Employers have many reasons for introducing well-being programmes, the advantages ranging from: increased engagement and productivity; lowered health and disability insurance claims; reduced absence rates and promotion of corporate social responsibility.But, how can employers ensure these programmes are eective and are aligned with employees' wantsand needs?The Towers Watson 2014 Global Benets Attitudes Research explored employee opinion towards wellness and suggested that they are unclear about the role oftheir employer in encouraging a healthier workplace.A third of employees, who do not take part in a health and wellness activity, report that they manage their health on their own. This reinforces the point that employees are unclear about what employers can do to help them lead a healthier lifestyle. This clearly suggests that some work needs to be done by employers to consider their position as a supporter of well-being in the workplace and the message they want to give out to employees on this subject. Employees certainly believe that a good health status equals greater eciency, with 63% stating that people who are in good health are more productive at work than those in poor health. However, a lower 43% say that employees who live a healthy lifestyle (for example, those who exercise regularly and maintain target body weight etc) are more productive at work than those 264 Building a culture of health in the workplaceHuman ResourcesHuman Resources who don't. Clearly there is a lack of understanding among employees about their current health status and the additional personal and professional benets of adopting a healthy lifestyle. These results suggest that there is a need for greater employee education in this regard to enhance awareness. The research also highlights a clear association between unhealthy workers and employee engagement. When looking at the correlation between work-related stress and engagement, 57% of employees with highstress are also disengaged. Furthermore, 49% of employees with low stress are highly engaged versus only 8% of those with high stress. When work-related stress is low, absence levels nearly halve. High stress also results in increased levels of presenteeism (where employees are deemed ill and should not be present in the workplace but are, leading to decreasing productivity) - our report showed 15.9 days for employees with high stress, versus 10.6 days foremployees with low stress. And all of this is of course likely to impact upon employee performance. So how do companies develop a culture of health? Despite many employers identifying the need todevelop and communicate a clearly dened wellness strategy, our research tells us that half have no such plan in place. Often initiatives have been implemented to be seen to oer some wellness support, although in the absence of a considered and comprehensive strategy, the eectiveness of this approach will certainly be limited. It is important that employers establish what they aretrying to achieve through a well-being programmeupfront - both to help build the business case and identify appropriate measurement mechanics. Having a well-dened strategy with leadership buy-in goes a long way to increasing engagement in the programme. To ensure money is well-spent, employers should build a clear understanding of the most signicant actual and potential health risks to their business and then implement targeted initiatives. Communication and even branding is key to the success of any well-being programme; not just to promote the initiatives available but to ensure the business objectives are understood and that behav ioural change is encouraged. Finally, although lack of evidence of the nancial return on investment has not proved to be the primary barrier to developing wellness programmes, in order for any budget allocation to be sustainable, employers need to be mindful that at some point they need to demonstrate in a tangible way that wellness positively impacts on absenteeism, engagement and 227 2290 Rebekah.haymes@towerswatson.comwww.towerswatson.com 265 Rebekah Haymes, Senior Consultant Pension reforms for everyone Steve Webb, Minister for Pensions at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) details how the government's pension reforms will oer new opportunities... This government has overseen major pension reforms that will leave this country's retirement prospects in a much stronger position. The demographic changes and challenges we face arestark; 1 in 3 people born in 2016 are expected to liveto 100 and the average time spent in retirement for a man is now 22 years and for women is 26 years. Improvements in life expectancy oer new opportunities, but they also present new challenges. Across our reforms we are working to make pensions - both the state pension and private saving - simpler for people to understand so they can build up their own savings with condence with the future. I am proud to say that our work means that people will know far more clearly what they are going to get from their State Pension and they will know that when they save extra for retirement to build on their State Pension, their hard-earned cash is safe andworking for them. The long-standing trend of falling pension saving is now turning. But there is much hard work still to do. Millions are not saving enough for a comfortable retirement - but we are working to close the gap. The starting point is the new State Pension.The new State Pension - to start in April 2016 - will provide clarity about what individuals can expect from the state as well as beneting many women, self-employed people and the low-paid. We are setting the full level of the state pension abovebasic means-tested support. This should give people greater condence in the value of saving into a private pension. Just like today, the amount received will depend on how much National Insurance is paid. Many public sector workers will have paid lower levels of NI - something known as contracting out. This is something that few people have heard of, but it will actually aect many. Three-quarters of those reaching State Pension age in the rst 2 decades ofthe new State Pension will have been contracted-out at some point in their working lives and around 6 mil lion people are still contracted out today. Generally, this means that employees have paid lower National Insurance contributions and paid that money saved into a workplace or personal pension instead. During the time they were paying those lower National Insurance contributions, they weren't paying in tothe government additional State Pension, also known as SERPS or State Second Pension. So their new StatePension may reflect this. That's why we're encouraging everybody who is approaching retirement in the next few years to check out what they'll be entitled to under the new system, and are in the process of rolling out a service throughwhich people can ask for a personalised statement. Anyone who has been contracted out should be reas sured that, generally, they will have additional income from a workplace or personal pension. Andmost people will be able to boost their State PensionFinance and Growth 266Finance and Growth income, beyond the level they could have expected in the current pension system, by continuing to work, or claiming National Insurance credits. \"The new State Pension - to start in April 2016 - will provide clarity about what individuals can expect from the state as well as benefiting many women, self-employed people and the low-paid. \" The concept of contracting out is a complexity which we're abolishing under the new system, but in the transitional period. It's essential that we ensure fairness across the board, and that everyone gets what they have paid towards in National Insurance contributions. Alongside the new State Pension, we are helping millions to save more - and get the benet of an employer and government tax relief contribution - through their own workplace pension. The roll-out of automatic enrolment continues at pace - 4.7 million people are now in, with all of Britain's large employers on board. We are expecting to enrol around 6 million more people in the coming years. Of course, these new savers need to be able to save with condence, and that is why we will bring in a cap on charges on default funds in dened contribution pension schemes. This will do even more to ensurefairness and good value. The nal piece of the puzzle is the ground-breaking pension freedoms we introduced in the last Budget. I believe people should have the power to maketheir own decisions about how they spend their money - money that they have earned and saved over their working lives. Ending the eective requirement to purchase an annuity is a massive game changer and there are already signs that people are now more willing to save more for a pension as a result. We need to ensure these big decisions for peopleabout how best to use their savings are supported with clear impartial guidance, and we will with ourfree 'guidance guarantee' which will be available fromApril 2015, giving people the help and support they need to take advantage of these new freedoms. Our reforms represent some of the biggest changesin the world of pensions in over half a century. Over time, they will create a fairer society so that people in Britain can look forward to a better Pensions Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) www.gov.uk/dwpwww.twitter.com/dwpgovuk 267 Steve Webb, Minister for Pensions Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)Research shows that Buckinghamshire's local government system would see savings of \u00a320m a year by restructuring to one council, if politicians are brave enough - something the local business community crowd-funded \u00a325,000 to discover. Guy Lachlan, Spokesman for Buckinghamshire Business Group, explains... Devolution has never been as prominent in the national psyche as it is now that the Scot tish government is gaining more control of its aairs. For years, counties, districts, towns and parishes across England have wanted their own version of'Devo max'; to benet from decentralised anddevolved powers and budgets so that they control more of their own aairs - this no longer seems a pipe dream. Devolution with condence will require the streamlining of local government to make sure it is t and able to take on a wider role. To put it another way: does it make sense in a place like Buckinghamshire to run 5 local authorities when you can do the job with 1 and have a singular strategic vision? This is a question now being asked by business leaders and councillors across the country. In Buckinghamshire, a county of 500,000 residents, the unnecessary costsof local government have now been independentlyestimated at \u00a320m per year. The business community in Buckinghamshire desperately wants a more eective and ecient government system to reduce costs and increase outcomes. So much so that they stumped up \u00a325,000 in addition to their taxes to crowd-fund research into dierent local authority models for the county. The conclusion of the report? Buckinghamshire would save over \u00a320m a year by streamlining 5 local authorities - down to 1 or 2, with all up-front costs of implementation being repaid after one and half years or earlier. The report concludes that no change is not an option. The district councils' response to this report has been predictably cautious. They recognise that something can be done - but not on their watch. Councils' budgets are diminishing nationwide but they cannot cut back 268 Stre amlining local gove rnmentFinance and GrowthFinance and Growth services and then ignore \u00a320m of yearly savings staring them in the face. Were we living in times of unbridled prosperity we would still be looking for ways to make our local authorities more streamlined and ecient, but with austerity still the name of the game for the foreseeable future shouldn't a ticket that oers \u00a320m savings a year be a winning ticket? Businesses were forced into action to fund this research as they were concerned by further fundingcuts on the horizon and the knowledge that if it were their business facing changing nancial pressures, they would at least have a look at their business model to see if they could be more ecient. They would also do this while getting on with business as usual and not use the work they need to do as an excuse for inaction. We now need an independent commission to lookinto the best option. The money that taxpayers have stumped up to fund the research should neither be wasted nor ignored by councils. Buckinghamshire is not alone in its thinking. Cheshire's East and West have floated combining into a unitary authority; local authorities in Cumbria, Leicestershire and Oxfordshire are discussing similar proposals;Chorley Borough Council has recently suggested a local referendum on the issue; and an MP in Lancashirehas called for an East Lancashire unitary. Ask around, this is a popular idea for good reason, with few seem ing to believe that a two-tier system is aordable or sensible, doubtless because it will create the potential for stronger local economic and social leadership. We are just months away from a general election, enough surely to focus the minds of sitting represen- tatives and potential candidates on where they stand on this issue. Should local candidates running for election not be asked to make clear to their constituents where they stand on this issue in time for the ballot boxes to be ticked? It would surely be anti-democratic to plan to reconsider the constitution in which they would be personally conflicted at a later date and behind closed doors. In an age of transparency, we need a system of local government that is focussed on the most eective impact possible on local economic and social realities and priorities. We need action as soon as possible, not when it's too late. We need reformers and visionaries, not a passing of the buck to the next in line. Those in power should not be able to dictate the terms of that power, that right surely belongs to the residents and businesses they serve. I've yet to see a majority vote in the hen-house for Christmas and I don't expect one to come without a lot of clucking, but let's at least ensure the power stays where it should - with local people and businesses who pay for our government.

Those investments are often linked in interesting ways and will need to be funded from a wide range of private and public sources. Two of the core areas of investment will be smart cities and connecting rural and regional areas to fast broadband networks. The Commission is therefore using its convening power to attract nance and interest to these topics, and today's 2 examples are the seminar \"Aligning regional investment to digital enablers for future growth\" 1 organised in co-operation with the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Com mittee which examined the economic and societal potential of ICT infrastructure investment. The other meeting was of the High Level Group of the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities 2. The partnership brings together cities and businesses which now includes 360 innova tive plans for smart city work and some 3,000 organisations who will work together on commonchallenges including standards and interoperability of systems with a view to reduce costs and raise funding more easily. Special guest, architect and urbanist Rem Koolhaas underlined the great potential of Smart Cities for innovation, economic growth and reallytackling societal issues. 270 Neelie Kroes, Former Vice President responsible for the Digital Agenda for Europe The Future for a digita l EU In order to secure a digital future for Europe, investments in this area are crucial.

As the current Commission hands over to PresidentJuncker's new team, we also know that the European Structural Funding Programme for 2014-2020 is just beginning with some 800 billion of investments to increase Europe's competitiveness and quality of life, reduce inequalities between regions and improveand develop our infrastructure. Digital investment must be at the core of that spending. Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission have already agreed that the priorities for this programme include ICT as a growth enablerand the reduction of energy use and of CO 2emissions (where ICT plays a signicant and growing role especially in a Smart City context.) President-designate Juncker has outlined his ambitions for a further 300 billion of public and private investment with his proposed Jobs, Growth and Investment Pack age focusing on investment priorities in ICT, energy and transport infrastructure. I welcome these approaches, and encourage the marriage of these perspectives with the digital ICTDigital technology, data and future cities Tom Saunders, Senior Researcher at Nesta details the impact digital technologies can have on the way our cities are governed... Rio de Janeiro oers one vision of how digital technologies might be used to create cities ofthe future. Hundreds of cameras spread throughout the city transmit live feeds to a command and control centre with a giant video screen where sta in white lab coats monitor and rapidly respond to events as they happen across the city. In the future, these city managers even plan to use the data they gather to spot trends and predict problems before they happen. Sensing, (big) data, modelling and visualisation are all part of a vision of what cities might look like in the future known as the smart city. It is a vision driven by large IT corporations and its main goals are eciency and more eective decision making. While it is dicult to argue with a vision which sees cities wasting less of their resources, there is littleevi dence so far beyond the anecdotal that sensing, modelling and visualisation can be used to achieve this. Computer aided decision making is also prob- lematic. Data dashboards can oversimplify the vastlycomplex nature of life in cities and there is a real danger that users of these digital tools will be unaware of the subjective decisions that have gone into selecting and processing the data. Top down visions of smart cities often view citizens as passive data points to be aggregated and crunched in large urban models. While they are the implicit beneciaries of local government eciency drives, they are given no active role in the life of their smart city. ICT 272ICT But as the great urbanist Jane Jacobs famously said \"cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.\" Thankfully, mirroring this drive to create smart cities by diktat is a grassroots movement which seeks to use similar technologies to createthem from the bottom up. This movement is characterised by citizens, entrepre- neurs and activists using digital technologies to gener ate and share data, advocate for change and share and reuse resources. Examples include the Smart Citizens Kit, an Arduino based sensor that provides citizens with sophisticated but low cost tools to measure pollution and share the data online and Peerby, a collaborative consumption platform which connects people who want to lend and borrow itemsfrom their neighbours. \"Data dashboards can oversimplify the vastly complex nature of life in cities and there is a real danger that users of these digital tools will be unaware of the subjective decisions that have gone into selecting and processing the data.\" At the moment, most of these bottom up approaches are small scale and their eects on the way citieswork could be said to be fairly negligible. They may become more eective in the future, but in themean time another approach seems to have more promise of achieving real world impact. This involves citizens and governments working together: govern- ments collect data from citizens through apps and online platforms and citizens participate in order to improve their communities. One of the oldest exam- ples of this type of cooperation is FixMyStreet, a plat-form which allows citizens to bring local issues such as potholes and abandoned cars to the attention of local councils. Another example is Boston StreetBump, an app which sends data to the city government when a driver hits a pothole. This approach has many benets, from savings that could result from workingwith citizens and existing technologies to gather data (rather than embedding new sensors, at a hugecost, in every inch of the urban fabric) to giving city managers a more granular, qualitative picture of their city and its problems. When talking about how governments and citizenscan use digital technologies to improve the way theircities function we often have to rely on a handful of examples, with FixMyStreet being one of the mostcited. But beyond Western Europe and America manycountries are experimenting with new approaches. One example is China, where local governments across the country use Wechat (a cross between WhatsApp and Facebook) to gather opinions from citizens on urban planning issues. Looking beyond the familiar can provide a wealth of inspiration when thinking about how digital technologies might impact our cities in the future. Digital technologies and new ways of gathering and processing data have the potential to aect almost everything that happens, from transport and planning to waste management and governance. But the starting point always has to be the needs of citizens. Top down attempts to track, measure and predict the behaviour of citizens may yield some useful insights, but a much richer understanding of the complex lifeof a city can be gained by using new digital tools to engage directly with the people that live, work and play 7438 2500 information@nesta.org.ukwww.nesta.org.ukwww.twitter.com/nesta_uk 273 Realising the benefits of a digital criminal justice system Nigel Rees, Director at Airwave details how police forces across the UK are embracing technology ... Police forces are embracing mobile data technology in the move to a fully-digitised end-to-end Criminal Justice System (CJS). Moving from a world of carrying around pocket note books and a myriad of forms, to adopting electronic notebooks and truly embracing paperless policing. The results have shown a dramatic reduction in time spent on processes, the removal of mistakes and duplication of information, leading to more time onthe frontline. Freeing up police time Providing ocers with electronic notebooks ensures that the process of digitising the CJS begins on the frontline. Ocers can gather and check information, issue tickets, take notes and ll in pre-congured forms that support their daily operations. By completing these activities whilst out in the community, police ocers can signicantly reduce their time in theback oce, enabling them to be more visible. While using the electronic notebook, forces have alsobeen able to transform a range of other activities by using features such as the camera and Bluetooth . The camera can capture and embed photos into busi ness processes. For example, embedding photos within a Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Harassment application is proven to deliver swifter justice and better outcomes for victims. An electronic notebookwith specialised policing applications and softwareallows ocers to record information, for example an on-the-spot ticket, and by using Bluetooth, the ticket can be printed and given to the recipient immediately. Compare this with the previous process of waitingup to 7 days to receive a ticket via the post and the benets are immediately visible.Accessing operational databases through the specialised police applications enables ocers to conduct on-the- spot checks in a matter of seconds rather than through a third party (such as via the control room) which could previously take up to 20 minutes. A CJS which is faster and right rst time The way in which the specialised applications have been designed means that they will not allow ano cer to miss mandatory elds nor enter incorrect information into elds, which ensures the establishment of a full and complete database of information andevidence. This meticulous attention to detail in the development of the software has already demonstrated its benets - prior to using this technology, there were mistakes on over 60% of tickets and form lling, now mistakes have been eradicated. Police Services continues to nd new uses for mobile technology to further improve the eciency of opera tions. Similarly, technology evolves rapidly, for example, video (body worn, xed and mobile) and geo-fencing mapping capabilities to enhance eective use of resources and proactively provide front line sta with the right information at the point of need. Forces should continue to explore further benets and ways to develop applications to enable a full 275A North East digital revolution Sunderland City Council outlines how it has embraced change to win a Digital City of the Year award... Sunderland in the North East of England has long been known for its manufacturing prowess, home to Nissan UK, the largest automobile plant in Europe. It's also been forging ahead as a basefor many other hi-tech, digital and IT-based ventures in the both the public and private sectors. So much has been happening digitally that Sunderland has now been crowned The Municipal Journal's UK Digital City 2014. Progress so far \"This is all about embracing change and challenges,\" explains Sunderland City Councillor Mel Speding. A councillor since 2000, Cllr Speding, who is also a Cabinet member, has seen many changes in local government including in Sunderland.\"As a city, we're very good at embracing change, being flexible, being innovative, and being resilient. Plus, in the current scal climate, I think we've all gotto be more and more flexible in local government to keep up with the pace, and the increasing pace of technological change. \"So, I think being recognised and awarded DigitalCity 2014 showcases how these areas were brought together - change, flexibility and technology.\" The roots of the award going to Sunderland can be traced to at least 2000 when the council realised the potential of creating the infrastructure needed for a digital city. It developed a core internal ICT hub and built a council data centre with the capacity to support commercial needs for the region and beyond.One of the key drivers of success in the digital and software sector in Sunderland has been Sunderland Software City (SSC), a support, training and advice service for digital and technology businesses. It has provided support to over 350 software businesses and 150 start-ups - helping them realise their potential and enter national and international markets. David Dunn, Chief Executive of Sunderland Software City attributes the organisation's success to the unique partnership that brings together the best of the public, private and education sector. David said: \"Sunderland Software City brings together Sunderland City Council, the University of Sunderland and the North East Business & Innovation Centre (BIC). \"This partnership allows the organisation to draw on the deep knowledge and understanding of business skills, market understanding, investment and innovation that exists within our partner organisations, and has helped create more than 310 new jobs and contribute an estimated net increase of \u00a314m in regional GVA in the last 5 years. \"As well as supporting businesses at a local level, Sunderland Software City are spearheading a number of national projects that are driving investment and strengthening the city's growing prominence in the global technology landscape.\" ICT 276ICT 277* In 1998, the annual communications market report from telecoms regulator Ofcom found that Sunderland had the highest percentage of homes connected to Broadband internet and multi-channel Digital television. And in 2010, survey work for BBC2 series The Virtual Revo- lution found more people in Sunderland were logging into Facebook than elsewhere in council, Sunderland then began introducing and putting more and more of its services online and embracing the digital age. The city boasts 95% plus hi-speed internet connections, as good as the best or the rest of the UK, and in 2011 started developingand rolling out its Cloud technology. Also, while the council was embracing the digital age, residents were blazing a trail with Sunderland becoming the Facebook 'capital' of the UK, and the best 'digitally connected' city, according to surveys. * This success hasn't just been in homes or withpublic services though because in 2010 the council's economic master plan recognised how Sunderlandcould broaden its commercial base. One way to put some more diversication into the local economy was with more hi-tech business start-ups, and more incubator units and space for companies such as at the centrally-based Sunderland Software Centre or the North East Business and Innovation Centre. There have been successes as through 2013/14 there were more than 400 jobs created in the city's softwareand IT sector leading to the perhaps inevitable' 'silicon' headlines as Sunderland companies won contracts with global brands such as Hertz and Sony, and found contract work in Dubai. Cllr Speding said: \"There's been a lot of supportacross the city and through the North East for the aims that we set down in our master plan. While we were driving forward with our automobile and manu facturing strengths, the council and its partners in the public and private sectors have also been nurturing and encouraging the growth of software and IT companies, and residents themselves have embraced new digital technology. \"Therefore, as a council, we've taken advantage of the growing digital market, and made that a staple part of the Sunderland economy. We've been using innovative digital technology to overcome the challenges of budget constraints, meet community needs, and help promote it as part of our economy. \"Now, all this work has been recognised by the UK Digital City Award. It's very much an award for every one in Sunderland.\" Key benets to date: Sunderland already boasts the highest number of tech start-ups outside -London; Sunderland was described as a \"world-class centre of excellence for digital technology\" in a national report by UK Trade & Investment (UKTI) focussed on attracting foreign investment; The 100+ software companies based in Sunderland are responsible for an annual turnover of \u00a365m and the creation of over 1000 jobs; The city has more than 95% coverage of superfast broadband connectivity making it one of the most connected cities in the UK. Digital City Council services include: Bereavement services - a bespoke web service used by all Funeral Directors in the city for booking the cemetery and crematorium; School admissions - a bespoke web service to apply for school places; Library services, children's centres and waste permits also benet from their own bespoke digital services. In 2010, a proposal was put to UK Government to transform the delivery of its public services. The proposed recommendations were for a 'revolution' in the public sector, todeliver services as 'digital by default'. The change started within government websites, streamlining systems and shifting departmental web information into one place - gov.co.uk - making services easier to find for citizens, and saving an anticipated 50% of publish- ing costs1. Achieving a paperless public sector takes real organisational change. It has to start from the top: senior-levelinternal processes and business struc- tures can be enhanced and improved by a digital approach, moving away from long-held paper-based systems. It just isn't feasible to deliver public- facing services digitally, and still retain old systems internally. Every board or trustee meeting in the public sector requires packs of information to be prepared, distributed and reviewed in advance. Traditionally, this has been a paper-heavy process, both time-consuming and costly, when organisations are trying to reduce both budget and carbon foot- print. It also has privacy and security implications: carrying confidential papers from place to place poses anobvious risk. Innovation has come in the form of board portals: secure technology that enables the compilation and distribution of board-level information to public-sector trustees, directors and senior management teams. A board portal can help improve governance and all senior-level communications across the organisation, reduces staff and IT resources needed to prepare previously paper-based board documentation, and delivers significant savings in terms of paper, couriers and postage. Diligent Boardbooks is the most widely used of these portals, working with over 87,000 directors, leaders and administrators worldwide, including 37 of the FTSE 100 and almost one- third of the Fortune 1000. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, a Diligent customer, said: \"The main driver for going digital was cost and efficiency. Before using Diligent Boardbooks, we used paper copies for our board packs but this involved a considerable amount of administration. We want to be seen as an organisation that embraces new technology todeliver an efficient service.\" Achieving Digital by Default: Creating Digital Boardroom Processes in the Public Sector 278Seven Best Practices in Transitioning to the Paperless Boardroom Attaining a paperless boardroom requires planning. If you don't take into account how your board members and trustees use information and interact with technology, half-hearted attempts to get rid of paper can backfire. Information that is emailed or stored in a shared file will inevitably be printed out, PDFs or document readers aren't very user-friendly, and with all of these factors, version control is a real headache. The solution is to use a board portal - a secure way to access, review, annotate and vote on board information. Once you've made the decision to go digital, how do you shift thinking away from paper and towards an alternative? The idea of 'doing things on paper' can be deeply embedded within an organisation and its mem- bers. They'll need help, support andPROFILE coaching, and to take small steps at a time. Diligent has identified a number of best practices to help ensure that the transition to a paperless board- room is successful. Be committed. If you're going to go paperless, you need commitment from your fellow directors. Changing habits can be hard without it. Map your information flow. If you understand how your board packs arecompiled, distributed and updated, the new paperless platform can be designed to replicate the current process as closely as possible. It is the paper you're changing, not the entire board process. Don't skimp on training. Proper training on the new system should be straight-forward (and can be done online or over the phone). Although digital skills of directors will vary, most carry an iPad or other tablet device and embrace technology that makes their lives easier. Training, and the ability to test the new system in private, will help adoption. Insist on 24/7 support. If you're about to go into a board meeting, and you have a question on the technology, you need to speak to someone imme- diately who can help you there and then, not call you back within four oreven 24 hours. Don't treat all information the same. If you're viewing detailed architectural drawings, for example, you may need them to be displayed on a bigger screen than is possible on a tablet or laptop. Be flexible in the format you use. Take your time. Give yourself and your fellow directors time to adapt to the new system. For the first meeting, you might choose to distribute paper packs as well as using the portal, and then poll the board about which system they prefer. If training has gone well, most directors we work with prefer the digital system within a couple of meetings. Peer pressure is stronger than decree. Even if you do have one or two colleagues who want to continue toreceive paper packs, it probably won't be for long. Once they see how easily their peers are navigating information, for example, they won't want to be responsible for slowing down themeeting. Ultimately, switching to digital must improve processes and efficiency for the organisation, and provide a betterexperience for individual users. For committee members, trustees, boarddirectors and the administrative staff supporting them, replacing paper- based meetings with those enabled by digital technology makes it quicker to prepare for and manage meetings. ExtraCare Charitable Trust, a charity that supports older people in homes and communities in the UK, found that it reduced the time it took to prepare board materials for meetings from 1.5 days per meeting to just half an hour, an annual saving of up tothree weeks. The Digital by Default initiative set out to achieve savings in the billions of pounds from the move to digital services. But it's not just public services that could save money by switching.For more information or to request a demo, contact us today: Diligent Housing Case Study See Diligent's iPad App in Action PROFILE By switching internal boardroom processes to digital, the cost savings - both financial and environmental - can be significant, meeting key require- ments of public-sector organisations.

V Vernon G James Research and Extension Center, North Carolina State Extreme weather events may cause severe damage to our society. Examples are hurricane Sandy in 2012 (the second-costliest hurricane in United States history), European windstorms Lothar and Martin in 1999, and, more recently, the exceptional sequence of floods in southern England in the winter of 2014. Insurance companies need to reserve sucient capital to cover claims following an extreme weather event. Estimates of expected losses due to catastrophic events crucially depend on the tail width of the probability distribution describing the likelihood of extremes. Hence, understanding the typical tail behaviour of time series generated by climate models is a pressing challenge for the insurance industry and forecasting agencies. Our research The Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (JBI), based at the University of Groningen, actively participates in current mathematical research on extreme events. The mission of the JBI is the cross-fertilization by modelling of the disciplines mathematics and computer science both with other sciences and with the outside world. www.math.rug.nl/broer/Mathematical climate modelling Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics h.w.broer@rug.nl http://www.math.rug.nl/broer/ Telephone: +31 50 363 3959EUROACADEMY invites you to implement your abilities by affording professional higher education and Master's level within the curricula conforming to the 3 + 2 system of studies accepted in Europe.
