Anytime you're feeling a little run down or headed in that direction \u2014 whether it's from stress, traveling, eating on the go, lack of sleep, who knows what \u2014 that means you're more vulnerable than usual. The question then becomes, what can you do to right now to provide added support for a healthy immune system? This is one of the most common questions Dr. Bill Rawls receives. His answer, based on a dozen years of researching what it takes to maintain strong immuno-resilience, is twofold. The first is mostly common sense: You have to minimize the lifestyle factors that wear down your immune defenses, to include lowering your stress levels, avoiding processed foods, and reducing your exposure to environmental toxins. The second is to load up right away on the right immune-promoting herbs. While all herbs offer some level of immune support, certain ones are much more powerful. Those are the ones Dr. Rawls included in his two favorite immune-boosting formulas: Adaptogen Recovery and Advanced Biotic. Adaptogen Recovery is a blend of immune-modulating adaptogens, a category of herbs that are known for their ability to increase resilience to stress. Advanced Biotic contains a combination of herbs that help promote optimal immune function. That includes supporting the immune system's job of balancing the microbiome, the collection of microbes that we encounter every day and take up residence in the tissues throughout our body. While both formulations can be found in other, more broad-scope Vital Plan kits, they're the two Dr. Rawls reaches for personally when he knows he needs an extra immune boost. That's why he created the Immune Boost Bundle \u2014 so others could get just the targeted immune support they need, when they need it, with a simple one-two punch. The Keys to Boosting Immune Health - Take adaptogenic herbs to decrease impacts of stress on the immune system - Take immune-boosting herbs - Take microbiome-balancing herbs - Support a good immune foundation with adequate sleep, exercise, relaxation, healthy eating, and time outside in nature. \"When you take an herbal extract, in essence, you're providing support to your immune system by adopting the plant's immune system \u2014 all of the plant's natural defenses against a wide range of stress factors concentrated into a potent extract.\" DR. BILL RAWLS Suggested Use For ongoing immune support, take 3 capsules of each formulation once a day, ideally with food. For acute immune support when you feel like your immune system is under exceptional strain, increase servings to 3 capsules of each formulation twice daily, ideally with food, for as long as needed. Consult your healthcare provider before using these products if you have a medical condition, are pregnant or nursing, or are taking medications.

FOR BEST USE For ongoing immune support, take 3 capsules of each formulation once a day, ideally with food. For acute immune support when you feel like your immune system is under increased strain, increase servings to 3 capsules of each formulation twice daily, ideally with food, for as long as needed. Consult your healthcare provider before using these products if you have a medical condition, are pregnant or nursing, or are taking medications. For ongoing immune support, simply take 3 capsules of each formulation once a day. Ideally, take with food and a glass of water, in the morning. For acute immune support, increase the serving size to 6 capsules of each formulation per day. You can take 3 of each in the morning, and 3 of each with dinner. Or, take 2 of each formulation with breakfast, lunch, and dinner for more sustained immune support throughout the day. The herbs in the Immune Boost Bundle get to work immediately on the underlying factors that support immune health. To maximize cumulative benefits for ongoing support, we recommend taking this bundle for at least several weeks, however, it may be taken longer if needed. For acute immune support, take double the serving for 2-3 days, or longer as needed. The Immune Boost Bundle is intended for seasonal and periodic use, however all of the ingredients may be taken for long-term periods of 6 months to a year. Beyond this time frame, we generally recommend taking a break or rotating the herbs you are using, unless otherwise directed by your healthcare provider. The ingredients in this formula have been chosen for their good safety profile and long history of traditional use as daily adaptogenic, tonifying, and immune supporting herbs. Yes!

The serving sizes of each ingredient are based on the amounts shown to be effective in clinical use, research studies, and traditional use.
