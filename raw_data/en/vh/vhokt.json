Bear in mind that women who are breastfeeding do not need to consume special foods or excessive amounts of fluid to successfully lactate or to increase their milk production. One of the wonders of breast milk is that it can meet your baby's nutritional needs even when you are not eating perfectly. However, that does not mean that you will not suffer. When you do not get the nutrients you need from your diet, your body draws on its nutrient reserves, which can eventually become depleted. Also, you need energy and stamina to meet the physical demands of caring for a new baby. What Food To Eat While Breastfeeding ? If you are already eating well when you were pregnant, you probably do not need to make any major changes on what you eat or drink when you are breastfeeding, although there are a few important considerations to keep in mind. The amount you need to eat depends on your pre-pregnancy weight, and how much weight you gained during pregnancy, as well as how active you are. In general, most women who are breastfeeding need about 500 calories more than women who are not - that is a total of 2,500 kilocalories (kcal) per day. You do not need to eat any special or different foods. However, you should try to follow a healthy and balanced diet, which includes a variety of foods from the food groups in the Malaysian Food Pyramid. Include a variety of healthy foods Variety and balance are crucial to a healthy diet. Eating a mixture of food containing : - carbohydrates, - protein, and - fat.. ..at meal times keeps you feeling full longer and supplies the nutrients your body needs. Eating a variety of foods while breastfeeding will change the flavour of your breast milk. In fact, some experts believe that babies enjoy a variety of flavours in their breast milk, and this may help him accept different foods once he starts eating solids.

While breastfeeding, you can eat practically anything you like, in moderation. However, do remember that traces of food and drink can sometimes get into breast milk, and this may cause your baby to become irritable or have an allergic reaction. If your baby becomes ; - fussy, - develops a rash, - diarrhoea, or - experiences congestion.. ..soon after breastfeeding, consult your doctor. These signs could indicate a food allergy. If you suspect that something in your diet might be making your baby a little fussier than usual, avoid the food or drink for up to a week to see if it makes a difference in your baby's behaviour. If removing a certain food or drink from your diet has no impact on your baby's fussiness, add it back to your diet and consider other possible causes instead. If you are concerned about your baby's behaviour, consult your doctor. Drink Plenty of Water, Limit Caffeine and Alcohol You only need to drink enough to satisfy your thirst while breastfeeding. Drinking lots of water, or being thirsty, will not affect your milk supply. There is no need to keep a record of how much water you drink. A good guideline to follow is to drink to satisfy thirst - that is, drink whenever you feel the need. If your urine is clear or light yellow, it is a good sign that you are well-hydrated. Coffee and Caffeine Most experts recommend that breastfeeding mothers limit their consumption of caffeine to about 2 to 3 cups a day, this includes : - coffee - tea - soft drinks - chocolate - coffee-flavoured ice cream. A small amount of caffeine ends up in your breast milk, and it can accumulate in your baby's system because he cannot easily break it down and excrete it. This might agitate your baby or interfere with your baby's sleep. Alcohol Drinking alcoholic drinks occasionally is unlikely to harm you or your baby. Remember, alcohol passes through your breast milk to your baby. Drinking more than two units a day while you are breastfeeding may reduce your milk supply, and even affect your baby's development. Use of some alcohol in cooking is safe as the alcohol will evaporate during cooking. Vegetarian Diet and Breastfeeding If you are a vegetarian, most likely you already know the importance of choosing foods that will give you the nutrients you need. This is especially important during breastfeeding. Choose Foods Rich In IRON, PROTEIN and CALCIUM Good sources of IRON include : - dried beans and peas - lentils - enriched cereals - whole grain products - dark leafy green vegetables - dried fruits. To help your body absorb iron, eat iron-rich foods in combination with foods high in vitamin C, such as : - papayas, - oranges, - mangoes, or - tomatoes. For PROTEIN, consider ; - eggs and dairy products, or - plant sources, such as : - soy products and meat substitutes - legumes - lentils - nuts - seeds - whole grains. - Good sources of CALCIUM include : - dairy products - dark green vegetables. Other options include calcium-enriched and -fortified products, such as : - juices - cereals - soya milk - tofu. Consider Supplements Your doctor will likely recommend that you take a daily vitamin B-12 supplement and, in some cases, a vitamin D supplement. Vitamin B-12 is found almost exclusively in animal products, so it can be difficult to get enough in some vegetarian diets. Vitamin B-12 is essential for your baby's brain development. If you do not eat enough vitamin D-fortified foods \u2014 such as cow's milk and some cereals \u2014 and you have limited sun exposure, you might need vitamin D supplements. Weight Loss While Breastfeeding You may have put on weight while you were pregnant. Some new mothers find it easy to lose weight, while others do not lose much. It all depends on your ; - body - food choices - activity level - metabolism. Aim For Slow and Steady Weight Loss DO NOT try to lose weight by dieting until at least two months after your baby is born. A low-calorie diet in the first few months could ; - drain-off your energy - diminish your milk supply. Losing about \u00bd kg to 1kg a week should not affect the amount or the quality of milk you make. Eating healthily and doing some gentle exercise will help you get in shape. This is better than very strict low-calorie diets when you are breastfeeding. You can increase your exercise six to eight weeks after giving birth. Conclusion Remember, there is no need to go on a special diet while breastfeeding. Simply focus on making healthy choices ? you and your baby will be healthy.
