RESEARCH GRANT exacerbates AD-relevant phenotypes in a genetically susceptible rat model via neuroinflammatory mechanism(s) The main objective of the project is to test the hypothesis that TRAP decreases the time to onset and/or increases severity of AD-like phenotypes in genetically susceptible individuals via microglial cell activation secondary to lung inflammation. R01 ES014901 (Lein [Contact] and Lehmler, MPI) 12/01/08-10/31/25 NIH NIEHS Molecular and Cellular Basis of PCB Developmental Neurotoxicity The main objective of this grant is to test the hypothesis that cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism influences the neurotoxic effects of lower chlorinated PCBs on CREB-dependent neurodevelopmental effects.

Role: Leader, Career Development missing link in PCB-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders? The goal of this project is to test the central hypothesis that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome associated with developmental expo-sure to varying doses of PCBs contributes to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Lein, Pamela J. 28 R01 ES029213 (LaSalle [Contact]/Lein/Schmidt, MPI) 06/01/18-05/31/23 NIH/NIEHS PCB Epigenomic Brain & Behavior Lasting Effects Study (PEBBLES) This study will leverage existing samples and behavioral outcome data from mice exposed perinatally to a mix of PCBs simulating the congener profile found in the serum of mothers in the MARBLES cohort with a new goal of identifying epigenetic placental biomarkers of PCB exposures and NDD risk. The unifying hypothesis is that genetic and PCB interactions can be detected as DNA methylation signatures in placenta to Exosomes as Mediators in Aging and Dementia The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that senescent endothelial cells, which accumulate with aging, create a pro-inflammatory environment that adversely affects the blood brain barrier (BBB) and contribute to neuropathology implicated in age-associated Alzheimer's disease. (Taha) 02/01/19-12/31/22 NIH/NICHD Role of excess maternal linoleic acid intake on infant neurodevelopment The goal is to assess the impacts of dietary linoleic acid (LA) and its oxidized metabolites (OXLAMS) during pregnancy and lactation on child brain development and to identify specific metabolites responsible for possible adverse effects.

R01 NS097808 09/01/17-08/31/22 NIH/NINDS Phenotypic Characterization of Novel Models of Dup15q Syndrome The goal of this project is to identify behavioral, neuroanatomical and epigenetic mechanisms of isoform-specific Ube3a overexpression to address important questions regarding our main scientific premise that overexpression of UBE3A is the principal the propagation of inflammation in the central nervous system The goal of this project is to generate preliminary data to support our central hypothesis that intra-axonal (anterograde and retrograde) signaling and electrophysiological signals (e.g., excitotoxicity) contribute to the transmission of neuroinflammatory triggers from the site of insult to distal regions within the CNS. U54 neuroprotective therapies for TETS and OP intoxication The unifying goal of the UC Davis CounterACT Center of Excellence is to identify improved medical countermeasures for treating acute intoxication with seizure-inducing chemical threat agents.

R21 NS110647 (Lein [Contact]/Wulff, MPI) 07/01/19-06/30/22 molecular targets for the proconvulsant activity of TETS The goal of this project is to test the central hypothesis that 232 receptors, which are far more abundant in the mammalian CNS than 632 receptors, constitute the major molecular target of TETS and, based on the structural similarity between the two compounds, also of RDX. R21 AG064599 synaptic changes in a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that in vivo imaging of synapse density is a predictive biomarker of AD pathology that precedes detection of amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles by in in Micro-Channel Electrode Arrays The main hypothesis of this proposal is that the axons growing through micron scale channels can spontaneously form an electrical seal that isolates the axonal membrane patches to yield high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) recording and immunity to mechanical vibrations or gliotic encapsulation of the NIH/NIEHS Perinatal causes insulin resistance in mice through impaired thermogenesis The overall objective of this proposal is to identify mechanism(s) by which environmentally relevant exposure to DDT during development increases risk of T2D in of PCB Developmental Neurotoxicity: ViCTER Supplement This ViCTER project will investigate a PCB congener (PCB 11), route of exposure (inhalation) and target organ (developing lung) not addressed in the parent grant. Additionally, this ViCTER project will exploit state-of-the art optogenetic techniques to translate in vitro observations of PCB 11 effects on structural connectivity to in vivo changes in structural and functional connectivity. U54 HD079125 (Abbeduto) 09/01/13-08/31/19 NIH/NICHD Lein, Pamela J. 30 MIND Institute Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) The goal is to support a translational science agenda focused on intellectual and developmental delays (IDD). The IDDRC will integrate research from multiple disciplines and bridge basic and clinical science to arrive at treatments for IDD conditions. The range of IDD conditions include autism spectrum disorder, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, ADHD, chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and many others.

Altered patterns of connectivity are associated with neurological deficits; therefore, we are investigating how environmental contaminants, chemical convulsants and inflammatory mediators perturb neuronal connectivity as determined using biochemical, morphogenic, electrophysiological and behavioral endpoints. We are also developing biomarkers of OP neurotoxicity and testing novel therapeutic approaches for protecting against the neurodegenerative effects "}
