How Do Chiropractic Adjustments Work? If you've never been to a chiropractor, you might not fully understand how chiropractic works. Chiropractic isn't simply cracking backs, though that's the impression you could get without more information. Chiropractic is actually the manipulation of the spine, including the vertebrae and discs. Your spine affects your entire body's comfort and movement. Misalignment of the spine can cause issues in your joints, extremities, shoulders, neck, and hips - and of course your back! When your vertebrae or discs are misaligned, it causes muscular, nervous, and skeletal tension throughout your body. To relieve tension, chiropractors make slight adjustments to your spine's vertebrae, aligning everything from your neck to your hips.

But there are several benefits that you can receive from chiropractic, if you need it, as well!
