There is also some useful information for young adult carers. If you help look after someone with cancer, this can affect your life in many ways. It may be your mum or dad who has cancer, or your brother or sister. Perhaps you help care for a grandparent, uncle, aunt or friend. Y ou may feel shocked, angry or frightened about what is happening. Y ou may be thinking, 'Why me?' or 'Why them?' We hope this booklet helps you deal with some of the questions or feelings you may have. The booklet explains: what it means to be a young carer who can help support you and the person you are caring for how to look after yourself some of the practical, emotional and financial issues you may face and how to cope with them. We have another booklet for adult carers called Looking after someone with cancer (see page 162). How to use this booklet This booklet is split into sections to help you find what you need. Y ou do not have to read it from start to finish. Y ou can use the contents list on page 5 to help you. It is fine to skip parts of the booklet.

They may also want information to help them support you with being a young carer. Using the glossary Y ou may hear a lot of medical terms when you are looking after someone with cancer. Some of these words can be confusing. We have explained them in the glossary on pages 151 to 157.

If you are under the age of 18 and spend time looking after someone who is ill, you are a young carer. Across the UK, about 1 in 5 children and young people are young carers. Y ou may not have realised that you are a young carer, or ever called yourself this before. But, as a young carer, you may do extra things to help your family. These may be things that your friends are not doing. For example, you might: clean or do other jobs around the house prepare meals wash the dishes do the food shopping go out with the person who is ill to help them with shopping or other tasks help look after your brothers or sisters. Being a young carer 9 Across the UK, about 1 in 5 children and young people are young carers.Y ou could be giving personal care to someone in your family who has cancer. For example, you might: help them get dressed give them their medicines change their bandages. Y ou may also give emotional support to the person who is ill. For example, you might: comfort them when they are upset listen when they need to talk. When you are not with them, you may worry about how they are coping.10 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer BethanIt was hard because I couldn't do some of the things I wanted to, because I had to help at home. How being a young carer can affect you Being a young carer can affect your life in many ways. Y ou may have lots of different feelings and emotions (see pages 45 to 59). It can be hard to concentrate at school or college, find time to study or keep in touch with friends (see pages 90 to 100 and pages 81 to 82). Sometimes you may have to cancel plans to look after the person who has cancer. It can even feel like being a carer has taken over your life. Y ou may also worry about what is happening at home. At times, you may feel angry with the person you look after. Y ou might feel that you are not getting enough attention, but then feel guilty for thinking that way. These are all normal reactions. It can feel challenging and like a big responsibility to be a young carer. But there can also be positive things about the experience. Y ou may become closer to the person you look after, learn new skills and feel more grown-up. Being a young carer 11 Your rights and choices If someone in your family has cancer, it is natural to want to try your best to help them. But your needs are also important. Y ou should not do all the same things as an adult carer, or spend too much time caring for someone. This may affect your studies, emotions, leisure time or other parts of your life. The person with cancer may be able to get to help from: their local council in England, Scotland and Wales (see page 176) or their Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland (see page 177). This means they should not have to rely on you to care for them. As a young carer, you have the right to be supported and have the same chances as other people your age. Are you doing too much caring? There are legal guidelines that say when you may be doing too much as a young carer. Y ou should not have a caring role that: makes you feel worried, sad or lonely affects your health means that you cannot spend enough time with your friends stops you doing well in your studies stops you getting or keeping a job stops you achieving your goals for the future.12 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Your right to a young carer's assessment The law says that any young carer or their family can ask for a young carer's assessment. This is done in your home by a local social worker or young carer's worker. A young carer's assessment is a chat to find out what support you and your family may need or want. To get an assessment, you or your family should contact your local council or Health and Social Care Trust (see pages 176 to 177). Y ou can also speak to your GP , teacher, a youth worker or another professional working with your family. They can help you get a young carer's assessment. Having an assessment is the best way to find out what support is available in your situation. It can help if you are struggling to look after the person with cancer, do your schoolwork or spend time with friends. The assessment is not like an exam. It does not test how good you are at caring for the person with cancer. Instead, it looks at: how much care you give and whether you want to be a carer how your caring affects your studies, training, work or opportunities to relax how your caring role makes you feel about the future the needs of your whole family any support that could help you and your family. Being a young carer 13 Carolina, aged 17The young carers support service provided me with further help due to the information that came out of the assessment. It also meant my family got the support they needed. Y ou and your family should get a written copy of the assessment and be told what to do if you disagree with it. If you live in Scotland, you have the right to ask your local council for a young carer statement. This starts with a conversation to find out about your caring role, what is important to you and what extra support you may need. To find out more about having a young carer's assessment or statement, visit: nhs.uk and search for 'young carers rights', if you live in England or Wales mygov.scot and search for 'young carer support', if you live in Scotland nidirect.gov.uk/young-carers if you live in Northern Ireland.14 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Preparing for a young carer's assessment Carers Trust has a guide to a young carer's assessment called Know your rights: Support for young carers and young adult carers in England. Y ou can download a copy on the Carers Trust website (see page 167). This guide gives practical tips on how you can prepare for a young carer's assessment. Before the assessment, you may find it helpful to think about these things. 5 practical tips 1. Keep a diary of all the jobs you do around the house and how long each task takes. 2. Make a list of any other ways that you support the person with cancer. 3. Think about how being a young carer affects your health, feelings, relationships, studies, any paid job and future plans. 4. Think about whether it is okay for you to continue being a young carer. 5. Write down which services currently help you and the person with cancer, and any extra support you think you need.Amy, aged 20I pay bills, buy and cook food, wash clothes, and clean the house twice a day. I help my dad with medication and I help him get around.16 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Becoming an adult If you are approaching adulthood, you can get a different carer's assessment depending on where you live. This assessment is done before you reach the age of 18. England and Wales If you live in England or Wales, the period when you approach becoming an adult may be called transition. Y ou can ask for a transition assessment when you are ready to start thinking about your future. This is different from a young carer's assessment (see pages 12 to 13). It is a chance for you to talk about your future plans, such as going to university or getting a job. The assessment decides what support you and the person with cancer need after you are 18. Y ou can have a transition assessment at any age, but it should happen well before you become 18. It is important to allow enough time to discuss and decide what support should be ready when you are 18. After the assessment, you should get a written report with information and advice to help you plan for your future. All carers aged 18 or over have the right to an adult carer's assessment. This is explained in our booklet Looking after someone with cancer (see page 162). Being a young carer 17 If you are approaching adulthood, you can get a different carer's assessment depending on where you live.Scotland If you live in Scotland, any young carer statement (see pages 12 to 13) continues to apply when you become 18, until you get an adult carer support plan. If you do not want to continue being a carer, you can choose not to have an adult carer support plan. Northern Ireland If you live in Northern Ireland and are aged 16 or 17, you can ask for an adult carer's assessment instead of a young carer's assessment (see pages 12 to 13). But guidance suggests that this will only rarely be in your best interests. It may be better to have a young carer's assessment and wait until you are 18 to get an adult carer's assessment. 18 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Remember to look after yourself and ask for support if you need it.Getting more support As a young carer, you may feel overwhelmed by everything that is happening at home. Remember to look after yourself and ask for support if you need it. We have details of lots of organisations that can help you (see pages 166 to 179) and more information about getting support (see pages 114 to 123). Talk to someone Y ou could talk to a family member, friend or teacher about anything that is worrying you. Talking about your situation at home may help you deal with problems and get support. As a young carer, you may not want, or be able, to do the same things as an adult carer. If you do not feel comfortable with a task, let someone know. This could be things like taking the person you look after to the toilet or giving them their medication. Another family member or friend may be able to help with those things. Being a young carer 19 If there is nobody who can help, talk to a health or social care professional. They should be able to arrange for you to get some support. We have a list of health and social care professionals you may meet (see pages 27 to 32). Local young carers' services can support you. They also run groups where you can meet other young carers. Find out more about young carers' services at childrenssociety.org.uk/ youngcarer/young-carers-services There are some safe places online where you can chat with others going through a similar experience (see pages 122 to 123). Y ou can also chat with support workers. These people can give you information and advice. Someone from a young carers' service can also talk to your school and other organisations or professionals on your behalf. See pages 114 to 123 for more information on getting support. For a confidential chat and emotional support, you can call our Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 (open every day, 8am to 8pm). Tell your school, college or work Y ou may want to tell your school, college or manager at work that you are caring for someone with cancer. There may be times when you need extra help with your work or time off. If you are open about what is happening and the situation at home, your teachers or employer can support you. We have more information about talking to your school and your work (see pages 90 to 111).20 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Make time for yourself It is important to look after your own mental and physical health, as well as the person you care for. If you do not look after yourself, you will not be able to help the person with cancer. Try to set aside some regular time to do things you enjoy. This can help you relax and take your mind off the situation. We have more information about different activities you could do (see page 71). Remember, you are still allowed to enjoy yourself and you do not need to feel guilty about this. Y oung carers' services can help you take a break from caring, make new friends and have some fun (see page 119).NotesWhat is cancer? 24 A to Z of professionals 27 Talking to doctors and nurses 33 Help with medicines 38 Notes 42about cancer24 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer What is cancer? Cancer starts in our cells. Cells are tiny building blocks that make up the body's organs and tissues. Cells receive signals from the body, telling them when to grow and when to divide to make new cells. This is how our bodies grow and heal. These cells can become old, damaged or no longer needed. When this happens, the cell gets a signal from the body to stop working and die. Sometimes these signals can go wrong, and the cell becomes abnormal. The abnormal cell may keep dividing to make more and more abnormal cells. These can form a lump, called a tumour. Normal cells Cells forming a tumourAbout cancer 25 A tumour can form in different parts of the body: It can form inside an organ. This is part of the body that has a special job, such as the liver or kidney. It can form inside a bone. It can form inside the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network that helps defend your body from disease. Cancer cells from a tumour can sometimes spread to other parts of the body. This is called secondary cancer. Not all cancers form a tumour. Some types of cancer start from blood cells. Abnormal cells can build up in the blood, and sometimes the bone marrow. The bone marrow is where blood cells are made. These types of cancer are sometimes called blood cancers. There are more than 200 different types of cancer. Each type has its own name and treatments. People with cancer need to have tests to find out exactly what type of cancer they have and whether it has spread. This helps the doctors plan the right treatment for each person. We have more information about cancer types and treatment. Y ou can order our booklets for free (see page 162).26 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Most cancers are not caused by inherited cancer genes. Worrying about getting cancer Many people worry about getting cancer. If someone in your family has cancer, you may be worried that it will be passed on from one generation to another (inherited). But most cancers are not caused by inherited cancer genes. Doctors think that only between 3 and 10 in every 100 cancers may be an inherited cancer. Cancer is not contagious. This means it cannot be passed from one person to another. About cancer 27 A to Z of professionals When you look after someone with cancer, you will probably meet lots of different professionals. We have put together a list of people to make it clear who does what. These are people you may talk to in the hospital or at home. This list will help you understand their jobs and ask the right questions. It can help to write down the names and details of the professionals you meet, in case you need to contact them.

Benefits advisers can also help you apply for grants from other organisations and charities.

If the doctor was too busy to talk to me, I would write down my questions and ask an adult to pass them on. Talking to doctors and nurses If you want to know about the health of the person you look after, doctors and nurses are the best people to ask. They are treating the person who has cancer and have all their medical notes. Doctors and nurses must have permission from that person to share any information about their health with you. It can sometimes be hard approaching a doctor or nurse because they may seem very important and busy. But if they have permission from the person you look after, doctors and nurses will be happy to talk to you and help if they can. Y ou may find it helpful to have a list of common medical words and phrases that the doctors and nurses may use. We have a glossary you may find helpful (see pages 151 to 157). Y ou may go to medical appointments with the person you care for. Caption to go here About cancer 35 5 practical tips 1. Before the appointment, write down any questions that you and the person you look after want to ask the doctor or nurse. 2. It is a good idea to make notes during the appointment. These will help you and the person you look after remember what was said. 3. Ask the doctor or nurse to explain anything you do not understand. 4. If you feel shy or nervous, you can ask an adult to speak to the doctor or nurse for you. 5. Try to find out what will happen next. Sometimes, you may meet support workers or healthcare assistants in the hospital. Y ou can always ask them questions, too. Here is a tool that may help you talk to doctors and nurses and get the most from appointments. Appointment planner and record Time and date Location Questions that I and the person I look after want to ask the doctor or nurse Who was there? Summary of appointment (for example, what people said or did) What happens next? 36 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Making sure you are included Y ou may be able to tell the doctors and nurses important things about the person you look after. For example, you may have noticed whether a new medicine they take is helping them or causing side effects. Sometimes the doctors and nurses may talk directly to the adults and not to you. This may make you feel invisible. It can feel like your questions, thoughts and experiences do not matter. If you find this happening to you, do not be afraid to say something about it. Y ou could try talking to an adult who can support you and speak on your behalf. This could be an adult family member. They can then try to include you the next time you are with a health professional. If you still do not feel properly involved in conversations with doctors and nurses, there are organisations that may be able to help. Y ou can contact your local Healthwatch or Patient Advice and Liaison Service (see page 171). They may be able to support you, speak on your behalf or help make sure your voice is heard.About cancer 37 Malik, aged 12I had to learn how to change my dad's dressings. When she was showing us, the nurse talked to my mum - she didn't speak to me. Who else can give you information? There are other people who can tell you more about different types of cancer and treatments. For example, you can speak to experienced cancer nurses on the Macmillan Support Line. They can talk to you about things like chemotherapy and what to expect. Call 0808 808 00 00 (every day, 8am to 8pm) if you would like to speak with someone.38 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Help with medicines Y ou may need to help the person you care for with their medicines. It is important to handle medicines safely. It is a good idea to make sure an adult knows you are helping with the person's medicines. This could be a health professional such as a pharmacist or GP , a family member or a friend. The person you look after should take their medicines exactly as their cancer doctor or nurse has prescribed. Y ou need to check: that the person's name and medicine are correct on the label that the expiry date on the medicine has not passed how often the medicine should be taken how to take the medicine (for example, with or after food). Y ou can get advice and information about medicines from a pharmacist in the hospital or a local pharmacy. This could be an independent pharmacy or part of a chain of stores, like Boots or Superdrug. A pharmacist may also be able to give the person you look after a pill organiser or a special calendar pack of tablets. These both show the day and time that the tablets should be taken.About cancer 39 Amy, aged 20My dad needs medication all of the time, including an oral morphine solution which he relies on - usually four times a day. Carers UK has an online and mobile app called Jointly. It is available for a small one-off payment. This app can keep track of the current and past medicines taken by the person you care for. Y ou can also upload an image to recognise a medicine quickly. Y ou should check with an adult before paying for the app. If you prefer, you can use our planner to record which medicines need to be taken and when (see pages 40 to 41). Y ou may want to make copies of the planner before filling it in. It was developed with help from Boots Macmillan Information Pharmacists. These pharmacists are available in some Boots stores and can help you with questions about medicines.TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date: TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date: TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date: TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date:Medication: How much to take (dosage): What it is for: Shape and colour: Medication: How much to take (dosage): What it is for: Shape and colour: Medication: How much to take (dosage): What it is for: Shape and colour: Medication: How much to take (dosage): What it is for: Shape and colour:Medication planner This planner is to be completed together with the person you look after or another adult.TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date: TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date: TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date: TIME MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN Instructions: Reorder date:NotesDiaryDiaryHow cancer can affect your emotions 46 Mood swings 47 Telling people how you feel 50 Coping with other people's feelings 52 Counselling and talking therapies 54 Depression 58 Notes 60your feelings46 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Jake, aged 13I was crying every night because I didn't know what was going to happen or anything. How cancer can affect your emotions Finding out that someone close to you has cancer can cause many emotions. Common first reactions are 'What is going to happen? Will they recover?' and then, 'Are they going to die?' It is common to have many different emotions. For example, you may feel: frightened about the future sad and upset that this is happening to someone you love exhausted or stressed because of the extra things you are doing angry with the world or the person who has cancer lonely or isolated guilty, even though what is happening is not your fault worried or sad. These are just some examples of how you may feel, but everyone is different. Feelings like these are natural.Your feelings 47 Mood swings Every day is different when you look after someone with cancer. Y ou will have good days and bad days. During this confusing time, you may have mood swings. This is when you feel happy one moment and then sad the next. One minute you could be laughing with your friends and the next you could burst into tears. Try not to worry too much about this. When you are dealing with difficult situations, it may take some time for your emotions to develop. Y ou may have a delayed reaction. It can be difficult for people to understand your mood swings if they do not know that you are affected by cancer. Y ou do not have to explain your situation. But, if you feel comfortable with someone, it may help to share what is happening. Writing down your feelings It can help to write down how you are feeling. Y ou may like to use this table to write about your good and bad days. Y ou could list things that made you feel happy or sad, and things that helped you feel better. Try to think about things you can do to have more good days and write these down as well. People affected by cancer designed this thinking tool. Y ou can find more help using the tool, other tools and stories at thinkaboutyourlife.org If you have any comments about the thinking tool, please email cancerinformationteam@ macmillan.org.ukGood days Next stepsBad daysCaption to go here 50 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Jamie, aged 18I used to talk to my auntie. She was pleased, because she felt like she was supporting my mum by being there for me. Telling people how you feel Talking about your feelings can help you feel less stressed and more in control. Y ou may feel comfortable with some parts of your role as a young carer, but uncomfortable about other parts. Remember that it is okay to share these feelings. Y ou may try not to get upset in front of the person who has cancer, in case you worry them. That is fine, but make sure you are not dealing with everything on your own. If possible, talk to someone else in the family or your friends about how you feel. If you do not feel comfortable talking to family or friends, maybe a young carer worker or an adult at school or college could help. This does not have to be your form tutor or one of your teachers - it could be the school nurse or a teaching assistant. Y ou can also chat online with support workers or other young carers at riprap.org.uk or kooth.comYour feelings 51 Remember that support is available whenever you are ready for it.There may be a local young carers' support group you could join see page 118. Y our school or college may have details. We also have information about organisations that help support young carers. Y ou may find it useful to get help from a counsellor (see pages 54 to 55). Y ou can call our Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 (every day, 8am to 8pm) and talk to a cancer support specialist. They can answer your questions about cancer, or just be there to listen if you feel like talking to someone. It is often helpful to share your feelings, but do whatever is right for you. Remember that support is available whenever you are ready for it. If your emotions are becoming overwhelming or you feel depressed, it is important to talk to your GP (see pages 58 to 59).52 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Samson , aged 16My older brother went out a lot. He withdrew from the family. It hurt at the time, but I understand now that it was his way of coping. Coping with other people's feelings It can be hard to cope with an adult getting upset or angry in front of you. Y ou may not have dealt with this before. Y ou may feel uncomfortable or helpless, or not know what to say. Often, the best thing is just to be there for the person with cancer. Be there to listen if they need to talk or give them a hug or make a cup of tea if they get upset. It is also important to be there to share the happier times. Sometimes the person you care for may want to take their mind off the situation, just as you do. If they feel well enough, you could watch a DVD together or play a game. They may appreciate just doing something normal and spending time with you. Your feelings 53 Addy, aged 14I'm definitely closer to my dad and brother since my mum got cancer. We always try to be there for each other. I appreciate them so much more now. If you have brothers or sisters, they may also get upset. Y ou may want to comfort them, especially if they are younger than you. It is not always easy to know what to say or do. But just trying your best to listen to how they feel can be a big help. Families often say that something like cancer brings them closer together. But being a young carer can also sometimes make you feel alone. Having someone in the family with cancer can put a lot of pressure on everyone. This may mean that people get angry and upset more often, or argue with each other. If this happens, try not to let it affect you too much. If you want to talk to someone about the situation at home, you can call our Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 (every day, 8am to 8pm). We also have information about other useful organisations you can contact.54 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Counselling and talking therapies Many young people get support by talking to close family members or friends. But you may find certain feelings hard to share with them. It can sometimes be useful to talk to a professional who has been trained to listen. They may be called a counsellor, therapist or psychologist. These professionals can help you explore your feelings and find ways to cope better. There is no need to feel embarrassed about talking to someone. Counsellors are there to help. Talking therapies Talking, counselling and support groups are called talking therapies. Talking about your thoughts and feelings can help you cope with stress, anxiety and difficult emotions. There are many types of talking therapies and your GP can help you get the right support for your situation. They can refer you to a counsellor or you can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service. There may be a counsellor at your school or college. Some young carers' services also offer counselling (see page 119). If you have counselling, you usually meet someone face to face. But, if it is hard for you to leave the house, you could have phone or online counselling instead. Y ou can have counselling by yourself or with your family. Your feelings 55 Afiya, aged 17You don't get time to think about what's going on, and don't realise that you're trying to run past it. It was much later that I suddenly started crying and didn't stop for a long time. Y ou can decide how much you would like to share with the counsellor. Any information you give them is confidential. This means they will not tell anybody else. Y ou may find it helpful to talk to somebody who is not directly involved in your situation. If you are angry with someone or frustrated, you can talk to the counsellor about this without upsetting anyone. The counsellor can support you to explore your emotions and your relationship with the person you care for. They can help you find your own solutions to issues or make decisions about your life. If you do not feel comfortable talking to the counsellor you are given, you can ask to see someone else. There is no need to feel bad about this. It is important that you trust your counsellor and feel comfortable with them. If someone referred you, they may be able to arrange for you to see a different counsellor.56 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Hopes and fears It may help you cope if you talk about what is frightening you, and things that you hope will happen. Y ou can use this tool to write down your hopes and fears. This may be easier than saying them out loud and can help you to work out how you feel. There is also space for you to think about what you could do next. These may be things that help you cope with your fears. For example: talking to the person you care for joining a support group chatting to other carers asking for extra help with everyday things. Y ou could share the feelings you have written down with others. Even if you prefer to keep things private, you may still find it useful to write down your hopes and fears. Y ou may realise that there are some things you cannot change, because they are out of your control. Rather than focusing on these things, you can put your time and energy into helping yourself feel better. People affected by cancer developed this thinking tool. Y ou can find more help using the tool, other tools and stories at thinkaboutyourlife.org If you have any comments about this thinking tool, please email cancerinformationteam@ macmillan.org.ukHopes Next stepsFears58 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Depression Caring for someone can be rewarding, but also demanding. There may be times when you feel sad. This could be when you are tired, cannot spend time with your friends, or the person you care for is unwell. These low moods may not last long. Most people find they have good and bad days. But if your low moods continue for more than two weeks, this may be a sign you are depressed. Symptoms of depression can include: feeling sad, tearful or hopeless losing interest in things you used to enjoy, like your hobbies or social life trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much feeling tired all the time or having little energy poor appetite or eating too much finding it hard to motivate yourself, concentrate or make decisions. If your low moods continue for more than two weeks, this may be a sign you are depressed.Your feelings 59 Carolina, aged 17Being a young carer affected my sleep and mental health. This had a knock-on effect on my school, family and friendships. A young carers' service put me in contact with mental health services, which got me the help I needed. If you think you may be depressed, it is important that you get some support. Remember that depression is not anybody's fault. There are many treatments that can help.

Getting support from others and having regular breaks can help you stay well. It is a good idea to tell your GP that you are a young carer. They can give you support and advice. Tell them if you have problems eating or sleeping, or if you are struggling with difficult feelings or finding it hard to cope. Y ou can also speak to a school nurse about any health concerns. Y ou can also call our Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 (every day, 8am to 8pm) for a confidential chat. The Children's Society has a short video made by young carers.

Or you may eat a lot as a way of coping. But it is important to have a healthy, balanced diet. This will give you the energy you need and help you feel your best. Even if you are having a bad day, try to eat healthy food. It is also good to sit down and eat a cooked meal when you can. If you are tired, perhaps you could ask a family member or friend to make meals you can put in the freezer. Then you can easily heat up a meal when you need it. To have a healthy, balanced diet, you should try to: eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day eat plenty of starchy foods (carbohydrates) - these include potatoes, bread, rice and pasta have some milk and dairy foods (such as cheese and yoghurt) or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks and yoghurts) eat some pulses (like beans, peas and lentils), fish, eggs, meat or other protein choose unsaturated oils and spreads, such as like vegetable, olive or sunflower oil and spreads, and eat them in small amounts eat foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar less often and in small amounts drink plenty of fluids (at least 6 to 8 glasses a day).Looking after yourself 67 Here are some ways that you can find simple, healthy recipe ideas for you and your family: Visit the Change4Life website at nhs.uk/change4life/ recipes or download their free Smart Recipes app. Visit nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/20-tips-to-eat-well-for-less to see 20 tips on how you can eat healthily and save money.

This can strengthen your bones and muscles. It can also improve your energy, sleep and mood. Here are some tips to keep active when you are a young carer: Try to do some exercise every day. This could be as simple as going for a walk. Physical activity can help you feel less tired and stressed. Download a free walking tracker app called Active 10 at nhs.uk/oneyou/active10 If you enjoy activities like sport, swimming, yoga or going to the gym, try to keep doing them.

Visit nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-fitness-studio For more tips on keeping active indoors or outdoors, visit sportengland.org, sportscotland.org.uk, sport.wales or sportni.netLooking after yourself 69 Sleeping When you are caring for someone with cancer, you may struggle to get enough sleep. This could be for lots of reasons, but the main one for many young carers is worry. It can be hard to stop worrying at night. When you go to bed, you may keep thinking about the person who is ill or what will happen in the future. This can keep you awake. Y ou may have people coming in and out of your home at different times. This can be a distraction if you are trying to sleep. Y ou could also be kept awake if the person you care for is having a bad night. There are some things you can do to try to get a good night's sleep. 5 practical tips 1. Read a book or magazine or listen to an audio book before you go to bed. This can help focus your mind on something other than cancer. 2. Don't look at your mobile phone, tablet, computer or TV for half an hour before bedtime. The screens on these devices give out a blue light that makes you more awake. 3. Have a bath before bedtime. If you want to, you could add something like lavender oil or a bath soak to help you relax. 4. Try simple breathing and relaxation exercises (see pages 70 to 72) or listen to soothing music. 5. Write down your worries or make a to-do list for the next day. This can help calm your mind and stop you worrying at night.70 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Relaxation If you feel stressed or anxious, you often start to breathe quickly, and your muscles become tense. There are different techniques that can help relax your body and mind. Breathe slowly and deeply for 3 to 5 minutes Take a deep breath through your nose, count to 5 and let your tummy expand like a balloon. Then breathe out through your mouth, count to 5 again and let your tummy deflate. This breathing exercise should make you feel calmer within a few minutes. It is a good idea to practise every day. Relax your muscles Think of each part of your body in turn, starting with your toes and then slowly moving upwards. Try to relax one muscle group at a time and release any tension, until your whole body feels calm and comfortable.Looking after yourself 71 Make time for yourself It is important to take regular breaks from caring, accept or ask for help and do something that you enjoy. This could be: playing sport or doing other types of exercise meeting friends spending time with pets reading listening to music watching your favourite TV programme or a film doing something creative like arts and crafts, playing an instrument or baking. Y ou may feel guilty about going out or enjoying yourself when someone you love is ill. Talk to the person you are caring for about this. They will probably want you to make time for yourself and have some fun. Taking a short break from your routine can help you feel calmer and lift your mood.72 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Focus on the present moment When you are a young carer, it can be easy to rush through a busy day without stopping to notice much. If you try to be more aware of what is happening in the present moment, this can relax and calm your mind. This is sometimes called mindfulness. Routine tasks, for example washing up, can be transformed into a mindful activity. Instead of focusing on stressful thoughts and worries, you can pay full attention to what is happening in each moment. Y ou may notice the temperature of the water, the sound of the dripping tap and the smoothness of the plates. There is a free website with guided mindfulness exercises for people affected by cancer (including carers) at thisiskara.com If you try to be more aware of what is happening in the present moment, this can relax and calm your mind.Caption to go here 74 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Drink and drugs Sometimes people use alcohol or drugs to escape their feelings when they are stressed or upset. But in the long term, this can make you feel worse and damage your health. If you are thinking about drinking alcohol or taking drugs, talk to someone about how you feel. This could be anyone you trust, such as a family member, friend, GP , social worker or young carer worker. They can help you find other ways to cope and encourage you to make safe, healthy decisions. If you already use drink or drugs to help you cope, it is important to get support quickly. Y ou could try talking to family and friends. If you are not comfortable doing that, we have details of helplines and organisations you can contact (see pages 172 to 174). It is also a good idea to see your GP , who can refer you for counselling and professional support (see pages 54 to 55). Other things that could help you cope are: physical activity, such as running or swimming talking to a friend changing your routine, so you are not thinking about alcohol or drugs at certain points of the day. If your friends encourage you to drink a lot or take drugs, it may be better to spend time with other people. Y ou can watch videos of young people sharing their personal stories about alcohol and drugs at healthtalk.org/drugs-and-alcoholLooking after yourself 75 Self-harm Self-harm is when you deliberately hurt yourself. Anyone can self-harm, but it is often linked to difficult experiences such as extreme stress or being bullied. People who care for someone with cancer may be at risk of self-harm. If you have any thoughts about self-harming or have started to hurt yourself, it is very important to get help quickly. Try to tell a family member, friend or young carer worker what is happening. We also have a list of organisations that can help. It is also important to make an appointment with your GP . They can treat you if you are depressed and arrange for you to get the right support (see pages 58 to 59). Y ou can watch a video about why young people self-harm and find advice about getting support at nhs.uk/conditions/ self-harmNotesHow cancer may affect your relationships 80 Friends 81 Family 83 Boyfriends and girlfriends 86 Notes 88your relationships80 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Cameli, aged 16 Some friends never knew. They couldn't support me because they didn't realise anything was wrong. Looking back, I should have talked to them more. How cancer may affect your relationships Y our relationships with people close to you are an important part of your life. While you are caring for someone who has cancer, your relationships with friends and family may change. Try not to worry too much about this. All relationships change and develop over time. For example, you may now have a different best friend to when you first started school. Some relationships do not last, while others grow stronger over time. Y ou will probably experience both. But remember that help and support is always available.Your relationships 81 Friends Talking to friends about cancer can be hard. When the person you look after is first diagnosed, you may be in shock. Y ou may need some time to think about who to tell. Y ou may worry that your friends will not understand what you are going through. If you tell them, you may feel that things will not be normal between you. But telling friends about your situation can be positive: You will have someone to talk to when you are stressed or upset. You will not have to make excuses if you cancel plans with them. They will understand if you are having a bad day and give you some space or more support. Y ou may want to start by telling one or two close friends that you are caring for someone with cancer. Be prepared for your friends to react differently. Some people will be calm and carry on as normal. Others may not know what to say or need time to think, just as you did.82 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Try to explain to your friends what it is like to be a young carer. This can help them understand your situation and how you feel. Y ou may see your friends less often because you are busy looking after the person with cancer. It is important to get support, so that you can spend time with your friends and do things you enjoy. Using social media is also a good way of keeping in touch with friends. Y ou may make new friends with other young people in a similar situation. Y ou can do this by joining a support group, a young carers' project or an online forum (see pages 114 to 123).Your relationships 83 Family The person that you are caring for may be your mum or dad, brother or sister, or one of your grandparents. They could be someone who lives in your house or who you see often. It will take time for you all to come to terms with the cancer. The most important thing is to try to find ways of coping together. Talking to each other and spending time together can help. For example, the person you care for may be too unwell to go to the cinema. But you could buy some popcorn and watch a film together at home instead. Having someone in the family with cancer can cause lots of different emotions (see pages 45 to 59). People may get angry and upset more often, or argue with each other more. Do not feel bad if you have arguments with your family, including the person you care for. If the problem continues, you may want to consider counselling on your own or with your family (see pages 54 to 55). This can help you understand your emotions and work with family members to resolve the issues. It is important not to do everything for the person you look after. This could affect your relationship because it may feel like your roles have been reversed. Most people will still want to be as independent as they can.Talking to each other and spending time together can help. 84 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Getting help from family members There are lots of ways that other family members can help, such as tidying the house or doing the shopping. This will give you a break and make them feel that they are supporting you. Do not feel like you need to do everything yourself. It is important to tell someone if you feel uncomfortable about a caring task. Another family member may be able to help instead. Y ou could talk to a health or social care professional about how you feel if that is easier. See pages 18 to 20 for more information on getting support. Sometimes it is useful to write down who is helping, when they are coming and what they are doing. This can help make the best use of everyone's time. Carers UK has an online and mobile app called Jointly. It is available for a small one-off payment. Y ou can use this app to share caring tasks with others, organise who is doing what and store useful contacts. Y ou should check with an adult before paying for the app. Y ou can find contact details for Carers UK on page 167. If you prefer, you can use our weekly family rota (see opposite). We have included examples of details you can add to the rota. Y ou and your family can make your own version of this table. Y ou can also make copies of the rota and use it for different weeks.

Spending time with them can also give you a break. Y our boyfriend or girlfriend might be willing to help you with the extra jobs you do at home. For example, they may agree to carry the shopping, mow the lawn or take the dog for a walk. Do not be afraid to ask them for support. But remember that these things are not their responsibility, so you should check that they are happy to help. Being in a relationship can be fun and exciting. But you may have less spare time as a young carer and may often be thinking about the person you look after. This can affect your relationship. If things are not going well or your relationship ends, you may feel very sad. This can cause more stress in addition to your caring responsibilities. Y ou may feel guilty for getting upset about your relationship. Perhaps you feel that you cannot talk about this issue at home because it seems unimportant compared to the cancer. But what happens in the rest of your life still matters. Remember, you can always talk to a close friend or professional about how you feel (see pages 54 to 55).Amy, aged 20I have a wonderful boyfriend who helps me cook dinner and he and his family have been there for all of us. He always helps me feel better.

It means that you can see friends and forget about your problems for a few hours. Or you may find that it can be worrying. Some of the things you may be worried about are: getting to school on time finding it difficult to concentrate completing homework managing your studies as well as your caring responsibilities being away from the person you care for. There is no right or wrong way to feel. Not everyone has the same experience. But telling your school that you are a young carer makes it much easier to get support. There will be someone at school who can make sure you do not have to go through everything alone. Y ou can ask your teacher if there is a young carers' lead in your school to help support you. Not everyone has the same experience.Amy, aged 20It was my choice to become dad's carer. I left college when dad was diagnosed and I've never regretted it. Maybe in the future I can pick up where I left off.94 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Talking to your teachers Y ou may not want to tell your teachers that you are caring for someone with cancer. But if they know what is happening, they may be able to help you. They are likely to be more understanding if you are late for school or struggle to keep up with homework. If you find it hard to talk about your home life, here are some tips that may help. 5 practical tips 1. It is a good idea to tell at least one person at school that you are a young carer. You could approach a teacher or member of staff that you like and trust. 2. You could say something like: 'Please can I speak with you in private after class? I would like to talk to you about what is happening at home and how this may affect my schoolwork.' 3. You could show your teacher a list or diary of all the jobs you do around the house. 4. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your teacher, ask a family member to contact them for you. Perhaps they could write a letter to the school. 5. Young carers' services can also speak to your school for you. The Children's Society can help you find a service near you (see page 168). School or college 95 How your school can support you Teachers are there to help you reach your full potential, whatever challenges you face. If you tell them about your situation at home, they may be able to: let you phone the person you are caring for during breaks or lunchtimes help you with homework or deadlines if you are struggling (see page 97) organise help for your family to travel to parents' evenings if it is hard for them to leave the house arrange for you to talk about how you feel with a school counsellor (see pages 54 to 55 for more information about counselling). In England and Wales, there is a free programme called Y oung Carers in Schools. It is run jointly by Carers Trust and The Children's Society. This programme can help your school put the right support in place for you and other young carers. See pages 167 and 168 for their contact details. There is lots of information available for schools on supporting young carers. 96 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer England If you live in England, your school can visit the Carers Trust website at carers.org and search for 'young carers in schools' for more information.

Visit eani.org.uk and search the booklet title.School or college 97 Managing homework As a young carer, you may not have as much time to do your homework as others in your class. After school, you may be cooking meals or doing housework, or you may not feel able to study. Try to take one day at a time. If you find it hard to concentrate at home, think about whether there is another place that you can do your homework. This could be at the house of another family member or friend, or at a school or homework club. Some young carers' projects (see page 119) also run homework clubs. If you are worried about not getting your homework done, you can ask a young carer worker or family member to talk to your school. The school may be able to give you a bit less homework, or more time to do it. These websites may help you with your homework, coursework or revision for exams: BBC Bitesize - offers free videos, step-by-step guides, activities and quizzes to support your learning and exam preparation.

Sometimes you may feel that you need to take a day off to look after the person with cancer. There may be days when you struggle to get to school on time. If this happens, speak to a teacher or someone who works at your school as soon as you can. They may be able to help you get more support at home, so you can concentrate on your studies. A GP , nurse, social worker or young carer worker can also help you get support for yourself and your family (see pages 11 to 19).School or college 99 If you are being bullied Bullies often pick on people who are different to them. If you are a young carer, you may find that you are the target of bullying. The bullies probably do not understand what your life is like outside of school. Bullying can include being: called unkind names deliberately left out of activities or friendship groups threatened hit, kicked or punched. If you are being bullied because of your situation at home, it is natural to feel upset and scared. But do not blame yourself. Bullying is unacceptable and should not be allowed to continue. There are ways to deal with the problem. It is important to tell an adult what is happening. Try talking to a teacher or school counsellor. Perhaps your school could arrange to teach a lesson or hold an assembly about cancer. This may help your classmates and teachers understand more about your situation. It is important to tell an adult what is happening.100 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Jake, aged 13The teacher spoke about cancer in assembly, which made a difference. Now my brother is treated like a king and has made lots of friends. Y oung carers' services can offer support (see pages 119). Y ou may be able to talk to other young carers who have been bullied. We also have contact details for different organisations that can help (see pages 166 to 179). For example, you can call Childline free on 0800 1111 to have a confidential chat with a trained counsellor. They may be able to help you deal with the bullying. Y ou could tell your teachers about the website kidscape. org.uk/resources Here they can download a free bullying awareness classroom resource, created by Kidscape and Carers Trust. This shows students the challenges that young carers face.NotesCancer and money issues 104 Benefits and financial help 105 If you work 108 Notes 112Money an D work104 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Cancer and money issues When someone has an illness like cancer, it can affect how much money everyone in the family has. The person who is ill may have to stop working for a while. Other people in the family may also have to stop working, or work less, so that they can be carers. There can also be extra costs, such as travelling to hospital or higher heating bills. These changes to the family can affect you if you are a young carer. But help is available if you or your family are having money problems because of cancer. Money and work 105 Benefits and financial help The government makes payments to people who need financial help. These are called benefits. Some benefits are just for carers and some are for people with a disability. This includes cancer. Other benefits help people if they have a low income. As a young carer, you may be able to get some benefits yourself. The person with cancer may be entitled to different benefits. This could make things easier for you and your family. Carer's Allowance Carer's Allowance is a benefit to help people who look after someone with a lot of care needs. Y ou may be able to get this if you look after someone for 35 hours a week or more. To get Carer's Allowance, you must be aged 16 or over and not be in full-time education. The person who you care for must also get a certain disability benefit. Before you apply for Carer's Allowance, it is a good idea to get some advice. Carer's Allowance can affect other benefit payments that you and the person with cancer get. If you live in Scotland, you may get two extra payments a year called Carer's Allowance Supplement.106 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Carer Premium If you are entitled to Carer's Allowance, you may be able to get extra money added to certain other means-tested benefits. This is called Carer Premium. Young Carer Grant (Scotland) This is a yearly payment for young carers aged 16 to 18 in Scotland, who are not entitled to Carer's Allowance.

For more information, contact the charity Turn2Us (see page 177). The person with cancer can also apply for a Macmillan Grant through a health or social care professional (see page 165). Macmillan Grants are small, one-off payments to help with the extra costs that living with cancer can bring. They can be used to help with things like energy bills, furniture or the cost of travel to and from hospital. Macmillan Grants are available to people with cancer whose income and savings are below a certain level.108 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer If you work If you have a job, it can be hard to balance working and caring. But work can be a chance to socialise, improve your confidence and reduce money worries. Y ou may be thinking about whether to tell your employer that you look after someone with cancer. As a young carer, you have important rights that protect you at work. Carers Trust has produced a free guide called Getting into work: A guide for young adult carers in England (see page 167). It includes advice on how to find a job, speak to your employer about being a carer and manage at work. Looking for a new job As a young carer, you are probably learning lots of practical, organisational and communication skills. These skills are likely to be valuable to employers when you apply for a new job. Y ou could highlight this experience on your CV and application forms.As a young carer, you have important rights that protect you at work. Money and work 109 At an interview, you could give examples of skills that you have used in your caring role. For example, you may be asked to describe a situation where you have managed your time well. There is also likely to be a chance for you to ask questions. It is a good idea to find out if, for example, the employer offers flexible (different) working arrangements (see page 111). Y ou can get help looking for a new job from your local Jobcentre Plus (in England, Scotland and Wales) or Social Security or Jobs and Benefits office (in Northern Ireland). Talking to your manager If you are working, even if just part-time, it is your choice whether to tell your manager that you are caring for someone with cancer. Y ou may choose not to tell anyone at work that you are a young carer. For some people, having a part-time job is a good chance to get out of the house and do something for themselves. It means having a place where you do not have to think or talk about cancer. But if you tell your manager about your situation, they may be able to give you more support. Y our manager is likely to be more understanding if you need to miss work or are late. They may be able to give you time off or arrange a more flexible work pattern. On the next page there are practical tips for talking to your manager about being a young carer.110 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer 6 practical tips 1. Try to arrange a meeting with your manager. You could say something like: 'Please can we arrange a time to have a private conversation? I would like to talk to you about my caring responsibilities at home.' 2. It is useful to make a list of the main things to talk about and questions to ask at the meeting. To get help with this, call our Work Support Service free on 0808 808 00 00 . 3. If you feel nervous, take someone with you to the meeting for support. It is best to meet in a quiet place where you will not be interrupted. You can remind your manager to keep everything you tell them confidential. 4. At the meeting, it is a good idea to make notes and keep a record of them. You can explain briefly that you look after a family member and what you do to help. You do not have to say that the person has cancer, but you can if you feel comfortable. 5. Try to explain how being a young carer may affect your work. For example, you may sometimes have to take time off at short notice. You and your manager can then talk about possible solutions, such as working at home sometimes. 6. Ask your manager what leave (time off) you can take and what other support is available in your situation. Suggest having regular catch-up meetings. You can then review how any changes are working and whether you are getting enough support. Money and work 111 Your rights at work Y ou have rights at work that may make it easier to keep working while you are a young carer. If you have any questions about your rights, call our work support team free on 0808 808 00 00. Protection from discrimination Y ou may be worried that you will lose your job if you tell your manager that you are a young carer. But it is against the law for your employer to treat you unfairly because you look after someone who has cancer. That would be discrimination. If you think you are experiencing discrimination, you can contact Citizens Advice for help (see page 175). Right to ask for flexible working If you have worked for your employer for at least 26 weeks, you can ask them for a more flexible work pattern. This could mean having different start or finish times, working from home sometimes or doing fewer hours. Y our employer can refuse your request if it is not in the best interests of the business. If you want to ask for flexible working, there is a procedure that you and your employer must follow. It may be possible to agree a temporary or small change informally. Time off in an emergency Employees can take reasonable time off to deal with an emergency involving someone they care for. This time off is usually unpaid, but you can check your employment contract or company policy. We have more information in our leaflet Questions for carers to ask about work and cancer (see page 162).

If a social worker is asked to visit your family, they can help you all cope with looking after someone who has cancer. They can give you information, advice and support. Y ou can talk to them if you have any questions or worries. Y our social worker is there to make sure that, as a young person, you are being protected and supported at home. 120 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Voluntary organisations and charities There are lots of charities across the UK that can support young carers and their families. Here are some health charities that can help: Macmillan Cancer Support offers practical, emotional and financial help for anyone affected by cancer, including young people and carers (see pages 163 to 165). Cancer Research UK is trying to find the causes of cancer and possible cures. It can give you information about different types of cancer (see page 170). Marie Curie gives free home nursing care to people at the end of their life (see page 178). There are also charities for specific types of cancer. Some charities, like the Children's Society, are there to protect children and young people. Other charities can support you and your whole family, including Action for Children, Barnardo's and Family Action. Charities like Carers Trust and Carers UK support anyone who looks after a person who is ill or disabled. See pages 166 to 169 for details of these charities.Getting help and support 121 Hospices Hospices support people with an incurable illness and their family members, close friends or carers. The care and support from a hospice are always free. Y ou may think that hospices only look after people at the very end of their life. But if people are diagnosed with an incurable illness, they can use hospice care at any stage of their condition. They often get care in their own home or by visiting the hospice as a day patient. Sometimes people stay in a hospice for a short time to give their carers a break. A hospice provides a wide range of services and can support your whole family. The person with cancer may be offered: help to manage symptoms like pain relaxation therapies emotional, spiritual or practical support. Y ou may be able to join a support group or counselling sessions for carers at the hospice. Y our local hospice can explain what services are available. To find a local hospice, ask a GP or district nurse, or visit the Hospice UK website (see page 177).People can use hospice care at any stage of their condition.122 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Online forums Online forums can be a good way to get support and talk to people who are in a similar situation. But it is important to stay safe on the internet. Here are some tips to make sure you are safe online: Tell a responsible adult which forum you use and who you talk to online. Tell someone if you feel unsure or uneasy about anything. Do not use your real name - make up a nickname instead. Do not share personal information, such as which school you go to or where you live. It is not a good idea to meet someone you have only chatted to online - they may not be who they say they are. You can leave a forum or take a break whenever you want to. For more information about staying safe online, speak to your school or visit saferinternet.org.uk Joining an online forum can put you in contact with other young people and carers. Y ou can use a forum whenever you like, make new online friends and share tips to help each other.

NotesAccepting what is going to happen 128 Before someone dies 130 When someone dies 132 The funeral 133 After someone has died 134 Grief 135 Notes 141if the person you care for Dies128 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Accepting what is going to happen Many people with cancer get better and recover from treatment. But sadly, some people do not. If someone you love is going to die of cancer, it can feel like the end of your world. Some of the young carers who helped develop this information have been through the experience. They want you to know one thing: it may be the worst time in your life right now, but this will not last forever. Y ou will get through it and there is lots of help available. If the person you care for is told that they will die, it can be hard for both of you to accept. This is called denial. It is a natural reaction. If the person with cancer is in denial, they may not want to talk about some things. While this may be upsetting for you, denial is a strong coping tool and needs to be respected. Some people eventually accept their situation, but others stay in denial.If the person you care for dies 129 It is still important to ask any questions you may have about what is going to happen. Y ou need to know what to expect, so you can try to prepare yourself. Y ou could talk to close family members, a doctor or a nurse (see pages 33 to 37). Y ou may want to say things to the person who is dying. The time that you have together is special, and you are likely to cherish it in future. Y ou could tell the person you love them or talk about favourite memories you have shared. Maybe you could ask them to tell you about their hopes and dreams for your future. This is a difficult and emotional time. If you need extra support, you can call our Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 (open every day, 8am to 8pm). It is still important to ask any questions you may have about what is going to happen.130 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Before someone dies Before they die, the person you look after may get very ill. Try to be prepared for this, as it will be upsetting. Y oung carers' services, or other organisations that support young carers, can help you and your family make an emergency plan. This can cover what to do if the dying person's health suddenly gets worse or they die at home. If you are by yourself when that happens, call their GP or the NHS helpline 111. A doctor will then come to your home to help you. Hospices If the person you look after becomes very ill, they may go into a hospice. This may also happen if you or your family decides that they cannot cope or need a break. A hospice is a place where people with serious illnesses get free specialist care and support. They have nurses who provide palliative care. This is special care towards the end of life. It includes pain relief for the person who is ill and emotional support for them and their family. Hospices are designed to be friendly, comfortable places, where family and friends are welcome. Some hospices will let you stay overnight from time to time. Y ou can speak to the nurses about things you can still do to help your loved one.If the person you care for dies 131 Talking about your needs Talking to nurses and doctors can help a lot at this stage. Palliative care nurses can help you make sense of what is happening. People may think that, because you are young, they need to protect you when someone is dying. This can be frustrating. If you want to be told more information, a young carer worker could explain this to your family or the healthcare staff. It is important to be open with your family about what you want. If you would like to be there at the end, make sure people know this and respect your wishes. But if you would rather not be there, that is okay too. We have more information about what happens in the last few weeks, days, and at the end of life in our booklet A guide for the end of life (see page 162).Palliative care nurses can help you make sense of what is happening.132 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer When someone dies If you have decided that you want to be there at the end, knowing what to expect can help you prepare. This will be an emotional experience. But remember you are doing something special by being there to comfort and reassure the person you love. When someone is dying, they can often still hear you even if they cannot respond. So, keep talking to them. Y ou may not be able to tell the exact moment when the person dies, but you may notice some physical changes. Their body may relax completely, and they may look peaceful. Y ou cannot be sure how you will feel until this happens. Some people say they feel relieved that the person is at peace and their illness is over. Losing someone you love is very hard. But remember that there are people around to support you. It is important to express how you are feeling.If the person you care for dies 133 The funeral Y our family will usually start planning the funeral quite quickly. This can be a chance to say goodbye to the person who has died, celebrate their life or share memories with others. A funeral director or religious leader may come to your home. They may want to speak with you about the person who has died and hear about your memories. If you want to get involved with the funeral, make sure you tell your family. What happens at the funeral depends on your family's culture and beliefs. Depending on the type of funeral and your family's wishes, you may be able to: read a poem do a special reading choose a piece of music simply talk about the person who has died and your memories of them. Tell the person planning the funeral if you want to do any of these things and find out what is possible. If you do not want to go to the funeral, or you are not allowed to go, there are other ways that you can say goodbye. Here are some ideas: Plant a flower or tree, or light a candle, in memory of the person who has died. Tie a message to a balloon and let it go. Visit a place with a special meaning or memories and perhaps say a few words. This could be a place where the two of you used to go, or just somewhere peaceful. 134 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer After someone has died After someone has died, life at home can feel flat or empty. If the person was cared for at home, nurses and family members may have visited regularly. It can feel quiet and lonely for a while, until you get used to the new situation. Give yourself plenty of time and space. Do not put too much pressure on yourself. Y ou may worry that you cannot talk about the person who has died to your family, in case it upsets them. But your family will probably understand how you feel at this time. Y ou could comfort each other and share memories. If you need to sort out the belongings of the person who has died, this can be upsetting. It may feel very final. Y ou may prefer not to do this task for a while. Talk to the rest of your family and try to agree when would be a good time. Make sure you tell someone if there is anything you want to keep. This could be something like a watch, a ring or photos. Someone close to you dying when you are young can make you feel alone. Y ou may find that none of your friends or classmates have gone through a similar experience. They may not know how to react or what to say. Try to explain to your friends gently that they can support you just by being there and listening. Y ou could encourage them to watch the How to help a grieving friend video from the charity Winston's Wish (see page 179). If it is hard for you to talk to your family or friends, you could contact a cancer support group, young carer worker or counsellor. Just make sure you do not keep your feelings to yourself. If the person you care for dies 135 Grief Grief is a word for some of the feelings you may have after someone close to you has died. The thoughts and feelings you have will change. Sometimes they may be very strong. They might stop you doing things. At other times, they may be in the background and you can still do your daily activities. Y ou may have lots of different emotions. They are unlikely to stay the same. It can feel like they come and go in waves. If you had a difficult relationship with the person who has died, your feelings may be complicated. Common feelings Shock and numbness Many people describe feeling shocked and numb in the days and weeks after someone they love has died. Y ou may find it hard to believe what has happened. It can feel like you expect the person to walk through the door at any moment. Anger Y ou may feel angry and think that your loss is unfair. This is a natural reaction. Guilt Y ou may think that you could have done more to help or behaved differently. Perhaps you could talk to a doctor or nurse who looked after the person who has died. Y ou could also talk to your GP . They can reassure you that there is nothing that you could have done to prevent the death. It is not your fault that the person with cancer died. 136 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Relief The person you looked after may have been ill for a long time or had symptoms that were difficult to control. Y ou may feel relieved that they are not suffering any more. Y ou should not feel guilty about this. Loneliness Y ou may feel lonely, even when surrounded by family and friends. This is understandable, as the person who has died was a big part of your life. It will take time to get used to them not being around. Longing Y ou may have a powerful longing to see, speak to or hold the person who has died or dream about them. Some people find looking at photos or thinking about good memories helpful. Others find they need to be distracted by other things. Fear Y ou may worry about the future and how you and your family will cope. This is natural. When you feel ready, you could talk to your family about how you feel. It may be possible to make some plans together to help you feel more secure. Sadness The sadness you feel after someone close to you dies can be overwhelming. Some people describe it like a physical pain in the chest. Try not to worry how often you cry. Crying is a healthy way to release strong emotions. If you cannot cry, you may be expressing your grief in a different way. Just do whatever feels right for you.Caption to go here 138 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Farouk, aged 15I used to talk to my mum after she died. It helped me.

Y ou will have good days and bad days. Try to take one day at a time.If the person you care for dies 139 Coping with grief After someone you loved has died, it can feel like nothing is the same any more. But you may find it helpful to get back to your usual routine quite quickly. Try to make sure that you do not isolate yourself. It can be harder to adjust if you have not been to school or college, or seen your friends, for a long time. There are some things that may help when you are grieving. 5 practical tips 1. Look after yourself. Grieving can be a very tiring process. It is important to take care of your health. Try to eat healthily, make time to relax and do regular exercise. These things can help improve your mood (see pages 62 to 75). 2. Do things you enjoy. It is a good idea to keep your mind busy and distract yourself from sadness. Try to make time for your hobbies. You could spend time with friends or pets, go for a walk or read a book. Try not to feel guilty if you have some fun. This does not mean you have forgotten the person who has died. 3. Stay connected to the person who has died. There are lots of ways to do this. You could write them a letter, put a favourite photo in a frame or visit a place that has nice memories. Do not be afraid to talk about the person or share stories about them. 4. Make a memory box. This is a container that holds special things to remind you of the person who has died. You could put in photos, some of their favourite music or letters or cards from them. These things can help remind you of happy times you spent together and give you comfort. 5. Ask for support. It is important to find someone to talk to about your grief. This could be a family member, close friend, teacher, your GP or anyone else you trust.140 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Jordyn, aged 14I was always really worried about my dad and I didn't know what I could do. I couldn't make him be able to do the things that he wanted to.There are charities that can help if you are coping with grief (see pages 178 to 179). Y ou could call the Cruse Bereavement young people's helpline free on 0808 808 1677. Child Bereavement UK runs support groups and has an app for people aged 11 to 25.

Y ou will always feel love and sadness for the person who has died. Eventually, you will have fewer bad days and can start to look to the future. This does not mean you are forgetting your loved one.NotesWhen you stop being a young carer 144 Notes 149life after caring144 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer Jordyn, aged 14It's important to know that you're not horrible if you go out and have a good time or keep doing normal things after they've died. When you stop being a young carer When you stop being someone's carer, it can be a big change. Y ou probably need time to adjust. The person you looked after may have got better and no longer need the same help, or they may have sadly died. Emotionally, these are very different situations. But, whatever your situation, it is important to bring some routine back into your life and be kind to yourself. Coping with your emotions Being a young carer is demanding and can cause many emotions (see pages 45 to 59). When you were caring for the person with cancer, you may have been too busy to deal with all these different feelings. Now, you may have more time to think and reflect. Y ou may start to feel emotions you did not have time to recognise before.Life after caring 145 After being a carer, you need time to recover. Try to focus on doing things you enjoy and that help you relax. Y ou may have been putting someone else's health first for a long time and it is important to look after yourself (see pages 62 to 75). To talk with someone about how you feel, call our Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 (every day, 8am to 8pm). Y ou may also find it helpful to get support from other people who used to be young carers. For example, you could join a support group or an online forum (see page 118). If the person you looked after has died, you may be coping with difficult emotions (see pages 127 to 140). It can sometimes take a long time to accept what has happened. Lots of support is available and your GP can help if a low mood or anxiety are affecting your daily life (see pages 45 to 59). Eventually, you will start to feel less sad and more hopeful about the future. Filling your time A typical day as a young carer may have involved lots of different tasks. When you stop looking after someone, it can leave a gap in your life. Y ou may feel you have lost your purpose and might not be sure how to fill your time at first. It is a good idea to get back into a routine slowly. Y ou may want to start spending more time with your friends or focus on your school or college work.146 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer When you feel ready, you may enjoy trying a new hobby or learning some new skills. Carers UK have designed an e-learning programme called Learning for Living. This can help you recognise the skills that you have gained from caring and what you can do to make the most of them. Visit learning4living.org Some young carers put their skills to good use by becoming volunteers. Y our caring experience may have made you more emotionally mature than other people your age. Volunteering can be a great way to make a difference, have fun and meet new people. Y ou can find volunteering opportunities across the UK at do-it.org Y ou can also volunteer for Macmillan. Visit volunteering. macmillan.org.ukLife after caring 147 Focusing on your future There may come a time when you consider moving away from home, or want to make decisions about your future.

Y our local council or Health and Social Care Trust can assess what support you and the person with cancer need after you are 18 (see pages 16 to 17). It is important that you have a chance to focus on your future goals. If you plan to move away from home, you may feel guilty about leaving. Y ou may be worried about the cancer coming back or leaving people behind who have also lost a loved one. These feelings are natural, but you have your whole life ahead of you. Y our experience with cancer should not stop you from doing all the things you want to. It is important that you have a chance to focus on your future goals.148 A guide for young people looking after someone with cancer If you are looking for a job, contact your local Jobcentre Plus (in England, Scotland and Wales) or Social Security or Jobs and Benefits office (in Northern Ireland) - see page 176.

Benign Benign means not cancerous. Benign tumours usually grow slowly. They do not spread to other parts of the body. Biopsy A biopsy is when a doctor takes a small sample of tissue from the body and looks at it under a microscope. This is to see if the cells are cancerous or not. Blood count A blood count is a blood test. It measures the levels of different blood cells in the blood. The three main types of blood cells are: red blood cells, which carry oxygen white blood cells, which fight and prevent infection platelets, which help the blood to clot.
