Most historical scholars would probably be hard pressed to write more than a brief paragraph about Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) and his discovery. Yet, for approximately seventy-five years from its beginnings in 1779, animal magnetism flourished as a medical and psychological specialty, and for another fifty years it continued to be a system of some influence. When one examines the history of animal magnetism and its offshoots, it seems incredible that this once powerful system is now almost completely forgotten. That animal magnetism is no longer practiced is hardly surprising. The theory of animal magnetism in its original form would be difficult for most moderns to accept. What is puzzling is that the story of animal magnetism is so neglected. Animal magnetism is not comparable to certain medical fads which flourished for a time and then died out. Such crazes did not significantly shape medical or psychological theory and practice, nor did they significantly affect the evolution of those disciplines. Animal magnetism, on the other hand, had a profound impact on medicine, psychology, and psychical research (today called parapsychology), as a brief examination of its history will show. Franz Anton Mesmer and Animal Magnetism The seeds of thought that gave birth to animal magnetism may be found in Mesmer's thesis Dissertatio physico-medica de planetarum influxu of 1766, which he wrote for a doctorate in medicine at the University of Vienna. In this treatise Mesmer developed the notion of \"animal gravitation,\" a force which he considered to be both the cause of universal gravitation and the foundation for all bodily properties, and which he believed to affect organisms in the most intimate way. Mesmer believed that animal gravitation connected living things to the stars and was the basis for healthy functioning, since it harmonized the body in a fashion comparable to the tuning of a musical instrument. Mesmer's interest in invisible forces found concrete expression in his early medical practice, where he experimented with using iron magnets to treat illness. Spurred on by success, Mesmer enthusiastically turned his attention to revising his theory of \"animal gravitation.\" Retaining his central idea of a universal force that is the foundation for health and disease, he renamed that force \"animal magnetism,\" finding it to possess many of the characteristics associated with mineral magnetism. The more Mesmer experimented, the more he became disenchanted with using iron magnets to heal. He came to believe that the physician himself is a magnet of a very special kind, capable of channeling the invisible \"magnetic fluid\" that pervades the universe into the body of the sick person and bringing about the magnetic balance necessary for a cure. The basic principles of Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism were articulated in twenty-seven propositions in his M\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9couverte du magn\u00e9tisme animal of 1779. Among the more informative are the following: 1) There exists a mutual influence between the celestial bodies, the earth and animate bodies; 2) The means of this influence is a fluid that is universally distributed and continuous . . . and which, by its nature, is capable of receiving, propagating and communicating all impressions of movement; 3) This reciprocal action is governed by mechanical laws as yet unknown. . . .; . . . 8) The animal body experiences the alternative effects of this agent which insinuates them into the nerves and affects them immediately; 9) It particularly manifests itself in the human body by properties analogous to the magnet. . . .; 10) Because the property of the animal body which makes it susceptible to the influence of heavenly bodies and to the reciprocal action of those around it is analogous to that of the magnet, I decided to call it \"animal magnetism.\" . . .; . . . 23) The facts will show, following the practical rules that I will establish, that this principle can heal disorders of the nerves immediately, and other disorders mediately. Mesmer eventually discontinued the use of iron magnets entirely, relying instead on the application of newly evolved animal-magnetic techniques. These techniques involved \"magnetic passes\" or sweeping movements of the hands to direct magnetic fluid to diseased parts of the patient's body. Using these methods, Mesmer performed some remarkable, if controversial, cures in Austria and Germany and attempted to gain acceptance for his theory of animal magnetism from the medical establishment of Vienna. He was not successful in this endeavor and in 1778 decided to go to Paris, where, he believed, new ideas were more favorably considered. In Paris, Mesmer set up two treatment clinics, one for the rich and the other for the poor. The sick flocked to him and he treated them by the hundreds over the next few years. During that time there were many among both rich and poor who testified to being cured by animal magnetism, in some cases of long-term chronic illnesses. During this period, Mesmer made attempts to get the medical establishment of Paris to approve his theory of animal magnetism, but try as he might, he could not gain a sympathetic hearing. On the contrary, the medical faculty at Paris became alarmed at the popularity of Mesmer's clinics and moved to suppress them. In 1784 two commissions were constituted to investigate animal magnetism, both appointed by the king of France. One was made up of members of the Royal Academy of Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine; it included some of the country's most eminent scientists and functioned under the chairmanship of Benjamin Franklin (1700-1790), then the American ambassador to France. The second commission was composed of physicians of the Royal Society of Medicine. The resulting investigations were carried out in the face of Mesmer's objections and without his cooperation. Both commissions filed reports unfavorable to animal magnetism, although a member of the second commission wrote a dissenting opinion recommending further investigation. The first commission also drew up a secret report for the king on potential dangers to morals through the misuse of magnetic techniques. The publication of the reports in 1784 was followed by a flood of treatises in response, many written by physicians. Some supported the conclusions of the commissions; others were strongly critical. In the latter category were the protests of dozens of medical practitioners who had themselves been using animal magnetism, in their opinion very successfully. They criticized the commissioners for both their attitude and the technique of investigation. Meanwhile Mesmer had become embroiled in a controversy about how his theory and technique were to be taught. Mesmer desired to secure his financial condition by charging a fee to those who wanted to be trained in animal magnetism. A scheme was worked out on Mesmer's behalf by a banker, Guillaume Kornmann (b. ca. 1740) and a lawyer and freethinker, Nicholas Bergasse (1750-1832). It involved the founding of Societies of Harmony\u2014which were to be considered the official organs for teaching animal magnetism, membership in the Society being gained through the subscription of a considerable sum of money. From the parent Society of Harmony in Paris, dozens more were established throughout France. Mesmer and Bergasse, who had become the chief spokesman of the Society of Harmony in Paris, eventually had a falling out and a split resulted. Mesmer grew more and more disillusioned with Paris and undertook a series of trips away from that city. Eventually, he settled in Germany and lived in comparative seclusion. Although he continued periodically to write on animal magnetism after 1790, he was not very actively involved in its affairs. In 1812, the Berlin Academy of Science, surprised to discover that Mesmer was still alive, sent Karl Christian Wolfart (1778-1832) to find out about animal magnetism directly from its discoverer. Wolfart remained with Mesmer for two years, putting together what would be the master's last treatise on animal magnetism. It was published under the title Mesmerismus. Oder System der Wechselwirkungen in 1814. Mesmer died in 1815. Magnetic Sleep Although Mesmer's personal fortunes and fame waned after 1790, animal magnetism (also called \"mesmerism\") flourished. This was due in no small part to the work of the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur (1751-1825), one of Mesmer's most loyal and enthusiastic pupils. Puys\u00e9gur discovered that some individuals fell into a kind of trance when animal magnetism was applied to them. Although appearing to be asleep, they were still conscious and could reply to questions and convey information. In this state of \"magnetic sleep,\" as Puys\u00e9gur called it, the patient was very suggestible, taking for reality any fantasy the magnetizer might depict. Upon awakening from magnetic sleep, the patient would remember nothing that had taken place while asleep. Puys\u00e9gur was fascinated by this unusual state of consciousness, so different from ordinary waking consciousness. He discovered that many in this state could apparently diagnose their own illnesses and those of others, and even prescribe effective remedies for the conditions they perceived. He also noticed that although magnetized subjects had no memory in the waking state for occurrences in the state of magnetic sleep, they did retain a continuous memory from sleep state to sleep state. Noting these two separate chains of memory that accompanied the two distinct states of consciousness, Puys\u00e9gur came to view magnetic sleep and the waking state as \"two different existences.\" From this seed, the notion of a seemingly separate mind or self operating covertly within the human psyche took root. It came to fruition some one hundred years later with the work of Pierre Janet and his concept of the \"subconscious,\" as described below. Puys\u00e9gur noted the similarity between \"magnetic sleep\" and the natural phenomenon of \"sleepwalking\" or \"somnambulism,\" the only difference between the two states being that in magnetic sleep the subject is in a special connection or \"rapport\" with the magnetizer, whereas in sleepwalking the sleeper is in rapport with no one. Because of the similarity, Puys\u00e9gur called the newly discovered state \"magnetic somnambulism.\" Another term that eventually came into use was \"artificial somnambulism.\" Hypnotism Puys\u00e9gur's work had a powerful influence on the practitioners of animal magnetism. Mesmer, working from a markedly mechanistic model of the human organism, had emphasized the physical action involved in magnetic healing. Puys\u00e9gur's orientation was much more psychological. From his experiments with magnetic sleep, he developed the rudiments of a psychotherapy based upon the investigation of somnambulistic consciousness. He evolved a theory of mental disturbance as a state of \"disorderly somnambulism\" in which the individual moves in and out of a condition of disturbed somnambulism in a chaotic manner. Puys\u00e9gur's psychological orientation is also demonstrated by the importance he placed on the role of human will when magnetizing and the need for the magnetizer to exercise \"good will\" in order to be effective. Although Puys\u00e9gur's views differed in these significant ways from those of Mesmer, he nevertheless retained Mesmer's notion of a \"magnetic fluid\" that passes between magnetizer and patient. Puys\u00e9gur became a very influential figure in the history of animal magnetism. His psychological concerns were taken up by many investigators and this eventually led to a new formulation of the theory of animal-magnetic phenomena. That formulation was first hinted at in the writings of the Abb\u00e9 Faria (1755-1819) and Alexandre Bertrand (1795-1831) and reached its culmination in the work of the Manchester physician James Braid (1795-1860). In 1842 Braid coined to replace \"animal magnetism,\" intending to do away with any notion of a physical agent such as \"magnetic fluid\" that passes between magnetizer and subject and produces the phenomena of somnambulism. Braid described hypnotism as a psycho-physiological state that needs no operator and can be self-induced. He also emphasized the role of suggestion both in producing the hypnotic state and in bringing about the healing effects associated with it. Eventually Braid's view became the dominant one and his terminology the accepted nomenclature. This took some time, however, and animal magnetism in its traditional form remained a force to be reckoned with for another sixty years. Three Streams Flowing from Animal Magnetism It is possible to trace three distinct currents of thought flowing directly from the discovery of animal magnetism. These three streams may be identified as 1) psychological, 2) medical, and 3) parapsychological. Psychological Stream The most important of these three currents, from an historical point of view, is the psychological stream. Justly it can be said that Mesmer's discovery of animal magnetism was a pivotal moment in the evolution of modern psychology and psychotherapy. It led to Puys\u00e9gur's investigation of the consciousness manifested in magnetic sleep and the eventual discovery of a subconscious realm of mental activity. It also led to Braid's teaching about hypnotism as a psychological phenomenon and the resulting exploration of the psychotherapeutic power of suggestion. The magnetic tradition of Puys\u00e9gur and the hypnotic tradition of Braid were both very much in evidence in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in experimentation with somnambulism and its effects. Braid's writings were \"discovered\" in France around 1860, and by the 1870s and 1880s, men trained in psychological observation, such as Charles Richet (1850-1935), Henri Beaunis (1830-1921), and Joseph Delboeuf (1831-1896), began to become involved in work on hypnotic phenomena. In the 1860s, Ambroise Li\u00e9beault (1823-1901), a provincial physician, had undertaken some special observations of his own. He used hypnotism to treat the illnesses of some of his clients with great success. Li\u00e9beault believed that hypnotism was based on suggestion and that its healing effects were due to the power of suggestion. Hippolyte Bernheim (1840-1919), professor of medicine at Nancy, was impressed by Li\u00e9beault's results, and the two initiated what came to be called the Nancy school of hypnotism. Meanwhile, the highly respected neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) was developing his own ideas about the nature of hypnotism based on his work with hysterical patients at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital. Because Charcot worked from a more physicalist model of hypnotism, his ideas came into conflict with those of Li\u00e9beault and Bernheim. The resulting competition between the Nancy school and the school of the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re continued for many years, resulting in extremely valuable experimental studies of hypnotism, suggestion, and hysteria. Among the associates of Charcot, although not an adherent of his school, was Pierre Janet (1859-1947). Janet had a particular interest in hysteria and the automatisms associated with that condition. From his observations, he developed the notion of the \"subconscious,\" a realm of mental activity in which emotional disorders originate. His ground-breaking work in this area made possible the development of all modern psychotherapies that accept the reality of an unconscious realm of mental and emotional activity influencing ordinary human life. Janet's discoveries had a strong impact on the subsequent work of Max Dessoir (1867-1947), Morton Prince (1854-1929), Boris Sidis (1867-1923), and William James (1842-1910), among others. Multiple personality was one of the disorders that was most closely studied by Janet and others who were interested in fathoming the mechanism of the subconscious. It was considered to be a special form of hysteria in which somnambulistic consciousness had taken the form of well-defined, distinct personalities. Janet, Alfred Binet (1857-1911), Eug\u00e8ne Azam (1822-1899), and others pioneered work in this area and used their findings to throw light not only on hysterical disorders but also on the nature of hypnotic consciousness in the normal individual. These insights into the subconscious carried implications for possible treatment methods for the emotionally disturbed. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was influenced by these developments, and his earlier works clearly reflect the magnetic-hypnotic tradition with its gradual unveiling of an unconscious mental life. Medical Stream In its origins, animal magnetism was a healing system. It was based on a view of the human organism as a self-healing entity requiring the proper balance of a universal \"magnetic fluid\" that affects the ebb and flow of the life force. The techniques of animal magnetism were geared to restoring that balance in persons suffering from illness. Although Puys\u00e9gur's work diverted the attention of many magnetizers to psychological pursuits, there remained a powerful current of interest in the healing work Mesmer originally envisioned. In the literature it is not always easy to differentiate between those interested in the investigation of somnambulistic consciousness and those interested in magnetic healing, since more often than not practitioners were involved with both. However, the two concerns were distinguishable in practice. This is reflected by the fact that many of the thousands of books written on animal magnetism before 1925 have one section dealing with the treatment of disease and another dealing with somnambulistic phenomena. Puys\u00e9gur himself had pointed out that many individuals, when put into a state of magnetic sleep, would spontaneously diagnose their own illnesses and those of others. He also described instances in which the somnambulist prescribed treatment by specific medicines or medical procedures. He considered this to be one of the great benefits of magnetic sleep, claiming that somnambulists were almost always correct in their diagnosis and that their prescribed treatments were often successful. In 1826 there appeared a hefty treatise of nearly twelve hundred pages compiled by Simon Mialle (b. ca. 1790) entitled Expos\u00e9 par ordre alphab\u00e9tique des cures op\u00e9r\u00e9s en France par le magn\u00e9tisme animal. This work gives some idea of the vast extent of the tradition of magnetic healing in the decades following Mesmer. Here Mialle details cases of cure through the application of animal magnetism between 1774 and 1826. In each case there is a description of the disease treated, the animal-magnetic procedure employed, and the results produced. Each instance is documented by source, and the reader cannot help but be impressed by the sheer volume of work of this kind being done in those early years. The healing tradition of animal magnetism continued well beyond the year 1826, extending even into the twentieth century. After 1880, books on animal-magnetic healing often incorporated chapters on healing by suggestion, taking a page from the successful medical use of hypnotism by Li\u00e9beault and his followers. Besides healing, another medical use of animal magnetism was as an anesthetic for surgery. The first well-documented surgical operation on an individual in a state of magnetic somnambulism was performed in Paris on April 16, 1829. The mesmerist was Pierre Jean Chapelain and the surgeon was Jules Cloquet (1790-1883), later famous for his works on anatomy. The surgery was for the removal of a cancerous breast from a sixty-four-year-old woman, a Madame Plantin. The earliest use of animal magnetism as an anesthetic in the United States seems to have been a painless tooth extraction performed by the mesmerist Bugard in 1836. It seems that this new use of animal magnetism did not really come into its own until the early 1840s. In 1842 a Dr. Ward successfully performed the amputation of a leg at the thigh upon a mesmerized patient in London. His influential colleague, John Elliotson (1791-1868), immediately took up the cause for this medical use of animal magnetism, and in India James Esdaile (1808-1859), carried out dozens of serious operations on magnetized patients in the mid-1840s. At about the same time a series of surgical operations were performed under Dr. Loisel in Cherbourg, France. All this promising activity involving animal magnetism as an anesthetic soon faded, however, with the introduction in Britain of ether as an analgesic in 1847. Although animal magnetism or hypnotism did not become widely used as an anesthetic, some surgical operations under its agency continued to be performed long after chemicals were well established in that role. In fact, the rise of interest in hypnotism in France around 1860 was strongly associated with its successful use in surgery. Parapsychological Stream: Psychical Research Psychical research, the scientific study of the paranormal, may be said to have had its official beginning in 1882 with the establishment of the Society for Psychical Research in Britain. Psychical research was the direct result of certain developments arising from animal magnetism. These were: 1) the occult medico-philosophical tradition in Germany that adopted animal-magnetic theory; 2) the development of \"magnetic magic\" in France; and 3) the rise of spiritualism in the United States. In Germany animal magnetism developed a strong early following among those influenced by romantic philosophy, so prominent at the end of the eighteenth century. Literary men such as Jean Paul Richter (1763-1825) and E.T.A. Hoffman Heinrich Jung-Stilling (1740-1817) are examples of thinkers who found the notion of a universal magnetic agent that connected all beings and was the source of life and health a most congenial concept. The spiritual philosophy of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) had made inroads of its own in late eighteenth-century Germany; magnetic somnambulists began to have Swedenborgian style visions, communicating with the world of spirits in mesmeric ecstasy. Paranormal-type phenomena, such as clairvoyance and precognition, were common in these circles, astounding the curious observer. While there were many who were content to account for these marvels through a romantic, occult-oriented philosophy, some felt the need for a more scientific approach that could examine the facts systematically and evaluate their credibility, a need that would not be met until the rise of psychical research in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The French developed their own particular melding of animal magnetism and occult tradition. The most influential magnetizer of this kind was the Baron Du Potet De Sennevoy (1796-1881). He developed a system called \"magnetic magic\" that revised animal magnetism's traditional doctrine of a universal magnetic fluid by incorporating it within the older notion of a universal spiritual power, which serves as the basis for \"natural magic.\" This concept, so different from the mechanical view of Mesmer's, considered magnetism to be the bond between spirit and matter, or body and soul. In Du Potet's view, mesmerizers who recognized the true nature of magnetism could work \"magic,\" producing marvelous cures and various paranormal phenomena. Animal magnetism began making significant inroads in the United States from the mid-1830s on. Lectures by Charles Poyen St. Sauveur (d. 1844) on animal magnetism excited the imagination of the country and led to the emergence of magnetic practitioners of a peculiarly American type. Itinerant magnetizers wandered the countryside with professional somnambulists at their sides, stopping in the local towns to give medical clairvoyant readings. For a fee, the somnambulist would diagnose an illness and prescribe remedies. The visionary Andrew Jackson Davis (1826-1910) began his career as such an itinerant somnambulist and eventually became an author of great popularity, using the magnetic trance to dictate his spiritual treatises. All this magnetic activity prepared the way for the rise of Spiritualism, initiated by \"spirit rapping\" in the home of John Fox in 1848. This spirit activity centered on the daughters of the household, and news of the purportedly paranormal activity of the Fox sisters spread rapidly throughout the United States, reaching England, France, and Germany within a few years. Spiritualist \"mediums\" appeared who claimed to be able to communicate with the departed on the \"other side.\" Typically, the medium would go into a self-induced trance and produce paranormal phenomena of the mental or psychic type (clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, etc.) or the physical type (levitation of objects, materialization of forms, production of mysterious lights, etc.). When Spiritualism spread to England in the early 1850s, it found a very receptive home. Within a few years spiritualistic mediums could be found in great abundance throughout the country. Spiritualist churches were established; spiritualist alliances were formed; and spiritualist books and newspapers came into print. There was such a proliferation of apparently paranormal spiritualistic phenomena that serious-minded people voiced the need for a careful scientific investigation to discover whether these things were real or illusory. The successful spread of Spiritualism was to a large extent due to the popularity of a fad that grew out of spiritualistic circles and emigrated to Great Britain and Europe in 1853. This was the practice of \"table tipping,\" \"table turning,\" or \"table tapping,\" as it was commonly called. A group of people would gather around the parlour table, rest their hands in a circle on its surface, and wait for spontaneous movement to occur. Sometimes the table would rotate; at other times it would rise and fall on one side, tapping a leg on the floor. The tapping would be read as an alphabetical code, and a message would be deciphered. Many explained the phenomenon in terms of the action of spirits of the dead communicating with the living; others attributed the movements and messages to the action of animal magnetic fluid emanating from the participants; still others believed the participants were simply deluding themselves, the movement being produced by their own unconscious physical exertions. In Germany, France, England, and the United States, the association between magnetic somnambulism and paranormal phenomena of the spiritualistic type was very strong. Many of the books and articles that appeared wove their way back and forth between the two areas, giving the impression that it was impossible to discuss one without dealing with the other. It is not surprising, then, that when the Society for Psychical Research was formed in England in 1882, it undertook to investigate not only the validity of spiritualistic phenomena, but also the nature of animal magnetism and hypnotism. In the thirty years preceding the foundation of the Society for Psychical Research, there had been a number of notable attempts to investigate the phenomena of Spiritualism scientifically. Some were carried out by scientists, others by individuals untrained in the procedures of systematic investigation. The results were uneven and inconclusive. So when a group of academics, most of them associated with Cambridge, decided to set up a society that would undertake a study employing stringent scientific criteria, there was enthusiasm for the idea both from intellectuals and the Spiritualists themselves. The Society was fortunate to have the nearly full-time involvement of a number of highly gifted investigators and within a few years began publishing its Proceedings and a journal. This activity generated a great many similar studies of the paranormal by some of the brightest minds of the day. The result was the publication of a mass of material on psychical research that continued well into the twentieth century. Conclusion The three streams flowing from the discovery of animal magnetism often merged. Writers in the psychological stream such as William James and Charles Richet sometimes dealt with issues of psychical research. On the other hand, the literature of psychical research was rich in psychological writings of real significance. An example of this is F. W. H. Myers's (1843-1901) classical work, Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (1903), which is generally considered to be a significant contribution to the investigation of the subconscious. The crossover among the three streams is also illustrated by the fact that both those interested in the psychological stream and those drawn to psychical research often investigated the healing and medical aspect of animal magnetism. Among the former, for example, were Hippolyte Bernheim, Jean-Martin Charcot, and Pierre Janet, who explored the relationship between the healing effects of animal magnetism and psychological factors, such as suggestion; among the latter were the members of the Society for Psychical Research whose studies focused on the nature of magnetic healing. The histories of animal magnetism, hypnotism, and psychical research are inextricably intertwined. As will be evident from the annotated entries in the bibliography, the literature of any one of these areas cannot but include the literature of the other two. Format of the Bibliography This bibliography is intended to include the literature of animal magnetism and those streams of thought that can be identified as flowing directly from it. Conceived in the broadest possible terms, that literature is vast, far exceeding the scope of this work. This bibliography has been consciously circumscribed for two reasons. The first is the desire to include only those works that are immediately connected with animal magnetism and the themes that arise directly from it. The second is the intention to produce a work focused on the most significant writings within the historical tradition arising from animal magnetism. The effect of including only those works that are closely connected with the themes arising from animal magnetism is most easily illustrated by describing the categories of literature that have not been included. Omitted are works that deal exclusively with occultism, possession, or witchcraft; theosophy, anthroposophy, Christian Science, or other spiritual philosophies; theology or religious thought; and conjuring or stage magic. While spiritualist writings have true importance for the history of animal magnetism and its offshoots, only those works have been included here that depict its development from mesmeric influences or that play a significant role in the rise of psychical research. This means that the bibliography does not include stories about clairvoyants, seers, or prophets; books relating communications from spirits; spiritualistic speculations about the afterlife or related matters; and collections of ghost-lore. The second reason for circumscribing the bibliography, the wish to focus on the most significant writings arising within the animal magnetic tradition, necessitated the omission of works which, while legitimately part of the history of animal magnetism and its offshoots, are relatively minor. While it is difficult to define the criteria by which such a selection was made, a few words can be said about the thinking that was involved. Rating low on the list of works to be included were writings that simply summarize the work of others, collections of cases that have been dealt with in previous works, and popularizations intended to simplify and condense more serious treatises. In the field of hypnotism, this tended to exclude books on stage hypnotism, handbooks of hypnotic practice, pamphlets meant for home study of hypnotism, treatises on personal magnetism, and writings on auto-hypnosis and auto-suggestion. There are, of course, some works in these categories that were influential or otherwise significant, and they have been incorporated as appropriate into the bibliography. Time Frame The bibliography begins with the year 1766, the date of publication of Mesmer's medical thesis Dissertano physico-medica de planetarum influxu, which contains the first seeds of animal magnetism. The bibliography ends with the year 1925. This date was chosen for a number of reasons. First, by 1925 publication of works on animal magnetism had almost completely ceased. Second, shortly after 1925 the study of hypnotism entered a new phase, in which researchers such as Clark Hull, M. M. White, and others adopted innovative laboratory and statistical methods to explore its nature and effects. Third, by 1925 most of the classical works of psychical research had been published, and psychical research too was about to enter a new stage of development. Like that of hypnotism, this new stage, initiated by the work of Joseph Banks Rhine at Duke University in the late 1920s, involved the introduction of laboratory and statistical methods into the study of paranormal phenomena. Indeed, what had been \"psychical research\" became popularly referred to as \"parapsychology.\" Annotations Annotations are intended to provide information about the content of the work and thereby indicate its place in the history of the field. The length of the annotation depends to some extent upon the significance of the entry in that history. In some cases, due to inaccessibility of a given work, annotations were compiled without benefit of direct inspection. Annotations are given for approximately one-third of the entries. The intention is to provide annotations for the most important items and a sufficient variety of less significant works to convey to the reader a sense of the evolution of the literature. Form of the Entries Entries are listed by year, from 1766 to 1925. Within each year, works are listed alphabetically. Each entry contains full bibliographic information, including author, title and publication data. Many entries contain annotations. Publication information is given in English: cities are cited in their commonly accepted English form (e.g., \"Munich\" rather than \"M\u00fcnchen,\" and \"Rome\" rather than \"Roma\"); multiple publishers are joined by English conjunctives (e.g., \"Bailli\u00e9re and Dentu\" rather than \"Bailli\u00e9re et \"The Author\" is used instead of \"chez l'Auteur.\" Included with every item is the designation [H] or [P], and in some instances [H & P.] These initials stand for Hypnotism, Psychical Research, and both. Every effort has been made to provide information about the first edition of each book. In the few cases in which that could not be obtained, information about a later edition is given.

The first published writing of Franz Anton Mesmer is a dissertation presented to the University of Vienna medical school for the degree of doctor of medicine. While the title page of the dissertation carries the initials of a doctorate in liberal arts and philosophy after Mesmer's name, there is a serious doubt that this degree was ever conferred. Although there is no record of what Mesmer studied in the years from 1755 to 1759, the rest of his education is known, and there is little reason to think he attained a degree during that hiatus. Mesmer came to Vienna in 1759 to study at the university. After one year in law, he began a six-year program in the medical school, finishing with this dissertation. At the very beginning of the thesis Mesmer states that he is attempting to continue the work of Richard Mead (1673-1754) who wrote about the influence of the stars on men. Mesmer emphasizes that he is not talking about an astrological understanding of that influence, but a purely physical, scientific one. After a general discussion of the laws of planetary motion, centrifugal force, and gravitation, he writes of his notion that there must be tides in the atmosphere just as there are in the ocean. Frank Pattie of the University of Kentucky, in his study of the influence of Mead on Mesmer, points out that this idea is central in Mead's De imperio solis ac lunae (1704), and that Mesmer sometimes reproduces Mead's own words on the matter, only slightly altered, without giving him credit. Mesmer then presents his own original ideas. He says that just as there are tides in the sea and the atmosphere, so also there are tides in the human body. There is, he asserts, a universal gravitation by which our bodies are affected. Through this influence emanating from the stars, our bodies are caused to resonate in a harmonious fashion. This fact, says Mesmer, must be taken seriously by medical practitioners, for if human bodies are violently shaken by the action of celestial bodies, then understanding the nature of that influence is of utmost importance. This generalized influence is labeled by Mesmer \"animal gravitation.\" Some years later, this concept will reappear, somewhat modified by his experience with magnets, third writing. Apparently the treatise first appeared in a Viennese periodical and then as a separate pamphlet. Now it can only be found in the Sammlung der neuesten gedruckten und geschriebenen Nachrichten (see entry number [9](#e9)). It is a response to an article of Maximillian Hell, an expert on the construction of magnets, who wrote an article critical of Mesmer's Schreiben \u00fcber die Magnetcur (entry number [5](#e5)). Hell claimed that the cures ascribed by Mesmer to animal magnetism were really due to the action of magnets. In his response, Mesmer not only reasserts that animal magnetism was the cause, he also denies that magnets are of any use in treating illness. [H] 4. [Mesmer, Franz Anton.](#Mesmer.F) Herrn N.p., n.p., 1775. A letter on magnetism addressed to the inhabitants of Frankfort. It can be found today only in the Sammlung der neuesten gedruckten \"Letter from M. Mesmer, Doctor of Medicine at Vienna to A. M. Unzer, Doctor of Medicine, on the Medicinal Usage of the Magnet,\" in Mesmerism. Translated and edited by George Bloch. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, 1980. Written on January 5, 1775, to Doctor Johann Christoph Unzer of Altona, this treatise appeared as a pamphlet and was then immediately published in the Neuer gelehrter Mercurius (edited by Unzer). In this attempt to explain his theory of cure through magnetism, Mesmer first uses the term \"animal magnetism\" in print. This term he now equates with the \"animal gravitation\" of his Dissertation (see entry number [1](#e1)). He distinguishes animal magnetism from mineral magnetism, but at the same time shows the analogy between the two. Mesmer points out that the animal magnetic fluid penetrates everything and can be stored up and concentrated, like \"electric fluid.\" Like mineral magnetism, animal magnetism can operate at a distance. An edition of this work published in 1776 has an important addition: a section titled Anhang von einigen Briefen und Nachrichten. This appendix contains excerpts from letters describing cures performed by Mesmer and ascribed to animal magnetism. [H] Mesmer's work, Unzer, a physician and editor of the periodical Neuer gelehrter Mercurius, experimented with magnets in the treatment of his own patients. The results were good, and he wrote this favorable opinion of the medical use of magnets. [H] 1776 7. [Klinkosch, Joseph alleged cures through exorcism performed by Gassner and those carried out by Mesmer using animal magnetism in the same category. He considered them to be false and delusory and argued that if any such cures occurred, it must be through electricity rather than magnetism. [H] 1778 8. (1778?). small treatise found today only in L'antimagn\u00e9tisme by Paulet (see entry number [94](#e94)). There are questions about both authorship and date. Amadou believes it a genuine piece by Mesmer, while Frank Pattie has his doubts. There is no date given by Paulet who took his version from the Recueil des effets salutaires de l'aimant (see entry number [22](#e22)). Amadou places the treatise somewhere between Mesmer's controversy with Hell and the publication of his M\u00e9moire (see entry number [10](#e10)). In the treatise, Mesmer describes how he first became aware of a \"magnetic quality\" in his own person that had effects upon the bodies of the sick, analogous to that produced by mineral magnetism. [H] 9. [Mesmer, Franz 194 pp. A collection of journal articles and polemical pamphlets written by Mesmer, Hell and others about the nature and efficacy of magnetic healing. For some of those writings this is the only remaining source. Mesmer himself acknowledged the accuracy of the reproductions in this collection. [H] 1779 10. [Mesmer, Franz Anton.](#Mesmer.F) M\u00e9moire vi + 85 pp. on the Discovery of Animal Magnetism,\" in Mesmerism. Translated and edited by George Bloch. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, 1980. A foundational work in the history of modern psychology. In this, Mesmer's first and most influential public presentation of his theory of animal magnetism, he describes the context of his discovery of animal magnetism, depicts the first cures performed through its application, and sets forth twenty-seven propositions which delineate its nature and effects. Having experimented with iron magnets to treat illnesses, Mesmer came to the conclusion that the human body itself is a magnet and that the physician, using his own body magnetically, can produce the most effective cures. To promote his discovery, Mesmer moved in 1778 to Paris, which was the intellectual center of the Europe of his day. His Parisian clinic claimed many remarkable cures. This dramatic success and the M\u00e9moire of 1779 caused his fame to spread quickly throughout France. Mesmer considered himself above all a physician and a scientist. In the foreword to the M\u00e9moire, he states his basic belief that \"nature affords a universal means of healing and preserving men,\" and throughout the text he emphasizes his conviction that he has discovered a natural principle whose laws would eventually be revealed by critical observation of the facts. According to Mesmer, there exists in nature a universal agent which, through as yet unknown laws, produces a mutual influence among the heavenly bodies, the earth, and living things. When this agent is observed operating in living organisms, it is seen to have properties of attraction similar to those of the magnet, even exhibiting polarity. Because of this similarity to mineral magnetism, Mesmer names this universal agent \"animal magnetism.\" He claims that it acts upon the nerves of living things and that its discovery makes available a powerful means of curing illness and preserving health. Animal magnetism operates in the organism by means of an extremely fine \"fluid\" (the term common among scientists of the time to denote any subtle substance or influence), which Mesmer calls \"magnetic fluid.\" Cure of disease is brought about by the direct intervention of the physician himself. He uses the magnetic power of his own body to influence the ebb and flow of magnetic fluid in that of his patient, restoring the natural balance of animal magnetic currents and thus aiding nature in the cure of disease. Mesmer states that in this way animal magnetism can cure nervous disorders directly and other disorders indirectly. Although Mesmer lived and wrote until 1815, he never significantly altered the outline of his theory as it is presented in the M\u00e9moire of 1779. It contains all the basic principles which were to be applied to treatment of the sick by \"magnetizers\" for decades to come. [H] 1780 18 septembre 1780. was physician to the Comte d'Artois, the regent of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris. Mesmer's first important associate in Paris, D'Eslon was educated by him in the theory and practice of animal magnetism. This well-constructed explanation and defence of animal magnetism was directed by D'Eslon to his medical colleagues in Paris. It resulted in their demand that he give up his involvement with the practice of animal magnetism. It can be found in Mesmer's Pr\u00e9cis and Paris: Didot, 1780, (4) + 151 pp. Because of his standing in the medical world, D'Eslon gave Mesmer credibility among the intelligentsia of Paris. This book was his major opus on animal magnetism in which he describes his first exposure to animal magnetism and how he became convinced of its efficacy. He adheres to all of Mesmer's teachings about the nature of the phenomenon, although he does not emphasize the doctrine of a magnetic fluid. D'Eslon stresses the importance of the fact that animal magnetism is effective as a treatment for illness. He knew this from his own experience, having been cured by Mesmer of a life-long ailment. Showing little concern about the niceties of theory, D'Eslon's appreciation of the practical efficacy of animal magnetism marks him as a sincere promoter of what he thought to be a great benefit to mankind.

In this booklet he criticizes the animal magnetic fluid of Mesmer, claiming it is simply an electro-magnetic influence. [H] 14. Jean pp. Paulet, a botanist and physician who was strongly opposed to animal magnetism, was editor of the Gazette de Sant\u00e9. This pamphlet is a reprint of two book reviews from that journal: the first, a review of D'Eslon's Observations sur le magn\u00e9tisme animal (entry number [12](#e12)); the second, a review of Horne's R\u00e9ponses d'un m\u00e9decin de province (entry number [13](#e13)).

The original outline was later destroyed and the German version of this work published in 1783 was a translation from the French edition. The translator and editor was apparently D'Eslon. The work attempts to give a history of animal magnetism to date by reproducing and commenting on important relevant documents. The history of animal magnetism is divided into five time periods: 1) dealings with the Faculty of Medicine at Vienna, 2) dealings with the Academy of Sciences at Paris, 3) dealings with the Royal Society of Medicine at Paris, 4) various activities in the two years following, and 5) dealings with the Faculty of Medicine at Paris. Mesmer uses the documentation format to reiterate his views and emphasize his side in the various disputes in which he had been involved. [H] 18.

The similarities between these ideas of Thouvenel and those of Mesmer are, however, striking. [H] 1782 [Bourzeis, P. F.

London and Aix-la-Chapelle: n.p., 15 pp. This letter was addressed by Mesmer to the dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris and written to protest D'Eslon's claim to be in possession of Mesmer's teaching. According to Mesmer, D'Eslon said that Mesmer would not be returning to Paris and for that reason the informal investigation of animal magnetism being conducted by the Faculty should examine his (D'Eslon's) work. Mesmer objects, saying that D'Eslon cannot possibly claim to present a complete picture of the theory and practice of animal magnetism. [H] 24. [Puys\u00e9gur, Antoine Hyacinte C** de de [Retz, M. the King of France, rejects the theory of animal magnetism. However, he does admit that cures have been brought about through its application. His explanation is that the cures were accomplished through \"imagination.\" [H] 26. [Thouret, Michel Augustin](#Thouret.M) and [Andry, sur de monsieur, 1782, 168 pp. This work is an extract from the M\u00e9moires of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 royale de m\u00e9decine for the year 1779. The authors describe the medical uses of magnets, beginning with a history of the subject. They then take up contemporary practitioners who use magnets to heal, including Franz Anton Mesmer. They concentrate on Mesmer's use of the mineral magnet, but they note his M\u00e9moire of 1779 in their footnote and refer to his original \"discoveries.\" Generally, the authors convey a positive attitude towards Mesmer's work. In 1784, however, Thouret revised his view, becoming very critical of animal magnetism in his Recherches et doutes (1784, sur aimons Le lu n.p., 1783, 15 pp. This pamphlet consists of a letter from Mesmer to a Doctor Philip (1782) with comments added by [H] 47 pp. Court de G\u00e9belin was one of the most highly respected intellectuals of his day. His monumental nine-volume Monde primitif (1773-1784) was a virtual encyclopedia of studies in comparative linguistics. In this letter he tells of how he was cured of a serious illness by Mesmer's animal magnetism. He passionately appeals for a serious study of that system and indicates the directions that study might take. Court de G\u00e9belin had long sought to unearth the outlines of a primitive science present in the great cultures of the west. In animal magnetism he believed he had discovered the true basis for that science. [H] 1784 30. [Bailly, Jean l'examen du magn\u00e9tisme animal. Lu \u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, par M.

Paris: Imprimerie Royale, 1784, 15 pp. Presented as a courtesy to the members of the Academy of Sciences which had been commissioned by the king to investigate animal magnetism. This brief report was intended to give them an account of some of the experiences which the commissioners had during their investigation. It is considerably shorter than the official report (see entry number [31](#e31)). [H] 31. [Bailly, Jean Sylvain, Royale, 1784, 66 pp. In the spring of 1784 the King of France appointed this commission made up of members of the Academy of Sciences to investigate the claims of animal magnetism. He chose some of the most eminent men of science of his day. The chairman was Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), a founding father of the United States of America, ambassador of that country to France, and a person highly knowledgeable in electricity and terrestrial magnetism. The commission's president was Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743 -1794), a follower of Condillac and one of the most important chemists of the age. The secretary of the commission and editor of its report was the famous astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly (1736-1793). The commission also included the director of the Academy of Sciences, Jean Baptiste Leroy (1724-1800), an investigator of electricity of some note. The fifth member of the commission was the physician de Bory, about which nothing is known today. The commission began its investigations on March 12, 1784, and published its report in August of that year. Both this commission and one made up of members of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, appointed by the King at the same time, investigated animal magnetism as practiced by Charles D'Eslon, a disciple of Mesmer. D'Eslon wanted this official inquiry, while Mesmer strongly opposed it. By cooperating with the commissions, D'Eslon effectively removed himself from his teacher's fold. Although D'Eslon's theory of animal magnetism, as presented to the commission, was somewhat different from that of Mesmer, the commissioners did not seem to be bothered by that fact. They contended that theory made no difference to their mandate, which was to decide about the existence and utility of animal magnetism. Their conclusion was that they found no evidence for the existence of an animal magnetic fluid. They ascribed any cures or improvement of health that might occur through the application of animal magnetism to the action of \"imagination.\" The report was very influential and became a center of a vigorous controversy which raged for a number of years, with pamphlets and books being written for and against its conclusions.

A member of the mystical Lyons school of freemasons, he developed a philosophy of animal magnetism that viewed it as an aid to the healing and social evolution taking place according to hidden laws of nature. Dampierre delineates four different types of \"magnetic crisis\" that can be experienced by an individual suffering from illness. The first is the necessary and salutary crisis that an ill person may experience before magnetic treatment\u2014certain gestures and actions that demonstrate nature's attempt to heal. The second type of crisis is that produced by suggestive individuals, when being magnetized, through imitation and the action of imagination\u2014this being a useless and even harmful type of crisis. The third type is the crisis produced through fear upon seeing another person in the throes of a violent crisis\u2014this also being a harmful type of crisis. The fourth type of crisis is that produced by the action of animal magnetism in susceptible persons who have a strong desire to remain in the state of crisis\u2014this type being dangerous to the patient. Since none of these crises leads, with the possible exception of the first, to a fruitful conclusion, Dampierre and his colleagues at Lyons sought an alternate, positive healing crisis. Dampierre believed that the crises most often produced by animal magnetism as practiced by those who used the techniques of Mesmer were of the harmful type described. He considered these crises to be embarrassing and obscene for the patient and narcissistically flattering for the magnetizer. Dampierre's solution was the magnetic technique developed by his fellow Freemason at Lyons, the Chevalier Barberin. In contrast to that of Mesmer which relied on magnetic \"passes\" that involved physical contact, or were applied at the most a few inches from the body, the magnetizing of Barberin was done at a distance, sometimes a distance of miles. This approach could produce magnetic somnambulism with the attendant apparently paranormal phenomena first noted by the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur (q.v.). This Lyons brand of Freemason animal magnetism was as such strongly oriented towards the occult worldview of the magical tradition of the West. [H] 50.

[Duplicate of entry Devillers was a member of the very active lodge of Freemasons of Lyon. When its members took sides on the issue of animal magnetism in 1784, he supported the opposition. In this book he admits that some of the phenomena of animal magnetism are genuine, but denies that they are due to the action of Mesmer's magnetic fluid. He attempts to show that the power of imagination is sufficient explanation.

He stated his own views in this treatise. The commission had seen the demonstrations of animal magnetism given by D'Eslon and Lafisse (Mesmer having refused to take part in the investigation). He distinguished four different kinds of facts observed by the commissioners concerning animal magnetism: the first were those general positive effects about which it was not possible to come to any conclusions as to cause; the second were those which were negative, showing only the non-action of the alleged magnetic fluid; the third were effects, either positive or negative, which could be attributed to the work of the imagination; and the fourth were those positive effects that could only be explained through the action of some unknown agent. Jussieu concluded that although the existence of a magnetic fluid had not been proven, there were enough effects of the fourth kind to justify the continued use of animal magnetism and further investigations of the exact nature of those effects.

This commission was constituted at approximately the same time as a second commission (The Franklin Commission), also appointed by the king, made up of nine eminent scientists from the Academy of Sciences. The commission of the Royal Society of Medicine began its investigations on April 5, 1784. The findings of this commission condemned animal magnetism. Hampered by a lack of scientific method and a surfeit of theoretical dogmatism, however, its report proved to be far less significant than that of the Franklin commission. One of the members of the Royal Society's commission strongly disagreed with its published findings and wrote his own report (see Jussieu, entry number [72](#e72)). correspondance de Monsieur Pressavin 1784, (7) + 8-232 pp. A work of great significance for the history of modern psychology. Puys\u00e9gur was an artillery officer in the army, a colonel of the regiment of Strasbourg. A member of an old and distinguished family, he had inherited a large property in Buzancy near Soissons and spent most of his time there looking after his land and occasionally carrying out experiments with electricity. Having heard about animal magnetism and its marvelous curative powers, he went to Paris to learn from Mesmer. Returning to his estate at Buzancy, he began to use animal magnetism to alleviate the ills of local residents. Among the first he treated was a peasant named Victor Race who was suffering from a fever and congestion of the lungs. When applying the magnetic passes to the man, Puys\u00e9gur noticed that Victor had fallen asleep. This sleep was not, however, a normal one, for he could still communicate with Puys\u00e9gur. While in this state Victor showed himself to be extremely suggestible and even seemed, in Puys\u00e9gur's estimation, to be able to read his magnetizer's thoughts. When returning to his normal state of consciousness, Victor remembered nothing of what had happened. Puys\u00e9gur also noted that there seemed to be a specially close relationship between himself and Victor, a relationship that he would later (Suite de M\u00e9moires, entry number [148](#e148)) call an \"intimate rapport.\" He also was struck by the dramatic change in personality that Victor underwent between the state of magnetic sleep and his normal state: in the latter he was of rather ordinary or even slow wit, while in the former he became extremely bright, perceptive, and articulate. Puys\u00e9gur termed this newly discovered condition \"magnetic sleep\" and \"magnetic somnambulism,\" since he immediately noticed the similarity between this state and that of natural \"somnambulism\" or \"sleep-walking.\" Puys\u00e9gur went on to further investigate this state through experimentation with other patients. He noted that they all showed the same characteristics as the ones that Victor had demonstrated. His work with Victor and subsequent investigations are described in the M\u00e9moires. Puys\u00e9gur's discovery of artificial somnambulism started a whole new trend in the practice of animal magnetism, shifting the emphasis from the physical to the psychological. The alteration in consciousness between the state of magnetic sleep and the normal waking state, with its attendant amnesia, revealed, within human beings, a double or divided consciousness with two memory chains. This revelation opened up a new line of investigation that would eventually lead to the psychological concepts of the \"subconscious,\" the \"subliminal self,\" and the \"unconscious\" in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The second edition (1809) and the third and most complete edition (1820) are supplemented by the Suite de M\u00e9moires (entry number [148](#e148)) which further develops the discoveries of the M\u00e9moires. 106.

The Comte de Puys\u00e9gur, brother of the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur, was second in command of the Regiment of Languedoc when the occurrences described in this pamphlet took place. He had learned the techniques of animal magnetism and found occasion to use them at this posting. Here he mentions some sixty cures accomplished through animal magnetism. One of the most curious was that of a dog which had been injured by an angry soldier. The Comte de Puys\u00e9gur approached the animal, which seemed to be barely alive, and applied magnetic passes. The dog was restored to good health in the space of a few minutes. This seems to be the first example in the literature of animal magnetism of the application of magnetic healing to an animal.

In the M\u00e9moire Retz deals with the healing \"impostures\" that have been perpetrated over the ages. He mentions Gassner's exorcisms, the magnetic medicine of the seventeenth century, the \"powder of sympathy,\" and other \"impostures.\" Although the title seems to indicate the work is to be a defense of Mesmer, it in fact rejects animal magnetism as the latest of the \"impostures.\" This second edition seems to be the only one still extant.

[Salaville, Jean Baptiste.](#Salaville.J) Le moraliste mesm\u00e9rien ou Paris: Paris: Prault, 1784, (4) + 136 pp. Servan was a distinguished French lawyer and a correspondant of Voltaire and d'Alembert. He had been cured by a mesmerist when traditional medicine had failed to help him. In this treatise, Servan defends Mesmer's views on animal magnetism in the wake of the negative reports of the two commissions. He addresses some well-considered questions to the members of the commission of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de M\u00e9decine. These \"doubts\" question: why they expected quick cures through animal magnetism and dismissed its efficacy on the basis of brief trials; why they did not choose optimal conditions for success but arbitrarily set up conditions they preferred; and why with their limited experience they felt justified in drawing such far-reaching conclusions about the non-existence of animal magnetism. Servan's treatise is one of the most thoughtful contemporary criticisms of the findings of the commission. [H] 112.

[Thouret, Michel + (1) + 251 pp. Thouret was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine in Paris and one of the leading spokesmen of the opposition of that society to animal magnetism and the teachings of Mesmer. In this work Thouret claims that his main concern is not to examine the details of cures being performed by animal magnetism, but to trace the history of the theory and practice of animal magnetism. He nevertheless clearly sides with those who reject animal magnetism as an illusion. Admitting that many persons of stature accept animal magnetism as an effective cure, Thouret uses his considerable erudition to show that such cures are not new and that Mesmer was simply the most recent of a long tradition of thinkers who posited a hidden power of nature that produces healing effects. He cites Paracelsus, Kircher, Maxwell, and Fludd as examples of men who held views similar to those of Mesmer. He also points out that there have been many healers over the ages who have accomplished cures resembling Mesmer's, mentioning the exorcist Gassner and the \"stroking doctor\" Greatrakes as examples. Thouret's learned critique was extremely influential and served as a starting point for much of the discussion at the time about the originality and effectiveness of animal magnetism. [H] 117.

He points out that he has been charged by the king to investigate the mineral and medicinal waters of the realm. Once again Thouvenal brings in \"animal magnetism,\" which he defines as the flux and reflux to which the \"electrical matter\" in all living things is subject. As in the first M\u00e9moire, Thouvenel makes no mention of Mesmer and his own brand of animal magnetism, which by this time must have been known to him. [H] 118.

Recueillie et publi\u00e9e par \"magnetic somnambulism\" by Puys\u00e9gur in 1784, Fournel was the first person to attempt to theorize about the nature of this new phenomenon. He sees magnetic somnambulism as a state midway between waking and sleep, a state essentially the same as natural somnambulism, which had been widely recognized as a reality. Fournel points out that the seemingly extraordinary phenomena associated with magnetic somnambulism, such as suggestibility and clairvoyance, have been noted for centuries in connection with natural somnambulism. Speaking of the sudden rise to popularity of magnetic somnambulism, he estimates the number of somnambulists in Paris and the provinces to be in the neighborhood of six thousand. Fournel makes a strong case for accepting magnetic somnambulism as a genuine phenomenon which deserves further study. [H] 140.

It was published with the \"imprimatur\" of the Roman Catholic Church. Mullatera dedicates the book to Innocenzo Laneri, Professor of medicine at the University of Torino. He begins with something of an apology for writing a book on the subject of animal magnetism, a subject which is of questionable merit. He points out that some French commissions had already dismissed it as a matter of imagination. But since there are people in Italy, at Piedmont, who are nonetheless practicing it, something needs to be written in response. Mullatera examines the background of magnetic medicine in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe, pointing out the similarity between the teachings of Mesmer and those of Paracelsus, Van Helmont and Fludd. For his contemporary sources he uses principally the reports of the commissions (including that of Jussieu) and the propositions of Mesmer. He finds animal magnetism to be of no particular value as a method of cure and places it in the category of useless, fantastic medical treatments. [H] 146.

Here he further develops his notion of the importance of the \"will\" in the action of animal magnetism and presents more information about the phenomena of magnetic somnambulism.

P. J. Duplain, 1785, 39 [H] 108 pp. The first treatise to attempt to present a comprehensive theory of magnetic somnambulism. It was published in 1785 shortly after the essay of Fournel (see entry number [139](#e139)), which Tardy de Montravel knew and appreciated. Like Fournel, he notes that since its modest beginnings at Buzancy in the previous year, the phenomena of magnetic somnambulism could now be found in Paris, Strasbourg, and throughout all the provinces of France. Tardy de Montravel had observed many somnambulists, but he bases his newly formulated theory of magnetic somnambulism chiefly on experiments he conducted with a certain Mademoiselle N., the first person he seriously attempted to magnetize. He found that she seemed to possess certain extraordinary abilities already noted in magnetic somnambulists by Puys\u00e9gur and others. These qualities included the ability to diagnose her own illness and those of others and the ability to perceive clairvoyantly. He also states that his Mademoiselle N. could directly see the magnetic fluid and describe its colors. Tardy de Montravel believed the somnambulist could exercise these powers because of a \"sixth sense\" that is activated in the somnambulistic state. He held that this sixth sense proceeded from the stomach area and that somnambulists could see and hear with their stomachs. In this he anticipated the writings of Petetin who made the same discovery in his work with hysterics (see Petetin, M\u00e9moire, entry number [171](#e171)). Tardy de Montravel describes the connection between magnetizer and somnambulist as a \"harmonic rapport,\" and compares it to \"platonic love.\" He emphasizes, however, that the relationship between them is completely moral, and that, should the magnetizer attempt anything improper, the somnambulist would immediately awaken. This work is one of the most important and influential early writings on magnetic somnambulism, being cited in nearly all treatises on the subject written before 1800. [H] 153.

The notion of a physical magnetic fluid was de-emphasized and a more psychological\u2014even magical\u2014view of animal magnetic action took its place. The magnetic passes were made without touching the body and there was much emphasis placed on magnetizing at a distance\u2014even at very great distances. The importance of the will was emphasized, and the magnetizer was expected to be in tune with the patient in order sympathetically to diagnose and then heal the person. Barberin rejected as harmful the convulsive crisis so often connected with magnetic cures, placing importance on the gentle crisis, the magnetic somnambulism of Puys\u00e9gur. He also truly believed in the pronouncements of his magnetic somnambulists, both for their usefulness in the healing process and for their spiritual messages. [H] 159.

[[Villers, Charles de.]](#Villers.C) Le magn\u00e9tiseur 229 Villers a friend and aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur and was strongly influenced by Puys\u00e9gur's approach to animal magnetism. Villers was a member of the society of harmony of the Metz artillery regiment associated with that of the Marquis at Strasbourg. His highly philosophical theory of animal magnetism was clearly influenced by that of the Lyon school of the Chevalier de Barberin. This work is a novel, but is as much a theoretical treatise on animal magnetism as it is a work of fiction. An important writing in the history of animal magnetism and psychotherapy, it develops a definite psychology of the relationship between magnetizer and magnetized. The title has a significant nuance of meaning, referring both to the magnetizer-hero, Valcourt, who is in love with the daughter of the household in which the novel is set, and to the central theme of the book, which discusses the affection and \"cordiality\" that the magnetizer must exercise toward his patient if he wants to cure effectively. Villers does not seem to believe in the existence of a magnetic fluid\u2014at least he does not place any importance upon a physical agent in the action of animal magnetism. Rather he sees animal magnetism as the work of the soul, a spiritual entity, which makes use of the will to bring about the desired curative effects. Villers mentions two different kinds of suggestion at work in the relationship between magnetizer and patient: the first being a kind of \"identification\" that is established between their souls, and the second an \"inspiration\" that follows from expectations about the effects which are supposed to take place. Villers, more than any other writer of the age, emphasized the psychological interaction of the magnetic relationship and insisted that there must be a \"moral affection\" on the part of the magnetizer in order to heal. He believed that patients must put their trust in the magnetizer, opening themselves completely to his influence, and he in turn must exercise a familial benevolence towards them. This emphasis on the emotional interaction of successful magnetic treatment was an important step towards establishing principles of a magnetic psychotherapy which only much later (in the work of Li\u00e9beault, Janet, Brever, Freud, etc.) would come to fruition. This work has a curious publication history. Today only one copy of the first edition is extant. Villers had sent some copies to his friends, including the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur, but the rest were destroyed by the minister of police. In 1825 Puys\u00e9gur, presumably using the copy given him by Villers, decided to issue a new edition. As he states in his preface, he made some changes, but left the work principally intact. The new version was published in two-volume form (Paris: Dentu, (4) + 296; (4) + 281 pp.). However, Puys\u00e9gur, for some unknown reason (perhaps he feared the title could give animal magnetism a bad name), ordered this entire new edition to be destroyed. In any case the second edition is extremely rare. [H] 176. r\u00e9duit \u00e0 des de de et de m\u00e9decine. Dans lequel on d\u00e9montrera quelques unes de ses erreurs; on analysera 54 pp. W\u00fcrtz is a strong supporter of orthodox animal magnetism as taught by Mesmer. He compares Mesmer to Galileo and Harvey whose important discoveries were rejected by their contemporaries. W\u00fcrtz says that Mesmer, recognizing a power in nature noted by some of the ancients but not understood by them, was able to lift this healing technique out of the mire of superstition and into the realm of science. He criticizes the views of D'Eslon and the condemnation of the Franklin commission, stating that if a proper investigation had been made, Mesmer would have been vindicated. He then sets out a proposal for a course of study of animal magnetism, highlighted by an investigation of the physics, chemistry and metaphysics of magnetism. The proposed course would also deal with the practical application of animal magnetism to healing and with procedures to be used for different cases. W\u00fcrtz insists that, for the most effective use of magnetic healing, the practitioner must combine a grasp of these techniques with a knowledge of conventional medicine. Within this framework he suggests an examination of the effects of magnetic somnambulism, particularly questioning the accuracy of the medical pronouncements of somnambulists. In discussing this issue, W\u00fcrtz states that Mesmer knew of magnetic somnambulism in his practice and recognized the reality of a special sixth sense that can operate in a magnetized person, but Mesmer and his followers were very cautious about this faculty.

Soon after that, Bell met the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur and learned about magnetic somnambulism. Bell states that he then developed his own practice of animal magnetism, and it is from these experiences that he writes the present treatise. Bell finds magnetic somnambulism the most interesting aspect of animal magnetism because the phenomena it produces are so striking. He writes of the sixth sense that comes into play in the somnambulist and the rapport or \"analogy\" that exists between magnetist and magnetized. Bell's treatment of the subject is fairly thorough, a much more readable essay than his first endeavor in the field (see Animal Electricity and Magnetism, entry number [121](#e121)).

Acknowledging that more often than not animal magnetism has been a subject of ridicule, Meiners undertakes to present enough information about it to convince the reader that it is a respectable subject of inquiry. He concentrates on animal magnetism as a healing art and describes the method to be used in magnetizing and the marks that characterize the magnetized state, emphasizing that this state has a remarkable power to bring about healing in the physical organism. In the process of examining this healing power, Meiners describes in detail a number of interesting case Goschen, 1788, 106 pp. This treatise, better known in the French translation (Lettre \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9g\u00e9tique et philantropique de Stockholm . . .), was written by the author at the request of the Exegetic and Philanthropic Society of Stockholm. That society had issued a publication in the form of a letter entitled Lettre sur la seule explication satisfaisante . . . in the same year addressed to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des amis r\u00e9unis de Strasbourg, and had sent a copy to Rosenm\u00fcller. His comments are highly critical of the position taken by members of the Swedish society. He objects to the basically religious orientation of their explanation of the phenomena of animal magnetism, their belief that supernatural and spirit forces are at work. Rosenm\u00fcller believes that a purely natural explanation for the phenomena is sufficient and best. Where the society attributes all sickness to the action of evil spirits and all cure to the removal of those spirits, Rosenm\u00fcller says the modern physicians must look for natural and physical causes for ill health. This even-handed and well-written work is one of the best discussions of the problems of occult interpretations of magnetic phenomena to appear before 1800. [H] 186. [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royal, 1788, 40 pp. The Exegetic and Philanthropic Society of Stockholm was founded to study and promote the teachings of Emmanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), a visionary and intellectual of great influence. The theory of animal magnetism, and especially the experiences connected with magnetic somnambulism, were very attractive to this society and it incorporated them into its world view. This treatise, addressed to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des amis r\u00e9unis de Strasbourg, attempts to formulate the results of this amalgamation. It is not surprising that the Swedish society found the writings of the Strasbourg society, oriented as they were to the psychological and moral aspects of magnetic somnambulism, congenial to its philosophical framework. The Stockholm society believed that supernatural and spirit forces were at work in the creation of disease and so must be involved in the cure. The Stockholm Society attempted to show that this Swedenborgian view of illness was the only reasonable way to explain the phenomena of animal magnetism and magnetic somnambulism. This letter was commented on by Rosenm\u00fcller in the previous entry (see entry pp. Written to obtain a degree in medicine and surgery, this is an interesting but very abbreviated list of works on animal magnetism. It cites the title of the work, place of publication, and number of pages.

Rahn states that he has studied the writings on animal magnetism and has not discovered anything essentially new. Rather he has found a revision of old opinions about a universal world spirit that also exists in the human body. This universal world spirit not only produces the general mutual influence between all bodies, heavenly and earthly, but also produces the special sympathy between one man and another, and is, in the last analysis, the bond between body and soul. Rahn notes there is a remarkable connection between individuals who are magnetized at the same time and he relates this connection to the old, well-known notion of natural sympathy. But he says that people must be willing to learn what new things the magnetists have to teach them, and, with the idea of an animal magnetic material, perhaps something novel has been added to traditional knowledge of the phenomena.

Bell was trained in animal magnetism at the Paris Society of Harmony and at the beginning of the book includes a reproduction of a certificate of fellowship signed by Bergasse, Kornman, and others. It is clear that Bell was also strongly influenced by the work of Puys\u00e9gur, for he devotes a great deal of space to the subject of magnetic sleep, something that would not have been touched on in Paris. Bell uses his own terminology to describe the phases of animal magnetism. He distinguishes between the \"strong crisis,\" which involves convulsions, and the \"gentle crisis,\" which involves sleep. Like Puys\u00e9gur, Bell speaks of a \"sixth sense\" by which the somnambulist may diagnose disease and predict its course. He also emphasizes the importance of the will in the process of magnetization and even mentions the ability to will an absent person into the magnetic state.

Benjamin took up the cause, promoting the tractors in the United States and England. He received a warmer reception in England than in America, and so he published most of his writings on \"perkinism\" in Great Britain. [H] 205. [Perkins, Elisha.](#Perkins.E) Certificates of the Efficacy of Dr. Perkins's Patent Metallic Instruments. New London, Connecticut: S. Green's Press, 1796, 16 pp. Elisha Perkins was an American physician who developed a healing technique involving the use of metallic tractors. The approach in some way resembled that used by the practitioners of animal magnetism. \"Perkinism\" received a hostile reception from the American medical establishment, who condemned this \"stroking\" technique as useless and therefore dangerous. Animal magnetism itself had made little headway in the United States at this time, having been condemned in France by Benjamin Franklin's commission and spoken poorly of by Jefferson. Only George Washington, because of the request of his friend Lafayette, gave it any kind of a hearing through a brief correspondance with Mesmer. Perkins too seems to have gotten Washington's ear, since he sold him a set of his tractors. These devices were made of dissimilar metals, gold and silver, and were approximately three inches in length. Held in the doctor's hands, they were used to gently stroke the body in the direction of the heart. Although Mesmerism was known to the American medical world at the time when Perkins developed his tractors, it is not clear to what extent he was influenced by Mesmer's teaching, for he says little about the theory of their operation. His son Benjamin was more vocal about theoretical issues (see his Influence of Metallic Tractors . . . , entry number [204](#e204)).

London: Printed for the Executrix, 1798, xii + (4) + 230 pp. De Mainauduc received his medical training and set up his medical practice in London. In 1782 he moved to Paris to become \"Quarterly Physician to the King of France.\" There he studied for a time with Charles D'Eslon. In 1785 he returned to London and soon began to teach a \"Science\" of healing without the use of conventional medical means. In the Lectures, he says that this Science of healing is not new, but has been practiced by physicians for two hundred fifty years. But, he insists, it had not been recognized for the science it is because it was \"enveloped with ridiculous nostrums or machinery\" (p. viii). So De Mainauduc claims for himself \"new discoveries\" about this Science, consisting of his particular philosophy and techniques. His \"Science\" is, in fact, a type of spiritual healing (based upon the action of the spirit, mind, and will) presented in the framework of a rather simplistic atomistic physiology: \"Thus it appears that every human Being possesses the power of striking other forms with the particles which are flying off from his own body; or, to state it in its proper light, we must say, that it is the prerogative of Spirit in many, by vigorous exertions, to propel the atoms of its own body against and through the pores of any other form in nature\" (p. 111). De Mainauduc writes about \"invisible fingers\" that can manipulate the interior of the patient's body: \"The Operator's own emanations, when duly influenced, become for the Operator, invisible fingers, which penetrate the pores, and may be truly considered as the natural and only ingredients which are or can be adapted to the removal of nervous, or of any other affections of the body\" (pp. 120-121). Making liberal use of quotations from the Bible, De Mainauduc paints his discovery of the principles of the new Science as God's gift to medicine. He bemoans the false philosophies that have over the ages become associated with this healing power. Chief among those philosophies was that of Mesmer, who \"pillaged the subject from Sir Robert Fludd, and found to a certainty the existence of the power; undisposed to attend to our Saviour's information, he preferred loadstones and magnetic ideas to the service of the Great Author, and after performing several accidental cures, his magnetism and his errors shared the fate of his predecessors\" (pp. 224-225).

[Mesmer, Franz Anton.](#Mesmer.F) M\u00e9moire Mesmer, Doctor of Medicine, on His Discoveries,\" in Mesmerism. Translated and edited by George Bloch. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, 1980. One of Mesmer's most important works. Writing twenty years after his history-making M\u00e9moire of 1779 (entry number [10](#e10)), Mesmer complains that his discovery, animal magnetism, has had great difficulty in attaining acceptance in the medical world. He hopes that the present treatise will correct mistaken notions and clarify the relationship of animal magnetism to the principles of physics. He also undertakes to explain the phenomenon of somnambulism and its place in the practice of animal magnetism. Although Mesmer never mentions it, the reader is aware that the work of the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur is the backdrop against which Mesmer's comments on this subject are made. With Puys\u00e9gur's discovery of \"magnetic somnambulism,\" Mesmer was confronted with a problem: how could he acknowledge the reality of this phenomenon without giving it too prominent a place in his system? One of the main goals of this M\u00e9moire was to attempt to solve that problem. In his description of the physics of animal magnetism, Mesmer reasserts his mechanical view of what takes place. If there had been any question that Mesmer's theory was occultist in orientation, that is clearly answered in the negative here. Everything is explained in terms of matter and motion. The magnetic fluid is composed of infinitesimally small particles that move in streams. Health and disease are the result of the free or blocked flow of those streams. In the process of explaining this system, Mesmer makes a point of distinguishing it from \"animal electricity,\" a distinction that a number of authors had failed to make. Taking up the subject of somnambulism, Mesmer states that it is a phenomenon known throughout history. He gives it his own particular interpretation, however, calling it \"critical sleep\" (\"critical\" referring to \"crisis,\" a special physical state of the body as it attempts to deal with illness). He says that all the phenomena connected with \"critical sleep,\" such as knowledge of things at a distance and the ability to diagnose disease (see the works of Puys\u00e9gur) are to be explained in terms of the actions of the magnetic fluid, and therefore in terms of a purely mechanical physical system. He insists that traditional occult interpretations of these things are mistaken and disclaims any connection with those of his followers who have gone in that direction. Mesmer admits that somnambulism or \"critical sleep\" is quite likely to occur during the application of animal magnetism, and he explains that fact in terms of the \"workings of all the machine's systems\" (\"machine\" meaning the body). In this M\u00e9moire, Mesmer accomplishes his chief aim: to expunge from the interpretation of his teaching any hint of occultist views. [H] 212.

It was meant for the king's eyes only, due to the delicate nature of the subject matter. In it the commissioners express their concern about potential misuses of animal magnetism, particularly the possible sexual arousal of female subjects by male magnetizers. Although the report contains some false information (that it is always men who magnetize women), it does give an accurate picture of the procedures: the contact between the knees of the magnetizer and those of the patient; the placement of the hand on the stomach or abdominal area; the reaching of one hand behind the patient's body; and the general physical proximity and attunement involved in the process of magnetization. The commission states that the patient does not simply regard the magnetizer as a physican; he is, after all, still a man. The report also points out that often the female subject experiences an ecstasy of sorts when in the magnetic crisis, a buildup of emotions which is followed by a languor and a kind of sleep of the senses. The emphasis of the commission is on not only the danger of overt sexual acts performed by the magnetizer, but also the fact that the process may well awaken sexual passions latent in the female patient which she will then seek to fulfill in fornication or adultery.

They used wooden tractors painted to look like the metallic ones and discovered that the wooden ones were just as effective as the metallic ones. The experiments are described in this book.

Wienholt was a physician from Bremen who began his magnetic practice in 1786 when, along with a Dr. Olbers, he healed a nineteen-year-old girl of a severe nervous condition. Wienholt went on to found the Magnetische Magazin f\u00fcr Niederteutschland, one of the more important early German periodicals in the field, in 1787. His practice of animal magnetism lasted for more than fifteen years, and this master work spans that whole period. After outlining abrief history of animal magnetism in Germany and describing the details of his own magnetizing process, Wienholt unfolds a panorama of his healing career from 1787. Many of the cases he presents are nervous disorders, ranging from epilepsy to hysterical loss of voice.

After stating how he believes one becomes convinced of the reality of animal magnetism, he discusses the \"physics\" of animal magnetism, placing it in the context of the known phenomena of heat, fire, electricity, light, mineral magnetism, etc. He then outlines a brief history of animal magnetism in France, from Mesmer's time in Paris through his (Puys\u00e9gur's) foundation of the Society of Harmony in Strasbourg, appending a section on the magnetic systems of the \"spiritualists\" of Lyon. Puys\u00e9gur then describes how to magnetize and states his own views on the nature of magnetic action and somnambulism, including a discussion of clairvoyance and the role of imagination. The final section of the book is a collection of letters written to Puys\u00e9gur by various people on the subject of animal magnetism. Among them is a most interesting letter from the brother of the Marquis, Maxime, who describes procedures to be used when many magnetizers are operating at one time under the leadership of a chief magnetizer who sets the tone for the whole group.

Instead he became a physician and eventually professor at the universities of Heidelburg and Marburg. The important Theorie attempts to unify the data of animal magnetism and somnambulism within a far reaching spiritualistic philosophy. The author takes up issues such as the state of the soul after death, visions and apparitions, presentiments and prophecy, and other spiritistic matters. He discusses the higher states of somnambulism which make the world of the spirits accessible to those still in the body and thereby anticipates a whole body of literature that would combine these various concerns some forty years later. Jung-Stilling was strongly influenced by Swedenborg but also conducted his own experiments with somnambulism. [H P] sequel to Jung-Stilling's Theorie (entry number [231](#e231)). Here he writes about the notion of Hades or Scheol.

Hufeland analyses the nature of \"magnetic rapport\" between magnetizer and magnetized in terms of this universal sympathy. He states that magnetizer and somnambulist are so closely bound in a sympathetic relationship that the two form \"one individual\" (p. 117), and that the soul of the magnetizer is to some extent also the soul of the somnambulist. Sympathy, Hufeland says, causes thoughts and feelings to be held in common by the two, and even muscular action is communicated to the somnambulist by the muscular movement of the magnetizer.

Puys\u00e9gur believed that one of the main differences between natural and artificial somnambulism was in the matter of \"rapport.\" He states that with magnetic somnambulism, the somnambulist is in \"rapport\" (or a state of special connection) with the magnetizer. But with natural somnambulism, the somnambulist is in \"rapport\" with no one. The other difference between the two conditions, Puys\u00e9gur says, is in the way they are brought about. Ordinarily natural somnambulism follows upon sleep. Artificial somnambulism, on the other hand, is produced through the application of the techniques of animal magnetism. This book also examines the faculties exhibited by individuals in the somnambulistic state, providing many case histories as illustrations. Puys\u00e9gur concludes with a look at the dangers that must be guarded against in the use of magnetic somnambulism. [H] 1812 238. [Mesmer, Berlin: Hallischen Waisenhauses, 1812, 78 pp. A compilation of articles that appeared in the Askl\u00e4pieion in 1812. Here Mesmer makes his second attempt to tackle the issue of the nature of somnambulism and its relationship to animal magnetism, which he had first developed in the M\u00e9moire of 1799 (see entry number [211](#e211)). Again, his intention is to remove any superstitious or religious elements in the explanation of somnambulism and to explain it in terms of his mechanistic theory of animal-magnetic fluid. He first gives a physical explanation for the nature of animal magnetism itself, describing it as an \"invisible fire\" and distinguishing it from \"animal electricity,\" a subject of great interest at the time. Moving on to somnambulism, he refers to it in the same terms as he had in the M\u00e9moire, that is as \"critical sleep,\" pointing out that often the healing crisis of animal magnetism takes place in connection with sleep and in that state the unusual phenomena associated with somnambulism may develop. He states that these phenomena have been recognized in all ages. They include: foreseeing an illness and predicting its course; prescribing effective medicines for a disease without the benefit of medical knowledge; seeing and sensing distant objects; receiving impressions from the will of another; and other phenomena. Mesmer explains how these things are possible with a purely mechanical theory of physiology and the action of the magnetic fluid over a distance. From this he further elaborates his notion of an \"inner sense\" which leads to knowledge of things at a distance and an instinct about health. He also explains \"rapport\" in the same terms.

Dentu, 1812, (4) + vii + (8)-91 pp. The publication history of this and subsequent related works deserves a special note. This first description of Puys\u00e9gur's treatment of Alexandre H\u00e9bert was followed by the publication in the same year of Continuation du traitement H\u00e9bert (entry number [245](#e245)). Later in 1813 this latter work was republished in one volume with Les fous The reason for this somewhat confusing set of related publications is that together they constitute a description of the ongoing treatment of Alexandre H\u00e9bert that concluded in 1813. Les fous . . . and the subsequent writings are little known but extremely significant for the history of modern psychotherapy. In his description of the treatment of Alexandre H\u00e9bert, Puys\u00e9gur shows that he was in the process of evolving a magnetic psychotherapy that embodied insights that were ahead of his time. Animal magnetism had from its beginnings made use of a kind of \"empathy\" between magnetizer and patient. Puys\u00e9gur, with his de m\u00e9moires . . ., 1785) had further. With Les fous . . ., he shows an awareness of the healing dynamic between magnetizer and patient that is very close to the modern concepts of transference and countertransference. Alexandre H\u00e9bert was a boy of twelve and a half who suffered from paroxysms of rage in which he was a danger for both himself and those around him. He experienced severe headaches and would fall into fits of weeping and moaning while hitting his head against the wall, sometimes even attempting to throw himself from windows. Puys\u00e9gur undertook to treat his condition by using animal magnetism. The boy was a good subject, immediately falling into states of somnambulism. Eventually, Puys\u00e9gur took the boy into his own home and kept him by his side for months. The magnetic treatment became a veritable psychotherapy, involving long conversations, revelations of secrets in the state of magnetic somnambulism, and even the analysis of dreams. Alexandre, who had been troubled from age four, eventually underwent a relatively complete cure, with only certain memory problems remaining. Through this experience, and an earlier one with an artillery soldier, Puys\u00e9gur developed a theory of mental disturbances. He came to believe that \"most insanity is nothing but disordered somnambulism\" (Les fous . . . , p. 54). He held that the disturbed person was in a state of disorder precisely because he or she was caught in a magnetic rapport with someone no longer present (Alexandre, for instance, maintained a hidden rapport with his mother). Puys\u00e9gur believed that the cure was to replace this disturbing rapport by a healthy rapport with the magnetizer. This \"transference\" oriented theory of psychotherapy seems to be unique for the time. [H] 1813 242.

Paris: (4) + 298; (4) + 340 pp. Deleuze is a central figure in the history of animal magnetism. After serving as a lieutenant in the French infantry, he decided to devote himself to the study of the natural sciences, eventually becoming assistant naturalist of the Garden of Plants in Paris and secretary to the association of the Museum of Natural History. Deleuze was highly respected by his contemporaries as a great scholar with a balanced approach to scientific issues. In 1785 Deleuze heard about the work of Puys\u00e9gur, but found it hard to believe that he had been able to do what was claimed. However, when a respected friend of Deleuze went to see Mesmer and was then able to induce somnambulism, Deleuze decided to visit his friend and find out for himself. He was impressed with the demonstration and began to pursue his own study of animal magnetism. He was influenced most strongly by the ideas of Puys\u00e9gur, and it is clear from reading Deleuze's writings that he was like Puys\u00e9gur in temperament and attitude towards the people he worked with. The Histoire is Deleuze's first work on animal magnetism and it is one of the most important ever written on the subject. In the process of depicting the history, Deleuze also conveys a great deal of information about the theory and practice. In his presentation, he pays a great deal of attention to detail and strives to be objectively fair. Although a partisan of animal magnetism, Deleuze does not close his eyes to legitimate criticism. The Histoire is about as balanced a treatment as one could find from a man who was engaged in a daily practice of that art. [H] 244.

[Mesmer, Franz Anton.](#Mesmer.F) + 356 pp. Mesmer's final work on animal magnetism, written with the assistance of Karl Christian Wolfart, who was sent to see Mesmer by the Berlin Academy of Science. Strangely, the original was written in French by Mesmer, and then translated into German, Mesmer's native tongue, by Wolfart. According to Tischner (Franz Anton Mesmer, p. 101), Wolfart's translation was, unfortunately, often stiff and bungling. Wolfart's carelessness extended even to his giving Mesmer's name incorrectly as \"Friedrich\" Anton Mesmer. This error has somehow been perpetuated by many modern libraries. Mesmerismus presents Mesmer's overall view of animal magnetism and its implications for human life. It is divided into two parts: \"Physik\" and \"Moral.\" The first part discusses the physical nature of animal magnetism and its relationship to such phenomena as fire and electricity. In his explanations, Mesmer is consistent with the mechanistic approach he held from the beginning. \"There is one uncreated primary essence\u2014God. In the universe there are two primary essences\u2014matter and motion. All possibilities unfold from the action of motion upon matter\" (p. 33). Mesmer also takes up the issue of somnambulism and the \"inner sense,\" repeating much that can be found in his Erl\u00e4uterungen of 1812 (entry number [238](#e238)). The second part examines the implications of animal magnetism for the moral life. Based on the central notion of universal magnetic harmony, much expounded by Bergasse, Mesmer draws conclusions about the true nature of morality, freedom, social life and religious worship. [H] 251. [Puys\u00e9gur, Armand Marie Jacques 671 pp. Stieglitz's approach to animal magnetism was that of a skeptic. He did not go along with the common theory of animal magnetism, and he was slow to accept its genuineness. However, he took this position not as one who had experimented in the field, but as a critic of the literature. This book is his major work in the field of animal magnetism. While revealing his skepticism, it also shows that he was not entirely closed to the data. He did believe that Mesmer had discovered an important natural force, but he thought that the nature of the phenomena of animal magnetism could not yet be decided. [H] 1815 253.

The Facts, Attested by the Most Respectable Divines, Physicians, and Literary Gentlemen; and the Discourses, Correctly Noted by Clerical Stenographers. By Several Medical Gentlemen. New York: S. Marks, 1815, (1) + 298 pp. This unusual account is significant for a number of reasons. Although not the earliest (see Charles Mais, entry number [249](#e249)), it is the most detailed account available of Rachel Baker, the \"sleeping preacher.\" She was nineteen years old when the book was written and was becoming fairly well known to the public, having recently been brought to New York for observation. The young woman had gone through a series of stages before the preaching phase began. In 1811 she had become extremely depressed and disturbed because she believed herself to be the world's greatest sinner. Then in January of 1812 she went through a night of terror followed by a feeling of great peace. From then she began to give sermons about God, his love, and the evil of sin. Awake she remembered nothing of these talks. In her ordinary state she was not considered to be a good thinker or \"sensible.\" But while preaching in her sleep, she struck those who heard her as extremely cultivated and wise, speaking of religious matters with great passion and conviction. The contrast between the young woman's waking state and somnambulistic states is very similar to that reported of Victor Race by Puys\u00e9gur (1784). In addition to presenting a vivid account of Rachel Baker and her phenomena, the book has a number of small treatises by various authors on sleep walking and related matters. Particularly noteworthy is one by Samuel L. Mitchill on \"somnium\" or \"that condition of the human faculties which is intermediate between sleeping and waking.\" The book also contains a description of an apparent case of multiple personality, the Rev. Dr. Tennent, which is one of the earliest ever published. [H] 255. [ [Fustier, abb\u00e9.]](#Fustier.A) Legrand, 1815, 55 pp. An attack on animal magnetism by a theologian. [H] 256.

At first, he considered Mesmer a charlatan and his theory unscientific. He then chaired a commission appointed by Berlin University in 1812 to examine the doctrine of animal magnetism. He personally approved a trip by a member of the commission, Karl Christian Wolfart, to visit Mesmer to inquire at first hand about his thinking on animal magnetism. This visit led to quite a different outcome from that anticipated by Hufeland (see entry numbers [250](#e250) and [256](#e256)).

He had first been introduced to animal magnetism by Gmelin in 1789 and he had been astounded by what he witnessed. He hoped that animal magnetism contained the core of a new and comprehensive theory of natural science. He states, however, that his hopes were dashed by subsequent experiences with somnambulists who turned out to be carrying out \"juggling acts\" for the benefit of their magnetizers and friends. This work is the result of Pfaff's critical attitude towards the subject.

However, Lavater taught Brandis's friend, Lichtenberg, to magnetize, and Brandis found his attention diverted from Greatrakes to animal magnetism.

Faria anticipated the views of Alexandre Bertrand by some years, contending that the true cause of the phenomena of animal magnetism was psychological. He believed that, contrary to Mesmer's teaching, there is no magnetic fluid, and that, contrary to Puys\u00e9gur's teaching, the power of the will of the magnetizer is not involved. In other words, Faria states that there is no external agent that produces the effects. Rather, the magnetizer makes use of suggestion to produce a state of \"lucid sleep,\" as Faria calls artificial somnambulism. He says that the extraordinary powers of lucid sleep are always present in human beings, but normally unavailable. Because the sleeper does not recognize them as natural abilities, they are attributed to an external agent. Faria also states that the healing powers of \"lucid sleep\" are due to the very powerful effects of suggestions coming from the operator. This edition of the book is very rare. A new edition was published in 1906 (Paris: Henri Jouvet) and is important because it contains comments on Faria's doctrine by Brown-Sequard, Li\u00e9beault, Gilles de la Tourette, Pitres, Crocq, Vires, and Bernheim.

This work concentrates on certain mystical aspects of the doctrine of animal magnetism considered by the author to be embodied in the writings of many religious and spiritual writers over the centuries.

Herbig, (2) + xxx + (1) + 478; (2) + 602 + (3) pp. A physician, Privy Councillor, and professor at Jena, Kieser was a strong supporter of animal magnetism and heavily involved in investigating the clairvoyant qualities of magnetic somnambulists. He called the essential agent of animal magnetism \"telluric power,\" associating animal magnetism with a generalized magnetic force. In this lengthy and important work, he describes mineral, vegetable, and animal magnetism, attempting to provide a foundation in physics for animal magnetic phenomena. Kieser says that sleep is a general expression of magnetic life and that somnambulism is a natural product of the application of animal magnetic techniques. In describing magnetic healing, he places some emphasis on the power of belief as supplementary to the healing power of animal magnetism itself.

Dentu, 1823, (4) + iv + 321 pp. In his rather short life, the physician Bertrand wrote two important books on animal magnetism. The first of the two is one of the most thorough works on somnambulism written to that date. Here Bertrand discusses the nature of somnambulism from his own experiments and those of others. He describes the phenomena associated with artificial somnambulism, both the more ordinary phenomena and those which seem extraordinary or paranormal. Among other things, Bertrand describes somnambulists' visions of magnetic fluid emanating from the fingers of the magnetizer, a phenomenon first noted by Tardy de Montravel (Essai. . ., entry number [152](#e152)).

It went through at least four editions in thirty years in France and was translated into a number of foreign languages. Deleuze's instructions are clear and balanced in tone. He emphasizes that animal magnetism is intended to be a source of benefit, a healing power for those in distress. It is not, in his opinion, a good idea to try placing the individual being magnetized into a state of somnambulism simply to be able to satisfy one's curiosity about that phenomenon. The tone of the manual is reminiscent of that of Puys\u00e9gur, Deleuze's inspiration. The good will of the magnetizer is of paramount importance to the outcome of the treatment. Deleuze accepts the existence of a magnetic fluid and describes how objects may be employed as receptacles for that fluid and used later in the healing process. The letter referred to takes up 36 pages of the text and is from the German physician Koreff. [H] 321.

In this work Rostan is mainly concerned with the genuineness of the phenomena of magnetic somnambulism. He says that since there is so much controversy about the subject, he can only state the conclusions he has arrived at from his own experience, without claiming to have the last word on the matter. He concedes that animal magnetism does produce a \"modification of the nervous system,\" and that this modification can bring about salutary effects on the health of the magnetic subject. But Rostan has serious doubts about the reality of the allegedly paranormal magnetic phenomena, such as clairvoyance. He points out that since the will of the magnetizer is necessarily involved in producing the magnetic state, there is a great deal of room for error in observing such phenomena, since the wish can deceive one about the fact.

Between the writing of his first book (Trait\u00e9 du somnambulisme, entry number [313](#e313)) and this one, Bertrand changes his mind about the true nature of animal magnetism and magnetic somnambulism. He no longer accepts the existence of a universal magnetic fluid as the agent that produces the phenomena associated with animal magnetism, even though he maintains the genuineness of the phenomena themselves. Bertrand believes that evidence often cited in favor of the existence of the fluid (e.g., claims of somnambulists to be able to see the fluid emanating from the fingertips of the magnetizer) is largely based on preconceived ideas that affect the imaginations and expectations of both magnetizer and magnetic subject. With this acknowledgement of the importance of suggestion, Bertrand anticipates the ideas of Braid about the true nature of animal magnetic phenomena. Most of the book is devoted to the history of animal magnetism and is one of the best sources for that subject up to the time of its publication. It includes the reports of the French commissions of 1784 (including the secret report) and also a report of the Academy of Medicine written by Husson and delivered in 1825.

Du Commun, a contributor to Annales du magn\u00e9tisme animal, practiced animal magnetism in Paris before coming to the United States and teaching French at the West Point Military Academy. These lectures are a well-constructed, popular-style introduction to animal magnetism. The first lecture covers the history of animal magnetism, the second deals with its applications and effects, while the third lecture discusses theory. Du Commun was acquainted with King Charles X, France's reigning monarch at the time of these lectures. In 1814 he presented Charles with the first three volumes of the Annales du magn\u00e9tisme animal (entry number [248](#e248)), which the king received approvingly. Charles X (previously known as the Comte d'Artois, to whom Charles D'Eslon had been personal physician) had, in 1826, appointed a commission drawn from the Royal Academy of Medicine to investigate the genuineness of the phenomena of animal magnetism. In these lectures, Du Commun states his belief that, since the king is favorable to animal magnetism, it would soon be accepted with the respect that was its due. [H] 341. Cotta, Seeress of Prevorst.

Justinus Kerner, physician and poet, had become acquainted with animal magnetism through Eberhard Gmelin (1751-1808) and soon developed a keen interest in the apparent clairvoyant and visionary powers of somnambulists. In 1826 a young woman, Friederike Hauffe, was brought to Kerner in a state of severe depression. She was also in bad physical shape, and Kerner undertook her physical and psychological treatment. This book is an account of that undertaking. Early in his treatment of Friederike Hauffe, Kerner decided to use animal magnetism. The woman was a good subject and easily became somnambulistic. In her trance states, she had visions, premonitions, and clairvoyant experiences. Kerner believed in the genuineness of these phenomena, recording them with great care in this account.

Newnham wrote the book under the patronage of the Bishop of Winchester and it was clearly an attempt to use physiological and psychological terms to explain supernatural or supernormal phenomena which embarrass the Church. Newnham does not deny the possible existence of supernormal phenomena, but he believes that since there are natural explanations for so many instances, one would have to be open to the idea that natural explanations apply to all. Newnham's chapters on sleep, dreams and somnambulism include an appreciative discussion of animal magnetism. This appeared seven years before Elliotson's invitation to Du Potet to do medical experiments with animal magnetism at London's University Hospital and started a strong wave of interest in the subject throughout England.

With Remarks on the Manner in which the Claims of Animal Magnetism should be Met and Discussed. By a Member of the Massachusetts Bench. Boston: Weeks, Jordan and Company, 1837, 72 pp. Poyen, one of animal magnetism's principal promoters in the United States, here writes with appreciation of a treatise by William Stone (Letter to Doctor A. Brigham, on Animal Magnetism . . . , entry number [389](#e389)). Poyen uses the occasion to take issue with a book by Charles Durant that attempts to deny the reality of animal magnetic phenomena and attributes them to suggestibility and delusion (see Exposition, or a New Theory of Animal Magnetism . . . , entry number [381](#e381)). Poyen shows that Durant's criticisms, far from being the original insights he claims them to be, are identical to those that had been voiced as part of the controversy over animal magnetism for decades. Poyen uses material from his own classes on animal magnetism, taught at Salem, Massachusetts, to support the claim for the genuineness of the phenomena in question. [H & P] 387.

Preceded by a Dissertation on the Proofs of Animal Magnetism. Boston: Weeks, Jordan & Co., 1837, vi + (2) + 13-212 pp. A work of considerable significance for the history of animal magnetism and spiritualism in the United States. Although Joseph Du Commun was the first to lecture on animal magnetism in America, Poyen may rightly be thought of as having done more than any other to make the phenomenon widely known there. Poyen learned the art of magnetizing in 1832 while a medical student in his native France. He developed a great enthusiasm for mesmerism, no doubt in part because of the relief it had given him from a troublesome illness. When he came to the United States a few years later, he wanted to make the virtues of animal magnetism widely known in that country. He set about the task energetically and methodically, giving lectures on animal magnetism the length of the northeastern seaboard. Progress of Animal Magnetism is his account of that tour. Poyen was trained in the animal-magnetic tradition of Puys\u00e9gur and Deleuze. Both accepted the genuineness of clairvoyant episodes in connection with somnambulism. Poyen's account shows that such clairvoyant experiences became common occurrences in the United States. Largely because of Poyen's lectures and writings, the sight of a magnetizer and his professional somnambulist partner travelling from town to town, giving medical readings and clairvoyant demonstrations, was a common one by 1848 when events around the Fox sisters gave rise to the spiritualist movement. That movement was able to spread so rapidly and become so strongly rooted in American culture largely because of the mental climate created by widespread familiarity with animal magnetism. [H] 388.

Elliotson set him up to practice in the North London Hospital. After strong objections from some medical colleagues, Elliotson had to ask Du Potet to carry on with his work in Du Potet's own apartments in Cavendish Square. During this stay in London, Du Potet wrote this book as an introduction to animal magnetism for the English speaking world. The book begins with a French dedication, but the rest is written in English. It is a very good general treatise on animal magnetism, and is particularly useful in its sketches of the history of animal magnetism. Few books of the time give such a clear impression of the atmosphere of interest and controversy that surrounded animal magnetism in those years. The tone is personal, yet not overly subjective. One of the interesting points Du Potet makes is that in his view there are three main schools of animal magnetism: the original school of Mesmer (with emphasis on the physical fluid), the school of the Chevalier de Barberin at Lyon (emphasizing the work of the \"soul\" in magnetizing), and the school of the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur (combining the physical treatment of Mesmer with the psychical treatment of de Barberin).

Her father wrote a letter to the Paris Academy of Medicine (which had been investigating animal magnetism) describing his daughter's feats and suggesting that they deserved attention. The Academy's investigatory commission invited Pigeaire and his daughter to Paris to observe and test her clairvoyance. After delays due to disagreements about the conditions for the tests, the commission observed the girl's attempts to read cards with blindfolded eyes. The encounter was inconclusive and led to a heated controversy between supporters of the girl and supporters of the commissioners. Frapart was an advocate of animal magnetism.

The most important reason was to see whether effects produced in animals could remove objections to the reality of the effects of animal magnetism based on possible collusion on the part of magnetizer and magnetized or deception on the part of the magnetized alone. Among the animals Wilson treated were cats, dogs, fish, a cock, macaws, a horse, pigs, and even elephants. He seems to have successfully placed all of them in a trance state using magnetic passes.

His first encounter with it was at a demonstration given in London by Du Potet on one of his lecture tours. Greatly impressed, Elliotson began to experiment on his own and came to the conclusion that animal magnetism was an art that would prove to be extremely beneficial to medical practice. From the beginning he met stiff opposition from the medical establishment, eventually having to resign his post at University College Hospital. He continued to write in support of animal magnetism and in 1843 founded England's principal mesmeric journal, the Zoist (entry number [490](#e490)).

This book went through many editions in Britain and the United States, and it proved to be very influential in making animal magnetism a legitimate subject of interest. Townshend begins the book with a straightforward recognition of the difficulties in treating a subject which produces such unusual phenomena. He then moves on to describe those phenomena using illustrations drawn from both his experiments and those of other magnetizers. Most of the book is devoted to a description of \"mesmeric sleepwalking,\" as he preferred to term magnetic somnambulism. Interwoven with his description are threads of semi-scientific theory about what makes such unusual phenomena possible. [H] 1841 434.

New York: H. A. Chap\u00edn One vol. only; Published in Paris and Dinham, Gait and Anderson, 1842, 12 pp. A work of the greatest significance in the history of hypnotism, and of utmost rarity. James Braid was the founder of modern hypnotism and was himself inventor of its name. His theories were enthusiastically taken up by such men as Azam, Broca, Richet, Charcot, Li\u00e9beault, and Bernheim. Apart from Mesmer and Puys\u00e9gur, no single individual had such a profound influence upon the history of hypnotism and dissociative phenomena as did Braid. Born in Fifeshire, Scotland, Braid was educated at Edinburgh. He completed his training as a surgeon and, after practicing for a while in Scotland, moved to Manchester. On November 13, 1841, Braid attended a mesmeric demonstration staged by the Frenchman, Lafontaine. On that occasion Braid thought the effects were produced by trickery, but on attending a second time he noted what he believed to be a genuine phenomenon: the mesmerized individual could not open his eyes. Intrigued by this observation, Braid set out to find the explanation. He performed some experiments with friends and relatives and arrived at what he considered to be the true cause of magnetic sleep: a rapid exhaustion of the sensory and nervous systems producing a feeling of somnolency in the mind, which then \"slips out of gear.\" News of these experiments reached a certain Rev. H. M'Neile who preached a sermon against Braid on Sunday, April 10, 1842. This occasioned the reply from Braid which is the pamphlet Satanic Agency and Mesmerism Reviewed. The significance of this work lies in its being Braid's first published work containing his historic theory of the cause of mesmeric phenomena and his new nomenclature for those phenomena: \"hypnotic sleep,\" \"hypnotise,\" and \"neurohypnotism\" (also used in his note \"Neuro-hypnotism,\" Medical Times and Gazette: July 9, 1842). In Satanic Agency Braid lists three common attitudes towards mesmeric phenomena and a fourth which is his own. The first is the belief that the phenomena are due to a system of collusion and delusion. The second is that they are real but the products of imagination, sympathy, and imitation. The third attitude, that of those who accept the theory of animal magnetism, is that the phenomena are caused by the influence of a magnetic medium. Braid's own view is that they are solely attributable to a particular physiological state of the brain and spinal cord. After expounding his theory of hypnotism, Braid describes the various uses to which he has applied it: for example, extracting teeth, relief of chronic pain, removal of paralysis, and restoration of hearing and sight. This small work contains all the basic elements of the system which Braid elaborated the following year with his publication of Neurypnology or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep (1843, entry number [465](#e465)). It is believed that there are only two copies of Satanic Agency and Mesmerism Reviewed extant today. Tinterow (Foundations of Hypnosis, p. 317) says that A. W. Waite and W. Preyer, in searching out Braid's writings, could locate only one copy. That copy, bearing the library plate of Dr. Albert Moll, resides in Tinterow's private library. A second copy, not previously known to exist, has become known to the author of this bibliography and is privately owned. This copy contains a notation apparently written in Braid's own hand.

After presenting a history of animal magnetism and its antecedents, Caldwell lists what he calls the three schools of mesmerism in existence at the time: the \"genuine animal magnetists\" who follow Mesmer and who hold that all effects are due to the magnetic fluid; the school who follow the \"Chevalier Barbarin of Lyons,\" believing that the effects of mesmerism are the results of faith and volition; and the school of Puys\u00e9gur who accepted the existence of both physical and psychological agents. Caldwell believes the last to be the most tenable of the three positions. The final section of the book is taken up with cases of mesmeric practice, both those of the author and others.

In doing this he attempts to counter superstitious beliefs that had come to be associated with magnetic phenomena, and also demonstrate to scientists that animal magnetism is a natural phenomenon. To do this Ennemoser first sketches the theory of animal magnetism and describes its principle phenomena, including magnetic sleep. He then draws connections between the phenomena described in the ancient and more recent literature of religion and occult and magnetic phenomena. In this context he attempts to prove that the phenomena of animal magnetism are simply manifestations of forces of nature and subject to natural law. The book contains a section on the \"psychological explanation\" of magnetic phenomena that is noteworthy.

It was the first use of animal magnetism as a surgical anaesthesia in England. Topham was the magnetizer; Ward the surgeon. The painless operation was described in an address delivered to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London and then published in this form. The resulting controversy is related in Elliotson's book. [H] 1843 465. [Braid, James.](#Braid.J) Neurypnology or The rationale of nervous sleep considered in relation with animal magnetism. Illustrated by numerous cases of its successful application in the relief and cure of disease. London: John Churchill, 1843, (2) + xxii + 265 + (1) pp. The first full-length treatment of the subject of hypnotism by its founder. In this book Braid expands upon Satanic Agency and Mesmerism Reviewed (entry number [450](#e450)). He further elaborates his proposed new terminology with the following vocabulary: NEURYPNOLOGY: the doctrine of nervous sleep; NEURO-HYPNOTISM: nervous sleep, a peculiar condition of the nervous system produced by artificial contrivance; HYPNOTIC: the state of nervous sleep; HYPNOTISE: to induce nervous sleep; HYPNOTISM: nervous sleep; DEHYPNOTISE: to restore from the state of nervous sleep; HYPNOTIST: one who practises neuro-hypnotism. It was Braid's intention that his terminology and theory should replace that of the animal magnetists. He meant thereby to do away with the notion of a magnetic fluid as the agent which produces mesmeric phenomena. Instead, he substituted the theory that mesmeric phenomena were of subjective origin. In Neurypnology Braid says that the specific cause is a rapid fatiguing of the sensory and nervous systems. In later writings Braid also gave due credit to the importance of suggestion in the hypnotic process. Braid had to face fierce opposition to his views from both mesmerists and medical colleagues. Yet he was eventually successful in having his notion of hypnotism the accepted theory to explain mesmeric phenomena\u2014though he did not live to see this happen. Shortly before Braid's death in 1860, Dr. Azam of Bordeaux published an enthusiastic account of hypnotic experiments based upon Braid's views, with which he had become acquainted the previous year. Also in 1860, Broca reported similar successful results using Braid's methods. From that point on, Braid's fame spread rapidly. By the end of the century he was universally credited as the originator of the system which made possible the revolutionizing of medical and psychotherapeutic technique. [H] 466.

In the lectures Dods expresses his belief in the power of the agent discovered by Mesmer, but rejects the term magnetism in favor of \"mental electricity\" or even \"spiritualism.\" Dods's religious approach is perceivable in these lectures. He calls mesmerism a \"power of God,\" and he connects the healing works of Jesus with this power. Dods describes six degrees of mesmerism, the sixth being clairvoyance.

New York: P. P. Good, 1843, xvi + 247 pp. Sunderland, a Methodist minister, attended the lectures of Charles Poyen on animal magnetism in 1837, and from that point began to incorporate that doctrine into his ideas about the effects of the mind upon the body. At the same time he developed an interest in phrenology, and combined the two into a system he labeled \"phrenomagnetism.\" Although Sunderland later dropped phrenomagnetism, in the first edition of the present book he includes it in his overall system called \"pathetism.\" Rejecting the idea of a magnetic fluid, Sunderland substitutes \"pathetism\" as the agent \"by which one person, by manipulation, is enabled to produce emotion, feeling, passion, or any physical or mental effects, in the system of another\" (p. 3). He sees the \"sympathetic\" relationship between the operator and patient, not animal magnetic fluid, as the central agent for producing these effects: \"All the feelings therefore which one human being may be able to excite in the mind of another . . . are identical with this same agency. . . . If impressions be made upon the sensorium through the eye or ear, or through the nerves of sensation, the immediate agency which carries those impressions to the mind is pathetism\" (p. 68). Sunderland had a unique view of the importance of the state of mind of those in the environment of the patient and operator: \"Pathetism has to do with the sympathetic system, not of the operator and his patient merely, but the nervous sympathies and antipathies of every other person present\" (p. 126). For Sunderland, pathetism embodies all the changes that can be brought about in the minds of men, and the physical correlates of those mental changes. In this way, the system of pathetism embodies knowledge of all the laws of life, health, and disease. [H & P] 490. The Zoist.

After disposing of M'Neile's charge that mesmerism is diabolical number [460](#e460)), Sandby describes his own personal experiences with animal magnetism and their influence on his opinion of the genuineness of the phenomena.

London: Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1844, xii + 459 pp. Wigan attempts to explain \"double consciousness\" or what he calls \"alternate consciousness\" in terms of the two hemispheres of the brain. Drawing his examples from various fields, including the literature on somnambulism and what would later be called multiple personality, he suggests that there are two minds, corresponding to the two hemispheres, and that these minds can operate simultaneously and independently. This view he then contrasts with a theory of dual consciousness connected with the two hemispheres proposed by Henry Holland, who argued that although a kind of dual consciousness is involved, the mind itself is one. Wigan's book was never all that well known, although it shows up in footnotes in some later writings, such as Ribot's Les maladies de la personnality (1885, see Chateauroux.

Philadelphia: Lindsay and Blakiston, 1853. Brierre de Boismont attempts to remove the subject of hallucination from the exclusive jurisdiction of medical pathology and place it within the domain of psychology. To do this, he examines the phenomenon historically and discusses its broad occurrence in the course of ordinary human events. After examining hallucination in connection with nervous disorder, Brierre de Boismont considers the hallucinations of dreams and nightmares and the occurrence of hallucinations in animal magnetism, somnambulism and ecstasy. There is also a section on collective hallucinations. In the latter part of the book, the causes, symptomology and treatment of hallucinations are outlined.

Boston and New York: Saxton Peirce & Co., and Saxton and Miles, 1845, xvi + (17)-350 pp. Grimes was one of the most important American writers on animal magnetism. His work was influential in Britain and Europe as well as in the United States. This book, the product of many years experience as a lecturer and mesmerizer, presents Grimes's rather unique views on mesmerism. Basing his work on the notion that all that happens in the world is to be explained in terms of matter, motion, and mind, Grimes maintains that if there are to be any effects of matter upon matter or mind upon mind, they must occur through a medium that connects them. This medium he calls the \"etherium.\" The study of the way in which the etherium conveys impressions from one mind to another and the way in which these impressions are channeled through the physical organism, he calls \"etherology.\" \"Etheropathy\" may then be said to occur whenever the etherium is forced to act in opposition to its normal mode of action. For Grimes, animal magnetism, mesmerism, pathetism, hypnotism, somnambulism, and clairvoyance are all morbid etheropathic conditions of the human constitution. From this it follows that individuals are only susceptible to being mesmerized when in a state of inner imbalance and that only through knowledge of the laws of etherology can one work with nature to benefit people needing help. Grimes combines this view of human psychology with his peculiar approach to phrenology. [H] 516.

A powerful intellectual force in economics and social science, she first gained success through the publication of her Illustrations of Political Economy (1832-1834). In addition to writing prolifically on politics and economics, she was also a successful novelist and writer of children's stories. In 1844 Martineau was cured of a serious illness through animal magnetism, and in this collection of letters she discharges her \"duty\" to make the truth about mesmerism known. She had known about mesmerism for some time, and when her illness became debilitating, a medical friend brought her to the famous mesmerist Spencer Hall (see entry number [517](#e517)), who was then lecturing at Newcastle. He mesmerized Martineau and the beneficial effects were immediate. Martineau first had her maid and then another woman mesmerize her regularly. After consistent treatment of this kind, Martineau recovered. During the mesmeric treatment, she often experienced powerful distortions of sensation which she describes in some detail in the Letters.

Sunderland claims that the pamphlet is full of falsehoods and distortions and is misleading to the public. [H] 527. [Szapary, + viii + 416 pp. In this work Szapary admits that, although his first book on animal magnetism (Ein Wort \u00fcber animalischen Magnetismus, entry number [431](#e431)) appeared in 1840, it was not until 1843 that he really came to understand the true nature of the phenomenon. In that year, he had among his patients a 16-year-old girl, Auguste Kachler, whose somnambulistic pronouncements on animal magnetism took him beyond a mere \"poetical\" understanding to a truly scientific one. From these insights, Szapary started a new school of healing magnetism, and he credits this young woman as its true founder. In the Katechismus, Szapary brings together Auguste Kachler's pronouncements and those of other somnambulists and authors to construct a \"catechism\" of basic truths about healing magnetism. It is presented in this form for a very specific reason. Szapary states that the main difference between Mesmer's teaching and that of the new school is that according to Mesmer only a few people are capable of magnetizing others, whereas the new school teaches that everyone can do it. Because he held that anyone could magnetize, Szapary undertakes to present to the lay practitioner the basic principles of magnetic practice in a simple and readable form. [H] 528.

In Braid's mind, this was just another way of talking about the \"universal magnetic fluid\" of the mesmerists. Consistent with his previous writings on that subject, Braid denies that such a \"new imponderable\" has been proven to exist. He claims that all the phenomena adduced to establish such a proof may be accounted for in terms of the remarkable power of the human mind over the body and that it is \"unphilosophical\" to accept its existence unless more ordinary means of explanation fail.

An appendix contains a Letter to the Royal College of Physicians, London, dated March 28, 1802 by Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815). Mesmer commends the doctrine of animal magnetism to the Royal College of Physicians, and states that, although some persons in England had detracted him personally, his theory nonetheless remains \"undamaged in England, where the discovery has not yet been proclaimed.\" [H] 536.

London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1846, xxxi + (1) + 287 pp. Esdaile, originally from Scotland, was a practicing surgeon in Calcutta, India. A physician of great skill, in 1847 he was appointed Surgeon to the Government of India. At the outset, he lists seventy-three painless surgical operations performed in the previous eight months while the patients were in a mesmeric trance, as well as eighteen cases of cures brought about by animal magnetic passes. The surgical operations included amputation of an arm, cataract operations, great toenails cut out by the root, and the removal of large tumors of up to eighty pounds. Esdaile reports that not one death occurred as a result of the operations. Esdaile then traces the history of mesmerism, gives a detailed description of how he induced the mesmeric trance, and describes the course of many cases from diagnosis through operation to recovery. Although this work, along with Elliotson's Numerous Cases of Surgical Operations Without Pain (entry number [474](#e474)) was briefly influential, experimentation of the kind Esdaile carried out was cut short by the discovery of an effective chemical anaesthesia the very year Mesmerism in India du magn\u00e9tisme Magnetic Phenomena by William H.

The book presents a very detailed and useful history of the fortunes of animal magnetism from the investigations of the favorable French commission in the 1820s to the time of its writing. It concludes with an interesting prehistory of \"psychodunamy\" in the medical practices of the ancients, a description of Mesmer's discovery, and an account of \"psychodunamy\" in England and America.

New York: John Allen, 1847, x + (2) + (13)-288 pp. A most unusual book relating the psychic and psychological phenomena of animal magnetism to the doctrines of the Swedish sage Emanuel Swedenborg. Although Mesmer published his first treatise on animal magnetism (1779) seven years after the death of Swedenborg, those who have followed the teachings of Swedenborg have always manifested an interest in mesmerism. Thus, the first known Swedish document on animal magnetism was published in Stockholm in 1788 by the \"Exegetical and Philanthropical Society,\" a group formed to promote Swedenborg's writings (see entry number [186](#e186)). Dr. Jung-Stilling (1740-1817), who wrote on both animal magnetism and spirit communication (see entry numbers [231](#e231)-232), was well acquainted with the writings of Swedenborg. It is not surprising then, that Bush, who finds in the psychic phenomena of mesmerism a means for verifying the truth of the experiences of Swedenborg, would have attempted to unify the two streams in a cogent way.

It indicates that Lafontaine was not merely a stage magnetist. He had a interest in animal magnetism as an agent for curing or alleviating illnesses, and this work is a veritable mine of information about the use of animal magnetism in Lafontaine's day. [H] 553.

The work of Cahagnet was important in providing a direct link between the tradition of animal magnetism and that of spiritualism. Cahagnet, a Swedenborgian, accepted the belief of the Swedish seer that human beings can communicate with the spirit world. It is not surprising then that when Cahagnet put individuals into a state of magnetic somnambulism, some of them began to speak of experiences of just that kind. Arcanes de la future is the first and most important of his works. In it he describes the visions of eight somnambulists who describe in detail their encounters with spirits of the dead. In some cases they relate information about the deceased person that seemed to be unknown to them but proved to be accurate. They also describe the nature of life beyond the grave and relay moral admonitions from those who have gone to the other side. In his work with these magnetic ecstatics, Cahagnet anticipated the spiritualist movement which was soon to sweep America and, a few years later, England, Germany and France. In France only Billot (see entry number [393](#e393)) had carried out similar investigations with magnetic somnambulists before Cahagnet.

Translated by William Gregory. London: Taylor, Walton and Maberly, 1850. Reichenbach was a German natural philosopher and industrialist, famous as the discoverer of creosote and paraffin. He liked scientific experimentation and in the 1840s questioned human perception of magnetic emanations. He came to believe that every substance in the universe gives off emanations which can be perceived by some individuals. Reichenbach called these emanations \"od\" and the people who can perceive them \"sensitives.\" He believed that he had conclusively established that these individuals could see an \"odyllic light\" of definite color proceeding from the human fingertips, from the poles of magnets, from crystals, and from other substances. Reichenbach was certain that, in his experiments, he had removed all possibility that suggestion or ordinary perception were involved in these experiences. Sensitives, according to Reichenbach, used a faculty possessed by a great part of the population (perhaps half), and he considered the perception of \"od\" emanations to be a purely natural phenomenon with no supernatural implications. He tried to forcefully set himself apart from the proponents of animal magnetism, stating that his concern was simply to investigate a general physical force, and that he had no interest in the therapeutic practices of the mesmerizers. Nonetheless, it is difficult to distinguish Reichenbach's odic force from Mesmer's magnetic fluid. The similarity is reflected in general writings on human magnetism from 1850 on that often treat the two phenomena as identical. In Physikalish-physiologische Untersuchungen, Reichenbach's most popular work on the subject, the author presents an overview of his notion of \"od\" (or \"odyle,\" as Gregory translated it) and a description of the experiments he conducted to establish its existence. There were two English translations: the one referenced above, and another translated by John Ashburner and published in 1851. Reichenbach's writings were numerous, but most of them were never translated into English. Information on the first German edition of this work is unavailable. [H] 584.

Scoresby makes his point from experiments he himself had conducted, beginning in 1845. He distinguishes five degrees or stages of zoistic magnetism: 1) an initial effect that involves dimming of sight or warming of the forehead; 2) a closing of the eyes and inability to reopen them; 3) sleep-walking or somnambulism, with an awareness only of the magnetizer; 4) sleep-walking with the perception of sensations induced by the magnetizer, and often insensibility to pain; and 5) a sleep of insensibility, where no personal impressions affect the subject and there is total immunity to severe pain. In this fifth stage ecstatic experiences may occur. [H] 1850-1859 1850 587.

Fox (situated in Hydesville, near Rochester, New York) was disturbed by knockings and other sounds that were believed to be produced by the spirit of a deceased man. Two of Fox's daughters, Kate (1841-1892) and Margaret (1838-1893) who seemed to be the focus of these sounds, discovered that the knocks seemed to respond to their questions. At the suggestion of their mother, they devised a simple code that would allow the knocks to spell out messages. Soon the Fox home was full of neighbors and other curious people trying to discover the source of the sounds. Eventually the daughters left home, but the knocks followed them. Kate and Margaret began to put on demonstrations in living rooms and meeting rooms for those interested in witnessing their communications with the spirit world. They began a tour that quickly brought national and then world attention to the phenomena. This was the beginning of the Spiritualist movement that over the next five years spread to countries all over the world. History of the Strange Sounds is probably the earliest published book on the events that took place at the Fox home.

He points out that in apparitions of spirit figures, the perceiver experiences the presence of an individual in just the same manner as he would experience the presence of a bodily figure, even though no body is present. The question for Schopenhauer boils down to whether the origin of the experience is from within the organism of the perceiver or external to it. He draws heavily on material found in the literature of animal magnetism. He sees a close relationship between animal magnetism, magic, second sight, spirit seeing, and visions of all kinds. Schopenhauer considers them all to be versions of what he calls \"dreaming the real.\" But the fact that he relates apparitional experiences to our dreaming faculty or \"dream organ,\" does not mean that he dismisses them as mere chimera. On the contrary, he sees good evidence that these experiences involve perceptions that correspond to realities\u2014hence his phrase, \"dreaming the real.\" In this way, an individual could have the dream-sensory experience of the actual presence of someone who is dead. On the other hand, Schopenhauer rejects the spiritualist view of these experiences, since he holds the notion of an immaterial substance (etherial matter) that acts on bodies to be philosophically untenable.

He is considered to be a founder of psychophysics, the study of variations in psychological experience that accompany controlled variation in physical events. Fechner was a spiritualist and was strongly influenced by the Swedish seer, Swedenborg, as well as the philosopher Kant (e.g., Tr\u00e4ume eines Geistersehers, 1766). He also made use of the teachings of magnetic somnambulists.

He became interested in the use of the hand-held pendulum and intrigued by the fact that its action varied from person to person. Attempting to remove the possibility of movement through muscular action, he devised an instrument (the magnetoscope) that held the pendulum stationary over a glass bowl. He obtained what he believed to be remarkable results from his experiments, observing different movements if the operator held different substances in his hand. The magnetoscope was not successful for other careful experimenters, however, and dropped into disuse. [H] Alexander.](#Wood.A) What is Mesmerism?

London: Bailli\u00e8re, 1853, ix + (3) + 150 pp. The author is an enthusiastic supporter of animal magnetism as a means of cure, as well a means of attaining special mental states, including clairvoyance. He describes three degrees of mesmerism: 1) mesmeric sleep, resembling natural sleep, but with insensibility that can in some cases allow surgery to be performed without pain, 2) mesmeric sleep-walking, or somnambulism, with its attendant phenomena of clairvoyant vision and ecstasy, and 3) mesmeric waking state, in which the person retains full consciousness and subsequent memory, but experiences other phenomena, such as paralysis, transposition of the senses, and great suggestibility. Describing the new \"table moving\" fad then sweeping through England and Europe, Barth suggests that \"in every second or third house has 'table moving' been practiced; it is hardly probable that any scientific phenomenon of any kind has ever been brought more generally to the test of demonstrative experiment in an equally short period of time\" (p.vii). He asserts that this phenomenon is explicable in terms of the forces of mesmerism: \"There can be no question that the 'table turning' will establish a general conviction of the reality of the mesmeric or animal magnetic power;\u2014it leaves no abiding place for a doubt in the mind of any reasonable being who will trust the evidence of his senses\" (p. viii).

To some degree, this approach has its roots in animal magnetism, which strongly influenced Burq, and in Perkinism, an American healing system devised by Elisha Perkins (1741-1799). This seems to be Burq's first work on the subject. [H] 659. [Carpenter, and Mesmerism.\" The Quarterly (1853): 501-57. William Carpenter was a noted physiologist in Britain. In this important article, he takes up two issues: the nature of animal magnetism and the cause of certain physical phenomena associated with spiritualism, principally \"table-turning\" and \"table-talking.\" With regard to the first, Carpenter reveals himself as one of the few early supporters of the ideas of James Braid in England. He states that suggestion causes the somnambulist to respond in the way the magnetizer expects. He points out that this suggestive influence might be quite subtle, so that neither magnetizer nor subject realizes it is operating. He also relates the apparent clairvoyant feats of somnambulists to subtle suggestions given the somnambulist by the magnetizer. With regard to table-turning and table-talking, he comes up with a similar explanation to that of Faraday: that the motion of the table is the result of unconscious muscular pressure exerted by the sitters.

[Faraday, Michael.](#Faraday.M) 2, 1853): 801-803. In 1853 the fad of \"table-moving\" swept across the Atlantic from the United States and rapidly engulfed the whole of Britain and Europe. \"Table-moving\" consisted of gathering a number of people (often termed \"sitters\") around a table and having them attempt to get the table to rotate or rise and fall without using physical force to do so. Techniques varied greatly. For example, the sitters might spread their hands on the table, joining little finger to little finger to form a continuous circle; or they might hold their hands above the table with little or no contact with it. The practice derived from the newly formed Spiritualist movement whose central belief was that spirits of the dead can communicate with the living. Spiritualists believed that the tables were moved by spirits, and when the tables would rise and fall, causing a leg to knock against the floor, they would discern spirits messages being tapped out in code for the benefit of the \"sitters.\" Others believed that the tables indeed did move, but that spirits were not involved; rather the physical effects were caused by some unknown force produced by the \"sitters\" (such as animal magnetic force, odic force, electrical force, etc.). Still others believed that no movement without physical force took place at all, and that table moving phenomena were either the result of self-deception or deliberate trickery. Since the fad had become so widespread and table moving was being attempted in many of the living rooms of the western world, a clamor arose for men of science to make a pronouncement on the reality of the phenomena. So it was that the physicist Michael Faraday, one of the most eminent scientists of the century, was persuaded to try some experiments and settle the matter \"once and for all.\" This Faraday did, making his findings known first in a letter to the editor of the London Times in the June 30, 1853 issue, then in more detail in the Athenaeum. Bringing together a group of people as \"sitters\" whom he considered to be honest and who enthusiastically believed they could move the tables, Faraday concluded that the tables move, if they move, simply as a result of \"quasi-involuntary\" muscular exertion on the part of the sitters. While believing they were merely pressing straight down on the table, the sitters unwittingly caused their hands, which were in contact with the table, to apply force in a uniform direction of motion. Faraday's experiment was supposed to put the matter to rest, but it did not. Many protested that no general conclusions could be drawn from his very limited experiment, carried out using only one of many possible techniques. Faraday's conclusions, for example, did not pertain to those purported cases of table moving with no physical contact. Nonetheless, Faraday's reputation was such that virtually everyone who wrote about table-moving phenomena after him felt called upon to acknowledge his view and take a stand in relation to it. This early attempt to investigate the physical phenomena of spiritualism scientifically is an important milestone in the development of psychical research. The call for rational and controlled study of these experiences would grow in intensity over the next thirty years, contributing significantly to the founding in London in 1882 of the Society for Psychical Research.

Kerner relates the motion of the tables to animal magnetic fluid and the physical effects it was believed to produce. He deals both with table turning and table tipping. [H & P] 675. Magn\u00e9tisme. Moyens et Wattelier, 1853-1868. This massive work is one of the most serious attempts to investigate paranormal phenomena before the establishment of the Society for Psychical Research in 1882. Mirville's approach, which is historical, involves searching the literature for data relevant to the apparent manifestations of spirits over the ages. The first volume was written in the form of a m\u00e9moire addressed to the members of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. Mirville continued the project through thousands of pages, studying such topics as: mesmerism, table turning, various kinds of spirit possession and exorcism, the spirit rappings of spiritualism, apparitions, miraculous healings, ecstasy, and many other subjects. In the course of his work, Mirville developed his own theory concerning spirit manifestations, viewing them as genuine, but the work of evil spirits, who needed the participation of humans, since paranormal phenomena could only take place through the medium of the magnetic fluid of animal magnetism. The publication history of this work is particularly difficult to trace, since the various volumes appeared separately over a number of years, and supplements were at times added to already published parts. [H & P] 677. [Nees Hippolyte Bailli\u00e8re, 1853, 60 pp. After intensive experimentation, the author comes to the conclusion that table moving is a genuine phenomenon.

After a look at the history of \"sympathetic\" healing before Mesmer, Schwarzschild describes the discovery of animal magnetism and its rapid spread from Paris, placing special emphasis on its history in Germany. He traces the concomitant history of magnetic somnambulism and the clairvoyant experiences that accompanied that phenomenon. Schwarzschild's section on the merging of the magnetic tradition with that of the romantic-magical tradition in Germany is particularly valuable. The second volume of this work takes up the issue of the reality of the phenomena of animal magnetism, somnambulism, and clairvoyance. Schwarzschild himself believes that the phenomena are genuine, and presents a lengthy discussion of the stages of magnetic sleep, the types of clairvoyance, techniques of magnetizing, and similar subjects.

The work includes a description of qualities a magnetizer should possess and a lengthy section on somnambulism, in which Szapary discusses spasms experienced in various magnetic states. The second edition of this book (1854) was greatly augmented with a section on table-moving or, in Szapary's terms, \"gyro-magnetism.\" Although Szapary believed animal magnetic influence could account for the movement, he was not as much interested in the movement of the table itself as he was in the \"psychic community\" that is formed around the experience. Those who sit around a table and concentrate on moving it themselves become, in his view, \"magnetic baquets\" or reservoirs of magnetic fluid. This socio-magnetic concentration of power can lead to all kinds of remarkable phenomena, such as powerful healings and even apparitions. The single person or \"medium\" who guides the action is simply focussing the power of the group itself. Szapary desired to develop this special \"physico-psychic-magnetic\" power of the \"companions of the table\" (the agape) and use it for the benefit of mankind. [H & P] 694.

In addition to criticizing Judge Edmonds, a spiritualist, Dods also finds Reichenbach's theories of odic force useless as an explanation of the phenomena. [H & P] 712. Spiritualism. A Treatise on Turning Tables, the Supernatural Agent in General, and Spirits. Translated by E. W. Robert. New York: Kiggins & Kellog, 1857. An early attempt to explain the \"supernatural\" physical phenomena of spiritualism in terms of natural causes. Spiritualists held that turning tables, table levitation, knocking sounds from tables, and other seemingly inexplicable physical phenomena were the work of spirits and signs of the continuing presence in this world of those who had passed on to the next. Gasparin, while granting the reality of such curiosities as turning tables and levitation without the exercise of appropriate physical force, denies that this is the work of spirits. He places himself squarely in the tradition of orthodox animal magnetism and posits that when a group of people apply themselves to produce physical movement at a distance, the object can, in fact, be moved by the force of the \"magnetic fluid\" of the participants. Taking his theory further, Gasparin believed that \"magnetic fluid,\" along with nervous excitement and hallucination, accounted for all the phenomena which spiritualists attributed to departed souls. He thereby transforms the doctrine of animal magnetism, which did so much to promote the rise of spiritualism, into a reason to deny its validity. Gasparin backs up his conjectures with a lengthy series of experiments that are described in the work. [H & P] 713. [Gentil, Joseph Adolphe.](#Gentil.J) 714.

Braid sees the state as a temporary disturbance in the nervous centers deriving from the stimulation of a strong idea.

Hare was a graduate of Yale College and Harvard University, a medical doctor, emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, discoverer of the oxy-hydrogen blow pipe, author of over 150 articles on scientific subjects, an associate of the Smithsonian Institute, and a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Although by 1855 numerous accounts of \"physical\" mediums apparently capable of moving physical objects at a distance by means of some unknown \"spiritual\" force had accumulated, Hare disbelieved these accounts and thought it necessary to put them to scientific test. He devised experiments to determine whether mediums could move objects when physical force could not be exerted upon those objects. To his surprise he discovered that they could. His experiences led to his embracing spiritualism and writing Experimental Investigations. The book contains five plates which depict the pieces of apparatus Hare used to carry out experiments, such as one in which a young medium was able to exert a force of eighteen pounds on a spring balance even though prevented from having any communication with the apparatus except through water. It would be twenty years before the type of painstaking experimentation carried out by Hare would come into its own with the famous researches of William Crookes in England, and when Hare submitted the results of his experiments to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, his findings were not well received.

Among these fanaticisms, he includes those of such religious figures as Joan of Arc and St. Teresa, and religious undertakings such as witch hunts and the Inquisition. Madden also discusses epidemics of a hysterical nature, such as the dancing mania and the Jansenist convulsionaries. Madden's point of view is that when imagination soars above reason it loses its bearings and the greatest evils can result. When reason is overthrown in that way, it is often only religion, and specifically Christianity, that can return it to its proper place. [H & P] 780. [Masson, Alphonsine.](#Masson.A) Discours prononc\u00e9 la doctrine spirite la nature des esprits, + 176 pp. Rivail was the founder of modern French spiritualism and its most important early figure. An accomplished educator who had published a number of books in that field, Rivail had been pursuing a serious interest in phrenology and animal magnetism in the early 1850s when he became intrigued by the \"table turning\" phenomenon sweeping Europe. Encountering two young mediums who informed him that he had an important religious mission to carry out, Rivail questioned them concerning the nature of human life and spiritual development, and obtained replies through table tapping and planchette writing that were to become the basis for an elaborate philosophy of spiritualism. Some of the key elements of his philosophy were: 1) his notion that human beings are composed of three main elements \u2014the spirit, the body, and the peri-spirit (which connects the other two and allows the spirit to act on matter); 2) the idea that the physical phenomena of mediumship (e.g., materializations, movements of objects without contact, etc.) may be explained through the action of the peri-spirit which utilizes the animal magnetic fluid of both the departed spirit and the medium; and 3) the doctrine of reincarnation that posits the repeated return of the spirit to earthly existence (this doctrine was quite foreign to spiritualism in America, England, and Germany). Le livre des esprits, Rivail's first work on the subject of spiritualism which lays out his basic doctrine, was extremely influential not only in France, but in other countries as well. Topics discussed include the vital principle, the nature of spirits, reincarnation, the communication of departed spirits with this world, the occupations of the spirits in the other world, and the moral implications of these tenets.

Azam, a physician and psychological investigator, having become acquainted with Braid's work, experimented with hypnotism and suggestion in the treatment of emotional disturbance. This article, in which Azam communicates the results of his first experiments, helped lead to the serious investigation of Braid's approach in France. Azam hoped, as did others at the time, that by using the term \"hypnotism\" rather than \"animal magnetism\" a fresh attitude could be brought to the investigation of trance phenomena, one free of the negative associations some had with mesmerism. Eventually Azam become a friend of Braid, who, three days before his death in 1860, sent Azam his last manuscript with an inscription of esteem. This manuscript, never published in English, eventually ended up in the possession of Wilhelm Preyer (1841-1897) who published a German version in Die Entdeckung des Hypnotismus (1881).

Taking note of the optimism of Velpeau, Broca, and Azam concerning the use of hypnotism to render a patient insensible, the authors undertook to confirm its efficacy for themselves. Through eighteen trials they found only one patient who became insensible to a significant degree, and that patient they considered to be hysterical. From this the authors conclude that magnetic sleep, magnetic somnambulism and hypnotism are the same phenomenon manifested in varying degrees, and that their efficacy is dependent on a condition of hysteria or near-hysteria in the patient. This conclusion is strikingly close to that which Charcot and the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re school will reach many years later. Despite this conclusion, however, the authors still consider hypnotism to be a useful tool for treating nervous disorders, and the main part of the treatise is spent discussing that application. They also state that looking at a brilliant object is not necessary for the induction of hypnotism. All that is needed is a Dunand, a Parisian physician, here discusses somnambulism and takes note of the \"hypnotic\" theory of Braid, then new to the French.

In their experiments, mesmerists encountered many phenomena that had traditionally been explained in occult or spiritist terms, and a number of mesmerists considered themselves the true inheritors of that tradition. While they believed the phenomena that occurred in the occult tradition to be genuine, because they themselves encountered similar phenomena, they strove to explain them in more \"naturalistic\" terms. In this book Morin expresses this viewpoint and uses the findings of the magnetists to shed light on the true nature of occult phenomena. The first half of the book is an exposition of animal magnetism and the many different forms it has taken in practice. It includes an excellent study of somnambulism and somnambulistic clairvoyance.

London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts & Green, 1863, xvi + 288 pp. One of the most spectacular mediums of the nineteenth century, D. D. Home was born in Scotland and grew up in the United States. At the age of thirteen, he began to have psychic experiences and became preoccupied with the issue of life beyond death. He soon progressed beyond clairvoyant and precognitive experiences to physical mediumship, apparently producing remarkable physical effects in the presence of numerous witnesses. In 1855 Home travelled to England where he spent the rest of his life, with numerous excursions to Europe. He exercised his now famous mediumship in the living rooms of the well-to-do and the parlors of the powerful throughout England and the continent, including Russia. Home was a highly cultured man, and considered a charming and entertaining (although somewhat vain) conversationalist. Among the feats routinely performed by Home were levitations and elongations of his body, materializations of objects, such as flowers, fire-immunity, movement of heavy objects without contact, and production of mysterious lights. William Crookes studied Home in Crookes's own laboratory to ascertain whether Home's phenomena were genuine. Crookes' conclusion was that an as yet unknown psychic force was at work that produced measurable effects (see Crookes, entry numbers [938](#e938) and [959](#e959)). Home was accused by contemporaries of using tricks to produce his effects, and to this day there are magicians who claim they can reproduce some of them. But in all the years Home practiced his mediumship, and in the variety of settings in which he performed his feats, Home was never detected in fraud. Incidents in My Life is the first of two autobiographical works, the second being Incidents in My Life. Second series, 1872 (entry number [948](#e948)). They are a valuable, although self-serving, source of information about the life of this unusual man. The first book covers Home's life from his birth in 1833 to the death of his first wife, Alexandrina, in 1862.

Paris and Nancy: Victor Masson et fils (Paris) and Nicolas Grosjean (Nancy), 1866, 535 pp. Li\u00e9beault is one of the most important figures in the history of hypnotism. In 1848, while engaged in his medical studies, Li\u00e9beault read a book on animal magnetism and was immediately intrigued. He successfully mesmerized a few people, but did not take the experiment any further at that time. He received his medical degree in 1850 and began a rural practice. In 1860 he learned of the experiments with Braid's hypnotism performed by Eug\u00e8ne Azam (1822-1899) (see Azam, entry number [812](#e812)), and decided to see if it could be of use to him in his medical practice. Looking for willing subjects, he announced to his clientelle that patients who agreed to treatment by hypnotism would not be charged. He soon had many patients to experiment with, and for the next few years developed his own unique approach to hypnotic therapeutics. Li\u00e9beault looked on hypnotic sleep as identical to natural sleep, except that the hypnotized patient is placed in that condition by an operator and is subject to a rapport with that person. Li\u00e9beault became a master of hypnotising patients, and attempted the cure of a great variety of illnesses. His healing technique centered around suggestion. While the patient was in a state of hypnotic sleep, Li\u00e9beault would make simple curative suggestions appropriate to the disease. These suggestions would negate the symptoms of the disease and inculcate good habits of health maintenance. In 1864, Li\u00e9beault moved to Nancy and took some time to write a book on his work; the result was Du sommeil. Here he describes his method of hypnotic induction and the various states that result. He speculates on the effects that hypnotic suggestion has on the nervous system and how healing through hypnotism takes place. Li\u00e9beault also writes about the hallucinations (sometimes of spirits) that can accompany somnambulism and the central role of suggestion in creating them. There is a widely circulated tale that only one copy of Du sommeil was sold in the first edition (there was a second edition called Le sommeil provoqu\u00e9 et les \u00e9tats analogues, in 1889), but that story is probably apocryphal. In any case, Li\u00e9beault's book was not popular and he was virtually unknown among medical men for many years. Li\u00e9beault's work was eventually noted by Hippolyte Bernheim (1840-1919), then professor of medicine at Nancy. Bernheim was very impressed by Li\u00e9beault and introduced his methods into the Nancy medical hospital. The result was instant fame for Li\u00e9beault and his theory. Li\u00e9beault and Bernheim drew a small group together around them, including Henri Beaunis (1830-1921) and Jules Li\u00e9geois (1833-1908), and formed the Nancy school of hypnotism, with its emphasis on suggestion as the essential cause of hypnotic effects. The influence of this school rapidly spread throughout Europe and remained a strong force for decades. The Nancy school was opposed principally by the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re school of hypnotism, title variant: Organe de l'Institut magn\u00e9tologique de par des Sciences Vienne; Flammarion, (1866), lix + 102 pp. A Colonel of the French army and Administrator of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique of Paris, de Rochas was one of the most prolific and important French writers in the field of animal magnetism and psychical research, with at least a dozen books to his credit.

This book, his first on psychical research, covers such subjects as the odic charge, the mechanical effects of human emanations on the human organism, the imposition of hands, and table turning.

Wallace had heard about table turning and table rapping off and on for a number of years, but in 1865 he had an occasion for firsthand experience. The results of these first encounters with the paranormal were compelling enough to lead him to investigate other mediumistic phenomena and he eventually became a convinced spiritualist, writing a number of books in its defense. This is his first work in the area of spiritualism and psychical research. Here he states the case for an objective, scientifically based study of the phenomena of mediumship. [P] 1867 901.

Savy, 1868, xviii + 616 pp. An extremely significant contribution to the development of thought concerning artificial somnambulism and automatism. Despine distinguishes four kinds of automatism: 1) those acts that, after many repetitions under the direction of the \"I,\" are performed solely by the organic \"automaton\" (e.g., running); 2) instinctive acts performed in connection with consciously intended acts (e.g., gestures while talking); 3) acts performed out of rapport or separately from conscious psychic activity simultaneously taking place (e.g., walking while thinking about a mathematical problem); and 4) acts performed by the organic \"automation\" while the psychic function of the brain or the \"I\" is suspended (e.g., actions carried out during artificial somnambulism). Insisting that actions may be automatic and yet \"intelligent,\" Despine argues that one may produce intelligent acts that do not involve the psychic functions of the brain or the \"I.\" One need not believe that \"the intervention of the spirit is necessary in all intelligent acts of man\" (p. 536). And, conversely, \"to admit, with the animists, that the spirit acts without knowing it, without consciousness, is an absurdity\" (p. 536). (In this, Despine anticipates Freud's view of unconscious intelligence.) Intelligence, Despine suggests, can manifest without personality, resulting from obedience to organic laws to which it is subject. From this view of automatism, Despine infers that in somnambulistic action there is a paralysis of the brain and so a non-participation of the \"I\" or the spirit. For that reason our understanding of the nature of somnambulistic amnesia must be revised. Somnambulistic acts are produced by the nervous system isolated from the brain, and therefore from the \"I.\" The \"I\" does not \"forget\" what has been done while in a somnambulistic state. Rather the \"I\" is not involved in the action in the first place and so never has knowledge of the action. (In this, Despine anticipates Pierre Janet's notion of dissociation.)

Philadelphia: Barclay & Co., 1869, (2) + 43-329 pp. Fahnestock, a physician from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, carried out many of his own experiments concentrating on the higher phenomena of magnetic somnambulism. He believed that through animal magnetism the deeper powers of seeing, hearing, and smell could be actualized and these senses made to operate at any distance. He was an adherent of a particular view of animal magnetism promoted by LaRoy of the Unconscious; Speculative Results According to the Inductive Method of Physical Science. 3 vols. Translated by William C. Coupland. London: Trubner & Co., 1884. Von Hartmann was a brilliant German philosopher and original thinker whose writings strongly influenced the development of our modern notion of the unconscious. This book is the most important of his works. It went through many editions and appeared in various structural formats, from this one volume form, to a two volume edition, and finally a three volume edition, the third volume being a collection of later essays. Von Hartmann posits an intelligent but blind dynamic reality that underlies all existence, and he calls that reality the \"unconscious.\" He begins his work with an examination of the unconscious as it manifests itself in the realm of organic life, particularly the organic life of animals. He contends that the activity of the mind we call \"willing\" is not the exclusive property of man, but is also participated in by animals. Von Hartmann even attributes will to the various parts of the organism, so that there are many independent wills spread throughout the body. The acts of will constantly manifested in the human organism are ordinarily not part of our conscious awareness. This means that in human beings both instinctive action and clairvoyant intuition are rightly considered manifestations of the universal unconscious will. Throughout the rest of the work von Hartmann develops this notion of the unconscious, arriving at three principal manifestations or layers: 1) the absolute unconscious that is the substance of the universe and underlies all other forms of the unconscious, 2) the physiological unconscious present in the vital actions of living organisms, and 3) the psychological unconscious which is the basis for our conscious mental activity.

The London Dialectical Society was a sophisticated debating society whose purpose it was to afford a hearing to subjects that were ostracized elsewhere. The stature of the individuals named to the committee appointed to study the matter assured that its findings would be given serious consideration by the public. The committee proceeded to gather evidence both from testimony and from direct experimentation. Letters and verbal testimony were received for and against the genuineness of the phenomena in question. The list of those making contributions included some of the great intellectual lights of the day and some of the best known spiritualist mediums. A subcommittee formed to carry out direct experimentation with the physical phenomena of spiritualism produced findings that were presented at the beginning of the report. The subcommittee established to its satisfaction that sounds were produced and movements of heavy bodies took place without any muscular action or mechanical contrivance. The report of the committee, basically favorable to the genuineness of the phenomena, was not accepted by the Dialectical Society as a whole and so was published by the committee on its own authority.

A Treatise on Dreams, Second Sight, Somnambulism, Magnetic Sleep, Spiritual Manifestations, Hallucinations, and Spectral Visions. London: R. Hardwicke, 1871, 148 (1872-1887). Charcot was one of the most highly respected neurologists of the nineteenth century. After successfully investigating a number of neurological conditions, he became particularly interested in hysteria. In 1878 he began to experiment with hypnotism, using as his subjects a number of hysterical women in his care at the Hospice de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re. In the course of this research, discussed in the Le\u00e7ons, Charcot described three \"stages\" of hypnotism: lethargy, catalepsy, and somnambulism, each with its characteristic symptoms. Believing that these stages came in regular succession and were consistently present in hypnotic induction, Charcot held that the stages were organically determined and not the result of suggestion and that hypnotism was a pathological phenomenon, an artificially created neurosis very similar to hysteria. Charcot next turned his attention to traumatic paralysis. Noting that traumatic paralysis differed from organic paralysis but seemed to be identical with the hysterical paralysis he had observed in his patients, he succeeded in using hypnotic suggestion to reproduce the symptoms of paralysis resulting from trauma. From this he concluded that the shock of the trauma produced a spontaneous hypnotic state, and that in this state the individual induced the paralytic symptom through autosuggestion. Charcot's view of hypnotism, that it is an organically determined condition essentially related to hysteria, exerted a considerable influence on psychological investigators and became the core doctrine of the \"Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re school\" of hypnotism which, along with the rival \"Nancy school\" founded by Li\u00e9beault and Bernheim, defined the late nineteenth-century French hypnotic tradition.

Hearing of a man who had been cured of rheumatism by the shock of being in a railway accident, Tuke decided to devote his attention to the influence of the mind upon the body. The resultant work which contains numerous case illustrations, investigates the influence of the mind, the emotions, and the will on the nervous and muscular systems, and then takes up the influence of the mind on the body in the cure of disease. In along discussion of the nature of imagination and its part in the process, Tuke compares the adherents of animal magnetism (mesmerism) to those who see purely psychological forces operating in magnetic healing (braidism).

[P] 958. [Timmler, William.](#Crookes.W) Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism (Reprinted from the Quarterly Journal of Science). London: J. Burns, 1874, 112 pp. This small volume is a landmark publication in the history of psychical research. It contains an account of experiments to assess the existence of a \"psychic force\" carried out by one of the most respected scientists of the nineteenth century. Crookes was a genius of scientific invention and original thought. He first became well known when, at the age of twenty-nine, he discovered the element thallium. He went on to become the inventor of the radiometer, the spinthariscope, and the Crookes vacuum tube, which was instrumental in the discovery of X-rays. He was founder of the Chemical News and editor of The Quarterly Journal of Science between July 1871 and June 1874. In 1871, Crookes began his investigations into telekinetic \"psychic force\" by carrying out some experiments with the famous medium D. D. Home (1833-1886). Using many different types of apparatus, he eventually confirmed unequivocally the existence of a force which could move objects and apply pressure at a distance from the apparent source of that force. In the Researches he gives a detailed account of the construction of the apparatus used and of other physical circumstances of the experiments. Crookes's Researches made a powerful impression on the minds of intellectuals of his day and did much to create a climate receptive to the establishment of the Society for Psychical Research in pp. Mesnet examines the state of the senses and memory in those suffering from \"pathological somnambulism.\" He also discusses moral and legal implications of pathological susceptibility to suggestion.

He also discusses the moral teachings of spiritualism, which he considers to be of a lofty nature and concludes with a plea for a serious and open-minded consideration of the subject.

Taking most of his data from his own personal observations and from those of medical men, he concludes that mediumistic trance and mesmeric trance are identical and that both the mental and physical phenomena of mediumship are \"morbid nervous phenomena.\" By this, Fairfield does not mean to deny the genuineness of such phenomena but only to indicate that they should be attributed neither to the intervention of spirits, nor to a \"psychic force\" such us that posited by William Crookes. Rather they are an extension of certain abnormal neurological events which result in psychic and physical action at a distance. [P] 974.

Initially opposed to spiritualism, Moses was led, through the interest of some respected friends, to investigate it more closely and soon observed things which he considered to be powerful evidence that discarnate spirits exist and communicate with the living. Less than a year after his first encounter with spiritualistic phenomena, Moses himself began to have psychic experiences and proved to be a powerful medium, regularly producing remarkable physical phenomena witnessed by many in his own home. Among others, these phenomena included repeated levitation of his own body, the appearance of lights, apports, the production of musical sounds, the mysterious appearance of writing on paper, and the movement of heavy physical objects without contact. Moses also produced a great volume of automatic writing, purportedly coming from spirits. This writing was of a cogency and moral quality that impressed many who were not inclined towards spiritualism. The Slade Case is a pamphlet that concerns itself with a controversial American medium, Henry Slade, who produced striking physical phenomena, but often under questionable circumstances. [P] 998.

London: Allen years after his first important article on artificial somnambulism (see entry number [977](#e977)), this treatise is Richet's attempt once and for all to establish the reality and scientific importance of artificial somnambulism for still-skeptical members of the medical profession. Richet identifies three degrees of artificial somnambulism: torpor, excitation, and stupor. He states that somnambulism, properly speaking, begins with the second phase. In that phase the individual is subject to hallucinations, suggestions, and automatisms of various kinds. In the third phase an anesthesia may be produced that is complete enough to allow surgical operations. Richet also discusses the various techniques that may be employed to produce artificial somnambulism, including the fixation of the eyes, the use of a shiny object, a sudden shock of the senses, and the passes of animal magnetism. He uses this discussion of technique as a starting point for examining the various explanations of the intrinsic nature and cause of artificial somnambulism, but he does not come down in favor of any one theory.

Impressed by the success of an acquaintance in magnetically healing infants whose intellectual development was insufficient to permit the effects of suggestion, the pioneer of suggestion asked himself whether there might not after all also be a physical agent involved in producing the effects of animal magnetism. Attempting to test the possibility that a physical agent might account for the magnetizer's success with younger children, Li\u00e9beault carried out his own experiments with infants. Much to his surprise he discovered that the action of magnetic passes produced a noticeable beneficial effect upon the infants. He ruled out the explanation that heat or pressure produced the effects, and concluded that, in addition to the effects of suggestion, there exists a \"nervous action\" transmitted from one individual to another by vibrations.

Personality must, he says, be distinguished from the \"I.\" An individual may have more than one personality, but only one \"I.\" Somnambulists may exhibit many personalities, but they are all attributed to one \"I.\" Richet insists that the \"I\" endures permanently, while personalities may be abolished with the onset of amnesia. Richet also discusses what he calls \"unconscious memory\" (m\u00e9moire inconsciente), which is a memory that functions in the individual, although it is completely outside of conscious awareness. Examples of this phenomenon taken from experiments with somnambulists show, in Richet's opinion, that our acts can be determined by causes entirely unknown to us.

In this work he discusses mental pathology, hysteria, and dreams, and puts forward an unusual thesis concerning the independent function of the two hemispheres of the brain. He believes that each hemisphere constitutes a complete and separate organ. This, he states, makes possible hemicerebral hypnotism and doubling of the personality. [H] 1080. 110 pp. Bernheim, Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of Nancy, with a scientific reputation for research on typhoid fever and heart disease, began in 1882 to develop an interest in hysteria and hypnotism. He heard about the work of the physician Ambroise Li\u00e9beault (1823-1904), whose original book on hypnotism was virtually unknown in the medical world (see Du sommeil et des \u00e9tats analogues, entry number [896](#e896)), but whose success in using hypnotic techniques to treat patients was difficult to ignore. Bernheim visited Li\u00e9beault to observe his approach and form his own opinion about the results. He was greatly impressed by what he saw and immediately tried Li\u00e9beault's technique himself. He soon came to the conclusion that hypnotism was not an appendage of hysteria, as the then prevailing theory of Jean Martin Charcot (1825-1893) had indicated, but a psychological state in its own right, one intimately connected with suggestion. Two years later, having continued to work closely with Li\u00e9beault, Bernheim published this book, the fundamental statement of his theory of hypnotism. Bernheim and Li\u00e9beault combined their researches and formed what came to be known as the Nancy school of hypnotism, and De la suggestion may rightly be considered the foundation work of that school. Bernheim begins the book with a description of his method of hypnotic induction. He then lists Li\u00e9beault's six degrees of hypnotic sleep and, from his own experience, reclassifies those stages, noting nine in all. Bernheim then enters into a detailed discussion of the nature of suggestion and presents a definition of hypnotism: the induction of a peculiar psychical condition which increases the susceptibility to suggestion. Next Bernheim discusses the phenomena associated with hypnotic sleep, including automatic movement, automatic obedience, suggested hallucinations during hypnotic sleep, and post-hypnotic hallucinations. After some words about somnambulism and double personality, Bernheim notes the physiological effects produced by hypnotism. This is followed by a discussion of suggestion in the waking state and an answer to the criticisms leveled against his views by Charcot and the men at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re. Bernheim then provides abrief history of animal magnetism and hypnotism up to his own time. Next there is an important chapter on automatisms and suggestion and a concluding discussion of the moral and legal aspects of hypnotic suggestion. With De la suggestion the stage is set for the controversy between Bernheim and Li\u00e9beault and their followers at Nancy, and Charcot and his followers at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, with the Nancy school insisting that all the phenomena of hypnotism arise from suggestion, and the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re school claiming that the phenomena of hypnotism are based on physiological processes that create an artificial neurosis comparable to an hysterical attack. This controversy was pivotal to the discussion of the theory of hypnotism for many years. [H] C. C. Massey. London: George Redway, 1889. On somnambulism and its implications for understanding the nature of human consciousness. Although the work is philosophical in orientation, Du Prel bases his analysis on a broad foundation of experimentation with somnambulistic states. Du Prel speaks about the division of the ego which is observed not only in somnambulism, but also in more ordinary experiences such as dreams. This division or splitting of the ego leads to the conclusion that human beings are very complex, with an unconscious component that determines much of what happens in conscious life. In his discussion of the unconscious, the influence of Kant, Schopenhauer, and Eduard von Hartmann can be discerned. But Du Prel's examination of somnambulism and the nature of consciousness takes him a step beyond their speculations. [H] 1083.

[P] for Psychical Research Proceedings 2 (1884): 217-37. F. W. H. Myers was one of the most important psychical researchers of the late nineteenth century. He was a founder of the Society for Psychical Research, a poet, a classical scholar, and considered by some to be one of the most significant psychologists of the time. Driven by the need to determine what can be discovered empirically about the nature of human personality and its possible survival of death, Myers devoted his considerable energies to the investigation of all phenomena that might clarify those issues. He investigated somnambulists, mediums, and all types of psychic and psychological phenomena. Myers originated a number of terms that came to be used commonly by psychical researchers, such as: \"telepathy,\" \"supernormal,\" and \"veridical.\" In this article, Myers examines the phenomenon of automatic writing to try to discover whether, as the spiritualists claimed, the writer conveys messages from the spirits of the dead. He concludes that unless there is content completely unknown to the writer, there is no reason to assume that anything more than the unconscious self of the writer is involved in the process. If, he says, there is evidence of material coming through automatic writing that could not have been obtained through normal means, it is still not established that spirits are at work. Telepathy may be a sufficient explanation. This article is a good example of the kind of critical thinking and good writing so characteristic of Myers. [P] 1091.

He attributes everything to the minds of the medium and sitters, suggesting that some of the phenomena are due to the action of a \"nerve force\" that can produce mechanical effects. The apparent intelligence operating in these instances is due, says Hartmann, to the unconscious operation of the medium's unrealized somnambulistic consciousness, working outside the awareness of the normal consciousness.

The first part of this work is a republication of Bernheim's De la In this part Bernheim views the nature of hypnotism in sharp contrast to that of Jean Martin Charcot (1825-1893) which was dominant at the time. Charcot believed hypnotism to be a pathological condition based on physiological processes, an artificial neurosis found only in hysterics. Bernheim, on the other hand, sees hypnotism as a purely psychological condition, one essentially related to suggestion. His definition of hypnotism is: the induction of a peculiar psychical condition which increases the susceptibility to suggestion. This basic difference of opinion constitutes the core of the dispute that would continue for many years between the followers of Charcot (the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re school of hypnotism) and the followers of Bernheim (the Nancy school of hypnotism). In the second part of the book, Bernheim discusses suggestion as a therapeutic agent. Beginning with a look at the traditional role of the imagination in healing through the ages, Bernheim places modern suggestive therapeutics in that historical stream. This introduction is followed by a long section on cases of specific illnesses Bernheim treated through hypnotic suggestion or through waking suggestion (Bernheim insists that the hypnotic state is not essential for effective treatment through suggestion). The book concludes with a chapter on the dangers to be guarded against in the use of hypnotism and suggestion.

It was published with the sanction of the Society for Psychical Research and was the result of a long and laborious collection of firsthand evidence of psychic occurrences. Myers was responsible for the lengthy introduction and the forty page \"Note on a Suggested Mode of Psychical Interaction\" in the second volume; Podmore collected and sifted through a large part of the evidence used in the book; and Gurney wrote all of the text apart from the sections done by Myers. As Myers says in the Introduction, the work embraces all transmissions of thought and feeling from one person to another by means other than through the recognized channels of sense, and this includes apparitions. Myers had already coined the word \"telepathy\" to denote these transmissions. The authors included apparitions of the living in this study, but excluded apparitions of the dead. The area of investigation is in this way limited to mind-to-mind transmissions between living persons. In Myers's introductory remarks, he undertakes to show how a study of these phenomena must be approached if it is to be scientific. He points out that in the literature of all ages there have been references to experiences which are, at least at first glance, \"supernormal\" (another term coined by Myers). The question is how to determine whether or not such events may be explained in terms of known factors and laws. His answer is to tackle the problem by examining contemporary data for which firsthand witnesses are available. That is precisely what the Society for Psychical Research did. Phantasms of the Living is the result of their findings. Approximately two thousand cases were considered to be well enough attested to be used in the study. Along with these data, the investigators examined experiments with telepathy carried out under controlled conditions. The results were summarized in three points: 1) experiments show that telepathy is a fact of nature; 2) testimony proves that phantasms (impressions, voices, or figures) of people who are undergoing some crisis (particularly death) are perceived by individuals close to them with a frequency which mere chance cannot explain; and 3) these phantasms, whatever else they may be, are instances of supersensory action of one mind on another. The bulk of the two volumes is devoted to presenting and commenting on the data of telepathy and phantasms collected by the Society. Gurney begins with some notes of caution concerning the implications of the findings. He then moves on to chapters on experiments in thought transference, spontaneous telepathy, transference of mental pictures and of motor effects, dreams, hypnagogic images, hallucinations, chance coincidence, cases with single and multiple percipients, and collective cases. There is a large supplement which includes additional cases from most categories covered previously. Never before or since Phantasms of the Living had such a massive, well thought out, and well written piece of research been produced in the field of psychical research. [P] 1145. 200-203. One of a number of important articles written in 1886 on the subject of the induction of somnambulism at a distance. H\u00e9ricourt describes one such case that occurred in 1878. The somnambulist was a twenty-four year old Revue philosophique 22 (1886): 577-92. The first of three important articles on unconscious acts occurring during somnambulism (see \"L'anesth\u00e9sie [1211](#e1211)) and the first of many writings that would establish Janet as the preeminent explorer of the \"subconscious\" (a term that Janet coined to designate the realm of mental activity outside conscious awareness) and a psychologist of great stature. Janet stands at the meeting point between the animal magnetic tradition, with its discovery and exploration of artificial somnambulism, and the great modern psychological systems. His early works strongly affected the thinking of Richet, Ochorowitz, and F. W. H. Myers and were important sources for Freud, Jung, and Adler. In this article, which explores actions deriving from a source outside the awareness of the individual who performs them, Janet discusses suggestions made in the hypnotic state and the products of automatic writing to see what light they throw on subconscious processes. He also notes the apparent creation of a secondary personality by means of suggestion and calls this and related phenomena the \"doubling of the personality.\" Janet's master work, L'automatisme psychologique (1889, entry number [1235](#e1235)), brought to fruition ideas put forward in this and the two articles that followed.

This second set of experiments, performed with additional precautions, was successful. [H & This article reproduces a talk given by Janet at a meeting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie Physiologique under the presidency of Charcot in late 1885. Janet was at that time already engaged in the investigations with somnambulism that would culminate in three important articles on the subject published in the Revue philosophique from 1886 to 1888 (q.v.). In this talk he tells of experiments done with a certain Madame B who was very susceptible to being put in the somnambulistic state and a good subject for experiments. Janet talks about a peculiarity that began to occur as he and others worked with her. They discovered what seemed to be an unusual responsiveness to the thoughts of the person who put her into the trance state, so much so that it seemed she could be made somnambulistic by the operator's merely thinking about it. To test this matter some experiments were tried in which the operator was in another location at some distance from the house of the somnambulist and he attempted to entrance her at set times unknown to her. The experiments proved successful to the degree that Janet thought the phenomenon worthy of further study. Janet offered no theory as to how this was possible. Fratelli Bocca, 1886, [H] 1150.

This article contains Myers's personal observations of experiments done by Pierre Janet and a Doctor Gilbert at Havre in 1886 to determine whether it is possible to induce a state of hypnotic trance in a subject separated from the operator by a considerable distance. He points out that mesmerists had for a long time claimed to be able to use animal magnetism at great distances, since they believed that the magnetic influence that proceeds from their fingers and eyes could operate through any physical obstacle. Myers also states that many \"suggestionists\" (those who follow the teachings of Li\u00e9beault and Bernheim) also claim to be able to exercise their suggestive power at great distances. Myers believes, however, that both schools of thought have been insufficiently critical in their observations and in their use of terms to bring the discussion to a definite conclusion. From the experiments done at Havre and the evidence of other observers, Myers concludes that telepathic hypnotism at a distance may be possible. In this process of discussing the issue, Myers provides a useful sketch of the possible modes of induction of hypnotic phenomena.

Balli\u00e8re et fils, 1887, 284 pp. A work significant for establishing a firm connection between multiple personality and the somnambulistic state. Dr. Azam was a professor of surgery at the Bordeau Medical School and the first in France to reproduce the hypnotic experiments of Braid. Here, he describes the results of his study of one of the most remarkable cases of multiple personality yet recorded: that of Felida X. He first met Felida when she was a young girl in 1858, and he was still observing her in 1887 when the book was published. Felida had two distinct personalities, each with its own characteristics. One was called her \"primary personality,\" the other her \"secondary condition\"\u2014which Azam considered to be a state of total somnambulism. In her secondary condition Felida exhibited personality traits very different from those of her primary personality. Although her primary personality could not remember anything of what happened while she was in her secondary condition, her secondary self had full memory of both states. This \"d\u00e9doublement de la personnalit\u00e9,\" as Azam termed it, continued throughout Felida's lifetime. Over the years the secondary personality gradually gained the upper hand, so that eventually her primary personality showed itself only rarely. Throughout the book, Azam points out the similarities between Felida's secondary condition and the state of artificial somnambulism as described by Braid. The connection between dual personality and somnambulism had been made before.

To throw light on moral and legal responsibility of the hypnotic subject, Gilles de la Tourette then examines what he calls states \"analogous\" to hypnotism, principally natural somnambulism, hysteria, and dual personality. In the next section of the book, the author investigates the benefits and dangers of hypnotism, emphasizing the responsibility of the hypnotizer for making the situation safe. The final section takes up important legal aspects of hypnotic practice: hypnotism and the commission of crimes, the possible abuse of the public through hypnotic demonstrations, the legal regulation of hypnotism, and the sexual violation of hypnotic subjects.

The second of three important articles written by Janet for the Revue philosophique on subjects relating to \"doubling of the personality\" and dissociated acts. In this article he concentrates on certain physiological effects of suggestion made to susceptible individuals. These effects include blindness, numbness, and paralysis. He also discusses experiments done with what Bernheim called \"negative hallucinations\" in which certain objects or individuals are made to disappear from the perception of the subject through suggestion. All these conditions are included by Janet under the term \"anaesthesias.\" They are, says Janet, examples of experiences being \"dissociated\" from the conscious awareness of the individual but remaining within the purview of \"another consciousness\" different from the individual's primary consciousness. Janet's use of the word \"dissociation\" with this particular meaning seems to be the first such use in the literature of modern psychology. In this article Janet also begins to form the outlines of a psychotherapy based upon the bringing of problematic dissociated material into the primary consciousness. [H] 1177.

The phenomenon was first noted in the tradition of animal magnetism in 1784 in Puys\u00e9gur's Memoires (see entry number [105](#e105)) where Puys\u00e9gur speaks of being able to communicate his wishes mentally to his patient, the peasant Victor Race. From that time on, literally hundreds of magnetizers noted the same phenomenon, and it became one of the most controversial aspects of animal magnetism discussed in the literature of the subject. In this study, Ochorowicz attempts to deal definitively with the issue not only by recounting the experiences of others, but principally through his own painstaking experiments. His conclusion is that mental suggestion is a reality and must be taken into account in any adequate theory of human psychology. Included in the book is a detailed description of the experiments conducted by Janet assisted by Ochorowicz, F. W. H. Myers, and others at Havre concerning suggestion at a distance. These experiments and related experiences were described in articles appearing in the Revue philosophique in 1886 written by Janet, Gley, H\u00e9ricourt, Richet and Beaunis. Ochorowicz also includes a long section on possible explanations of the phenomena of mental suggestion. [H & 1887-1888. Published in Paris, this periodical describes itself as a monthly that treats magnetism, braidism, hypnotism, fascination, hypnosis, ecstasy, suggestion, somnambulism (both natural and artificial), lethargy and catalepsy, legal medicine, physiological psychology, the study of psychic substances, nervous phenomena, mental illnesses, metalloscopy and metallotherapy, and moral and therapeutic applications.

Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1887, 160 pp. Henry Seybert, a spiritualist, left a bequest of $60,000 to the University of Pennsylvania to be used for the maintenance of a chair to be known as the \"Adam Seybert Chair of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy,\" with the condition that the incumbent, either alone or with a commission of the university faculty, make a study of all religious systems, particularly modern spiritualism. A commission was appointed and began its work in 1884, resulting in this Report. It studied a number of mediums firsthand over a period of three years. The representative of the testator on the commission repeatedly protested that certain members had as their only object the discrediting of spiritualism. He requested that those members be removed, but they were not. The findings of the commission were totally negative. An appendix contains a controversial discussion of the sanity of Prof. Johann Z\u00f6llner, a German professor of physics and astronomy who investigated the American medium Henry Slade. Spiritualists claimed that the intentions of Mr. Seybert were never fairly carried out. [P] 1192. [Theobald, Morell.](#Theobald.M) Spirit Workers in the Home Circle.

Margaret made the explanation, stating that she and Kate had made the \"spirit\" sounds by cracking their joints. Kate was present, but made no comment. A short time after the \"expos\u00e9,\" Kate stated in a letter that the sisters (both subject to alcoholism) were out of money, and the public confession had netted them a thousand-dollar fee. She goes on to say that she (Kate) could perhaps now bring in an income by proving Margaret's expos\u00e9 to be false. The whole affair had been initiated when Margaret had agreed to work with Reuben Davenport on the confession. Shortly after the public meeting, his book, embodying the expos\u00e9, was published.

In the last of three important articles written by Janet for the Revue philosophique from 1886 to 1888, he discusses four kinds of acts that can be unconsciously performed by an individual: 1) those inculcated by posthypnotic suggestion, 2) those inculcated through anaesthesia, 3) those inculcated through \"distraction,\" and 4) those produced spontaneously. He then continues to investigate the phenomenon of \"doubling of the personality\" and the kinds of amnesia involved. This becomes a particularly intriguing question when the investigator discovers, as did Janet, more than one \"secondary\" or somnambulistic personality in an individual. In describing the individual's actions in this state, Janet speaks of the person acting unconsciously or \"subconsciously\" and of \"subconscious acts.\" This seems to be Janet's first use of the term \"subconscious,\" which was to become pivotal to his subsequent writings and so influential to those who would carry out similar investigations.

Delboeuf was a successful practitioner of medical hypnotism and an acute observer of the psychological factors involved in hypnotic phenomena. An independent thinker who wanted to observe matters for himself, he visited both the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re and Nancy to see how they conducted their hypnotic experiments. In this work he begins with a description of his earlier visit to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, expressing strong criticism of the methods used there. He was keenly aware of the suggestibility of the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re subjects and felt their responses in states of hypnotism were unknowingly conditioned by the observers. His view of the work of Li\u00e9beault and Bernheim is more sympathetic, although he believes they underrate the intelligence and awareness of their subjects. The book also has a section on the views of Li\u00e9geois on moral and legal aspects Discusses the double (or multiple) streams of consciousness revealed by experiments in dissociation to be present in all people. Evidence for this phenomenon is taken from the data of hypnotism, hysteria, and the automatisms (such as automatic writing) associated with normal individuals.

In this book he writes about the practical application of both animal magnetism and hypnotism. In the latter area he was strongly influenced by the school of Charcot. [H] 1231. Forel, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Zurich and Director of the Burgh\u00f6lzli mental hospital, was well known for his work on the anatomy of the brain. He became interested in hypnotic phenomena and in 1887 visited Bernheim to study his technique. Forel became very adept at hypnotism and used it in his psychiatric work and as a treatment for physical illnesses. The main part of this work appeared as an article in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Gesammte Strafrechtswissenschaft and is concerned largely with the forensic aspects of hypnotism. Following the approach of the Nancy school of hypnotism, Forel emphasizes the place of suggestion in the induction of hypnotism and the implications of suggestion for personality responsibility on the part of the hypnotized. The book became very well known and was often revised and augmented, soon reaching editions of several hundred pages. [H] 1233. [Gibier, Paul.](#Gibier.P) Physiologie transcendantale.

It is a fine piece of research that influenced virtually all later research on the subject. At the same time, this book can be considered the summation and culmination of the best of the research on animal magnetism, somnambulism, and hypnotism that had preceeded it. Although his approach was innovative, Janet was aware of his indebtedness to that tradition. Written as a thesis for a doctorate in philosophy at the Sorbonne, this was Janet's first full length book, the continuation of a line of investigation begun in his three important articles published in 1886, 1887, and 1888 in the Revue philosophique (see entry numbers [1146](#e1146), [1176](#e1176), [1211](#e1211)). Here he examines those human acts which, while bearing the earmarks of intelligence, yet bypass the will and escape conscious awareness. Janet calls these acts \"psychological automatisms.\" To clarify the subject, he divides the book into two parts: the first dealing with total automatisms, and the second with partial automatisms. The first part treats of catalepsy and somnambulism, and contains an important chapter on suggestion. The second part includes discussions of distraction and subconscious acts, post-hypnotic suggestion, hysterical anesthesias, and \"psychological disaggregation.\" As examples of the latter, Janet examines the topics of madness, fixed ideas, hallucinations, possessions, and the phenomena of spiritualism. L'automatisme psychologique, with its broad historical scope and original approach to research, provides an important link between the descriptive psychology of the magnetizers who studied somnambulistic automatisms and the scientific psychology of 1236. 1889, 28 pp. on somnambulism and its relationship to spiritualistic mediumship and other extraordinary phenomena. [H & P] avec la Doin, 1889, viii + 758 pp. Li\u00e9geois, an adherent of the Nancy school of hypnotism, was more interested in the forensic than the physiological aspects of hypnotism. Following the techniques of Bernheim, Li\u00e9geois experimented with suggestion and its implications for personal responsibility on the part of the hypnotized subject. He discovered that fifteen to twenty percent of his subjects could be placed in a somnambulistic state, in which they were extremely susceptible to hypnotic and posthypnotic suggestion. While his subjects were somnambulistic, Li\u00e9geois was able to create all sorts of hallucinations and induce various degrees of amnesia. He also experimented with suggestion in the waking state, obtaining striking results. Li\u00e9geois carried out other experiments with hypnotic suggestion, discovering that he was able to get subjects to carry out suggestions at a distance in space (by using the telephone) and at a distance in time (finding that suggestions could be executed long after they were given). Li\u00e9geois's experimentation with criminal suggestions were imaginative and bold, at times crossing beyond the boundaries of human decency. He succeeded in inducing hypnotized individuals to commit what they believed were criminal acts and discovered that, when awakened, they could experience complete amnesia for those actions. He concluded that it is possible for one person, through hypnotic suggestion, to induce another to commit criminal acts which are contrary to the conscience of the hypnotized person. In these cases, the person who made the suggestions should be considered the responsible person and the hypnotized subject should be exonerated. To obtain realism in his experiments, Li\u00e9geois seemed ready to go to great lengths, sometimes showing little concern for the dignity or distress of his subjects. Nevertheless, Li\u00e9geois's work was extremely helpful for forensic psychologists and retains its value today. pp. accepts the three phases of hypnotism taught by Charcot, but divides the third phase into three: hyperesthesia, exaltation, and intelligence.

He worked in cooperation with a number of other investigators in the field, and in the introduction to this book, he expresses his thanks to August Forel and Max Dessoir. Moll begins this work with a brief description of the history of hypnotism in France and Germany, and moves on to an examination of the methods used for hypnotic induction. He then discusses the characteristics of the state of hypnotism, describing both physiological and psychological symptoms. In this section Moll has a discussion of suggestion in which he credits the mesmerists as the discoverers of post-hypnotic suggestion. Moll next takes up the theory of hypnotism and the possibility of simulating the hypnotic state. After examining the medical uses of hypnotism and legal aspects, Moll inquires about the status of animal magnetism, pointing out errors in experiments that have been cited as confirmation of the existence of a magnetic fluid. This work became a very popular general treatise on hypnotism, going through many revised editions over the next twenty-five years. [H & of [H] A.

Because of the censorship of spiritualistic literature in Russia, Aksakov centered his work in Germany. There he founded the Psychische Studien (later called the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Parapsychologie), for decades Germany's chief periodical of psychical research. Aksakov carried out numerous investigations of mediums and translated many works on psychical research into Russian. Animismus und Spiritismus, an important work in the field of psychical research, takes up the issue of whether or not the dead communicate with the living through mediums, and looks into the genuineness of other psychic phenomena. Taking Eduard von Hartmann's Der Spiritismus (1885, entry number [1113](#e1113)), as his point of departure, Aksakov examines the history of the \"anti-spiritists\" and especially von Hartmann's contention that all spiritualistic phenomena can be explained in terms of purely human powers, natural and paranormal. Conceding that natural and paranormal human powers are an important element in the phenomena of spiritualism, Aksakov nonetheless insists that some phenomena can only be explained in terms of the action of spirits. In this he includes both the extra-corporeal action of the spirit of a living person (animism) and outside intervention from disembodied spirits (spiritism). In marshalling his evidence, he brings to bear both his own and others' investigations. Animismus und Spiritismus was originally written in Russian and then translated into French in 1890.

He founded the first laboratory of experimental psychology in the United States (1876) and his monumental Principles of Psychology (1890, entry number [1271](#e1271)) was a major force in shaping modern American psychology. As a philosopher, he developed the doctrine of pragmatism and wrote the extremely influential Varieties of Religious Experience (1902). James was also an important psychical researcher, helping to found the American Society for Psychical Research in 1884 and later serving a term (1894-1895) as president of the Society for Psychical Research in London. His interest in psychical research evolved directly from his psychological studies and his desire to pursue every possible avenue for understanding the nature of the human psyche and its hidden dynamics. Although skeptical when he began his first significant project in psychical research, an investigation in 1885 of the famous American medium, Leonora Piper (1859-1950), James eventually concluded that she possessed some power as yet unexplained. In this important article, James discusses the findings of Janet, Binet, and others concerning the existence of the subconscious. Emphasizing the importance of discoveries of a second stream of consciousness which can be tapped in certain conditions such as the state of hypnotism, James sees in this secondary or, as he calls it, \"submerged consciousness\" a key to understanding such diverse phenomena as possession and multiple personality. He calls the coexistence of a secondary self or selves with the primary self a \"splitting of the mind,\" and urges further investigation to determine more about the relationship between hypnotic trance and these subconscious states.

After an historical review of the use of suggestion in healing among the Egyptians and the Hebrews, Bernheim notes that successful treatment by suggestion can be carried out in the waking state and need not involve hypnotism at all. He follows this with important observations on hallucinations and amnesia, and discusses the problem of the moral responsibility of a subject in the hypnotic state. The final section, the largest of the book, presents observations on the treatment by suggestion of a variety of illnesses ranging from organically based conditions to hysteria. [H] 1285.

Li\u00e9beault also discusses legal aspects of hypnotism, \"zoomagnetism,\" and \"lucidity\" or clairvoyance in the hypnotic state (a subject that he had not previously examined in detail). In his chapter on \"zoomagnetism,\" Li\u00e9beault contradicts the conclusions he had reached in his \u00c9tude sur le zoomagn\u00e9tisme (1883, entry number [1068](#e1068)). In that work he had acknowledged the existence of a physical, vibratory agent which, along with suggestion, could be a source of healing. He had become convinced of the reality of this agent through experiments done with infants, who were benefited through the application of animal magnetic techniques.

To the question of whether science can have anything to say about the issue of human survival after death, Myers answers that a scientific attitude and scientific methods can be brought to bear upon the study of supernormal phenomena that seem at first glance to indicate that people continue to exist after death. Myers believes that findings concerning telepathy are relevant to this issue because, if human beings can communicate at a distance without the benefit of the bodily senses, then perhaps communication with those who are at the greater distance involved with death is also possible.

In the care of these victims, therefore, it is necessary to guard against suggestions that might lead them to consider their injuries to be worse than they are. [H] 1317. [Hodgson, Richard.](#Hodgson.R) \"A Record of Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance.\" Society for Psychical Research Proceedings 8 (1892): 1-167. The continuation of an article written by F. W. H. Myers et al. in 1890 (see entry number [1274](#e1274)) concerning the investigation of the remarkable mental medium from Boston, Mrs. Leonora Piper (1859-1950). In 1887 Hodgson was sent by the Society for Psychical Research to Boston to act as secretary for the newly formed American Society for Psychical Research. In May of that year he met Mrs. Piper and began what would be a fifteen-year investigation of her mediumship. In this careful preliminary report of his findings, Hodgson does not reach definite conclusions about the genuineness of the material obtained in the s\u00e9ances. However, the article is replete with statements of individuals who sat with the medium and who had no doubt that she had obtained information from or about deceased persons that she could not have come to through ordinary means. Hodgson wrote a second report on Mrs. Piper in an article in the Proceedings in 1898 (see entry 304 pp. English: The Mental State of Hystericals. A Study of Mental Stigmata and Mental Accidents. 2 vols. in 1. Translated by Caroline Rollin Corson. New York and London: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1901. A continuation of work on subconscious states in hysteria begun by Janet in his articles in the Revue [1235](#e1235)). As in this earlier work, Janet attempts, insofar as possible, to remain on the level of description and to avoid metaphysical speculation concerning the nature of hysteria. Presenting his theory of hysteria in descriptive terms, he argues that the central element is a contraction of the patient's field of consciousness. This contraction defends the patient against the emergence into consciousness of unacceptable, disturbing subconscious sensations. Although he makes no attempt to spell out the mechanism, Janet sees the source of this contraction as cortical. The first volume of the work, which contains a preface by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) indicating that the studies had been carried out at The Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re and first described in lectures delivered there by Janet in 1892, deals with \"mental stigmata.\" Mental stigmata are characteristics of hysteria, essential to the condition, that are experienced by the patient as a generalized discomfort difficult to describe. The second volume considers \"mental accidents,\" or symptoms of hysteria that are superadded to the condition and experienced as transient and painful to the patient. Among the \"mental stigmata\" Janet includes anesthesias, amnesias, abulias, motor disturbances, and modifications of character. \"Mental accidents\" include subconscious acts, fixed ideas, attacks, somnambulisms, and deliriums. Although Janet cites the work of other researchers copiously, he concentrates on the cases he himself has treated and he draws his descriptions from his own observations. du champ de la f\u00fcr psychologische Forschung (Vol. 3/4: 277-514). Based largely on original experiments conducted by Moll, it focuses on the nature of rapport in hypnosis. Moll points out that although the term \"rapport\" in its most general sense refers to a special connection between hypnotist and subject, it has been given a bewildering variety of nuances of meaning over the previous hundred years, and he hopes to bring some clarity to the confusion. He distinguishes \"isolated rapport,\" in which the subject relates only to the hypnotist, from other kinds of rapport, in which the subject may be aware of other persons. Moll also examines those instances in which the hypnotized individual has rapport with no one, a circumstance arising in autohypnosis. In the process of discussing rapport, Moll examines an issue that he considers essentially related: whether there is such a thing as animal magnetism and whether an animal magnetic fluid exists. This question reduces itself to the issue of whether, as the Nancy school teaches, the hypnotic state is brought about through purely psychological means, or whether there is some physical or semi-physical agent involved. Moll states that he has not been able to observe the phenomena so often cited by the magnetists as proof of their theory. However, he does not intend this finding necessarily to imply the disproof of the reality of animal magnetism. [H] 1324. [Myers, Frederic William Henry.](#Myers.F) \"The Psychical Research Proceedings 7 (1892): 298-355. The first of four very important articles by Myers on the subliminal consciousness published in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. Here Myers develops his notion of a hidden part of the human psyche that functions \"below the threshold\" of consciousness and has powerful effects on all facets of human life. The part of us that we are aware of, the supraliminal consciousness or part \"above the threshold\" of consciousness, is what we ordinarily consider to be our whole self. But in Myers's view, the subliminal consciousness is a much greater and richer part of our being. Myers's concept of the subliminal self goes beyond the notion of the \"subconscious\" developed by Janet and the \"unconscious\" of Freud. He includes in it not only subconscious mental activity, instinctual drives, and repressed \"fixed ideas,\" but also those intuitive flashes that characterize genius and even knowledge gained through some kind of supernormal faculty.

De Rochas has been underestimated as an investigator of hypnotic and psychic phenomena, and this, like most of his works, is highly original and worthy of note. Here, De Rochas sets out the stages or phases of hypnotism as he sees them: 1) a state of credulity, 2) catalepsy, 3) somnambulism, 4) rapport, 5) a state of sympathy to contact, 6) a state of lucidity, and 7) a state of sympathy at a distance. Each phase, he says, is followed by an intervening state of lethargy. Referring to the latter four phases as the \"profound states of hypnosis,\" he examines them in detail. In addition to a discussion of these phases, the book contains a chapter on the \"exteriorization of sensibility\" and one on ecstasy. [H] Translated by Charles Gilbert Chaddock. London (?): F. A.

This book is his first and his masterwork. Hudson used his two-mind theory to oppose the spiritualistic view of the world, insisting that apparent communication with the dead is self delusion.

Cock Lane and Common Sense is a collection of essays that had previously appeared in various journals. The subject is spiritualism, ancient and contemporary.

These include the inaccuracy of human testimony; the possibility of hallucination, and fraud. Taking these difficulties into account, Lang presents accounts of spiritualistic experiences which he nonetheless considers worthy of serious consideration.

London: Walter Scott, 1894, xiv + 401 pp. Although a civil servant by occupation, Podmore devoted a great deal of time to the firsthand investigation of psychical phenomena and became one of the most important figures in the early history of the Society for Psychical Research. Although initially a spiritualist, the exposure of a number of well-known mediums as frauds led him to become an extreme skeptic. He developed such severe criteria for judging the genuineness of mediumistic experiences that some believed they were impossible to meet. This skepticism undoubtedly increased the credibility of the Society for Psychical Research as a seriously critical investigative body. Although Podmore had contributed to Phantasms of the Living (1886, see entry number [1144](#e1144)), Apparitions and Thought-Transference is his first solely authored book. Podmore provides a solid description of the history of the question from the time of the early mesmerists and points out reasons for caution in accepting the conclusions of those earlier investigators. He then arrives at a position that he was to maintain throughout all of his works: that alleged apparitions and communications from the dead are explicable in terms of the operation of telepathy.

His demonstration is not, however, based on proofs cited by spiritualists, such as communications from the dead, which Hudson considers to be superstition. Rather it is founded on an analysis of the physical, intellectual, and psychical structure of human beings. Hudson contends that any other conclusion is logically and scientifically untenable.

He finds fault with Charcot's attempt to provide a description of mental conditions based on the same model as that used to categorize organic disease. Janet also points out that Charcot was misled in his conclusions because of a lack of awareness of what was happening to his patients on the ward. Charcot did not realize that his hysterics were often \"magnetized\" by various individuals and that his \"three stages\" of hypnotism were in fact behaviors learned in those magnetic sessions, not organically determined responses.

In the present book, De Rochas discusses the history and nature of the phenomenon, his own experiments with it and its relation to his stages of hypnotism (see entry number [1328](#e1328)). Asserting that it has been well established that specially sensitive individuals perceive emantions proceeding from the organisms of living beings and pointing out that some investigators believe that a hypnotic subject in the state of rapport with the hypnotizer may be able to experience the sensations of the hypnotizer, de Rochas is led to the belief that the power of sensation may be extended beyond the skin of the body. This phenomenon, he notes, is not new, and he traces the history of analogous phenomena back hundreds of years, citing among other sources, literature that treats of the power of sympathy and sympathetic medicine in general. In this regard, he devotes a full chapter to the magnetic medicine of William Maxwell. [H & P] 1392. n.p., 1895.

The finding of the committee, published in its Proceedings, was basically that she was a charlatan and that many of the apparently supernormal phenomena were deliberately staged. In a preface, the Society's president, Henry Sidgwick, states that Mr. Soloviev's study of Madame Blavatsky, at least in certain parts, constituted a supplement to the statement of results given by the Society.

The theory behind this term is that when a telekinetic individual moves objects without contact, the motor nerves of that individual are involved. De Rochas wrote this book with the intention of establishing the fact that inert objects can be moved through a force that emanates from the physical organism of some people. The first part of the book is largely a description of s\u00e9ances with the famous Italian medium, Eusapia Palladino (1854-1918), whose physical mediumship was investigated by more panels of experts than any other medium of the day. She produced some physical phenomena that were never explained, but she was also detected in fraud. De Rochas provides detailed accounts of experiments and comments by observers present and discusses the occasional presence of fraud. The second part of the book deals with the turning tables of 1853, the British investigation of physical phenomena (the report of the Dialectical Society and the work of William Crookes), and the phenomena produced by a number of mediums such as Henry Slade Hypnotism Vol. 1; 1898.

This wide-ranging work takes up the history of spiritualism with the specific aim of assessing whether \"experimental spiritualism,\" (the direct experience of the paranormal phenomena of spiritualism, including apparent communication with departed spirits) can show mankind the true meaning of life and inject a note of optimism into human existence, a task which modern materialism had not been able to accomplish.

He has researched his subject well and is successful within his own terms of reference.

Hodgson summarizes the findings of the previous articles and proceeds to give a lengthy description and analysis of his s\u00e9ances with the medium from 1892 to 1895. Although in his article of 1892 Hodgson did not state any definite conclusions about the genuineness of Mrs. Piper's mediumship, in this article he says that he has no doubt that the chief communicators who manifest through Mrs. Piper are indeed the deceased persons they claim to be, and that they have survived death and are able to communicate with the living.

Paris: F\u00e9lix Alcan, 1898, iii + 492; x + 559 pp. A classical study of the subconscious elements at work in the formation of neuroses. Janet formulated the concept of \"subconscious fixed ideas\" in his L'automatisme psychologique (1889, entry number [1235](#e1235)). This is the notion that an idea, excluded from personal consciousness because of its disturbing content, can develop unobserved in a hidden part of the personality and work subconsciously to produce all manner of neurotic symptom. In the present work he develops this insight into a comprehensive theory of the neurosis. The first volume is Janet's systematic presentation of his ideas, while the second constitutes a kind of clinical appendix to the first, containing short clinical lessons along with a description of cases treated by Janet and F. Raymond in their laboratory at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re. In presenting his theory, Janet discusses the nature of fixed ideas, how they manifest in symptoms, how they may be uncovered, and the treatment to be used in their management. Janet distinguishes between \"hysteria\" and \"psychasthenia\" and describes \"psychasthenia\" as a state involving \"mental weakness\" manifesting in obsessions, phobias, and other symptoms. \"Hysteria,\" on the other hand, is characterized by a narrowing of the field of consciousness manifesting in such symptoms as anesthesias, abulias, and amnesias. Treatment of the neurosis must, Janet asserts, involve the bringing to consciousness of the fixed ideas, the dissolution of those fixed ideas, and the reeducation of the patient for healthy living. N\u00e9vroses et id\u00e9es fixes became an influential textbook for the therapy of the neurosis and helped established Janet as one of the nineteenth century's preeminent clinicians. [H] 1442.

Psychology of Suggestion: A Research into the Subconscious Nature of Man and Society. New York: D. Appleton, 1898, (2) + x + 386 pp. A student of William James (1842-1910) at Harvard, Sidis went on to become a pioneer in psychological experimentation in the laboratory. His main area of interest was suggestion and its connection with hypnotism and hypnoid states and this book is one of the most important works on suggestion written in the English language. Sidis describes his experiments with suggestion and his conclusion that within the human mind coexist two streams of consciousness that constitute the waking and the subwaking self. The waking self is the ruling self, having the power to investigate its own nature, create ideals, and struggle for them. The subwaking self is stupid, lacking in critical sense, and highly suggestible. The submerged, subwaking self has a broader awareness than that of the waking self, knowing the life of the latter, while the waking self knows nothing of the life of the subwaking self. In addition to this discussion of the self and suggestion, the book includes an important section on social suggestibility and crowd Neurypnology; or The Rationale of Nervous Sleep Considered in Relation to Animal Magnetism or Mesmerism and Illustrated by Numerous Cases of Its Successful Application in the Relief and Cure of Disease.

He has a very valuable biography of Braid at the This study of the nature of the soul has as its thesis the fact that human beings have a \"second body\" or \"subtle body\" that is a vehicle of the soul and that survives death. This enveloping form is called by Delanne the \"perispirit.\" In this book he presents experimental evidence for the existence of such a vehicle, drawing largely on the work of de Rochas and Luys. Jenseits und das Leben 587 was a famous French astronomer, spiritualist, and psychical researcher strongly influenced by the first great French spiritualist, Allan Kardec (Hippolyte Rivail) who thought that human survival of death was as much a matter of scientific proof as of belief. In this book, Flammarion attempts to establish the reality of telepathy, clairvoyance, premonitions, and other psychic phenomena. Given the genuineness of such experiences, one must, Flammarion believes, conclude that the soul can exist apart from the body and can act without its benefit. attempts to explain the phenomena of mediumistic trance in terms of a vital energy emanating from the medium and those around and subconsciously directed by the medium.

Flournoy, Professor of Psychology at the University of Geneva and highly respected in his field, heard about a medium in Geneva who exhibited phenomena that he thought deserving of psychological investigation. Her name was Catherine Elise Muller (called \"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Smith\" in the book to protect her identity). Flournoy was admitted to her circle in 1894 and attended her s\u00e9ances on and off for five years. A number of \"departed spirits\" manifested through the medium, including Cagliostro and Marie Antoinette. Flournoy concluded that these personalities were the subconscious productions of the medium's mind and not the actual people they claimed to be. Muller also believed she was in touch with life on Mars, and while in trance she spoke a language she claimed to be Martian. Through a laborious analysis of the syntax of this language, Flournoy discovered beneath the apparently alien form a structure basically French, the native tongue of the medium. The publication of the book alienated Muller and her friends, who considered themselves betrayed by someone they had befriended. The work is a prototypical study of mediumship from a psychological point of view. Although some questions remained about sources for certain obscure historical information that came through Muller, the overall impression was that she was a sincere but self-deluded medium.

He includes a lengthy discussion of the \"telepathy\" as opposed to the \"spirit\" hypothesis to account for the material obtained from this remarkable medium and makes it clear that he favors the latter explanation.

Although psychical research continued to be prominent in this, the fourth congress, Janet, who was secretary of the congress, removed 30 articles related to psychical research for the proceedings. This is indicative of the then-current struggle between supporters of psychical research and those members of the academic establishment who opposed its legitimation. [P] 1497.

In this book, Delanne, although writing from an avowedly spiritualist point of view, shows that he is able to bring a keen investigative eye to the study of mediumship. Recherches sur la m\u00e9diumnit\u00e9 is a work of impressive scholarship in which Delanne shows a familiarity with the psychological literature relating to automatisms and the influence of the subconscious or conscious acts. Beginning with a comparison between the productions of mediums and hysterical automatisms and a discussion of the light shed on mediumistic phenomena by the work of Binet, Janet, and others, Delanne examines cases of mediumship that give evidence of clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition and other paranormal phenomena and looks at the possible influence of suggestion on these phenomena. The last part of the book is concerned with proofs that the dead communicate with the living, bringing to bear evidence that Delanne believes can only be explained in terms of spirit communication.

Given the distinction, he argues that one can mesmerize but not hypnotize a young child (under three). With regard to hypnotism, Ellsworth seems most strongly influenced by the findings of Charcot. With regard to mesmerism, his emphasis is on the physical and curative effects. [H & P] 1503. [Flournoy, Th\u00e9odore.](#Flournoy.T) C.

Flournoy's conclusions remain as he had expressed them in the earlier work, but he adds further information concerning various aspects of the case. Among other things, he quotes the findings of Professor Victor Henry on the \"Martian\" language developed in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Smith's mediumship (see Henry, Le langage martien, 1901, entry number [1483](#e1483)). Henry traced what he believed to be the unconscious origins of that phenomenon. Flournoy's further elaboration of material related to the \"personalities\" that communicated through the medium strengthens, in his view, the case for the unconscious origin of these figures.

Of the three volumes, however, only two appeared. Volume one deals with Mesmer, his theory and the history of his work, and with Puys\u00e9gur and the consequences of his discovery of artificial somnambulism. Volume two takes up the findings of the second French commission, French practitioners such as Lafontaine and Du Potet, Braid's discoveries, and certain American magnetizers.

Translated by R. F. C. Hull. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1977. Jung's dissertation for his doctorate in medicine, written under the direction of Eugen Bleuler (1857-1939). Here Jung discusses examples of double consciousness and somnambulism and treats in great detail the case a young female medium whose s\u00e9ances Jung had himself witnessed. He attempts to explain the phenomena observed in terms of psychological mechanisms such as \"cryptomnesia,\" the emergence into consciousness of forgotten information without the medium recognizing that information as memory. [P] 1507. English: Christian Science, Methuen 374 pp. Podmore was a very good historian, and he brings that ability to bear in this work. After providing a brief survey of early psychic phenomena, he launches into an investigation of the era beginning with Mesmer and ending in 1900 and connects the rise of modern spiritualism to the spread of mesmerism throughout France, Germany, Britain, and the United States. From its beginnings as a movement with the events that took place in the home of the Fox sisters in New York state in 1848, he traces the spread of spiritualism over the \"ground prepared by mesmerism\" throughout the United States and eventually to England. Podmore then categorizes the various kinds of mediumship that developed within the movement and discusses the principal mediums of the nineteenth century from the point of view of the reliability and genuineness of their phenomena. As in his earlier writings, Podmore holds that mediumship may be adequately explained in terms of fraud, bad observation, or, in the case of some mental phenomena, unconscious telepathy.

Much of this little work is devoted to evaluating progress in the investigation of telepathy, hypnotism, and communication with the dead, but Bennett also includes a section of Myers's concept of subliminal mediumship by the dean of Italian psychical researchers. Bozzano discusses, among other things, the mediumship of Eusapia Palladino and possible explanations for the phenomena that she produced.

In this volume, one of the most important and informative histories of hypnotism, he uses an historical analysis to evaluate the true nature of the phenomenon. Beginning with Mesmer, he traces developments through the Abb\u00e9 Faria, Elliotson and Esdaile, to Li\u00e9beault and the formation of the Nancy school, to whose insights along with those of Braid, he was obviously partial. He did not believe the mesmerists proved their case for a magnetic fluid; neither did he agree with the pathologically oriented views of the school of Charcot. He does treat them all, however, and quite fairly. His description of the history of medical hypnotism is valuable and his discussion of the various explanatory theories of hypnotism is enlightening.

As in that earlier work, the first volume provides a systematic presentation of Janet's ideas, while the second volume is a sort of clinical appendix to the first, containing short clinical lectures along with a description of cases treated by Janet and Raymond in their laboratory at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re. Among new ideas developed in this work is that of \"presentification,\" the process of making present a state of mind or a group of phenomena. It is a synthetic power, one that operates on the highest level of the psyche and is at the heart of the ability to grasp reality. This level is at the top of a five-tier hierarchy of psychic functioning. Functioning at the top level requires a greater degree of psychological tension. As one descends through lower, less reality-oriented levels of functioning, the tension or force required is less. With the concept of hierarchical levels of psychic functioning, Janet revises his view of mental energy, paying more attention to the quality than to the quantity of energy expended. The concept also provides him with a solid psychological framework for explaining the nature of obsessions and related psychasthenic disturbances. [H] 1523. Tragedy and Other Studies.

He investigated many mediums and came to conclusions that were quite original. He was one of the few researchers to take up the problem of mediumistic \"personification,\" that is, the way the phenomena in s\u00e9ances present themselves as coming from an individual intelligence. He noted that the personification seemed to vary in its form depending on the composition of the group carrying out the sitting. In the book Maxwell also introduces a helpful system of classification for psychic phenomena, making a distinction between physical and mental phenomena. Charles Richet, who had great respect for Maxwell, took up this classification and it became the accepted one for many years. [P] 1526.

[Myers, Frederic William Henry.](#Myers.F) Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death. 2 vols. London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1903, xlvi + 700; xx + 660 pp. Without question the most important single work in the field of psychical research. Myers, one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research, served as its secretary from 1888-1899 and its president for the year 1900. During the 1880s and 1890s he authored many articles on psychical research in the Society's Proceedings and in other periodicals such as the Nineteenth Century and the Fortnightly Review. With Edmund Gurney and Frank Podmore, he co-authored the monumental Phantasms of the Living (1886, entry number [1144](#e1144)). In his day Myers was a noted classical scholar and a poet of distinction. His academic training was at Cambridge University, the birthplace of the Society for Psychical Research. He was a fellow of the University and a lecturer in classics there for some years. Myers was a man of great intellectual versatility and accomplishment. Th\u00e9odore Flournoy called Myers one of the most remarkable personalities of his time in the realm of mental science. William James said of Myers that he was a wary critic of evidence, a skilful handler of hypotheses, a learned neurologist, and an omnivorous reader of biological and cosmological matter. Human Personality was published after Myers's death in 1901. He had nearly completed the writing by that time and he had entrusted the press work to Miss Alice Johnson. She and Richard Hodgson carried out whatever editing was still needed after Myers's death. Human Personality is equally a work of psychology and of psychical research. Myers draws upon the vast literature of both fields and finds a place for every phase of human experience through his unifying concept of the \"subliminal self.\" According to Myers, the supraliminal self is that self with which we ordinarily identify. It embraces all our conscious, purposeful dealings with reality. The subliminal self, on the other hand, represents man's central, greater self. Myers sees the subliminal self as the enveloping mother-consciousness in each of us. From this matrix our supraliminal conscious self is precipitated like a crystal. The supraliminal self has as its job to deal with the vicissitudes of the world we live in. Its task is, therefore very precise, and over the aeons the supraliminal self has evolved to its present form to do that task better and better. The supraliminal self, the self we ordinarily call \"I\", is a very limited and specialized production of the greater subliminal self. The subliminal self is the source of all those experiences and impulses which arise unplanned and unbidden from within\u2014ranging from primitive animal impulses to flashes of genius and clairvoyant intuition. It is the source of the worst and of the greatest in us, and its territory is as yet largely unexplored. William James said, \"For half a century now, psychologists have fully admitted the existence of the subliminal mental region . . . but they have never definitely taken up the question of the extent of that region, never sought explicitly to map it out. Myers definitely attacks the problem which, after him, it will be impossible to ignore. What is the precise constitution of the subliminal\u2014such is the problem which deserves to figure in our science hereafter as the problem of Myers.\" In Human Personality Myers puts together a remarkable compendium of the literature of psychical and psychological research up to the end of the nineteenth century, with his concept of the subliminal self providing the unifying framework for the vast array of material. The work features chapters on disintegrations of personality (including the best summary of the literature of multiple personality to that time), genius, sleep, hypnotism (containing an extensive study of the history and theories of hypnotism, along with Myers's own hypotheses about its nature), sensory automatisms (including the phenomena of clairvoyance, crystal gazing, telepathy, apparitions of the living and hallucinations), motor automatisms (including automatic writing, automatic drawing and automatic speaking), phantasms of the dead (hauntings and apparitions of departed spirits), and a chapter on trance, possession and ecstasy (with a discussion of mediumship, spirit-possession, and visionary hypnotic states). The appendices with extensive descriptions of cases equal the length of the main text. The publication of Human Personality marked a high point in the history of psychical research. Myers undertook to assimilate and unify the work that researchers had carried out over the previous thirty years. His book became the point of reference for every later attempt to synthesize the data of psychical research.

[Rossi, Multiple Personality: an Experimental Investigation into the Nature of Human Individuality. New York: D. Appleton, 1904. An important study of a case of multiple personality and the nature of dissociation. The case described is that of Rev. Thomas Carson Hanna who, in 1897, struck his head in an accident and from that time began to live a dual life. He manifested a new state of consciousness in which he remembered nothing of his previous life and had to relearn basic language and motor skills. After a period of time, this \"secondary state\" began to alternate with his \"primary state,\" in which he regained the memories of his life and could exercise his normal motor skills. Through intensive therapeutic work, the two states were eventually fused into one. This case is described in the center section of the book, preceded by Sidis's discussion of neuron organization in its relationship to multiple personality and followed by Sidis's treatment of \"consciousness and multiple personality.\" This later section contains extremely important material on conscious and subconscious elements in multiple personality and on the place of \"hypnoid\" and \"hypnoidic\" states in extreme forms of dissociation. Here Sidis makes some remarkable statements about the normality of multiplicity in human psychological experience, suggesting that the phenomena of multiple personality, \"far from being mere freaks, monstrosities of consciousness, . . . are in fact shown to be necessary manifestations of the very constitution of mental life. Multiple consciousness is not the exception, but the law. . . . One great principle must be at the foundation of psychology, and that is the synthesis of multiple consciousness in normal, and its disintegration in abnormal mental life\" (pp. 364-65).

He was professor of logic and ethics at Columbia University from 1889-1902. Although his interest in psychical research began with some striking sittings with the famous American medium Leonore Piper in 1888, he did not begin writing on the subject until after his retirement from teaching. In 1906, he organized the new American Society for Psychical Research (there had been an earlier short-lived society from 1885 to 1890), which published its first Journal in January 1907. Science and a Future Life is Hyslop's first book on psychical research, and it is one of his most important. Here he deals with the issue of the evidence for survival after death as found in mediumistic communications. Although taking up the problem in its most general form, he concentrates on the material received through Mrs. Piper, examining the various possible explanations for the data, in particular the spiritistic versus the telepathic hypothesis.

New York: Longmans, Green, 1905, x + 575 pp. Prince was an important figure in American psychology and a pioneer in the study of mental dissociation. Having studied at Vienna, Strasbourg, Paris, and Nancy, as well as at Harvard Medical School, he developed a special interest in the investigations of Charcot and Janet related to hypnotism and hysteria, an interest that helped give direction to his own original research. A founder and long-time editor of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, president of the American Psychological Association, and a member of the American Society for Psychical Research, Prince eventually taught at Harvard and became Professor of Neurology at Tufts. In 1901, in the Proceedings of the British Society of Psychical Research, Prince published his first essay on one of his patients, a woman given the fictitious name of Miss Beauchamp, who exhibited four different personalities. One of the personalities, \"Sally,\" had a co-conscious existence, that is, she persisted as a separate self with a differentiated self-conciousness while each of the others was present. The Dissociation of a Personality, an important account of an early attempt to understand and determine what should be the outcome of therapeutic work with multiple personality, describes Prince's discovery of Miss Beauchamp's personalities, the course of her therapy, and Prince's theoretical reflections on the nature of multiple personality.

After a period of skepticism, he became convinced that some of the reported spiritualistic phenomena were genuine and went on to establish the American Psychical Institute, which gave weekly lectures, put on monthly demonstrations, and periodically published bulletins on matters related to psychical research. The Scientific Council of the Institute included many pre-eminent psychical researchers from around the world, such as Max Dessoir, Hans Driesch, Paul Joire, Oliver Lodge, Joseph Maxwell, Eug\u00e8ne Osty, Charles Richet, Harry Price, and even Pierre Janet. Carrington was particularly interested in studying mediums and their psychic feats. Becoming fairly competent at conjuring, he used his knowledge to expose the tricks of fraudulent mediums, but he also believed that he came across much that was genuine. The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism, Carrington's first book and one of the best books on the subject, concentrates on the deceptions employed by some mediums, but also deals with what Carrington thought to be genuine.

New York: Macmillan, 1907, x + (2) + 345 pp. A series of excursions into the realm of hysteria drawing upon the vast experience of the author. Janet justifies his choice of hysteria as the subject for these lectures by pointing out that most of the major contributors to modern psychotherapy took the study of hysteria as their starting point. He examines the \"major symptoms\" of hysteria: monoideic somnambulisms, polyideic sleep, motor agitations, contractures, paralysis, anesthesias, and disturbances of vision, speech and alimentation. He concludes his lectures with a description of the chief characteristics of hysteria and a discussion of \"contraction of the field of consciousness\" Cie, 1907, (4) + 477 pp. Moutin distinguishes between animal magnetism and hypnotism, claiming that animal magnetism produces phenomena that hypnotism never will. Pointing out that there is \"nothing new under the sun,\" Moutin refers to authors before Mesmer who had discussed an animal magnetic fluid, including among Mesmer's precursors the \"Professor of Physiology Lecot\" (i.e., Nicolas Claude Le Cat [1700-1768]) who in 1767 (in his Trait\u00e9 des sensations et des passions), twelve years before Mesmer's first M\u00e9moire (1779), wrote of an \"animal fluid\" with the same characteristics. Moutin claims that too much emphasis has been placed on suggestion, to the detriment of the study of a \"transmissible agent\" (magnetic fluid) that passes between operator and subject. He relates psychic phenomena, such as telepathy, clairvoyance, mental suggestion, and other phenomena of spiritualism, to animal magnetism and claims that they cannot be fully understood until a thorough investigation of animal magnetism has been conducted.

New York: Holt, 1911. A study of one of the famous Elberfeld horses who were supposed to be able to communicate through a code tapped out by their hoofs. In 1891 William von Osten discovered that his horse, Kluge Hans, would count objects placed before him with his hoofs. Von Osten went on from there to develop a more subtle communication with the animal, with the horse apparently able to signal answers to questions in German and solve difficult mathematical problems. Over the years the phenomenon was studied by numerous scientists, many of whom attested to the horse's remarkable feats. Here, Pfungst comes down on the negative side of the controversy, suggesting that when Kluge Hans did give correct answers it was because von Osten unconsciously provided cues to the animal to indicate when he should start and stop in giving the tapped code. The controversy continued for many years after the appearance of this study, and remains an issue among psychical researchers to this day. [P] of Abnormal Psychology 2 (1907): 22-43, 58-80. An important collection of articles on the subconscious by some of the leading minds in the field. Of great interest are the articles by Janet and Prince. Janet, inventor of the term \"subconscious,\" emphasizes that he has from the beginning used the notion of the subconscious as a crystallization of the results of observations, not as a metaphysical theory. Prince takes up the issue of an adequate explanation for subconscious phenomena, insisting that the purely physiological interpretation is insufficient and that it is necessary to postulate the existence of dissociated ideas. 1907, xvii + 492 pp. A collection of essays on subjects of interest to psychical researchers: truth, dreams, dissociation of personality, and psychical research.

London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., 1908, xv + 127 pp. William Barrett, for over thirty years Professor of Physics at the Royal College of Science in Dublin, was one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research, editor of the society's Journal from 1884 to 1899, and a key figure in the initiation of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1885. Barrett began his study of psychical research in 1874 and after a long and thorough investigation became convinced of the reality of the phenomena of spiritualism. He held there was evidence for the existence of a spiritual world, survival of death, and communication with departed spirits. This book, Barrett's first major work on psychical research, has as its basis a lecture delivered some fourteen years earlier in which he presents evidence regarding the genuineness of psychic phenomena. This evidence is drawn from his own experiments and from investigations undertaken principally by members of the Society for Psychical Research, much of it having already appeared in the Proceedings of the Society. Barrett adopts the spiritualistic explanation for the phenomena as a working hypothesis, insisting that objective students of the facts must give this hypothesis serious consideration. A thoroughly revised version of this work, published in 1918 under the title On the Threshold of the Unseen: An Examination of the Phenomena of Spiritualism and the Evidence for Survival after Death, takes the same position but cites the findings of ten additional years of psychical research in confirmation of his spiritualistic viewpoint.

It is Boirac's intention to answer the question: Is it possible to study so-called \"psychic\" phenomena scientifically? He divides these phenomena into three main categories: hypnoidal phenomena (relating to hypnotism and suggestion), magnetoidal phenomena (natural but unclassified physical forces), and spiritoidal phenomena (resulting from the action of unknown agents). Boirac believes the scientific study of such phenomena is possible and suggests methods for that study.

The author's view of hypnotism is influenced by Charcot's three-phase schema, but Joire clearly situates himself in the tradition of animal magnetism with the notion that a \"nervous force\" emanates from the body and produces external effects. Indeed, he even developed a device called the \"sthenometer\" to measure this \"nervous force.\" The device consisted of a dial with a straw needle balanced on a pivot. Joire believed he obtained clear movements of this needle when a subject's hands were placed in the vicinity of the dial and that these movements were produced by the body's emanations, but other investigators attributed this movement to the action of radiating heat.

It presents a history of the Society for Psychical Research and contains lengthy sections on experimental and spontaneous telepathy. The bulk of the book, however, is taken up with an examination of \"automatism and lucidity.\" In discussing the psychic aspects of automatic writing and trance speaking, Lodge devotes nearly two hundred pages to a discussion of the medium Leonore Piper, long considered to be the best example of a genuine mental medium. His conclusion is that the evidence for the survival of the human spirit after death, which has been accumulating over the centuries, has now been given a powerful boost through the remarkable material obtained from Mrs. Piper and other contemporary mediums. Lodge reveals that he himself believes in survival and the communications of the dead with the living. [P] Spiritistic Phenomena and Their Interpretation. Translated by William Sloane Kennedy. Boston: Small, Maynard & Company, 1909. Lombroso was a renowned psychiatrist and criminal anthropologist interested in problems related to hypnotism and hysteria. In 1891, he turned his attention to psychical research when he was invited by Cavaliere Ercole Chiana of Naples to sit in on s\u00e9ances with the medium Eusapia Palladino. As a result of those sittings, Lombroso felt compelled to accept the facts of spiritualism, although he still had difficulty with the theory. After further investigations of mediums and experimentation with thought transference, Lombroso accepted the hypothesis of spirit communication. This is his most important book in the field of psychical research. The first half is a study of hypnotism as it relates to thought transmission, clairvoyance, precognition, and the physical phenomena of spiritualism. The second half is a study of mediumship, its conditions, and its limitations. The book concludes with an important chapter on unconscious fraud and Healing. London: Methuen, 1909, xv + 306 pp. Although not as detailed as might be desired, the treatment of the evolution of thought that began with Mesmer's discoveries is readable and accurate.

Hart examines the evolution of the notion of the subconscious and grapples with the question of whether the subconscious is a \"brain fact\" or a \"mind fact,\" that is, a subject for physiology or for psychology. He concludes that both lines of investigation yield useful results, but it is important not to confuse the two fields of inquiry. Hart also insists that no matter which line of inquiry the investigator of the subconscious pursues, he must clearly distinguish between the phenomenal (observed facts) and the conceptual (mental constructions).

Flournoy distinguishes between \"spiritualism,\" the belief in the immortality of the soul and \"spiritism,\" the belief that the dead communicate with the living.

The information obtained in these sittings is remarkably accurate, but little is said about safeguards against the medium obtaining that information by secret means. Hill, who believes the medium is genuine, suggests a theory of mediumship: the mind of the medium is placed in rapport with the source of information (living or dead) by means of the presence of some object (in this case the \"object\" is the sitter).

The question has importance for psychical research in that most explanations of human survival of death and the existence of paranormal phenomena are based on some kind of animistic view of human nature. McDougall accepts the notion of animism with qualifications, holding that the acceptance of animism does not imply a belief in specific metaphysical entities such as the soul. He believes that this is the only philosophically sound conclusion and the only way to account for certain paranormal phenomena such as telepathy.

In the preface, he suggests that genuine physical phenomena are very rare indeed and in the first half of the book he writes of experiences which were for the most part fraudulent. However in the second half of the book, he describes his encounters with the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino during her American tour. He states his firm belief that in contrast to other phenomena he had seen, some of her physical phenomena were genuine. Although she was known to resort to trickery and Carrington had himself seen that, he had no doubt that she also produced real psychic feats of materialization and movement of objects at a distance. At the end of the book Carrington emphasizes the need for a psychical laboratory which could study such phenomena in a properly controlled setting. [P] 1685.

He seems, however, to believe that things are a bit more complex than he had originally thought, suggesting that there are many genuine psychic phenomena, mental and physical, but that the spiritualistic explanation is too simplistic and cannot account for some of the facts. He contends that not enough data are available to reach any certain conclusions about what kind of intelligence might be behind the genuine phenomena produced. [P] 1696.

Unlike earlier authors, this medium seemed to obtain her information from unseen spirits. The book is an account of those visions and their accuracy and includes a whole section on false or inaccurate material obtained when forgeries of prehistoric objects were the Cosmic Relations. 2 vols. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1914, xi + (1) + 512; (8) + 513-989 pp. A very ambitious attempt to relate mediumistic phenomena to the philosophy of a cosmic soul. For a philosophical work, the book is surprisingly rich in the data of psychical research. Most notably, it contains about 400 pages of matter relating to the medium Leonore Piper (1859-1950). The author concludes that genuine mediumistic phenomena are the result of possession of the medium or hypnotic influence exerted on the medium by discarnate souls. Holt sees these discarnate personalities, as well as all incarnate personalities, as manifestations of the one cosmic soul which is sometimes called God.

After discussing the nature of the subconscious and subconscious processes, Prince describes his conception of the unconscious as a \"storehouse of neurographic dispositions or residua.\" He intends the term to indicate an absence of the attributes of consciousness. Prince points out, however, that such \"conserved experiences\" may at times be activated and function as subconscious processes. These subconscious (or, in his terminology, \"co-conscious\") processes do partake of qualities of consciousness, even though they may never emerge into the awareness of our personal consciousness. Prince hoped that through these clear distinctions, the confusions in the use of the terms \"unconscious,\" \"subconscious,\" and \"conscious\" + 160 pp. In this work Schrenck-Notzing answers criticisms leveled against his book on materialization by von Kemnitz, von Gulat-Wellenburg, pp. English: Phenomena of Materialisation: A Contribution to the Investigation of Mediumistic Teleplastics. Translated by E. E. Fournier d'Albe. London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Trubner, 1920. One of the most important scientific studies of the phenomenon of materialization. Schrenck-Notzing was a well-known German psychiatrist who was associated with the Nancy school of hypnotism. He first became interested in the field of psychical research through his experimentation with hypnotism and was drawn further in that direction by Charles Richet, whom he met in 1889. Schrenck-Notzing's interest centered on experimentation with mediums, especially on mediumistic production of physical phenomena. He participated in experiments with Richet, Myers, and Sir Oliver Lodge of the Society for Psychical Research, and with such well-known psychiatric figures as C. G. Jung and Eugen Bleuler. Materialisations-Ph\u00e4nomene is Schrenck-Notzing's best known work in the field of psychical research. It describes phenomena produced in sittings with two mediums: Eva C. and Stanislava P. Both mediums produced remarkable materializations of figures with human features, along with more amorphous shapes. The book contains over two hundred photographs of these productions at various stages of formation. Schrenck-Notzing gives a detailed account of precautions taken to exclude trickery and bad observation. He also explores possible alternate means of producing the same results. His conclusion is that the phenomena of these two mediums, produced within the stringent conditions which he created, were genuine. The second greatly enlarged edition, published in 1923, contains added data derived from sittings with the same mediums and with Willy Sch., Marie S., Enja Nielsen, Franek Kluski, and others. The first edition in its English translation was also augmented with additional material. [P] 1705. [Sidis, Boris.](#Sidis.B) The Foundations of Normal and Abnormal Psychology. Boston: Richard G.

In the first part of the volume, he discusses his solution of the problem of the brain versus mind in the study of the psyche, that is, the question of the place of physiological inquiry in psychology. Sidis advocates a form of psycho-physical parallelism, claiming that every psychic change must have its physiological concomitant. The second part of the book contains an analysis of the abnormal mind and an exposition of the author's theory of \"moment consciousness\" as the basis for the synthetic unity of consciousness, a unity which, according to Sidis, must somehow be explained.

His elaboration of experiences with hypnosis and suggestion into a comprehensive system is an important evolution of ideas that had first been formulated by Janet in the 1880s. [H] 1915 1707.

Part I, by Walter Franklin Prince; The Doris Case of Multiple Personality. Part II, by Walter Franklin Prince; The Doris Case of Multiple Personality. Part III, by James Hervey Hyslop; The Mother of Doris, by Walter Franklin Prince.\" American Society for Psychical Research Prince, a minister of the Episcopal Church, was the founder of the Boston Society for Psychical Research, president for one term of the Society for Psychical Research in England, and one of America's most important American psychical investigators. In 1909, a twenty-year-old girl, who was enrolled in the Sunday school of the Episcopal Church in Pittsburgh where Prince was then rector, came to the attention of Prince's wife. Mrs. Prince was worried about what appeared to be unusual behavior in the girl, called \"Doris Fischer\" in the account, and kept an eye on her, finally speaking to her husband about her concern. Prince had read Morton Prince's The Dissociation of a Personality (1905, entry number [1559](#e1559)) and thought Doris was suffering from a similar form of dissociation. Desiring to do therapy with the girl and believing that she could only be successfully treated if she were away from her father (her mother having died in 1906), Dr. and Mrs. Prince adopted Doris in 1911. Doris had five distinct personalities: 1) \"Real Doris,\" who knew nothing of the other personalities, 2) \"Sick Doris,\" who knew all about \"Real Doris\" but nothing of the others, 3) \"Margaret,\" who knew both \"Real Doris\" and \"Sick Doris,\" and who, although she liked \"Real Doris,\" would play little tricks on her, such as getting her to see hallucinations, 4) \"Sleeping Margaret,\" who, when Margaret was sleeping, would emerge and speak with impressive intelligence and perception, but who ordinarily could not move the limbs of the body, and 5) \"Sleeping Real Doris,\" who acted very much like an automaton, repeating phrases mechanically. Prince conducted his treatment with great skill, encouraging Real Doris to handle as much of daily life as possible, and, while allowing the others some expression, keeping them asleep for longer and longer periods. The abilities of the secondary personalities were gradually absorbed into Real Doris, and, with a single exception, the secondary personalities faded into the background. The exception was Sleeping Margaret, who remained the same throughout this period of integration. Sleeping Margaret was something of a puzzle. She was very mature and detached in her view of things, and unlike the others, she was not subject to suggestion. She eventually depicted herself as a guardian spirit who, when Doris was three, had come as a result of the prayers of Doris's mother. To test the hypothesis that Sleeping Margaret was a spirit who had come in from the outside, James Hyslop, a psychical researcher and Prince's friend took Doris in 1915 to twenty-three sittings with a \"Mrs. Chenoweth\" (a pseudonym). There had some evidence of supernormal phenomena (telepathy, clairvoyance) in Doris's life up to this point, but with Hyslop's intervention, that aspect of the case received more attention. Hyslop describes the elaborate measures taken to assure that Mrs. Chenoweth had no knowledge whatsoever about Doris before the sittings. He hoped to gain information from the medium that would provide independent confirmation that she was possessed by a spirit, thus verifying Sleeping Margaret's account of herself. But Mrs. Chenoweth indicated instead that Sleeping Margaret was merely Doris's subconscious self. Hyslop accepted this assertion, but Prince did not, and there the matter stood in 1917 at the end of their account. In 1923, however, Prince wrote another article on the Doris Fischer case, describing communications purporting to come from Doris's deceased mother through Mrs. Chenoweth. It contains a detailed account of the sittings in which those messages occurred. The Doris Fischer case is of considerable interest both as one of the most elaborately described cases of dissociation and multiple personality in the annals of the phenomenon and as an extremely interesting account of an attempt to distinguish multiple personality from possession.

Here he claims to have both witnessed and photographed levitation and the production of ectoplasmic structures. The book caused a sensation and the remarkable photographs were not easily explained away. It was Crawford's contention that phenomena such as raps and levitation of furniture were produced by ectoplasmic \"rods\" emanating from the medium, and his photographs appeared to confirm that opinion.

One cannot be reduced to the other. However, we also perceive a relationship between the two realms, a kind of parallelism.

Lodge gives the reader an intimate sketch of his son as a young soldier through letters written by him from the front and letters from other army men who knew him. He then presents a mass of mediumistically obtained material which provided what Lodge considered to be evidence of Raymond's survival of death and his communication with his loved ones on earth. The book concludes with a long philosophical discussion of the meaning of life and death in the light of the evidence of human survival. [P] 1715.

His treatment of hypnotism and animal magnetism, and particularly his discussion of suggestion in psychical research, forms the core of his treatise. [H & P] 1722.

Stanford University, California: Leland Stanford Junior University Publications, 1917, xxiv + 641 pp. After Leland Stanford Junior University was given a significant endowment to study psychical research, Coover engaged in experiments investigating thought transference, precognition, subconscious phenomena and other subjects. This book, which contains a long catalogue of books on psychical research held by the University library, was both a result of that endowment and a demonstration of the use to which the money was being put.

[H] 1728. [Maeterlinck, Maurice.](#Maeterlinck.M) 327 pp. Maeterlinck, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, was deeply interested in the issues of psychical research. This, his major work on the subject, is a well thought out examination of certain central issues, including phantasms of the living and dead, psychometry, and knowledge of the future. Most significant is his long chapter on the \"Elberfeld horses.\" These were the famous \"talking\" horses which had been previously discussed in Das Pferd des herrn von Osten (entry number [1592](#e1592)) by Oskar Pfungst. Maeterlinck himself experimented with the horses and presents material that casts doubt concerning whether the nature of the phenomenon has yet to be understood. [P] 1729.

Oxford: Blackwell, 1918, x + 176 pp. Bond describes an experiment in automatic writing aimed at discovering information about buried remnants of Glastonbury Abbey. The experiment was successful in that it produced information relevant to the positioning of the Edgar Chapel. Information about a second chapel, the Loretto Chapel, was also produced. The automatist did not accept a spiritualistic interpretation of the phenomenon but believed that some unknown inner faculty was activated in the process of automatic writing. [P] 1733.

[Crawford, William Jackson.](#Crawford.W) Hints and Observations for Those Investigating the Phenomena of Spiritualism. New York: E. P. Dutton, 1918, (4) + 110 pp. Drawing from his own experience, Crawford describes the measures to be taken to get good results when sitting in a spiritualist circle in which physical phenomena occur. The emphasis is not on how to avoid fraud, but on how to make dramatic physical phenomena more likely to occur by avoiding things that inhibit the action of psychic forces. [P] 1736.

He then proceeds to describe incidents that seem to bear out such an assumption. The book contains original material describing occurrences of, among other things, clairvoyance, out-of-the-body experiences, and visions of the dead. [P] 1739.

The material on the phenomena of spiritualism is well researched and the author admits the possibility that these phenomena are genuine. However, he sees spiritistic practices as illicit and immoral, since they attribute to men what should be attributed only to God. The author cites two separate condemnations of spiritistic practices by the Vatican's Holy Office, one in 1898 and one in 1917. [P] 1743.

New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1918, vii + (1) + 161 pp. Martin sees the movements mentioned in the subtitle of the book as arising from despair provoked by the crass philosophical materialism of the mid-nineteenth century. He believes that these movements have arrived at beliefs and reached conclusions that go beyond the evidence they present. While he himself is convinced that death does not end human existence, this belief derives from philosophical considerations rather than from empirical evidence. [P] 1745.

Allen and Unwin, 1920. Influenced by the Nancy school of hypnotism and especially by the \"new Nancy school,\" founded by Emile Cou\u00e9 (1857-1926), Baudouin forcefully separates the concept of suggestion from its common identification with hypnotic suggestion, and puts it forward as the key to a powerful psychotherapeutic and educational system. Baudouin emphasizes the importance of reaching the subconscious through well-constructed suggestions and outlines a technique which he claims to be effective in treating emotional problems and enhancing learning at every level.

Abandoning his previous notion that the phenomena of mediumship could be attributed entirely to the unconscious operation of a vital energy within the medium, he here posits an outside directing force beyond the medium and those in the immediate vicinity and explains this within the framework of a doctrine of individual and collective evolution. [P] 1755. [Harris, Dean William Toronto: McClelland, Goodchild & Stewart, 1919, (6) + vi + (2) + 181 pp. Harris includes spiritism among the occult sciences.

[Henslow, George.](#Henslow.G) The Proofs of the Truths Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., 1919, xii + 255 pp. Using psychic occurrences witnessed by himself and those known to him, the author attempts to prove the genuineness of mediumistic phenomena. His purpose is to show that the spirits of the departed communicate with the living. Data used include spirit communications, automatic writing, and physical phenomena such as apports, poltergeists, and spirit photography. It is the work of a believer in spiritualism. [P] 1757.

In a sense this is a summary of all of his previous writings, concentrating principally on the issue of survival after death and a future life. The intention of the book, and his personal \"mission,\" is summarized in these words from the preface: \"If I succeed in leading intelligent people to take scientific interest in the phenomena while they preserve proper cautions in accepting conclusions I shall have accomplished all that can be expected in a work of this kind, and tho I regard the evidence of survival after death as conclusive for most people who have taken the pains to examine the evidence critically, I have endeavored in this work to canvass the subject as tho it had still to be proved.\" [P] 1758.

He admits that spontaneous apparitions of the dead may take place, but criticizes the spiritualists' deliberate attempt to communicate with the dead. His main conclusion is that spiritualism has not, as it claimed, discovered a way of tapping hidden but normal powers in man which may be legitimately used and by means of which the dead may communicate with the living. On the contrary, spiritualism is a modern revival of necromancy and black magic universally condemned by the Church. [P] 1760.

He begins with an analysis of the dimensions of space and looks at the possibility that existence beyond death takes place in a fourth dimension. [P] 1768. [[Carrington, Walter 1920, 134 pp. Carrington attempts to indicate the kind of empirical evidence that would be necessary to establish human survival of death with reasonable certainty, evidence that some individual personality has undergone death and has yet remained sufficiently intact to warrant being described as the same individual. Contending that the evidence available from mediums is sufficient to make survival the most probable hypothesis, Carrington then investigates the process of mediumistic communication and the various factors that may influence its form. He concludes by deploring the fact that spiritualists are for the most part so uncritical about communications from mediums that they make the dispassionate study of the evidence difficult and give those who undertake such studies a bad name in the minds of thinking people.

The first volume deals with man's spiritual nature and the faculties of the soul that seem to go beyond ordinary material existence, such as telepathy and precognition. The second volume takes up phantasms of the living, that is, apparitions of various kinds, with the emphasis on apparitions of the dying before or at the moment of death. The third volume deals with the return of the dead, describing manifestations of the departed from a few minutes to many years after death.

Janet's most exhaustive statement of his theory and technique of psychological healing. In this massive work, Janet presents a system that results from thought evolved through many years of clinical work. In this system, psychological energy plays a central role, providing the means for integrating one's experiences into a functioning whole. The work is divided into four parts: (1) a historical account of the search for mental healing through the ages, (2) a description of the role of human automatism in the understanding and treatment of psychological disturbances, (3) an explanation of the place of mental energy in the formation of an illness and its treatment, and (4) an evaluation of the utility of treatment techniques that have been used by practitioners. Throughout the work, Janet assigns aplace of preeminent importance to the animal magnetic and hypnotic traditions in the search to understand and heal mental illness. [H] 1778.

A paper originally read at a general meeting of the Society for Psychical Research on July 4, 1919 and translated into English by H. G. Baynes. Here Jung discusses apparitions, dreams, and nervous disorders as the principle sources for the primitive belief in the existence of spirits. From a psychological viewpoint, he suggests, the experience of spirits arises from the projection of autonomous complexes buried within the psyche. Projection outward is to be expected, because these \"spirit-complexes\" which belong to the impersonal or collective unconscious, should not ordinarily be associated with the ego. [P] P] 1780.

He was a believer in the reality of spirit communication and was convinced that the evidence provided by good mediums should have a cumulative effect ending with conviction on the part of any impartial investigator.

Tischner carried out a number of well-controlled experiments to study these phenomena and came to the conclusion that, under suitable conditions, some individuals do show themselves to possess faculties which allow them to communicate with other minds and to obtain information through other than ordinary channels.

London: Kegan Paul, Trench & Trubner, 1930. The single most important work yet written on the subject of possession and exorcism. Oesterreich thoroughly examines material related to possession from ancient to contemporary times and from a number of primitive cultures. Noting that certain themes appear again and again in accounts of possession, no matter where they originate, he points out that possessing entities appear to be of two types: human and non-human spirits. In his classification and comments, Oesterreich brings to bear a solid grasp of the then most recent findings relating to hysteria, multiple personality, and hypnotic trance. He distinguishes between involuntary and voluntary possession, the latter being by far the most common type, observable every day in primitive trance rituals and spiritualistic s\u00e9ances. Oesterreich does not claim to have arrived at a final conclusion concerning the intrinsic nature of possession phenomena, but he clearly leans toward a psychological-parapsychological as opposed to a spiritistic explanation. But regardless of his personal belief about possession, his description of the phenomenon in its various forms remains the most comprehensive available. Translated from the second German edition. London: Methuen and Co., 1923. Oesterreich's first work on psychical research (\"Okkultismus\"). Looking chiefly at the phenomena produced by the mediums H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Smith, Leonora Piper, Eusapia Palladino, and Eva C, he concludes that the tenets of spiritualism can be neither proved nor disproved. He comments that many have harbored the fond wish that parapsychology would open the doors to the world beyond the grave and give the race new hope. This, he says, has not happened.

[P] 1813. pp. In this work Tischner examines various kinds of knowledge, normal and supernormal, and their implications for out many experiments in telepathy over a number of years before writing this book. In some of the most successful experiments, he was himself the percipient or \"receiver\" of telepathic information. Here he presents details of circumstances and results of his telepathic experiences and his own view of telepathy as a psycho-physical process involving the transmission of vibrations from one brain to another. Not surprisingly, he does not accept the notion of telepathic communication between the living and the dead.

In 1922 \"Megalis\" gave performances in various towns in Sweden. This book describes those apparently successful clairvoyant sessions. [P] iv + 201 pp. In this book Ehrenfreund combines his expertise in criminology with his interest in psychical research in describing the work of a Viennese clairvoyant named \"Megalis\" (Karoline Steininger). When \"Megalis\" had been placed in a deep hypnotic trance, induced by Dr. Leopold Thoma, she was told to go to the scene of a crime and back to the moment when it was being committed. According to Ehrenfreund, she frequently produced accurate information about the crime and its circumstances. [P] 1824. [Fournier D'Albe, Edmund to August 1921.

By the time Richet wrote this book he had accumulated an impressive list of personal honors. He had been professor of physiology at the University of Paris since 1887; he had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1913; he was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie de M\u00e9decine and the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences; and in 1905 he had been elected president of the Society for Psychical Research. The latter position indicates the depth of his involvement in studies of the paranormal. In 1884 Richet began his psychical researches with sittings with the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino and in 1891, he founded the Annales des Sciences Psychiques, the first French periodical devoted to psychical research. Richet begins his Trait\u00e9 with a definition and discussion of the term \"metapsychique,\" the French word (first introduced by Richet) which is the equivalent of the English \"psychical research.\" After giving a brief history of developments in the area, he proceeds to describe, area by area, the present state of knowledge in research of the paranormal.

He begins with a discussion of what he considers to be experimental proofs of survival, and moves on to consider the continued presence of the dead in hauntings. Within this general survey, Flammarion scatters a detailed examination of a few cases, including \"Calvados castle,\" the haunted house of La Constantinie, and the \"fantastic villa of Comeada, Coimbra.\" After classifying true haunting phenomena, he discusses those not attributable to the dead (such as poltergeist occurrences) and spurious hauntings.

While making use of the experiments and investigations of others, Mackenzie contributes his own critical evaluation of the reliability and implications of those findings. He has an unusually lengthy treatment of supernormal phenomena connected with animals (e.g., the Elberfeld horses and the Mannheim dog), and he seems fairly ready to accept them as genuine. vii + 388 pp. Working largely from original material drawn from his own investigations, Osty, in a work he considers to supersede his earlier Lucidit\u00e9 et intuition (1913), explores some of the most remarkable cases of clairvoyance ever published. These cases are related in great detail and with minute descriptions of the circumstances surrounding each. The phenomena described involve knowledge of unknown events at a distance in both space and time. Any serious criticism of the validity of the findings of psychical research must deal in some way or other with the material of this book. [P] 1852.

His controls identified themselves to him on various occasions as biblical characters, ancient philosophers, well-known historical personages, and others. Trethewy considers two possible sources for these controls, the subliminal or subconscious self of the medium and spirits. While admitting that it is impossible to prove either alternative, he indicates that the evidence is such that the second cannot be reasonably ruled out.

In this work he attempts to classify and analyze the many beliefs that human beings arrive at in the course of a lifetime. He is particularly concerned to establish a philosophical basis for crediting the findings of science, which has to avoid credulity on the one hand and skepticism on the other. One of the beliefs Schiller examines in detail is the belief in survival of death, pointing out the extreme difficulty involved in arriving at anything scientific in this matter. [P] 1875.

[P] (7) 42 pp. An excellent study of \"exteriorization of sensibility\" or sensation at a distance. Tischner begins with an examination of the \"magnetic fluid\" of Mesmer and the \"odic force\" of Reichenbach, and traces the notion of an extension of sensibility beyond the organism that arose from those systems. He discusses the recent investigations of de Rochas, Joire, and Boirac, and then describes his own experiments. Asserting that the success of these trials combined with the accumulated evidence of previous experimenters stands strongly in favor of the reality of the phenomenon, Tischner moves on to a general theoretical discussion of what this \"exteriorization of sensibility\" might be. He concludes that there must be something other than suggestion involved in the phenomenon. There must, he believes, be some physical agent at work that is not as yet well understood. This reopens the question of the validity of mesmerism and \"magnetic fluid,\" in some form or other. Tischner believes that the appeal to suggestion as an explanation has not closed that question, as some had believed. He also suggests that \"exteriorization of sensibility\" is probably involved in certain phenomena of mediumship, such as telekinesis and materializations. excellent reference source for the history of psychical research. This is the second of two volumes. The first volume (entry number [1830](#e1830)) covers the period from ancient times to the middle of the nineteenth century. This volume covers the period from the middle of the nineteenth century to the time of writing. As is so often the case, the German word \"occult\" in the title refers to psychical research, not to issues related to esoteric magic. Tischner covers the period in question efficiently, with great accuracy, and with broad coverage that includes the history of psychical research in America, England, France, and Germany. Although the book is, as one might expect, particularly strong in its treatment of psychical research in Germany, its one area of weakness is the brevity of its treatment of work in France. Nevertheless, Tischner gives the reader a clear picture of the main streams of development of psychical research in this important period, and provides a clear framework for understanding the interplay of intellectual currents that influenced its course. 1882.

Watts, Celia L. Goerz, Orlando D. Goerz. Los Angeles: National Psychological Institute, 1924, 390 pp. Wickland, a physician working in collaboration with his wife who was a spiritualist medium, had a unique method for enticing possessing spirits to communicate. Using a static electricity machine, sometimes employed by physicians in those days to treat various illnesses, he would drive the spirit from the victim and into his entranced wife. This enabled him to talk and reason with the spirit through his wife. He believed that in many cases the invading spirit had entered the victim accidentally, being attracted to the light of that person's \"aura.\" After the spirit had become convinced of its true condition (that it was no longer in its own body, that it needed to pass on to another stage of life, etc.), it would usually leave willingly. Sometimes, however, Wickland had to call upon friendly spirits to take the invading entity away forcibly. Wickland claims to have completely cured individuals who had long been institutionalized as insane. In some cases he was able to confirm that the cure still held many years after the treatment. He also spent some time tracking down and verifying information given by the invading spirits about the circumstances of their lives on earth. The book is significant as a rare attempt to give practical application to the spiritualist view of the world through a kind of mediumistic psychotherapy. [P] 1925 1885. [Baerwald, Richard.](#Baerwald.R) Urkunde. Edited by Max Dessoir). Berlin: Ullstein, 1925, ix + (1) + 382 + (2) pp. An excellent study of the \"intellectual phenomena\" of psychical research. These include telepathy, apparitions, clairvoyance, foreknowledge, and communication with the dead. Baerwald's point of departure for the study of psychical phenomena is psychological, an attempt to probe the realms of the unconscious through an examination of some of our most mysterious experiences. Baerwald concentrates on examples of these phenomena drawn from German psychical researchers and, for that reason, the book is an extremely valuable source of information on the history of psychical research in Germany. The book is well researched and copiously footnoted. (For the first volume of this work, see physikalische The Religion of Health: an Examination of Christian Science. Completed by R. M. Barrett.

The book attempts to describe those phenomena, but does so in a disorganized and confusing manner. The author believes \"Margery's\" phenomena to be supernormal, but, although attempts were made by objective persons to test them under laboratory conditions, no concurring conclusions were reached. One of those attempts was made by a committee of the Scientific American set up to investigate \"Margery,\" with Bird as its secretary. That committee's conclusions were negative and the latter half of this book is devoted to a criticism of its findings. [P] 1888. [Broad, Charlie Dunbar. ](#Broad.C) The Mind and Its Place in Nature. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., 1925, x + 674 pp. Broad was Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge and a brilliant philosophical lecturer and writer. He developed a particular interest in psychical research and became one of its most distinguished theorists. This work is an expanded version of the Tarner Lectures given at Cambridge in 1923. In the first part of the volume, Broad considers the various common-sense theories of the nature of mind and raises the mind-body problem. He then investigates the ways in which we come to know about things around us, examining sense perception, memory, introspection, and knowledge of other minds. From there, Broad moves on to a discussion of evidence for the existence of an \"unconscious.\" In the fourth section of the book he takes up human survival after death, an issue directly related to psychical research. Pointing out that the Society for Psychical Research has brought forth a mass of facts pertaining to the continued existence of human beings after death, Broad contends that these facts may justly be called \"supernormal\" in that they cannot be explained through the usual assumptions of science and common sense about the nature and powers of the human mind. Taking these facts into account, Broad discusses first the ethical and then the empirical arguments for survival. He does not believe that the various ethical arguments that have been put forward by philosophers are valid, but he does think that important directions are indicated in the empirical arguments. Human survival of death as a hypothesis, says Broad, goes a long way toward explaining supernormal data. Nonetheless, a hypothesis is only that, and although Broad does not believe it possible to disprove survival, neither does he hold that we have what constitutes convincing proof. Broad believes that any valid philosophical analysis must take into account all the facts as we know them, and in this vein he develops a philosophical psychology that recognizes both the findings of psychical research and those of scientific 1925, ix + 80 pp. An account of 114 experiments in telepathic transference of drawings and diagrams carried out by the author.

The present volume, concerned with the physical phenomena of mediumship, begins with a thorough discussion of the methodology to be used in investigating the phenomena and the sources of error against which researchers must be guarded. This is followed by a discussion of the experiments of the London Dialectical Society and of William Crookes in the early 1870s, a brief treatment of the Slade-Z\u00f6llner experiments, a lengthy section on the physical phenomena of Eusapia Palladino (1854-1918), a substantial discussion of Stanislawa Tomczyk and Kathleen Goligher, and shorter studies of other well-known mediums, such as \"Eva C.,\" Willy Schneider, and Ladislaus Laszlo.
