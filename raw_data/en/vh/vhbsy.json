CODE MOVEM ENT Spinal arthrodesis codes were added to lines that had some, but not all, of the spinal arthrodesis codes Acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy were added to the low back pain lines Spinal traction was removed from the low back pain lines Artific ial disc replacement was added to the covered and the uncovered spinal conditions lines Electromyelography was recommended to be moved from the Ancillary to the Diagnostic List Transcranial magnetic stimulation was added to the major depression line A seri es of straightforward code changes were accepted Injections into the labyrinth were added for treatment of Meniere's disease Several procedures were added for the treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip ITEMS CONSIDERED BUT NO CHANGES MADE An unspecific ICD-9 code for toe walking was considered for movement from an uncovered line to a covered dysfunction line; however, a more specific code for tendon contractures was found to pair with the desired treatment and was felt to represent more appropriat e coding A guideline for neuroimaging in headache was considered, but will be revisited in December GUIDELINE CHANGES A series of guidelines were revised to ensure consistency between the Prioritized List and HERC- approved coverage guidances DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D4, ADVANCED IMAGING FOR LOW BACK PAIN was changed to include the imaging recommendation table included in the HERC low back pain evidence- based guideline GUIDELINE NOTE 85, ELECTIVE INDUCTION OF LABOR. The Guideline Note was clarified to indicat e that elective induction of labor is not covered for elective induction of labor prior to 41 weeks except in the cases of maternal diabetes, prelabor rupture of membranes, or other medical or obstetrical indications. Other guideline notes were revised: GUIDELINE NOTE 7, ERYTHROPOIESIS -STIMULATING AGENT (ESA) GUIDELINE. The Guideline Note was changed to require reassessment of ESA use at 12 rather than 8 weeks of therapy for patients with renal insuffi ciency. GUIDELINE NOTE 37 DISORDERS OF SPINE WITH NE UROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT was modified to clarify the definition of radiculopathy and which lines contained which diagnoses GUIDELINE NOTE 47, URINARY INCONTINENCE. The Guideline Note was modified to not include electrical stimulation as a possible modality that could be required to be tried prior to surgery. GUIDELINE NOTE 92, ACUPUNCTURE was revised to allow coverage for low back pain for 12 visits and for tension headache New guidelines were adopted: GUIDELINE NOTE XXX, SMOKING AND SPINAL F USION . This guideline allows coverage of spinal fusion only for non -smoking patients. GUIDELINE NOTE XXX, FOREIGN BODIES IN TH E GI TRACT was adopted to specify that hazardous foreign bodies would be c overed on a higher line, nonhaz ardous bodies on a lower line A series of new guidelines were adopted to ensure consistency between the Prioritized List and HERC- approved coverage guidances GUIDELINE NOTE XXX , ARTIFICIAL DISC REPL ACEMENT was adopted which details when artificial disc replacement would potentially be covered. GUIDELINE NOTE XXX , NON- PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT -RESISTANT DEPRESSION was adopted to require trials of two antidepressant medications prior to ECT or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation DIAGNOSTIC GUILDELINE XXX, NEUROIMAGING IN DEMENTIA was adopted specifying when neuroimaging is covered for the work up of dementia CHANGES FOR THE OCTO BER 1, 2014 (TENTATI VE) PRIORITIZED LIST AS PART OF THE ICD- 10 CONVERSION PROCES S Various ICD -10 codes for peripheral neuropathies were moved f rom an uncovered sprain/strain line to covered nerve disorder lines Foreign body codes were added to a covered line with a guideline specifying when these codes are on the upper covered and when on the lowered uncovered lines Albinism codes were added to t he precancerous skin condition line; certain albinism codes involving conditions of the eyes were also added to an ophthalmology line Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 3 VALUE -BASED BENEFITS SUBCOMMITTEE Meridian Park Health Education Center October 11 , 2012 8:30 AM - 1:30 PM Members Present: Lisa Dodson, MD, Chair; Kevin Olson, MD, Vice -chair; Coffman; Ariel Smits, MD, MPH; Cat Liv ingston, MD, MPH Jason Gingerich; Dorothy Allen Also Attending: Denise Taray (DMAP ); Kathy Kirk, Oregon Pain Management Commission Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called to order at 8:30 am and roll was called. Minutes from the August 9, 2012 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved as submitted. ACTION: HERC staff will post the approved minutes on the website as soon as possible. An orthopedic surgeon from Roseburg has expressed interest in joining the VbBS/HERC. The HERC has been looking for surgical expertise in a member. The subcommittee had no objections to having the HERC consider her for VbBS membership. She will likely be joining the VbBS for the December meeting. Coffman discussed having a possible new timeline for dealing with new CPT codes. These codes are expected to be published in September rather than late October. The VbBS may take these codes up in November (starting in 2013) and publish a new List on January 1 st to allow the new codes to be incorporated into the List in a timely fashion. The downside of this proposal would be to have a longer time between Lists (January 1 and October 1 rather than April 1 and October 1). Kirk reported that the plans did not have an issue with the delayed code publicat ion to date. HERC staff will continue to examine this possible change and update the subcommittee. Smits presented a HERC staff request for input from the subcommittee for dealing with treatments with low effectiveness and high cost. Two options would be a specific guideline for each new class of treatment or a general guideline outlining general coverage guidance. Gibson thought that a set of principles for coverage would be useful . Ocker suggested that some of these treatments should still be broug ht to the committee to review. Coffman mentioned that previous discussions with the HSC had brought up issues about having an absolute number ( QALY threshold) in a guideline. Kirk urged staff to consider the guideline note method as these notes have been very useful for the plans and in the legal process. Topic: Mononeuritis and other peripheral neuropathies Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 4 Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with suggested placement changes for ICD- 10 codes for peripheral neuropathies on the 2014 li st. It was clarified the new acute peripheral nerve injury line included surgical treatment only. There was minimal discussion and changes were approved as proposed. Actions: 1) G57.10 -G57.13 moved from line 638 to lines 535 and 557 2) G57.20 -G57.22 moved fr om line 638 to lines 450 (new line on October 1, 2014 List), 535 and 557. 3) G57.40 -G57.42 moved from line 557 to line 441 4) G58.8 -G58.9 moved from line 638 to lines 535 and 557 5) DMAP advised to move G59 from line 638 to the Excluded File Topic: Toe walking Discussion: Smits introduced a summary regarding coverage of toe walking. Kirk brought up that most toe -walking self resolves and therefore does not need to be covered. Pollack was concerned about the cases in which kids have an underlying medical condition which results in the toe walking, such as cerebal palsy. In CP and other cases, there are true ligament contractures. The group felt that ligament contractures should be covered, but not toe walking per se. Smits noted that 727.18 (ligament contractur e) was on line 318 and paired with the tendon lengthening CPT code requested for treatment of toe walking. The decision was that 727.18 could be used to code for this condition when surgery is required. Providers may need to be educated that this pairing exists on line 318. Toe walking (ICD -9 739.79) was not added to line 318. Actions: No changes made to the Prioritized List Topic: Erythropoeisis stimulating guideline revision Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regarding suggested changes to the erythropoeisis stimulating agents (ESAs) guideline. There was some discussion about use of ESAs for conditions not currently included in the guideline, such as anemia resulting from treatment including multiple medications for hepatitis C. The decision was not to consider adding any indications until specifically requested to review ESAs for a new particular indication. The requested change increasing the reassessment period in renal failure to 12 weeks was accepted. Actions: A revised guideline note was adopted as shown in Attachment A. Topic: Radiculopathy and guideline note 37 Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with suggested changes to guideline note 37. There was a discussion about adding radiculopathy and mem bers suggested a language modification could be made for greater clarity. There were Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 5 clarifying suggestions about which portion of the guideline applied to which line on the Prioritized List. Actions: A revised diagnostic guideline was approved as shown in Attachment A. Topic: Guideline for spinal fusion and smoking Discussion: Smits introduced a summary with a suggested new guideline regarding smoking and spinal fusion. There was some discussion about whether it would be problematic to require tes ting on the day of surgery. Kirk felt that the guideline as written was implementable and the requirement for testing was not significantly different from the bariatric surgery guideline. There was concern that there w as no restriction to not smoke after surgery; however, it was felt that such restrictions would not be feasible. Gibson suggested that, because there are multiple types of surgery which have better outcomes with non- smoking, a more general guideline limiting most types of surgery to non-smokers should be considered. However, it was felt that the evidence reviewed showed decrease efficacy with smoking and spinal fusion; evidence was not reviewed for other types of surgery. Ocker expressed concern for discrimination with this guideline. S he was concerned that smokers may tend to have other characteristics such as poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, etc. She suggested that patient education may be more valuable than a restrictive guideline. Other members agreed that there was a concern about discrimination. However, the general consensus was that the evidence supported this guideline. Additionally, restricting smoking had precedence in other rules such as restricting alcohol use prior to liver transplant. Spinal fusion is generally an elect ive surgery, which gives patients time to quit smoking. Dodson reminded the subcommittee that OHP covers tobacco cessation treatments, so patients would all have access to these types of services. The group felt that Ocker's concerns about patient educat ion and optimizing lifestyle issues should be brought up again when this guideline was discussed at HERC. The group also added a clause to the guideline specifying that patients have access to tobacco cessation services. There was discussion that spinal fusion surgery has marginal effectiveness, so any restrictions which improve outcomes are useful. There was also support for having patients have accountability for optimizing their own health outcomes. DMAP raised concerns about the suggested guideline specifying \"non -elective\" spinal surgery. There was a question about what the definition of elective was. The subcommittee felt that only emergent indications would require a waiving of the non - smoking guideline and changed that wording in the guideline. Emergent indications were thought to be neurologic conditions which were unstable, such as rapidly progressing neurological deterioration. An emergent indication would be one for which delay in treatment would reasonably be expected to result in permanent serious dysfunction. The decision was to change the language to \"emergent\" without a specific definition in the guideline. If there is a problem in defining emergent in practice, then DMAP or the health plans can bring this guideline back for further modifications. Actions: 1) A new guideline was adopted as shown in Attachment B. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 6 2) Add 22532- 22548, 22590- 22632 to line 84 DEEP ABSCESSES, PERIORBITAL ABSCESS; INTESTINAL PERFORATION 3) Add 22532- 22548 Topic: Urinary Incontinence Guideline Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document with suggested changes to the urinary incontinence guideline. There were some questions about whether electrical stimulation was par t of physical therapy. Ocker noted that some of the literature showed acupuncture treatments, others showed electrical pads as the therapy. Kirk noted that electrical stimulation was billed in addition to PT. Dodson expressed concern about limiting the modalities used by a PT. Smits pointed out that electrical stimulation (CPT 97014) was currently on the Excluded List, so we are not covering it currently. The subcommittee agreed to not add coverage for this service and to remove reference to this servi ce from the current urinary incontinence guideline. Actions: A revised guideline note was adopted as shown in Attachment A Topic: Coverage Guidance for Low Back Pain/Acupuncture Guideline Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes to the P rioritized List to make it consistent with the HERC coverage guidance for low back pain. There was discussion about adding coverage for low back pain, which has traditionally been below the funding line. However, OHP is currently paying for primary care v isits for this diagnosis. Members discussed that as OHP moves toward CCOs, there may be additional incentive to cover services such as yoga. There was some concern about CCOs not being willing to accept the global budget amounts , which would make such coverage less likely. Currently, many patients with back pain are treated by pain clinics, but there is an access issue for both pain clinics and primary care for patients with back pain and narcotic prescriptions. There is an emerging issue of PCPs unwill ing to see patients who are taking narcotics at all. There was some discussion about requiring referrals for acupuncture. Ocker was concerned that this might limit access. Others expressed concern that acupuncturists may not be able to make a diagnos is, which would be required for coverage. Seeing a PCP and getting identified as having a covered diagnosis would be facilitated by requiring referral for acupuncture. There was concern that some PCPs would refuse to refer to acupuncture as they do not f eel that it is effective. The subcommittee expressed their intent to not limit acupuncture access, but rather to have a referral to maintain continuity between the PCP and acupuncturist. Further discussion of the acupuncture guideline centered around t he number of visits allowed for low back pain. The decision was 12 visits was a reasonable place to start. Ocker felt that 12 visits was a reasonable number for any chronic pain condition. The decision was to add coverage for acupuncture and CBT to li nes 400 and 562 (the back lines). Spinal traction will no longer be covered per the coverage guidance. A Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 7 coding specification will be added to these lines to specify that CBT is only covered for certain back pain diagnoses. The acupuncture guideline was modified to reflect coverage for low back pain. An additional modification was made to the acupuncture guideline to allow coverage for tension headaches. HERC staff will work with Ocker to consider other conditions to be added to the acupuncture guideli ne. Actions: 1) Add acupuncture (97810 -4) to lines 400 and 562. 2) Add cognitive behavioral therapy (90804- 15) to lines 400 and 562 3) Delete spinal traction (CPT code 97012) from lines 400 and 562 4) Add a coding specification to Line 400 i. Cognitive behavioral ther apy (90804- 15) only pair s on Line 400 with the low back a coding specification to Line 562 i. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90804- 15) only pair s on Line 562 with the low back as shown in Attachment A . Topic: Coverage Guidance for Artificial Disc R eplacement Discussion: Smits introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on artificial disc replacement. Livingston reminded the subcommit tee that the data showed that artificial disks were non-inferior to spinal fusion. Olson pointed out that the HSC had not adopted coverage of artificial discs due to concer n about safety; however, the newer data reviewed to create the coverage guidance appeared to be more r eassuring about the safety of this procedure. It was also discussed that this procedure is safer than the alt ernative of spinal fusion. Dodson wanted the List to match the coverage guidance and the HTAS decision. It was pointed out that the diagnoses suggested to pair with artificial disc replacement were on lines 400 and 562 and the artificial disk CPT codes should be added to both lines. The decision was to adopt the guideline as suggested, with an additional reference to line 562. Actions: 1) Adopt a new guideline as shown in Attachment B 2) Add artificial disc replacement (CPT 22856 -22865) to line 400 and 562 Topic: Coverage Guidance for Neuroimaging for Low Back Pain Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverag e guidance on neuroimaging for low back pain. There was minimal discussion about the guideline. It was pointed out that electromyelography (CPT 96002- 4) is used for diagnosis of a vari ety of conditions. The proposal was to not cover this service for the diagnosis of low back pain ; however, the Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 8 group agreed that it should be covered for diagnosis for other conditions and moved from the Ancillary to the Diagnostic List. The intention is to not cover EMG for diagnosis of low back pain. Actions: 1) Advise DMAP to move electromyelography (CPT 96002- 4) from the Ancillary List to the Diagnostic List 2) Diagnostic guideline 4 modified as shown in Attachment A. Topic: Coverage G uidance for Nonpharmacologic Interventions for T reatment Resistant Depression Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on treatment resistant depression. Pollack expr essed concern that there was no evidence for treatments such as meditation, psychotherapy, etc. There was some discussion about clarifying what qualifies as two medications for depression. For example, sleep aids should not be considered medications. The medications should be SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants or similar medications. There was som e concern that psychotherapy may not be reasonable to try in certain cases , such as catatonic patients . The group felt that the proposed guideline was reasonable, but changed the title to more closely reflect what was included in the guideline. Actions: 1) Transcranial magnetic stimulation codes 90867 - 90868 were added to Line 9 MAJOR DEPRESSION, RECURRENT; MAJOR DEPRESSION, SINGLE EPISODE, SEVERE 2) No chan ge was made to 90869 placement 3) A new treatment guideline for nonpharmacologic interventions for treatment resistant depression was adopted for line 9 as shown in Attachment B Topic: Coverage Guidance for Neuroimaging for Dementia Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on neuroimaging for dementia. The only modification requested to the proposed guideline was to add the reversible causes of dementia that were listed in the coverage guidance to the guideline. Actions: 1) A new diagnostic guideline for neuroimaging in dementia was adopted as shown in Attachment B Topic: Coverage Guidance for Neuroimaging for Headache Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on neuroimaging for Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 9 headache. DMAP has made HERC staff aware that this guideline is unenforceable. This guideline needs to be reworked and br ought back for consideration at the December meeting. Actions: 1) HERC staff to rework guideline and bring back to the December meeting Topic: Coverage Guidance for Elective Induction of Labor Discussion: Smits introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on elective induction of labor. The guideline affected by this coverage guidance was previously reviewed in August. However, HERC staff on review found that the elective induction of labor guideline substantially did not match the coverage guidance. There was some discussion about whether elective induction should be limited prior to 39 weeks or prior to 41 weeks. Elective induction after 39 weeks is standard of care in many Oregon communities. However, there is no evidence that this improves outcomes, and it may cause harm. The group felt that the HERC should challenge community standard, when the evidence supports other practice. The group also felt that the Prioritized List should match HERC guidances. Actions: 1) A revised guideline note was adopted as shown in Attachment A Topic: ICD-10 Follow Up Foreign Body in the GI Tract Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regarding suggested changes to coverage of treatment of foreign bodies in the GI tract. There was minimal discussion. Actions: 1) Duplicate foreign body in GI tract codes currently on the 2014 biennial Prioritized List line 527 (T18.2xxA, T18.3xxA, T18.4xxA, INTUSSCEPTION, VOLVULUS, INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, HAZARDOUS FOREIGN BODY IN GI TRACT WITH RISK OF PERFORATION OR OBSTRUCTION 2) Rename Line 527 FOREIGN BODY IN GI TRACT WITHOUT RISK OF PERFORATION OR OBSTRUCTION . 3) Adopt a new guideline for lines 48 and 527 as shown in Attachment B for the 2014 biennial list Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 10 Topic: ICD -10 Follow Up Placement of Albinism Codes Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document for changes involving albinism codes for the 2014 biennial list . The discussion centered around whether routine skin exams should be covered for persons with this condition. The suggested placement was on the prevention line (line 3); however, the line containing high risk skin conditions (line 257) was considered to be a better plac e to pair albinism with skin exam CPT codes. Ocular and cutaneous diagnoses would be on both the ophthamalogical and the skin lines. Cutaneous only diagnosis codes should only be on line 257. Actions: 1. Place E70.338 and E70.339 (with hematologic abnormal ity) on Line 329 DISORDERS OF AMINO -ACID TRANSPORT AND METABOLISM (NON PKU) Place oculocutaneous albinism codes (E70.31x and E70.32x) on Line STRABISMUS; OF 2. Place cutaneous AND E70.39 on line AL PREMALIGNANT AND CARCINOMA IN SITU Topic: Straightforward Issues Discussion: Smits presented a summary of straightforward changes to the Prioritized List. There was a brief discussion about adding cerumen impaction lavage (69210) to several lines or taking off all lines but 526. The group felt that the lavage was needed to treat the hearing loss or to diagnose otitis media and therefore should be on these lines. Uncomplicated cerumen impaction will stay on line 526. There was also discussion about adding PT/OT for treatment of brachial plexus. The group decided to add PT/OT to both lines with brachial plexus codes (lines 493 and 535). Actions: 1) Remove 59830 from line 1 2) Add 59830 to line 41 3) Add 75557- 75561, 75565 to line 50 4) Add 26665 to line 382 5) Add 26785 to line 297 6) Add 43262, 43264, 43265, 43268, and 43271 to line 308 7) Add 28190 to line 415 8) Remove 96920- 2 from lines 223, 386, 432, 517, 545, 553, 554 and 568 9) Add 61582 to line 320 10) Remove 839.40 from line 497 11) Add 839.40 to line 551 12) Add 77371 to line 466 13) Add 19120 to lines 197, 509 and 665 14) Advise DMAP to remove 19120 from the Ancillary List 15) Remove 11401 and 11402 from line 197 16) Remove 11623 from line 197 17) Remove 13122, 13132, and 13133 from line 197 18) Add 23470 and 23472 to line 208 19) Add 27130 to lines 89, 207, 308 and 382 Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 11 20) Add 27495 to line 208 21) Add 11043- 11047 to line 142 22) Add 76801, 76805, and 76815- 7 to line 59 23) Add 27495 to line 208 24) Add 61571 to line 101 25) Add 14000 to line 208 26) Add 14001 to lines 197, 216, 308, 448 27) Add 69210 to lines 383 and 470 28) Add 44120, 44121, and 44125 to line 88 29) Add 15100 and 15101 to lines 146, 167, 250, and 448 30) Add 44130 to line 341 31) Add 33530 to line 77 32) Add 12021 to line 216 33) Add 77418 and 77421 to line 165 34) Add 97001- 97004, 97110- 97124 to line 493 and 535 35) Add ref erence to line 493 and 535 to GUIDELINE NOTE 6, REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES 36) Add 92002- 92014 to lines 183, 292, 308, 320, and 448 37) Add 65430 to line 164 38) Add 44125 to lines 35 and 165 39) Add 99211- 99255 to line 173 40) Change the treatment description of line 173 to \"M edical and surgical treatment\" 41) Add 357.2 to line 535 42) Add 51705 and 51710 to line 351 43) Add 29828 to line 406 44) Remove 45378 from line 48 45) Advise DMAP to place 45378 on the Diagnostic List Topic: Intratympanic Gentamycin for Meniere's Disease Discussion: Smits presented a summary document. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add 69801 ( Surgical Treatment Discussion: Smits presented a sum mary document. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add 27001- 27006 (Open tenotomy, hip) to line 336 2) Add 27140- 27165 (osteotomy, hip or pelvis) to line 336 3) Add 77036 (capsulectomy or capsulotomy, hip) to line 336 4) Do not add hip arthroplasty (27130) to line 336 Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 12 Topic: Coverage Algorithm Discussion: Livingston presented a proposed coverage algorithm for discussion. A comment was raised that the burden of proof should be on those advocating the treatment. A discussion of coverage with evidence development ensued, and there were considerations such as less risk or harm, but unknown effectiveness. There was a discussion of standard of care and how to invest public resources and public dollars. The entire side of the algorithm in which there is insufficient or mixed evidence was felt to be risky for recommended coverage. If there is insufficient evidence, how can one know if it is safer and cheaper . The middle avenue on the algorithm should not have coverage. Actions: 1) Further discussion of the algorithm is planned for today's HERC meeting Public Comment: There was no additional public comment received. Issues for next meeting: Placement of 2013 CPT codes Guideline note 44 , menstrual bleeding disorders Puberty suppressing medications for gender questioning youth Silver nitrate treatment for dental caries Neuroimaging for headache Next meeting: Scheduled for December 13, 2012 , Meridian Park Hospital Health Education Center, Tualatin OR , Room 117B&C, 8:30 AM Attachment A Revised Guidelines Value-based Benefits Subcom mittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Attachment A The following guideline revisions will go into effect on April 1, 2013 : GUIDELINE NOTE 7, ERYTHROPOIESIS -STIMULATING AGENT < 10gm/dl or Hct < 30%) induced by cancer chemotherapy given within the previous 8 weeks or in the setting of myelodysplasia. 1) Reassessment should be made after 8 weeks of treatment. If no response, treatment should be discontinued. If response is demonstrated, ESAs should be discontinued once the hemoglobi n level reaches 10gm/dl, unless a lower hemoglobin level is sufficient to avoid the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. B) Indicated for anemia (Hgb < 10gm/dl or HCT < 30%) associated with HIV/AIDS. 1) An endogenous erythropoietin level < 500 IU/L is required for treatment, and patient may not be receiving zidovudine (AZT) > 4200 mg/week. 2) Reassessment should be made after 8 weeks. If no response, treatment should be for RBC transfusions should be used, and the Hgb should not exceed 11gm/dl. C) Indicated for anemia (Hgb < 10 gm/dl or HCT <30%) associated with chronic renal failure, with or without dialysis. 1) Reassessment should be made after 8 12 weeks. If no response, treatment should be discontinued. If response is demonstrated, the lowest ESA dose sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions should be used, and the Hgb should not exceed 11gm/dl.

They have been investigated for use in patients who have prolonged broncho- pleural air leaks, as well as an alternative to lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) in patients with lobar hyperinflation from severe emphysema. 3) Evidence a.

Literature review of efficacy and safety of bronchoscopic treatment of severe COPD with pulmonary valves ii. 6 case series identified (N=98, 21, 57, 98, 19, 19) iii. 2 studies showed significant improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) at 3- month follow -up; 1 study found improvement at 1 year follow up (significance not given); 1 study showed no difference at 6 month follow up iv. 3 studies found improvement in quality of life; 1 study did not v. A case series of 98 patients with end -stage emphysem a treated by bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with airway valves reported that 1% (1/98) of patients died following complications related to pneumonia Pneumothorax occurred across the studi es. Most resolved spontaneously but 1 patient required valve removal and 2 required tube insertion. vii. Across the case series exacerbation of COPD following the procedure occurred at a rate of 35% (20/57) and 17% (17/98) of patients (follow -up period varied between studies). viii. The most consistently reported complication across the series was bronchospasm, which occurred in 5% (5/98), 5% (1/20), 5% (1/19) and 4% (2/57) of patients. ix. A case series of 19 patients with severe emphysema treated with bronchoscopic l ung volume reduction with airway valves reported that bronchial hypersecretion with worsening clinical status occurred in 5% (1/19) of patients; this resolved after a number of valves were removed. In the same series valve displacement occurred in 5% (1/19 ) of patients; the valve was also removed b. Sterman 2010 (abstract only available) i. Multicenter pilot study ii. N=91 patients 2013 CPT Code Issues 2 iii. Pneumothorax was the most frequent serious device -related complication and primarily occurred when all segments of a lobe, especially the left UL, were occluded. iv. Highly significant health -related quality of life (HRQL) improvement ( - 8.2 +/ - 16.2, mean +/ - SD change at 6 months) was observed. HRQL improvement was associated with a decreased volume (mean - 294 +/ - 427 ml, p = 0.007) in the tr eated lobes without visible atelectasis. FEV(1), exercise tests, and total lung volume were not changed but there was a proportional shift, a redirection of inspired volume to the untreated lobes. v.

Thomson 2012 i. Review ii. 3 RCTs included (N=112, 34, 288) iii. 2 RCTs showed clinical benefits of bronchial thermoplasty compared with usual care in patients with moderate or severe asthma. The third trial 2013 CPT Code Issues 3 reports the results of a comparison with sham bronchial thermoplasty in 288 adults with severe asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty improved asthma quality of life questionnaire scores compared with sham bronchial thermoplasty; in the posttreatment period, there were fewer severe exacerbations and emergency department visits. Bro nchial thermoplasty causes short -term increases in asthma- related morbidity. iv. Conclusions: Bronchial thermoplasty has a role in the management of patients with severe asthma who have uncontrolled symptoms despite current therapies. Future studies need to i dentify factors that predict a beneficial clinical response. b. Du Rand 2011 i. British Thoracic Society guideline for indications for therapeutic thorascopy ii. The goal of bronchial thermoplasty is to reduce airway smooth muscle by the application of radiofrequenc y-generated heat at 658C. Although there is a high level of evidence for the effectiveness of this technique in reducing symptoms, adverse events and frequency of exacerbations (Evidence level 1), its place in the treatment of asthma remains to be establis hed and we recommend that treatment should be limited to a few specialist centres in carefully selected patients. 4) Other policies a. Aetna 2012 i. Aetna considers bronchial thermoplasty experimental and investigational for the treatment of asthma and other indica tions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) because its effectiveness has not been established. b.

Reviewed in December, 2008 and good evidence found for coverage 2) Description : Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well -defined tumor using ext remely detailed imaging scans. 3) HSC history: a. Discussed in October, 2010. The decision at that time was not to add coverage for stereotactic body radiation therapy, as there was no good long t erm data about whether this more expensive method of delivering radiation was any better than conventional radiation therapy for non- CNS indications. The HOSC wanted data on improved outcomes/lower cost/improved safety data before covering for non-CNS ind ications. This decision was upheld by the HSC at the January, 2011 meeting. b. 77373 and 77435 were new codes for 2007, but no discussion found in the 2006 or 2007 minutes for HSC or HOSC 4) Issue : It appears to be the intent of the HSC/HERC to not cover stereotactic body radiation for non- intracranial malignancies. In 2010, the decision was to wait for additional evidence prior to coverage. A new MED report was published about a year ago on this topic. Additionally, the current code placement is inconsistent and needs to be revised. 5) Evidence a. MED 2011 i. Evidence based review of newer radiation therapies for non- intracranial malignancies ii. 2 good quality technology assessments found addressing SBRT iii. Both technology assessments concluded that SBRT has potential and improves convenience for patients (due to fewer treatment sessions), but comparative studies are needed to determine its efficacy, safety, and cost - effectiveness compared to other treatments. iv. One systematic review found three economic studies of SBRT but st ated that firm conclusions about cost -effectiveness could not be made due to lack of well -designed comparative trials v. No studies compared SBRT to other treatments including conventional radiation therapy 6) Recommendation s: a. Do not cover SBRT for non- intracran ial indications 2013 CPT Code Issues 5 i.

American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 2009 i. Position statement ii. In recent years, confocal l aser endomicroscopy rapidly moved from the bench to the bedside. It is being analyzed as a potentially valuable addition to conventional endoscopy as a means of in vivo optical biopsy enabling realtime histological examination of the superficial layer of the GI tract. How this will affect the practice of screening, surveillance, and early diagnosis of benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions of the GI tract requires further study. iii. Currently available devices for confocal endomicroscopy have a very narrow field of view and allow only visualization of the superficial mucosal layer of the GI tract. Further technological developments are needed to enlarge the field of view, which will facilitate the use of confocal endomicroscopy for cancer screening and surv eillance. iv. Increased depth of penetration is also needed to assess depth of invasion during cancer staging. v. Confocal endomicroscopy is an examiner -dependent technology. Interobserver and intraobserver variability of this technique has not been adequately st udied. vi. Finally, adequate histopathology training is needed for interpretation of confocal endomicroscopy images by gastroenterologists performing this procedure. vii. The incremental clinical benefit and cost -effectiveness of this imaging modality relative to c onventional histopathology examination require further study. 2) Recommendation: Excluded File a.

All other studies either case series or RCTs of various dosages v. \"Although many of the studies were small, overwhelming evidence supports the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the botulinum toxins, specifically serotype A, for the management of these conditions. Before this is accepted as a widespread treatment modality, good -quality evidence from large -scale randomised controlled trials is needed. These studies should identify not only the most appropriate patients to treat but also the best dose, administration technique, and frequency for treatment. \" a. Giannantoni 2008, review of botulinum use for neurogenic detrusor overactivity a. Several studies show promising results in terms of both clinical and urodynamic improvements, supporting the efficacy, safety and tolerability of botulinum toxin serotype A (BoNT -A) for managing neurogenic detrusor overactivity (DO). DO due to spinal cord injuries represents the most frequently treated dysfunction, where the efficacy appears to be high, with beneficial effect s on quality of life. b. Data on the management of DO in patients with multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents and Parkinson's disease are scarce or absent; thus, the suitability of BoNT -A in the treatment neurogenic DO of other diseases of central ner vous origin requires further investigation. c. Good quality, randomized controlled trials are still needed to identify not only the most appropriate patients to treat, but also the appropriate dose, administration technique, frequency of treatment and any ev entual long - term complications. Thus, the use of intravesical BoNT -A in the control of neurogenic DO appears to be promising, but the drug is still in phase 3 clinical development, and further high -quality research is essential. b. Schmid 2008, review of botulinum use for idiopathic detrusor overactivity a. Clinical studies with different dosages and injection protocols show success rates of 60 -96% for neurogenic and nonneurogenic detrusor overactivity, with wide variations in the duration of response. The drug i s still under development for the indication of idiopathic detrusor overactivity, and is under ongoing investigation for long -term efficacy and safety. 4) Other policies a.

MED 2012 Botulinum Toxin A Treatment for Chronic Headache and Chronic Migraine i. 4 systemat ic reviews and 2 Hayes reports identified ii. Overall, the evidence for the effectiveness of BTX -A on chronic migraine is inconsistent, with the studies that do show a benefit finding the improvement small and potentially clinically insignificant. iii. All reviews reached essentially the same conclusions, which is that BTX - A is ineffective for treatment of chronic migraine . iv. The overall quality of the body of evidence for chronic migraine is high, including multiple RCTs of moderate to good quality. However, most 2013 CPT Code Issues 9 trials (nine) were sponsored by the manufacturer and thus have the potential for funding bias. b. NICE 2012: botulinum for chronic migraine prevention i. Botulinum toxin type A is recommended as an option for the prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine (defined as headaches on at least 15 days per month of which at least 8 days are with migraine): that has not responded to at least three prior pharmacological prophylaxis therapies and whose condition is appropriately managed for medication overuse. ii. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A that is recommended according to the above should be stopped in people whose condition: is not adequately responding to treatment (defined as less than a 30% reduction in headache days per month after two treatment cy cles) or has changed to episodic migraine (defined as fewer than 15 headache days per month) for three consecutive months. 5) Other policies a.

Recommendation is that women with symptoms suggestive of possible ovarian cancer be given the following test options: pelvic examination, serum CA125 or pelvic ultrasound either individually or in combination ii. Reviewed additional tumor markers, incl uding CEA, CDX2, CA 72- 4, CA 19-9, AFP, beta -hCG and HE4. iii. Review of HE4 1. There was consistent evidence, from five studies comparing HE4 and serum CA125 in women with pelvic masses, that HE4 is more sensitive and specific than serum CA125 for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer (Abdel -Azeez et al., 2010; Huhtinen et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2008; Nolen et al., 2010; Shah et al., 2009). These five studies included a total of 434 women with ovarian cancer and 583 with benign disease. Summary ROC curves suggested pe ak sensitivity/specificity of 77% for serum CA125 compared with 83% for HE4. From these figures, for every 1,000 women referred for diagnosis of a pelvic tumour, using HE4 instead of serum CA125 would identify an additional seven patients with cancer with 81 fewer false positives (assuming a 10% prevalence of undiagnosed ovarian cancer in this population (Myers et al. , 2006)). 2. Five studies looked at the combination of HE4 and serum CA125 (Abdel -Azeez et al., 2010; Huhtinen et al., Moore et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2009; Nolen et al., 2010). The evidence suggests that the combination of HE4 and serum CA125 is more specific, but less sensitive than either marker in isolation. iv. Review of multiple tumor marker panels 1. Three of the studies (Nolen et al., 2010; Moore et al. , 2008; Abel - Azeez et al., 2010) investigated panels combining three or more serum tumour markers. There was no evidence to suggest that multiple tumour markers were much better than the two marker combination of serum CA125 and HE4. 2013 CPT Code Issues 11 i. Conclus ions 2. At this time, there is ample evidence supporting the clinical utility of serum CA125 in diagnosing ovarian cancer. The GDG acknowledged that the methodological quality of the evidence was low, with most studies being case series and not designed as prospective diagnostic or prognostic studies. The GDG noted that although the preliminary data on HE4 showed it to have a relatively high sensitivity and specificity, it was not in routine clinical use and studies about its diagnostic performance had only recently been published. The GDG therefore did not feel the data on HE4 was substantial enough to enable it to be recommended instead of serum CA125 - the only serum tumour marker with widely accepted clinical utility in women with ovarian cancer. They there fore recommended the routine use of serum CA125. b. Moore 2011 i. Lead author receives direct funding from Abbott Diagnostics c. Bandiera 2011 i. prospective cohort study to determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of HE4 and ROMA ii. N=419 iii. For the discrimination of benign masses from EOC, in premenopausal women, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.3% and 59.4% for CA125, 84.6% and 94.2% for 84.6% and 81.2% for ROMA, whereas in postmenopausal women, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.3% and 82.3% for CA125, 78.2% and 99.0% for HE4, and 93.1% and 84.4% for ROMA. In patients with EOC, elevated CA125, HE4, and ROMA levels were associated with advanced Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage, suboptimally debulking, ascites, positive cytology, lymph node involvement, and advanced age (all P < 0.05). Elevated HE4 and ROMA (both P < 0.01), but not CA125 (P = 0.0579), were associated with undifferentiated tumors. In multivariable analysis, elevated HE4 and ROMA (all P<0.05) were independent prognostic factors for shorter overall, disease- free, and progression- free survival. iv. Conclusions and Impact: This study underlines the high specificity of HE4 in discriminating endometriosis and ovarian benign cysts from EOC and the high sensitivity of C A125 in detecting EOC. We showed HE4 and ROMA as independent prognostic factors. Multicenter studies are needed to draw firm conclusions about the applicability of HE4 and ROMA in clinical practice. 2013 CPT Code Issues 12 v.

The subjective assessment and RMI both had significantly higher AUCs than the ROMA (0.893, 95% CI:0.857-0.922; P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0030, respectively). The pre - and postmenopausal populations generated similar results. iv. Conclusion: Although new tumour markers models are promising, they do not contribute significantly to the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Ultrasound, especially subjective assessment by ultrasound, remains superior in discriminating malignant from benign ovarian masses. 5) Other policies a. Aetna 2012 i.

These air-filled spaces compress the healthy parts of the lungs , blocking airflow in normal breathing. The aim of lung volume reduction surgery is to help shrink the diseased parts of the lung so that as much air as possible can enter into the healthy parts . The procedure is carried out using a small flexible camera which is inserted down the wind pipe. A thin, hollow tube, called a catheter, is used to place small, one-way valves in to the airways. Usually, 3 or 4 valves are inserted. Introduction The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE ) has prepared this overview to help members of the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee (IPAC) make recommendations about the safety and efficacy of an interventional procedure. It is based on a rapid review of the medical literature and specialist opinion. It should not be regarded as a definitive assessment of the procedure.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects millions of people and has limited treatment options. Surgical treatments for severe COPD with emphysema are effe ctive for highly selected patients. A minimally invasive method for treating emphysema could decrease morbidity and increase acceptance by patients. OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and effectiveness of the IBV(R) Valve for the treatment of severe emphysema. Methods: A multicenter study treated 91 patients with severe obstruction, hyperinflation and upper lobe (UL)-predominant emphysema with 609 bronchial valves placed bilaterally into ULs. RESULTS: Valves were placed in desired airways with 99.7% technical success and no migration or erosion. There were no procedure- related deaths and 30 -day morbidity and mortality were 5.5 and 1.1%, respectively. Pneumothorax was the most frequent serious device-related complication and primarily occurred when all segments of a lobe, especially the left UL, were occluded. Highly significant health -related quality of life (HRQL) improvement ( -8.2 +/ - 16.2, mean +/- SD change at 6 months) was observed. HRQL improvement was associated with a decreased volume (mean -294 +/- 427 ml, p = 0.007) in the treated lobes without visible atelectasis. FEV(1), exercise tests, and total lung volume were not changed but there was a proportional shift, a redirection of inspired volume to the untreated lobes. Combined with perfusion scan changes, this suggests that there is improved ventilation and perfusion matching in non- UL lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION: Bronchial valve treatment of emphysema has multiple mechanisms of action and acceptable safety, and significantly improves quality of life f or the majority of patients. Copyright 2009 S.

It includes the use of more complex diagnostic procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound,interventions for the relief of central airway obstruction due to malignancy and the recent development of endobronchial therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease and asthma. The guideline aims to help all those who undertake flexible bronchoscopy to understand more about this important area. It also aims to informrespiratory physicians and other specialists dealing withlung cancer of the procedures possible in the management and palliation of central airway obstruction. The guideline covers transbronchial needle aspiration andendobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, electrocautery/diathermy, emphysema andbronchial thermoplasty for asthma. This guideline is based on the best available evidence. The methodology used to write the guideline adheres strictly to the criteria as set by the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evalua-tion (AGREE) collaboration http://www.agree- collaboration.org/1/agreeguide/. Three hundred and eighty-seven papers were critically appraised usingthe Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists. A web-based guideline development tool (http://www.bronchoscopy-guideline.org/) enabled each pair ofreviewers to collaborate online. The reliability of the evidence in each individual study was graded using the SIGN critical appraisal checklist. Thebody of evidence for each recommendation was summarised into evidence tables, formulated into evidence statements and graded using the SIGNgrading system into recommendations. DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is a safe and simple procedure mainly used to sample hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes incases of suspected malignant involvement orsarcoidosis (Evidence level 2++). It should be used at the time of initial bronchoscopy to sample lymphadenopathy noted on CT scanning. (EBUS TBNA) has high sensitivity and speci city for identifying malignancy in medias- tinal and hilar lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer (Evidence level 2++), and also has a highsensitivity for identifying malignancy when used for sampling paratracheal and peribronchial paren- chymal lung masses (Evidence level 3). In caseswhere EBUS-TBNA results are negative for malig- nancy, a con rmatory surgical biopsy should be performed. EBUS-TBNA also has high sensitivity for identifying non-caseating granulomas in hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes in cases of suspected sarcoidosis (Evidence level 2++). THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES Debulking techniques There are a number of effective debulking tech- niques for the removal of endobronchial tumour; the treatment of choice will depend largely on costand availability. Rigid bronchoscopy techniqueshave advantages in terms of airway control, the ability to easily remove a large volume of tumour, to dilate the airway and to deploy silicone stents. Inthe UK there are, however, relatively few experi- enced practitioners in rigid bronchoscopy outside surgical units. This guideline therefore covers theuse of interventional techniques which utilise the more widely available flexible bronchoscopy. In patients with intrinsic central airway obstruc- tion, with or without critical airway narrowing, immediate debulking using endobronchial diathermy, argon plasma coagulation, cryoextraction and thermal laser may all be considered (Evidencelevel 3). Brachytherapy, conventional cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) may also be considered for debulking if there is time for theirdelayed effect to take place. These techniques are not generally useful for extrinsic compression. Endo- bronchial diathermy, argon plasma coagulation andcryoextraction are all relatively safe, simple and are much cheaper than laser, brachytherapy and PDT .1Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK 2NorthWest Lung Centre, University Hospital of South Manchester, UK 3Royal Free Hospital, London, UK 4Worcester Royal Hospital, Worcester, UK 5Lane Fox Unit, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK 6Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Preston, UK 7Department of Thoracic Oncology, Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK 8Department of Respiratory Medicine at Royal Brompton Hospital, London, Chelsea andWestminster Hospital, andImperial College, London, UK 9Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, UK Correspondence toDr Ingrid A Du Rand, The BritishThoracic Society, 17 DoughtyStreet, London WC1N 2PL, UK;ingrid.durand@nhs.net Received 5 1014 Thorax 2011; 66:1014e1015. doi:10.1136/thoraxjnl-2011-201052Chest clinic group.bmj.com on October 17, 2012 - Published by thorax.bmj.com Downloaded from These techniques are effective in alleviating symptoms of breathlessness and haemoptysis in patients with endobronchial malignancy (see table 1). Treatment of early lung cancer Many of these debulking techniques, including endobronchial diathermy, cryoextraction, brachytherapy and PDT , may also beused for the treatment of early central lung cancer with curative intent and for treating localised endobronchial disease in patients un t for surgery or other radical therapy. Stents Following tumour debulking, self-expanding metal stents caneffectively maintain airway patency and are also effective in the treatment of extrinsic compression (Evidence level 3). Non- removable stents should be used with caution, if at all, innon-malignant disease due to the potential for stent fracture andother long-term complications. EMERGING APPLICATIONS FOR FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY There are a number of recent diagnostic and therapeutic appli-cations using the flexible bronchoscope which have not yet established a clear place in routine practice. These include electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, treatment of emphysema by lung volume reduction using valves andbronchial thermoplasty for asthma. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy The use of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy to locatetumour not visible under direct vision using three-dimensional data from a CTscan has been shown to yield a diagnostic rate of between 59% and 80%, with greater accuracy for lesions>40 mm in diameter. It is a safe, effective but currently expensive modality for sampling peripheral lesions, and studiesusing virtual bronchoscopy alone have similar diagnostic rates. Endobronchial valves Endobronchial valves may be used in the treatment of emphy-sema with severe hyperin flation, in an attempt to reduce lung volume. The valves are inserted into the target area via flexible bronchoscopy under conscious sedation or general anaesthesia.In patients with severe emphysema and hyperin flation theyhave been shown to produce small improvements in lungfunction (Evidence level 2 /C0). Suf cient ef cacy has not yet been demonstrated to recommend their routine use. Bronchial thermoplasty for asthma Airway smooth muscle may also have a role in the pathogenesis of asthma by secreting proin flammatory cytokines remodelling. The goal of bronchial thermo- plasty is to reduce airway smooth muscle by the application of radiofrequency-generated heat at 65 8C. Although there is a high level of evidence for the effectiveness of this technique in reducing symptoms, adverse events and frequency of exacerba- tions (Evidence level 1), its place in the treatment of asthma remains to be established and we recommend that treatmentshould be limited to a few specialist centres in carefully selectedpatients.

Thomson, Stephen Bicknell, and Rekha Chaudhuri Purpose of review Bronchial thermoplasty, which involves the delivery of radio frequency energy to the airways to reduce airway smooth muscle mass, has been recently introduced for the treatment of severe asthma. This review summarizes the preclinical development, efficacy and adverse effects of bronchial thermoplasty. In addition, the potential mechanisms of action and place in management of severe asthma are discussed. Recent findings The efficacy and adverse profile of bronchial thermoplasty has been assessed in three randomized controlled trials, the first two of which showed clinical benefits of bronchial thermoplasty compared with usual care in patients with moderate or severe asthma. The third trial reports the results of a comparison with sham bronchial thermoplasty in 288 adults with severe asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty improved asthma quality of life questionnaire scores compared with sham bronchial thermoplasty; in the posttreatment period, there were fewer severe exacerbations and emergency department visits. Bronchial thermoplasty causes short-term increases in asthma-related morbidity. Follow-up data to date support the long-term safety of the procedure. Summary Bronchial thermoplasty has a role in the management of patients with severe asthma who have uncontrolled symptoms despite current therapies. Future studies need to identify factors that predict a beneficial clinical response. Keywords asthma quality of life, bronchial thermoplasty, severe asthma INTRODUCTION The majority of adults with asthma have mild or moderate disease that can be controlled by inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with inhaled long-acting b2agonist (LABA) bronchodilators [1-3]. Five to 10% of patients have more severe asthma and often, despite maximal drug treatment, these individuals experience considerable morbidity and generate high healthcare costs [4]. There is an unmet need for new improved therapies for patients with severe asthma [5&]. Bronchial thermoplasty, which involves the delivery of radio frequency energy to the airways to reduce airway smooth muscle mass, has been recently introduced for the treatment of severe persistent asthma. The review summarizes the preclinical development, efficacy and adverse effects of bronchial thermoplasty. In addition, the potential mechanisms of action and place in the management of severe asthma are discussed. PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT In experimental animals, bronchial thermoplasty has been shown to reduce airway smooth musclemass [6], increase airway size [7,8] and decrease airway responsiveness to methacholine [6-8]. In a canine model, Danek et al. [6] examined the effects of bronchial thermoplasty on airway to methacholine and airway wall histology. Bronchial thermoplasty treatments, to airways more than 3 mm in diameter, controlled to 65 8C and 75, but not 55 8C, reduced airway responsiveness to local methacholine challenge for at least 3 years posttreatment (Fig. 1a). Airway smooth muscle mass was reduced at 12 weeks (Fig. 1b) and by 3 years, the airway smooth muscle was partially replaced by a thin layer of mature collagen. The histology of the lung parenchyma, epithelium and mucous glands in the airway was not altered by bronchial Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow & Respiratory Medicine, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, UK Correspondence to Professor Neil C. Thomson, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow & Respiratory Medi- cine, Gartnavel General Hospital, Policy Aetna considers bronchial thermoplasty experimental and investigational for the treatment of asthma and other indications (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) because its effec tiveness has not been established. See also CPB 670 - Xolair (Omalizumab) . Background Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States, and its prevalence has been increasing since 1980. In 2000, asthma was responsible for 4,487 deaths, about 0.5 million hospitalizations, 1.8 million visits to the emergency room, and 10.4 million visits to the physician office among individuals of all ages. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects data each year from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 3 United States territories to provide prevalence data for state and local health department asthma programs. Findings from BRFSS indicated that approximately 7.2 % of adults in the United States have current asthma (CDC, 2003). According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's (2002) global strategy for asthma management and prevention, the preferred therapy for patients with moderate persistent asthma is regular treatment with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and a long -acting inhaled beta 2- agonist twice - daily. For patients with severe persistent asthma, the primary therapy includes inhaled corticosteroid at hig her doses plus a long -acting inhaled beta 2 -agonist twice -daily. Bronchial thermoplasty is a bronchoscopic procedure that employs radiofrequency ablation to reduce the mass of airway smooth muscle (ASM), thus attenuating bronchoconstriction. It is being s tudied as a minimally invasive method to improve asthma control. Bronchial thermoplasty is performed on an out -patient basis with conscious sedation (i.e., no general anesthesia is needed), and it usually takes approximately one hour to complete. There a re two assumptions that underlie the development of this procedure: (i) ASM is a vestigial tissue; and (ii) treatment directed at ASM alone will provide sustained symptomatic and physiological improvement in patients with asthma.

General Background Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Clinical studies have shown that asthma can be effectively controlled by intervening to suppress and reverse inflammation as well as treating the bronchoconstriction and related symptoms (G lobal Initiative for Asthma [GINA], 2010). The goal of the treatment of asthma is to achieve and maintain clinical control by eliminating symptoms during both the day and night, to normalize measures of lung function, and to reduce the risk of future exacerbations ( California Technology Assessment Forum [ CTAF ], 2011; GINA, 2010). Asthma control can be reached in the majority of individuals with a pharmacologic intervention strategy developed in partnership between the patient/family and the doctor , involving assignment to a continuously evolving treatment plan based on current level of control (GINA, 2010). Depending on level of control, s tandard treatment options may include stimulus avoidance and an as -needed reliever medication (e.g., rapid -acting short - or long acting inhaled beta 2 [B2] agonist), reliever treatment with regular controller treatment (e.g., inhaled glucocorticosteroid, leukotriene modifier, theophylline, cromones) , oral Newer Non-intracranial Malignancies Evidence & Policy Summary Octo ber 2011 Center for Evidence -based Policy Medicaid Evidence -based Decisions Project (MED ) Oregon Health & Science University 3455 SW US Veterans Hospital Road Medicaid Evidence -based Decisions Project (MED) 1 Executive Summary Background Approximately half of all cancer patients receive some form of radiation therapy. Radiation utilizes high energy particles or waves to destroy or damage cancer cells. Patients may receive radiation therapy alone or in combination with other treatments. Radiation can cause acute and chronic side effects that depend on the area of the body radiated and dose of radiation given. There are three main modalities for delivering radiation : 1) externally by a machine (external beam radiation therapy, EBRT), 2) internally via radioactive material place d in the body (brachytherapy), or 3) systemically through the use of radiopharmaceuticals that are swallowed or injec ted into the blood stream . Current conventional or standard EBRT uses three -dimensional tomography (PET), and/ or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for planning purposes and delivers p hoton beams of uniform intensity to the target tumor using a medical linear accelerator (linac). Conformal refers to the ability to precisely conform the delivery of the EBRT to the shape and size of the tumor, so current conventional EBRT is often referre d to as 3D conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT). Over the past ten years , significant advances have been made in the techniques available to deliver EBRT. The goal of these newer techniques is two -fold: to improve the targeting of the radiation to the tumor to minimize damage of normal tissue and increase the dose of radiation (fraction) delivered to improve outcomes and decrease the number of fractions and length of treatmen t. The use of two newer techniques, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), has increased dramatic ally over the past decade . Health care spending on these newer technologies is rising alongside their adoption, with the newer technologies being generally more expensive than existing one s. Between 2002 and 2008, for example, Medicare spending on IMRT grew from less than $50 million to over $800 million. Moreover, comparative trials including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were not required for clearance of the devices that deliver th ese newer techniques for radiation therapy. For moderate risk new devices, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clears the device for sale under their 510(k) process that only requires a manufacturer to demonstrate that the new devices is substantially e quivalent to a prior device(s) that has already been cleared for sale by the FDA. Because of the rapid diffusion of the technologies, their costs, and the uncertainty of their effectiveness and safety, we reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness, safety , and cost of SBRT and IMRT compared to conventional EBRT (i.e. , 3DCRT) . The following key questions are addressed in this report. Key Questions 1. Does Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) or Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) improve patient outcomes compared to conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)? REPORT ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGY Confocal laser endomicroscopy The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) T echnology Committee provides reviews of new or emerging endoscopic technologies that have the potentialto have an impact on the practice of GI endoscopy.Evidence-based methodology is used, with a MEDLINE liter-ature search to identify pertinent preclinical and clinicalstudies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Ad- ministration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications ofa given technology. Both are supplemented by accessingthe ''related articles'' feature of PubMed and by scrutinizingpertinent references cited by the identied studies. Con-trolled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases,data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. Insuch cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. T echnical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietarypublications, and informal communications with perti-nent vendors. For this review, the MEDLINE database wassearched through January 2009 using the keywords''confocal,'' ''confocal endoscopy,'' and ''confocal laserendomicroscopy.'' Reports on Emerging T echnologies are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE T echnology Committee, reviewedand edited by the committee as a whole, and approvedby the Governing Board of the ASGE. These reports arescientic reviews provided solely for educational and in-formational purposes. Reports on Emerging T echnologiesare not rules and should not be construed as establishinga legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating,requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment or payment for such treatment. EMERGING TECHNOLOGY Confocal laser endomicroscopy is a new endoscopic modality developed to obtain very high-resolution imagesof the mucosal layer of the GI tract. Confocal laser endomi- croscopy is based on tissue illumination with a low-powerlaser with subsequent detection of the fluorescence lightreflected from the tissue through a pinhole ( Fig. 1 ). 1Theterm confocal refers to the alignment of both illumination and collection systems in the same focal plane.2,3The laser light is focused at a selected depth in the tissue of interestand reflected light is then refocused onto the detection sys-tem by the same lens. Only returning light refocusedthrough the pinhole is detected. The light reflected andscattered at other geometric angles from the illuminated object or refocused out of plane with the pinhole is excluded from detection. This dramatically increases thespatial resolution of confocal endomicroscopy, thus provid-ing an ''optical biopsy'' dhistological examination supercial layer of the GI tract. 4,5 Confocal imaging can be based on tissue reflectance or tissue fluorescence.6,7The confocal devices based on tissue reflectance do not require any contrast agents, but available prototypes have had numerous technical problems and relatively low resolution, which signicantlycompromise in vivo imaging and clinical utility. 6-9 In contrast, confocal endomicroscopy based on tissue fluorescence uses local and/or intravenous contrast agentsand generates high-quality images comparable with tradi-tional histological examination. 5,10Most clinical studies re- ported to date used a confocal fluorescence microscope integrated into the distal tip of a conventional upper en- doscope (EG-3870CIK; Pentax, Japan) or colono-scope lasermicroscope (Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) in-serted through the accessory channel of a traditionalendoscope. These instruments have been cleared by theU.S. Food and Drug Administration, and all have different depths of imaging, eld of views, and lateral resolutions. The latest model of Cellvizio confocal miniprobes (Mauna Kea use during ERCP require an endoscopeaccessory channel of at least 1.2 mm, whereas the otherprobes, which are designed for use in EGD and colono- scopy, require a channel larger than 2.8 mm. All probes generate dynamic (12 frames per second) images. Thedepth of imaging for CholangioFlex probes is 40 to70mm, 70 to 130 mm for GastroFlex (ColoFlex), and 55 to 65 mm for GastroFlex UHD(ColoFlexUHD).

Zacurb Purpose of review The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) around the world has increased over the past 20 years due to the emergence of hypervirulent strains, increased use and misuse of antibiotics, and the increase of susceptible at-risk populations. Treatments currently available for CDI are inadequate to impede the increasing spread and virulence of the infection, avoid recurrence in chronic patients or prevent infection in at-risk populations. Recent findings New and promising evidence has been presented during the past year, focusing on two major points: preservation of gut microflora and optimization of immune response to CDI and toxins. Summary The review aims to summarize the most recent evidence available on the epidemiology, risk factors and treatment of CDI. New antibiotics with selected action on C. difficile and limited effect on microflora (fidaxomicin) and donor fecal transplantation seem to have a relevant efficacy in treating CDI and reducing its recurrence. The use of selected monoclonal antibodies directed against C. difficile toxins in addition to standard therapy is a new, promising approach for the treatment of recurrent cases. Vaccination could be an additional weapon against CDI. New robust data are needed before recommendations can be made to abandon current treatment based on vancomycin and metronidazole and move toward new frontiers. Keywords antibiotics, Clostridium difficile infection, diarrhea INTRODUCTION Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea is the leading cause of diarrhea in the healthcare setting. It is also fast becoming a common cause of diarrhea in the community. Any medication or process that dis- rupts the normal bowel flora or bowel motility can predispose patients to a C. difficile infection (CDI). A higher morbidity and mortality has been described in recent years. It has been reported that 3% of healthy adults are asymptomatic carriers [1]. Symptomatic patients can present with a broad spectrum of disease severity ranging from a mild, watery, self-limiting diarrhea to life-threatening ful- minant pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megaco- lon, bowel perforation, septic shock, and death. Recurrence of symptoms, as a consequence of relapse of the original infection or reinfection, is one of the greatest challenges of CDI [2,3], occurring in 5-47% of cases [4&&,5&,6&,7]. More recently, a large European hospital-based survey reported a recur- rence rate of 18% [8&&], and another study reportedthat patients with at least one recurrence of CDI had a risk of subsequent recurrence of 45% [9&,10]. The cause of recurrent CDI is not well under- stood. Factors implicated in the development of recurrent CDI are disturbance of the normal bowel flora, decreased resistance to colonization through antibiotic usage, and defective immune response to C. difficile and/or its toxins [3,11,12].

While rarely life-threatening, incontinence may seriously influencethe physical, psychological and social wellbeing of affected individuals. The impact on the familiesand carers of women with UI may be profound, and the resource implications for the health serviceconsiderable. The International Continence Society (ICS) has standardised terminology in lower urinary tract function: UI is 'the complaint of any involuntary urinary leakage'. 1This may occur as a result of a number of abnormalities of function of the lower urinary tract, or as a result of otherillnesses, and these tend to cause leakage in different situations. Denitions for stress, mixed andurge UI and overactive bladder (OAB) are given in the glossary. Other types of UI may be describedby the situations that provoke urine loss, for example during sexual intercourse, or on laughing orgiggling. Some patients may simply report being 'wet all the time'. This may be a reflection of theseverity of their condition, although may on occasions be due to other pathologies, for examplestula. There are currently approximately 80 cases of stula between the urinary tract and genitaltract treated each year in England and Wales and this condition is not considered further in thisguideline. It is recognised that UI may be of a transient nature on occasion, reflecting acute healthor environmental factors. Prevalence and incidence Urinary incontinence is an embarrassing problem to many women and thus its presence may be signicantly underreported. In a UK community study, the prevalence of UI known to the healthand social service agencies was 0.2% in women aged 15-64 years and 2.5% in those aged 65 andover. 2A concurrent postal survey showed a prevalence of 8.5% in women aged 15-64 and 11.6% in those aged 65 and over. Incontinence was described as 'moderate' or 'severe' in one-fth ofthose who reported it and, even among these, fewer than one-third were receiving health or socialservices for the condition. 2 The Leicestershire MRC Incontinence Study, of individuals over 40 years of age, found that 33.6%of the population reported signicant urinary symptoms but only 6.2% found these bothersome,and only 2.4% both bothersome and socially disabling. Of the population surveyed, 3.8% (one innine of those with clinically signicant symptoms) felt the need for help with their symptoms. 3,4 Some women may not see their UI as a major problem. For others, who do perceive a problem with which they would like help, there are often barriers to presentation. Women may take upto 10 years before seeking help. 5They may be too embarrassed to seek advice, may not wish to bother their general practitioner (GP), may believe UI to be a normal consequence of the ageingprocess or may not appreciate that treatments are available. 6 Differences in study populations, the denition and measurement of UI, and the survey methodused result in a wide range of prevalence estimates. 7Where the most inclusive denitions have been used ('ever', 'any', 'at least once in the last 12 months'), prevalence estimates in the generalpopulation range from 5% to 69% in women 15 years and older, with most studies in the range25-45%. 7There appears to be less variation in the prevalence of more severe UI and estimates in the general population range between 4% and 7% in women under 65 years, and between4% and 17% in those over 65 for daily UI. 7The Leicestershire MRC Incontinence Study found that, while 34.2% of women reported UI at times, only 3.5% experienced the symptom on a dailybasis, 11.8% weekly, 7.3% monthly and 11.6% yearly. 8 1Review Botulinum Toxin Injections for Neurogenic and Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity: A Critical Analysis of Results Anand K.

Early studies showed promising results in an areawhere few options previously existed between pharmacotherapy andsurgery. This has led to an urgent need to assess the wide range oftechniques and therapies available, as well as the efficacy and toler-ability of the treatment. We performed a critical analysis of the numer- ous clinical studies for this novel treatment option in the management of neurogenic and idiopathic detrusor overactivity, with a view to directingfurther research and assisting urologists in the management of theseconditions.Methods: A systematic review of the literature, as well as a search for abstracts presented to relevant peer-reviewed meetings, was performed.All articles from 1988 onwards were included, prior to which no articlesdescribing urologic use of botulinum neurotoxins had been published,although the majority of the articles have been published since 2000.Results and Conclusions: Although many of the studies were small, over- whelming evidence supports the efcacy, safety, and tolerability of the botulinum toxins, specically serotype A, for the management of these conditions. Before this is accepted as a widespread treatment modality,good-quality evidence from large-scale randomised controlled trials isneeded. These studies should identify not only the most appropriatepatients to treat but also the best dose, administration technique, andfrequency for treatment. #2006 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology. * Corresponding author.

Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents and Parkinson's disease are scarce or absent; thus, the suitability of BoNT-A in the treatment neurogenic DO of other diseases of central nervous origin requires further investigation. Indeed, good quality, randomized controlled trials are still needed to identify not only the most appropriate patients to treat, but also the appropriate dose, administration technique, frequency of treatment and any eventual long-term complications. Thus, the use of intravesical BoNT-A in the control of neurogenic DO appears to be promising, but the drug is still in phase 3 clinical development, and further high-quality research is essential. KEYWORDS botulinum A toxin, detrusor overactivity, neurogenic diseaseSeveral studies show promising results in terms of both clinical and urodynamic improvements, supporting the efcacy, safety and tolerability of botulinum toxin serotype A (BoNT-A) for managing neurogenic detrusor overactivity (DO). DO due to spinal cord injuries represents the most frequently treated dysfunction, where the efcacy appears to be high, with benecial effects on quality of life. Data on the management of DO in patients with THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF MICTURITION The goal of treating detrusor overactivity (DO) is to reduce the reflex irritability of the overactive bladder (OAB), thereby prolonging the time between voids [1]. Many patients with neurogenic DO can be treated effectively with oral anticholinergic drugs, which act as competitive inhibitors of acetylcholine, blocking its muscarinic effects. However, they often have troublesome side-effects, e.g. dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, changes in visual accommodation, dizziness and somnolence, all of which reduce patient compliance. Doses insufcient to restore urinary continence are often used. Until recently, invasive surgery (mainly bladder augmentation) was the only available treatment option for patients with intractable DO. There might be other treatment options in selected groups of patients with spinal cord injury. Short-term maximum functional stimulation of the pudendal nerve afferents or implantation of a sacral root nerve stimulator might result in major benets for urge incontinence [2,3]. However, the use of sacral rhizotomy is limited in male patients with suprasacral cord lesions, in view of the consequent loss of reflex erections [4]. Auto-augmentation, enterocystoplasty and the ileal conduit are major surgical interventions that can be considered as a last alternative. Recently, new alternative drugs and/or administration techniques have been introduced to control DO and to restore urinary continence in patients affected by neurogenic voiding dysfunction. Indeed, efciency of intravesical application of vanilloid-antagonists (capsaicin and resiniferatoxin) is controversially discussed or has still to be precisely evaluated [5,6]. Normal storage of urine depends on spinal reflex mechanisms that activate sympathetic and somatic pathways to the urethral outlet and detrusor muscle, and tonic inhibitory systems in the brain that suppress the parasympathetic excitatory outflow to the urinary bladder, leading to detrusor relaxation and bladder lling [1,2]. Mechanoreceptors trigger micturition reflexes, which consist of ring of the sacral parasympathetic pathways and inhibition of sympathetic and somatic pathways. Sensory information, including the feeling of bladder fullness or pain, is conveyed to the spinal cord via afferent axons in the pelvic and hypogastric nerves [1]. Acetylcholine, which interacts with muscarinic receptors on the detrusor muscle, is the predominant peripheral neurotransmitter responsible for bladder contraction. Acetylcholine interacts with the M3 receptor, initiating a cascade of events that results in contraction of the detrusor muscle. Increasing attention has been paid to the role of sensory afferent nerves in normal voiding and in DO. The most important afferents for initiating micturition are those passing in the pelvic nerve to the sacral spinal cord. These afferents consist of small myelinated (A- ) and unmyelinated C-bres that convey impulses from tension receptors and nociceptors in the bladder wall [3]. Damage to the axonal pathways in the spinal cord leads to the emergence of primitive spinal bladder reflexes triggered by bladder afferent C-bres, which are thought to serve a defence mechanism to eliminate irritants and bacteria in the normal bladder [1-3]. Several types of receptors have been identied on afferent nerves, including vanilloid receptors, which are activated by capsaicin and possibly by endogenous anandamide; purinergic receptors (P2X), which are activated by ATP, neurokinin receptors which respond to substance P and neurokinin A; and receptors for nerve growth factor (trk-A receptors) [7,8]. Other substances, including nitric oxide, calcitonin gene-related protein, and brain-derived neurotropic factor, might also have an important role in modulating the sensory afferents in the detrusor muscle [1,8,9].

The drug is still under development for the indication of idiopathic detrusor overactivity, and is under ongoing investigation for long-term efcacy and safety. KEYWORDS botulinum neurotoxin type A, overactive bladder, urinary incontinence, urgencyIn this review we summarize the recent innovation of botulinum-A neurotoxin (BoNT-A) injections in the bladder as a potential new treatment option for idiopathic detrusor overactivity, refractory to conventional anticholinergic medication. BoNT-A is by Clostridium botulinum and consists of a 150-kDa neurotoxic protein that has the ability to cleave proteins within the nerve terminal. BoNT-A is thereby able to prevent acetylcholine release at the presynaptic INTRODUCTION The physiologist Claude Bernard, in his classic work on experimental research, wrote that poisons not only destroy life, but that they can also be used to treat the sick [1]. In patients with refractory idiopathic (non-neurogenic) detrusor overactivity (DO), there is a gap in treatment between classic anticholinergic agents and surgical treatments (e.g. bladder augmentation or sacral neuromodulation). Administration of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) directly into the bladder wall is a new treatment concept, which has been increasingly researched and applied. Several studies have now documented a signicant relief of symptoms in neurogenic and idiopathic DO [2-12]. The ICS denes the overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome as urgency with or without incontinence, usually associated with frequency and nocturia [13]. Obviously, in such cases, UTIs, metabolic diseases or malignancies such as carcinoma in situ of the bladder must be excluded. According to two large epidemiological studies, one from Europe and the other from the USA, the prevalence of OAB in the adult population is 17% [14,15]. The EPINCONT study showed an increase in the prevalence of OAB in postmenopausal women [16]. The frequency and severity of incontinence episodes, the use of incontinence devices (pads), and the inability to continue with sexual life are the main factors responsible for the compromised quality of life [17]; about two-thirds of these patients have stressed social and sexual relationships and a low self-esteem. The cost of consultations, medications, incontinence physiotherapy, surgery, incontinence devices, incontinence pads, undergarments, cleaners for carpet or furniture, catheters, and costs due to skin or UTIs was estimated to be $US 32.1 billion in the year 2000 [18]. First-line treatments of OAB include change in lifestyle, bladder training or pelvic floor rehabilitation, and local oestrogen application if there is female genital atrophy. Anticholinergics are the main medical treatment, in combination with conservative measures, or as second-line therapy. The limiting factors for the use and the success rate are the side-effects, e.g. dry mouth, constipation, headache and nausea [19-22]. If unable to tolerate the drugs, or if failing to respond, many patients had to live with their OAB, or undergo more invasive treatments, e.g. sacral neuromodulation [23] or bladder augmentation [24]. BOTULINUM NEUROTOXIN: A SHORT HISTORICAL REVIEW On 14 December 1895 in Ellezelles, Belgium, three persons died after consuming smoked ham sausages. Emile Pierre Van Ermengem, a student of Robert Koch, isolated the responsible organism and named it Bacillus botulinus [25], today known as Clostridium botulinum . The Napoleonic wars from 1795 until 1813 destroyed the European economy, leading to neglect of hygiene during the production of food. In the 19th century, food poisoning incidents became more frequent after the consumption of sausages. The government physician Justinus Kerner examined 155 cases of poisoning from sausages and published his monograph 'on the fat poison' in 1822 [26,27]. zoonotic poison, that grew in airless acidic surroundings, being lethal even in very small amounts. He could show that the poison, like rust in a conductor cable, could interrupt motor signals in peripheral somatic and autonomous nerve pathways. After experimenting on himself, he concluded that the fat poison could potentially be used for treatment purposes. In 1870, Mueller named this poisoning 'Botulismus', derived from the Latin word botulus for sausage.

Chronic migraine prevalence is estimated at 1.3% of the US population (Natoli 2010 ), and around 2.2% of the US population is estimated to suffer from CTTH over the course of a year (Hayes 2011a). Both CM and CTTH occur more often in women (Hayes 2011b; Krishnan 2009). Acute treatments 2011). Prophylactic treatment is often considered for patients who have two or more migraines with thr ee or more days of disability per month or use of acute medication more than twice per week (Modi 2006). Common prophylactic treatments for migraines include calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic drugs, lif estyle management, and alternative therapies such biofeedback and relaxation (ICSI 2011). BOTOX\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxinA , onaBTX -A) is the only botulinum toxin (BTX) approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) for the prophylactic treatment of chroni c migraine at this time. Other ommon prophylactic djunctive therapy . The FDA has not approved any formulation of BTX for the prophylactic treatment of CTTH. Cost information The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) reports that the national average cost of physician/surgeon fees for botulinum toxin A (BTX -A) (including BOTOX\u00ae, Dysport\u00ae) in 2010 was $398. According to Allergan, the manufacturer of BOTOX\u00ae, the cost/unit of BOTOX\u00ae in 2011 was $5.25, resulting in a total cost per approved dose of 155 units of $813.75 . Allergans dossier submission noted that administration cost s were estimated at $250.50 per visit based on the 2011 Medicare Physicians Fee Schedule . The combined cost per dose and administration costs resul t in a total estimated cost of $1,064.25 per treatment cycle. Key Questions 1. Does BTX -A reduce the frequency, severity, or duration of chronic headaches or migraines? 2. Does BTX -A improve qualit y of life in patients who have chronic headaches or migraines? 3. Is there a difference in efficacy among serotypes and BTX -A products? 4. How does efficacy of BTX -A compare with other standard treatments for chronic headaches or migraines? 5. What are the harms an d complications associated with BTX -A treatment? 6. What are the costs of BTX -A treatment compared to standard treatments? Methods A full search of the MED clinical evidence primary sources was done to identify systematic reviews (SR), meta -analyses (MA), tec hnology assessments (TA ), and randomized controlled trials (RCT) using the terms botulinum toxin, botox , headache, and migraine . Searches of core sources were State Policy Summary Update : Coverage of botulinum toxin t ype A for chronic headache and chronic migraine prophylaxis Special Project September 2012 Center for Evidence -based Policy Medicaid Evidence -based Decisions Project (MED) Oregon Health & Science University 3455 SW US Veterans Hospital Road Medicaid Evidence -based Decisions Project (MED) 1 Background In October 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BOTOX\u00ae (BTX -A) injection for use to prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraines ( > 15 days per month with headache lasting 4 hours per day or longer). The FDA has not approved BTX-A for prophylaxis of chronic migraines in patients under 18 years of age or for treatment of episodic migraine (14 headache days or fewer per month) (Allergan 2011). The approved dose for treating ch ronic migraine is 155 units administered intramuscularly into the muscles of the head and neck approximately every 12 weeks (Allergan 2011). The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) reports that the national average cost of physician/surg eon fees for BTX-A in 2011 was $398. According to Allergan, the manufacturer of BTX-A, the cost/unit of BTX-A in 2011 was $5.25, resulting in a total cost per approved dose (155 units) of $813.75 (Allergan 2011). In November 2011 , the Medicaid Evidence -based Decisions (MED) Project elected to pilot test a review of evidence for two new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes. The MED Project invited the Medicaid Medical Directors Learning Network (MMDLN) states to participate in this process. The group selected Botulinum Toxin Type A (J0585 Inject ion, onabotulinumtoxina, 1 unit ) as one of t he codes for review. The evaluation was to include both a review of the evidence as well as related state coverage policies . The f ollowing policy summary is an update to a separate Participant Request done in December 2012 on the same topic . Evidence Summary In February 2012, MED staff produced the evidence report Botulinum Toxin A Treatment for Chronic Headache and Chronic Migraine , which addresses the use of BTX-A for chronic headache and chronic migraine (Little 2012) . Overall, the evidence for the effectiveness of BTX - A on chronic migraine was inconsistent, with the studies that do show a benefit finding the improvement small and potentially clinically insignificant. Overall, seven studies found no beneficial effects of BTX -A compared with placebo in the treatment of chronic headache , while two small studies found a beneficial effect of BTX -A relative to placebo on headache frequency, intensity and/or duration. While BTX -A appears to be relativel y safe for the treatment of both chronic migraine and chronic headache , with few serious adverse events, side effects in general are frequent occur in one to two -thirds of all patients.

Methods: Preoperative serum samples of 419 women (140 healthy controls, 131 ovarian benign cysts, 34 endometriosis, and 114 EOC) were tested for CA125 and HE4 using fully automated methods (Abbott ARCHITECT) and validated cutoff values. Results: For the discrimination of benign masses from EOC, in premenopausal women, the sensitivity and specicity were 92.3% and 84.6% and 81.2% for ROMA, whereas in postmenopausal women, the sensitivity and specicity were 94.3% and HE4, and 93.1% and 84.4% for ROMA. In patients with EOC, elevated CA125, HE4, and ROMA levelswere associated with advanced Federation and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage, suboptimallydebulking, ascites, positive cytology, lymph node involvement, and advanced age (all P/C200.05). Elevated HE4 and ROMA (both P/C200.01), but not CA125 ( P\u00bc0.0579), were associated with undifferentiated tumors. In multivariable analysis, elevated HE4 and ROMA (all P/C200.05) were independent prognostic factors for shorter overall, disease-free, and progression-free survival. Conclusions and Impact: This study underlines the high specicity of HE4 in discriminating endometriosis and ovarian benign cysts from EOC and the high sensitivity of CA125 in detecting EOC. We showed HE4and ROMA as independent prognostic factors. Multicenter studies are needed to draw rm conclusions aboutthe applicability of HE4 and ROMA in Biomarkers Prev; 20(12); 2496-506. /C2112011 AACR. Introduction Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most frequent cause of death from gynecologic cancer. It has the highest fatality-to-case ratio of all gynecologic malignancies,being characterized by early widespread metastasis andhigh-grade malignancy at diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate is about 80% to 90% for patients with stage I disease and only 30% for patients with stage III or IV. Althoughsurvival has improved with the use of maximal cytore-ductive surgery along with platinum- and taxol-based chemotherapy, nearly 80% of ovarian cancers relapse and patients inevitably succumb to the development of che-motherapy-resistant disease (1). At the moment, serum CA125 is the commonly used biomarker for EOC diagnosis. Jacobs and colleagues (2)developed the widely used Risk of Malignancy Index(RMI), an algorithm that uses ultrasound ndings, archi- tectural features of pelvic mass, CA125 levels, and men- opausal status to stratify patients into high- and low-riskgroups. However, as CA125 is associated with a high false-positive rate among benign gynecologic conditions, such as endometriosis that affects mainly women in pre-menopause, its use for EOC detection is almost exclusive- ly reserved for postmenopausal cases (3-6). Furthermore, CA125 has low sensitivity in identifying patients withearly EOC disease, being increased in only 50% of patients with stage I (7). CA125 is also used to monitor response to therapy and in early detection of ovarian cancer recur-rence after treatment (8-11), but the value of preoperativeAuthors' Af liations:1\"Angelo Nocivelli\" Institute of Molecular Medicine, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Departments of2Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology and3Obstetrics and Gynecology, Brescia; 4Department of Laboratory Medicine, A.O.

P. Liu peter.liu@utoronto.c aEarly detection of myocardial dysfunction and heart failure Geoffrey de Couto, Maral Ouzounian and Peter P. Liu Abstract | The impact of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure is continuing to escalate in the developed world. Treatment of this heterogeneous condition has focused on the symptomatic stage, often after irreversible remodeling and functional impairment have occurred. Early identification of cardiac dysfunction would allow implementation of early intervention strategies to delay the progression or to prevent the onset of heart failure altogether. Although screening methods for asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction have yet to be optimized, a staged approach for patients with predisposing risk factors using serological biomarkers followed by noninvasive imaging techniques may be useful. Existing biomarkers for cardiac dysfunction include Btype natriuretic peptide, troponins, and Creactive protein. Novel markers such as protein ST2, galectin3, and various prohormones are emerging and may provide prognostic information that is incremental to conventional clinical evaluation. Monitoring myocardial mechanics and molecular processes through three dimensional speckle tracking and hybrid imaging modalities, such as PET-CT , may provide insight into disease manifestation before overt structural and physiological abnormalities. de Couto, G. et al. Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 7, 334-344 (2010); published online 11 May 2010; doi:10 .1038/nrcardio.2010. 51 Introduction Myocardial dysfunction leading to symptomatic heart failure is the convergent final common pathway for repeated stresses and injuries to the cardiovascular system. The aging population, environmental changes, and improved treatment for acute cardiac conditions, such as myocardial infarction and sudden deaths, have contrib - uted to the rapid increase in the prevalence and incidence of heart failure in the developed and develop ing world. In North America, heart failure accounts for 50% of medical admissions to general hospitals, and is associated with an acute in-hospital mortality of 12% and a 1-year mortal - ity of 20-35%.1,2 More than 60% of patients discharged from hospital with heart failure will be readmitted within 1 year. Escalating medical costs are incurred as a combi - nation of acute in-hospital care, ongoing medical and device-based treatments, and repeated hospital admis - sions. Large human costs, such as compromised quality of life, depression, and the inability to complete tasks at work or in daily life, are also incurred.3 In this Review, we highlight the need for early detection of myocardial dysfunction and heart failure, and describe existing and emerging strategies for this detection. Remodeling is key to HF progression In general, the development of heart failure is a clini - cally silent process. Although incompletely understood, the silent progression of heart failure appears to manifest from continual hemodynamic stress that leads to extensive remodeling within the failing heart. During hypertrophy, the shape of the ventricle becomes more concentric; with dilatation, a more spherical shape develops. Eventually, when compensation has been exhausted, the change in geometry of the ventricle leads to the impairment of function and the development of symptoms. Irrespective of disease etiology, remodeling leads to alterations in endogenous neurohormonal systems, most notably the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and adrener - gic systems, which adversely affect the structure and function of the heart.4 Moreover, inflammation, an indi - cator of physiologically stressed systems, has a key role in this process. Following cardiac injury and stress, the innate immune response is activated. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6, are produced and not only mediate remodeling of the heart but also adversely contribute to insulin resistance, cachexia, and anorexia.5 Cardiac dysfunction also leads to disruption of effective oxygen transport, which contributes to oxygen desaturation of peripheral tissues, causes increased release of norepi - nephrine, greater anxiety and depression, and worsens sympathetic derangement. Together, these complica - tions lead to respiratory and skeletal muscle atrophy, which contribute to symptomatic fatigue, dyspnea, and general weakness.6 The need for early detection Heart failure is a progressively debilitating disease that is complex and heterogeneous.

Dirk J. van Veldhuisen1 1Department of Cardiology, University Medical Centre Groningen, 1, 9700 RB, Groningen, The Netherlands; and2BG Medicine, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA Received 12 February 2009; revised 28 May 2009; accepted 10 June 2009; online publish-ahead-of-print 31 July 2009 Galectins are a family of soluble b-galactoside-binding lectins that play many important regulatory roles in inflammation, immunity, and cancer. Recently, a role for galectin-3 in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) has been suggested. Numerous studies have demonstrated the up-regulation of galectin-3 in hypertrophied hearts, its stimulatory effect on migration, broblast proliferation, and the devel- opment of brosis. The latter observation is particularly relevant as cardiac remodelling is an important determinant of the clinical outcome of HF and is linked to disease progression and poor prognosis. Because galectin-3 expression is maximal at peak brosis and virtually absentafter recovery, routine measurement in patients with HF may prove valuable to identify those patients at highest risk for readmission or death, thus enabling physicians to tailor the level of care to individual patient needs. This review summarizes the most recent advances in galectin-3 research, with an emphasis on the role galectin-3 plays in the development and progression of HF. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keywords Galectin 3 Heart failure Prognosis Fibrosis Macrophages Biomarkers Introduction Heart failure (HF) remains one of the most prevalent and challen-ging medical conditions. Despite advances in treatment, morbidity and mortality remain high; 80% of men and 70% of women aged 65 years or older will die within 8 years after the initial diagnosis.Heart failure is also one of the most costly medical conditions. 1 Perhaps best known for its role as a mediator of tumour growth, progression and metastasis,2,3a role for galectin-3 in the pathophy- siology of HF has been suggested recently. Galectin-3 is a member of the galectin family involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes4some of which, inflammation and brosis, are pivotal contributing pathophysiological mechanisms to the development and progression of HF. The up-regulation of myocar- dial galectin-3 has been demonstrated in a rat model of HF-pronehypertensive hearts, 5interferon up-regulation was associated with the concomitant activation of macrophages.5,6,8Galectin-3 was also found to be signicantly up-regulated in hypertrophiedhearts of patients with aortic stenosis 5and in the plasma of patients with acute9and chronic10,11HF. Moreover, the involve- ment of galectin-3 in the development of brosis has also beendemonstrated in the heart,5,7,8liver,12and kidney.13Taken together, these observations suggest that galectin-3 may beinvolved in the development of HF. It is speculated that blockade of galectin-3 may slow the progression of HF and possibly reduce HF-related morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the most recent advances in galectin-3 research, with an emphasis on the role galectin-3 plays in thedevelopment and progression of HF. Biology galectin which is unique in that it is the only member of the galectin family with an extended N-terminaldomain constituted of tandem repeats of short amino acid segments (a total of 110-130 amino acids) linked to a single C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain of about 130 aminoacids. Whereas the C-terminal domain is responsible for lectin activity, the presence of the N-terminal domain is necessary for the full biological activity of galectin-3. 14,15Members of the galectin family are presented in behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The American and Euro- pean Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies undertook this review to provide guidelines on the indications and optimal methods for the use of transit measurements in clinical practice. This was based on evidence of validation including performance charac- teristics, clinical signicance, and strengths of various techniques. The tests include measurements of: gastric emptying with scintigraphy, wireless motility capsule,and13C breath tests; small bowel transit with breath tests, scintigraphy, and wireless motility capsule; and colonic transit with radioopaque markers, wireless motility capsule, and scintigraphy. Based on the evi- dence, consensus recommendations are provided for each technique and for the evaluations of regional and whole gut transit. In summary, tests of gastrointestinal transit are available and useful in the evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal dysmotility, since they can provide objective diagnosis and a rational approach to patient management.

INTRODUCTION Gastroparesis, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and functional dyspepsia affect over one-third of the population, consume signicant health care resources, affect quality of life, and cause distress. They are associated with alterations in gastrointestinal (GI) transit of food, chyme, and residue.

The paper was approved by the Committee on May 16, 2004, and by the AGA Governing Board on September23, 2004. Normal gastric emptying reflects a coordinated effort between different regions of the stomach and the duodenum as well as extrinsic modulation by centralnervous system (CNS) and distal gut factors. Importantevents related to normal gastric emptying include fundicrelaxation to accommodate food, antral contractions fortrituration of large food particles, pyloric relaxation toallow food to exit the stomach, and antropyloroduodenalcoordination of motor events. Gastric dysmotility in-cludes delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis), rapidgastric emptying (as seen in dumping syndrome), andother motor dysfunctions such as impaired fundic dis-tention most commonly found in functional dyspepsia.The importance of gastric dysrhythmias has not beenclearly dened. Disorders of gastric motility may presentwith a spectrum of symptoms of variable severity. Thistechnical review systematically assesses the clinical re-search literature and formulates recommendations for thediagnosis and management of patients with gastropare-sis. The published peer-reviewed literature on gastropa-resis was searched on PubMed using the key wordsgastroparesis, gastric motility, and gastric dysmotility.Referenced articles from published manuscripts, bookchapters, and recent abstracts from national and interna-tional meetings were included in this review. Symptoms and Clinical Presentation of Gastroparesis Gastroparesis is a symptomatic chronic disorder of the stomach characterized by delayed gastric emptying inthe absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms ofgastroparesis are variable and include early satiety, nau-sea, vomiting, bloating, and upper abdominal discom-fort. In 146 patients with gastroparesis, nausea waspresent in 92%, vomiting in satiety in 60%. vegetable-laden bezoars. 2,3 Symptoms of gastroparesis are nonspecic and may mimic structural disorders such as ulcer disease, partialgastric or small bowel obstruction, gastric cancer, and pancreaticobiliary disorders.2There also is an overlap between the symptoms of gastroparesis and functionaldyspepsia. Functional dyspepsia is characterized bychronic or recurrent upper abdominal discomfort; how-ever, many individuals report symptoms of dysmotility,including nausea, vomiting, and early satiety, and sub-sets of patients with functional dyspepsia exhibit delaysin gastric emptying. 4,5Indeed, idiopathic gastroparesis can be considered one of the causes of functional dyspep-sia. Recently, a quantitative instrument for gastroparesis-related symptoms has been validated. 6 Symptom correlation with delayed gastric emptying is variable for diabetic gastropathy, idiopathic gastropare-sis, and functional dyspepsia. 7-9In recent studies, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and vomiting have beenreported to predict delayed emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia. 4,5In patients with diabetes, ab- dominal fullness and bloating were found to predictdelayed gastric emptying. 10In some drug trials of pro- kinetic agents, the correlation between symptom im-provement and acceleration of gastric emptying has beenpoor. In contrast, cisapride was reported to reduce epi-gastric pressure and bloating in association with im-proved emptying. 11In individuals with symptoms of gastroparesis who have normal rates of gastric emptying,other motor, myoelectric, or sensory abnormalities mayelicit symptoms. Abdominal discomfort or pain is present in 46%- 89% of patients with gastroparesis but is usually not thepredominant symptom, in contrast to its prominence infunctional dyspepsia. 1,12Abdominal pain in gastroparesis responds poorly to treatment of gastroparesis.12Patients with functional dyspepsia exhibit heightened sensitivityto gastric distention suggestive gastroesophageal reflux disease; MMC, migrat-ing motor the American Gastroenterological Association 0016-5085/04/$30.00 doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2004.09.055GASTROENTEROLOGY 2004;127:1592-1622Practice Parameters Practice Parameters for the Evaluation and Management of Constipation Charles A.

These guidelines are intended for the use of all practi- tioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditionsaddressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all propermethods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient. METHODOLOGY An organized search of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews was performed through October 2006. Key-word combi- nations included constipation, obstructed defecation, slow rectal intussuception, pelvic dyssynergia, anismus, paradoxical puborecta- lis, and related articles. Directed searches of the embedded references from the primary articles also were accomplished in selected circumstances. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Constipation is a symptom-based disorder of unsat- isfactory defecation that may be associated with infrequent stools, difficult stool passage, or both.1 The diagnostic criteria for functional constipationaccording to the Rome III consensus include two or more of the following symptoms: straining, lumpy or hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sen- sation of anorectal obstruction, and manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation more than 25 percent of theReprints are not available.

Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard Cigna benefit plans. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Cover age Policy . In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supercedes the information in the Coverage Po licies . In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administr ation of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations. Proprietary information of Cigna . Copyright \u00a92012 Cigna Coverage Po licy Cigna does not cov er the use of a wireless gastrointestinal motility monitoring system (e.g., SmartPill\u00ae) for any indication because it is considered experimental, investigational or unproven. General Background Gastrointestinal (GI) motility is defined by the movements of the digestive system, and the transit of the contents within it. When nerves or muscles in any portion of the digestive tract do not function with their normal strength and coordination, a person develops symptoms related to motility problems. Tests of GI motility allow the assessment and identification of abnormal patterns and physiology. For each area of the GI tract, there are different GI motility tests that assess different functions and provide different types of information. Diagnostic testing typically begins with defining intestinal tract anatomy. The presence of structural problems are generally ruled out before proceeding to studies that evaluate GI tract functioning. The SmartPill Gastrointestinal (GI) Monitoring System\u00ae (The SmartPill Corpor ation, Buffalo, NY) has been proposed as an alternative testing method for the diagnosis of gastric conditions and intestinal motility disorders such as gastroparesis and chronic constipation. The system records pH and pressure measurements from the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract for use by physicians to aid in the evaluation of gastrointestinal motility diseases and conditions. Sensors on board an ingestible capsule measure pH and pressure as the capsule travels the length of the GI tract. Measurements are transmitted from the capsule within the GI tract via radiofrequency signal to a patient worn receiver and subsequently downloaded for analysis and review. Next, software performs data analyses providing the physician with a printable report c ontaining regional gut transit Medical Policy Subject:Wireless Capsule for the Evaluation of Suspected Gastric and Intestinal Motility Disorders Policy #: MED.00090 Current Last Review Date: 08/09/2012 Description/Scope A wireless capsule for the evaluation of suspected gastric and intestinal motility disorders, the SmartPill GI Monitoring System\u00ae (SmartPill Corporation, Buffalo, NY) was designed to measure pH, temperature and pressure throughout the gastrointestinal tract.The measurements are transmitted via radio signals to an external recording device. Inthe stomach, the SmartPill has been used to assess gastric emptying in individuals withsuspected gastroparesis. In the intestine, the SmartPill has been used to assess smalland large bowel transit times in those with chronic constipation or other motilitydisorders. The device is also referred to in this document as a wireless motility capsule. Note: Please see the following related documents for additional information: RAD.00030 Wireless Capsule Endoscopy for Esophageal and Small Bowel Imaging and the Patency Capsule Position Statement Investigational and Not Medically Necessary:A wireless capsule for the evaluation of suspected gastric motility disorders (SmartPill GI Monitoring System) is considered investigational and not medically necessary for all conditions. A wireless capsule for the evaluation of suspected intestinal motility disorders (SmartPill GI Monitoring System) is considered investigational and not medically necessaryfor all conditions. Rationale Wireless Motility Capsule for the Evaluation of Suspected Gastroparesis The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) (2004) has identified gastricemptying scintigraphy (GES) of a solid-phase meal as the gold standard for the diagnosisof gastroparesis. Scintigraphy studies involve the ingestion of a radiolabeled mealfollowed by serial images to identify the percentage of the meal retained at 2 and 4hours. In contrast, the wireless motility capsule estimates the gastric emptying time(GET) based on the time from ingestion to an abrupt rise in the pH, signifying that thecapsule has passed from the acid environment of the stomach to the alkaline duodenum.Validation of the wireless motility capsule as an alternative to scintigraphic gastricemptying studies requires directly comparative studies of individuals with a variety ofsymptoms which are interpreted in a blinded fashion. Kuo and colleagues (2008) enrolled 87 healthy subjects and 61 with known gastroparesis who simultaneously ingested the wireless capsule and a radiolabeled meal, permitting a BCBS 2012 MED_00090 Wireless Capsule for the Evaluation of Suspected Gastric and Intestinal Motility Disorders 12013 Genetic Testing CPT code review 1 81201- 81203 1) Familial adenomatosis polyposis gene testing 2) Similar Prioritized List placements: a.

This PCO addresses the clinical utility of using epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR) mutation testing for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to predict the rst-line NSCLC have a signicantly higher rate of partial responses to the EGFR TKIs getinib and erlotinib. In the United States, approximately 15% of patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbor activating EGFR mutations. EGFR mutation testing is widespread at academic medical centers and in some locales in community practice. As of yet,there is no evidence of an overall survival (OS) benet from selecting treatment based onperforming this testing. Recent Data One large phase III trial (the Iressa Pan-Asia Study [IPASS] trial), three smaller phase III randomized controlled trials using progression-free survival as the primary end point, and one small phase IIItrial with OS as the primary end point, all involving rst-line EGFR TKIs and chemotherapydoublets, form the basis of this PCO. Provisional Clinical Opinion On the basis of the results of ve phase III randomized controlled trials, patients with NSCLC who are being considered for rst-line therapy with an EGFR TKI (patients who havenot previously received chemotherapy or an EGFR TKI) should have their tumor tested forEGFR mutations to determine whether an EGFR TKI or chemotherapy is the appropriate rst-line therapy. NOTE. ASCO's provisional clinical opinions (PCOs) reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and literature available at the time they are written and are intended to assist physicians in clinicaldecision making and identify questions and settings for further research. Because of the rapid flow ofscientic information in oncology, new evidence may have emerged since the time a PCO wassubmitted for publication. PCOs are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recentevidence. PCOs cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be consideredinclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of thetreating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge ofthe patient, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to anyPCO is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physicianin light of each patient's individual circumstances. ASCO PCOs describe the use of procedures andtherapies in clinical practice and cannot be assumed to apply to the use of these interventions in thecontext of clinical trials. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons orproperty arising out of or related to any use of ASCO's PCOs, or for any errors or omissions.

Summary Disease characteristics. Nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness (DFNB1) is characterized by congenital, non- progressive, mild -to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment. No othe r associated medical findings are present. Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis of DFNB1 depends on molecular genetic testing to identify deafness -causing mutations in GJB2 and/or GJB6 that alter the gap junction beta -2 protein (connexin 26) and the gap junction beta- 6 protein (connexin 30), respectively. Clinically available molecular genetic testing of GJB2 and GJB6 detects more than 99% of deafness - causing mutations in these genes. Management.Treatment of manifestations: Hearing aids; enrollment in appropriate e ducational programs; cochlear implantation may be considered for individuals with profound deafness.

Summary Disease characteristics. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1 (CMT1) is a demyelinating by distal muscle wea kness and atrophy, sensory loss, and slow nerve conduction velocity. It is usually slowly progressive and often associated with pes cavus foot deformity and bilateral foot drop. Affected individuals usually become symp tomatic between age five and 25 years. Fewer than 5% of individuals become whee lchair dependent. Life sp an is not shortened. Diagnosis/testing. (6%-10% of in MPZ . CMT1C (1%-2% of all CMT1) is associated in LITAF, and CMT1D (<2% of all CMT1) is associated CMT1E (<5% of all PMP22 . CMT2E/1F (<5% all CMT1) is associated with in NEFL . Molecular genetic testing is cl inically available for all of these genes. Management. Treatment of manifestations: Treatment by a multidisciplinary team including a neurologist, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, physical and occupational therapist; special shoes and/or ankle/foot orthoses to correct foot drop and aid walking; surgery as n eeded for severe pes cavus; forearm crutches, canes, wheelchairs as needed for mobility; exercise as tolerated. Prevention of secondary complications: Daily heel cord stretching to prevent Achilles' tendon shortening. Surveillance: Regular foot examinati on for pressure sores. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Obesity (makes ambulation more difficult); medications (e.g., vincristine, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin) known to cause nerve damage. Genetic counseling. CMT1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About two thirds of probands with CMT1A have inherited the disease-causin g mutation; about one third have CMT1A as Page 1 of 33 Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy CodeComments 90785 Interactive complexity (List separately in addition to the code for primary procedure)90802, 90810-90814MHCD Lines (5,9,27,32,68,107,133,180,2 09,212,222,269,295,305,316,334,390,398,400,412,417,419,425,431,437,445,457,462,469,471,474,481,483,487,488,496,500,508,518,521,544,546,562,569,576,588,608,609,660)MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 6 TOBACCO DEPENDENCE Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY/BRIEF COUNSELING NOT TO EXCEED 10 FOLLOW-UP VISITS OVER 3 MONTHS 70 SUBSTANCE-INDUCED DELIRIUM 400 DISORDERS OF SPINE WITH NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT 562 ACUTE AND CHRONIC DISORDERS OF SPINE WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT 681 MENTAL DISORDERS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY Treatment: EVALUATION 90791 psychiatric diagnostic evaluation (no medical services)--done by nonphysician90801 or 90802 Diagnostic 90792 psychiatric diagnostic evaluation with medical services--done by physician90801 or Diagnostic 90810 90816 90823MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 90833 30-minute psychotherapy add-on code 90805 9081090817 90824MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 5622013 Pscyh CPT Codes 90826MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 90836 45-minute psychotherapy add-on code 90807 90813 90827MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 90837 psychotherapy, 60 minutes 90808 9081490821 90828MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 90838 60-minute psychotherapy add-on code 90809 9081590822 90829MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 90839 psychotherapy for crisis, first 60 minutes No existing code MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 90840 psychotherapy for crisis,each additional 30 minutes No existing code MHCD lines MHCD lines (minus lines 6 and 681) + line 70 + line 400 + line 562 90863 Pharmacologic management, including prescription and review of medication, when performed with psychotherapy services No existing codeExcluded Note: only to be used by psychologists in New Mexico and Louisiana who are permitted to prescribe.

Although such supports are not part of the mental health benefit package, mental health organizations (MHOs) that el ect to provide these services may report them using psychiatric rehabilitation codes which pair with mental health diagnoses. If MHO s choose to provide tobacco cessation supports, they should report these services using 99407 for individual counseling and S9453 f or classes.

These codes are to be used when the focus of t reatment is on the alleged child victim. This can include findings by child welfare of abuse or neglect; or statements of abuse or neglect by the child, the perpetrat or, or a caregiver or collateral report. Although these diagnoses can be used preventively , i.e. for children who are not yet showing symptoms, presence of symptoms should be demonstrated for interventions beyond evaluation or a short -term child or family intervention.

GUIDELINE NOTE 75, AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS Line 334 There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of treatment (e.g., Applied Behavioral Analysis) for Autism Spectr um Disorders (ASD). However, effective treatments may be available for co- morbid conditions such as mood disorders. When treating co- morbid conditions, that condition, not an ASD diagnosis, should be the primary diagnosis for billing purposes. The treatment of co -morbid mental health conditions should be consistent with the treatment methods, frequency, and duration normally applied to those diagnoses. Treatment of neurologic dysfunctions that may be seen in individuals with an ASD diagnosis are prioritized according to the four dysfunction lines found on the Prioritized List ( Lines 78, 318, 375 and 407). Treatment for associated behaviors, such as agitation, that do not meet the criteria for co -morbid mental health diagnoses should be limited in frequency t o a maximum of 8 hours of behavioral health service per month, subject to utilization management review by the mental health organization (MHO) or other relevant payer.

DES consist of a standard metallic stent, a poly mer coating, and an anti -restenotic drug (eg, sirolimus or a derivative of sirolimus or paclitaxel) that is mixed within the polymer and is released over a period as short as days to as long as one year after implantation to reduce the local proliferative healing response. Four types of DES are currently Greenhalgh 2011, Cochrane review of drug eluting vs bare metal cardiac stents i. N=more than 14,500 patients in 47 RCTs ii. There were no statistically significant differences in death, AMI or thrombosis between drug eluting stents (DES) and bare metal stents (BMS) . Total reduction was seen in the need for repeat revascularization with use of sirolimus, paclitaxel, everolimus, a limited extent) tacrolimus -eluting stents. These effects are demonstrated in the longer term follow up. Subgroup analyses (e.g. diabetics) largely mirrored these findings. iii. Authors' conclusions : Drug -elutin g stents releasing sirolimus, paclitaxel, dexamethasone and zotarolimus reduce composite cardiac events. However, this reduction is due largely to reductions in repeat revascularisation rates as there is no evidence of a significant effect on rates of deat h, MI or thrombosis. The increased cost of drug- eluting stents and lack of evidence of their cost -effectiveness means that various health funding agencies are having to limit or regulate their use in relation to price premium. b. NICE 2003, guidance on corona ry stenting i. It is recommended that when considering the use of a bare -metal stent (BMS) or a drug -eluting stent (DES) the decision should be based on the anatomy of the target vessel for stenting and the symptoms and mode of presentation of the disease. c. DeLuca 2012, meta -analysis i. N=6298 patients in 11 trials ii. At long -term follow -up (mean [SD], 1201 [440] days), DES implantation significantly reduced the occurrence of target -vessel revascularization <0.001, P value for heterogeneity, .20), without any significant difference in terms of mortality, reinfarction, and stent thrombosis. However, DES implantation 2013 HCPCS Code Issues Page 2 was associated with an increased risk of very late stent thrombosis and reinfarction. 4) Other guidelines a. American Heart Association, 2011 i. meta -analyses have failed to show that the introduction of bare -metal stents (BMS) confers a survival advantage over balloon angioplasty405-407 or that the use of drug -eluting stents (DES) confers a survival advantag e over BMS. 5) Summary: Controversy exists over whether drug eluting stents confer survival advantage compared to drug eluting stents. However, drug eluting stents appear to reduce the need for revascularization procedures. Increased cost of drug eluting st ents compared to bare metal stents s hould be taken into consideration when determining coverage. 6) Recommendation: a.

Experimental PSA3 1) HCPCS code: S3721 2) Definition: novel urine protein used for confirmation of diagnosis of prostate cancer 3) Evidence: a. Auprich 2011 review i. prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) is superior to prostate -specific antigen (PSA) and percent free PS A in the early detection of prostate cancer. PCA3 improves the diagnostic accuracy of externally valid ated nomograms among men with an elevated PSA undergoing biopsy. PCA3 independently predicts low -volume disease and pathologically insignificant prostate cancer but is not associated with locally advanced disease and is limited in the prediction of aggress ive cancer. Preliminary data demonstrate that combining PCA3 with other new biomarkers further improves diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. ii. Conclusions: PCA3, integrated in novel biopsy nomograms or risk stratification tools, can be used to counsel or confirm biopsy indications. If confirmed in further studies, using PCA3 together with established staging risk factors could assist clinicians in specific pretreatment decision making. So far no evidence for the usefulness of PCA3 in active surveillance progr ams has been presented. a. Roopol 2011 review a. Studies investigating the value of PCA3 as a diagnostic test virtually all show a beneficial effect as compared to PSA with respect to specificity. Beside the fact that most of these studies are subject to potenti al bias, the observed increased specificity was accompanied by relatively low sensitivities. Two studies, attempting to avoid selection bias as much as possible, show a marginal beneficial effect of the PCA3 test. Data on PCA3 as a staging tool for prostat e cancer remain inconclusive. 2013 HCPCS Code Issues Page 4 b. Summary: The PCA3 test is not capable of replacing the PSA test in clinical practice and an appropriate cut -off level with acceptable performance characteristics is hard to define. Its value as a first -line diagnostic test is limited. The addition of PCA3 to risk assessment tools leads to an increase in predictive capability. Data relating to the accuracy of PCA3 on prostate cancer staging are contradictory and PCA3 as prognostic test should be subject of future studies . 4) Other policies a. Cigna 2011 i.

Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Coronary artery stents are tiny tubular devices used to 'scaff old' during percutaneous transluminal problem; in order to reduce restenosis, stents that elu te drugs over time are now available. However these drug-eluting stents ar e more expensive and there is a need to assess their clinical ben ets prior to recommending their use. Objectives T o examine evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) t o assess the impact of drug eluting stents (DES) compared to bare metal stents (BMS) in the reduction of cardiac events. Search strategy The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1990 - April 2009) and EMBASE (1980 - January 2009) were searched. We carried out handsearching (electronic and manual) up to January 2008. Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing DES with BMS used in conjunction with P TCA techniques in the review. Participants were adults with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We considere d published and unpublished sources and included them if they reported outcome data of interest. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently extracted data, assesse d trial quality assessment and checked decisions within the gro up. Data extraction included composite event rates (major adverse cardia c event, target vessel thrombosis. Data synthesis included me ta-analysis of composite event rate, death, AMI and revascularisation rates , presented as odds ratios with 95% condence intervals (CI) usi ng a xed- effect model. We assessed heterogeneity between trials. 1 Drug-eluting stents versus bare metal stents for angina or a cute coronary syndromes (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This guidancefor the use of DES does not apply to people who have hadan MI in the preceding 24 hours, or for whom there isangiographic evidence of thrombus in the target artery. 1.4 If more than one artery is considered clinically appropriate for stenting then the considerations in Section 1.3 apply toeach artery. 1.5 This guidance specifically relates to the present clinical indications for PCI and excludes conditions (such as manycases of stable angina) that are adequately managed withstandard drug therapy.REVIEW ARTICLE Drug-Eluting Bare-Metal Drug-Eluting Stent in Primary Angioplasty (DESERT) Cooperation Background :Concerns have emerged regarding a higher risk of stent thrombosis after drug-eluting stent (DES) infarction (STEMI). Our objective was toperform a meta-analysis using individual patient data toevaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of DES com-pared with bare-metal stents (BMS) in patients undergo-ing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI. Data Sources :Formal searches of electronic data- bases (MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and scientific sessionpresentations from January 2000 to June 2011. Study Selection :We examined all completed random- ized trials of DES for STEMI. Data Extraction :Individual patient data. Data Synthesis :Individual patient data were ob- tained from 11 of 13 trials identified, including a total of6298 patients (3980 [63.2%] [SD], 1201 [440] days), DES implantation heterogeneity, .20), with- out difference in terms of mortality, re-infarction, and stent thrombosis. However, DES implan-tation was associated with an increased risk of very latestent thrombosis and reinfarction. Conclusions :The present pooled patient-level meta- analysis demonstrates that among patients STEMIundergoing primary percutaneous coronary interven-tion, sirolimus-eluting and paclitaxel-eluting stentscompared with are associated with a significant re-duction in target-vessel revascularization at long-term fol-low-up. Although there were differences in cumula-tive mortality, reinfarction, or stent thrombosis, theincidence of very late reinfarction and stent thrombosiswas increased with these DES.

How- ever, concerns have emerged regardinga potentially higher risk of stent throm-bosis (ST) with DES 18,19that might be even more pronounced among patients with STEMI, as suggested by a prospec-tive registry. 20-22Therefore, the aim of the Drug-Eluting Stents in PrimaryAngioplasty (DESERT) Cooperationwas to perform a pooled patient-levelmeta-analysis of randomized trials toevaluate the risks and benefits of DEScompared with BMS in patients under-going primary percutaneous coronaryintervention (PCI) for STEMI.See Invited Commentary s European HPompidou, A Publique-Hand INSER M Descartes U n France (Dr S Heart Cent e Copenhage n Kelb\u00e6k); D e Cardiology ,Medical Ce n Netherland s van der Ho e DepartmentSkejby , Den m DepartmentUniversity H SwitzerlandDivision of C Camillo Ho s (Drs MustoOspedale S a Annunziata , Florence, It a Spaziani); H Interventio n University H Rocio, Sevil l de la Llera);Cardiology U Neri Hospit a Pasceri); Di v \"S.

Forstudies performed in large numbers of subjects outside NorthAmerica, each writing committee reviews the potential influ-ence of different practice patterns and patient populations onthe treatment effect and relevance to the ACCF/AHA targetpopulation to determine whether the findings should inform aspecific recommendation. The ACCF/AHA practice guidelines are intended to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision making by describing arange of generally acceptable approaches to the diagnosis,management, and prevention of specific diseases or conditions.The guidelines attempt to define practices that meet the needs ofmost patients in most circumstances. The ultimate judgmentregarding the care of a particular patient must be made by thehealthcare provider and patient in light of all the circumstancespresented by that patient. As a result, situations may arise forwhich deviations from these guidelines may be appropriate.Clinical decision making should involve consideration of thequality and availability of expertise in the area where care isprovided. When these guidelines are used as the basis forregulatory or payer decisions, the goal should be improvement inquality of care. The Task Force recognizes that situations arise inwhich additional data are needed to inform patient care moreeffectively; these areas will be identified within each respectiveguideline when appropriate. Prescribed courses of treatment in accordance with these recommendations are effective only if followed. Because lack of patient understanding and adherence may adversely affectoutcomes, physicians and other healthcare providers shouldmake every effort to engage the patient's active participationin prescribed medical regimens and lifestyles. In addition,patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, andalternatives to a particular treatment and be involved inshared decision making whenever feasible, particularly forCOR IIa and IIb, where the benefit-to-risk ratio may be lower. The Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that may arise as aresult of industry relationships or personal interests amongthe members of the writing committee. All writing committeemembers and peer reviewers of the guideline are required to disclose all such current relationships, as well as thoseexisting 12 months previously. In December 2009, the ACCFand AHA implemented a new policy for relationships withindustry and other entities (RWI) that requires the writingcommittee chair plus a minimum of 50% of the writingcommittee to have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1 for theACCF/AHA definition of relevance). These statements arereviewed by the Task Force and all members during eachconference call and meeting of the writing committee and areupdated as changes occur. All guideline recommendationsrequire a confidential vote by the writing committee and mustbe approved by a consensus of the voting members. Membersare not permitted to write, and must recuse themselves fromvoting on, any recommendation or section to which their RWIapply. Members who recused themselves from voting areindicated in the list of writing committee members, andsection recusals are noted in Appendix 1. Authors' and peerreviewers' RWI pertinent to this guideline are disclosed inAppendixes 1 and 2, respectively. Additionally, to ensurecomplete transparency, writing committee members' comprehen- sive disclosure information\u2014including RWI not pertinent to thisdocument\u2014is available as an online supplement. Comprehensivedisclosure information for the Task Force is also available online atwww.cardiosource.org/ACC/About-ACC/Leadership/Guidelines-and-Documents-Task-Forces.aspx . The work of the writing com- mittee was supported exclusively by the ACCF and AHA withoutcommercial support. Writing committee members volunteered theirtime for this activity. In an effort to maintain relevance at the point of care for practicing physicians, the Task Force continues to oversee an ongoing process improvement initiative. As a result, inresponse to pilot projects, evidence tables (with referenceslinked to abstracts in PubMed) have been added. In April 2011, the Institute of Medicine released 2 reports: Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for SystematicReviews andClinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust . 2,3It is noteworthy that the ACCF/AHA guidelines are cited as beingcompliant with many of the proposed standards. A thoroughreview of these reports and of our current methodology is underway, with further enhancements anticipated. The recommendations in this guideline are considered current until they are superseded by a focused update or thefull-text guideline is revised. Guidelines are official policy ofboth the ACCF and AHA. Alice K. Jacobs, MD, FACC, FAHA Chair ACCF/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines 1. Introduction 1.1.

Anesthetic management of the CABG patient mandates a favorable balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand toprevent or minimize myocardial injury (Section 2.1.8). Histori-cally, the popularity of several anesthetic techniques for CABGhas varied on the basis of their known or potential adversecardiovascular effects (eg, cardiovascular depression with highdoses of volatile anesthesia, lack of such depression withhigh-dose opioids, or coronary vasodilation and concern for a\"steal\" phenomenon with isoflurane) as well as concerns aboutinteractions with preoperative medications (Sections 2.1.8 and 4.5). Independent of these concerns, efforts to improve outcomes and to reduce costshave led to shorter periods of postoperative mechanical ventila-tion and even, in some patients, to prompt extubation in in CABG patients in theUnited States in the 1970s and 1980s. Subsequently, itbecame clear that volatile anesthetics are protective in thesetting of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, and this, inHillis et al 2011 ACCF/AHA CABG Guideline e657 by guest on November 21, 2012 http://circ.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from Collaborative Review - Prostate Cancer Contemporary Role of Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 in the Management of Prostate Cancer Marco Aupricha,*, Anders Bjartellb, Felix K.-H.

Results were restricted to English- language papers published within the period 1999-2011.Evidence synthesis: The PCA3 gene is highly overexpressed in specic PCa cell lines and prostatic tumours. In 2006, a simple and robust urine test (Progensa) became commer-cially available. Despite its costs, prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) is superior toprostate-specic antigen (PSA) and percent free PSA in the early detection of PCa.PCA3 improves the diagnostic accuracy of externally validated nomograms amongmen with an elevated PSA undergoing biopsy. PCA3 independently predicts low-volume disease and pathologically insignicant PCa but is not associated with locally advanced disease and is limited in the prediction of aggressive cancer. Preliminary data demon-strate that combining PCA3 with other new biomarkers further improves diagnostic andprognostic accuracy. Finally, ndings of the rst PCA3-Gene-ViroTherapy study suggesttherapeutic potential by exploiting PCA3 overexpression.Conclusions: PCA3, integrated in novel biopsy nomograms or risk stratication tools, can be used to counsel or conrm biopsy indications. If conrmed in further studies,using PCA3 together with established staging risk factors could assist clinicians inspecic pretreatment decision making. So far no evidence for the usefulness of PCA3in active surveillance programs has been presented. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology. * Corresponding author.

Roobol Introduction Despite the fact that it is commonly known that the serum prostate-specic antigen (PSA) test does not represent the ideal tumor marker, it is still the most frequently used test in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Especially now, with convincing evi- dence available that PSA-based screening can reduce disease-specic mortality [1/C15/C15,2/C15/C15], a diagnostic test capable of distinguishing men with prostate cancer from those without the disease with greater specicity and at the same time precisely identifying those men with potentially aggressive prostate cancer is urgently needed. Various PSA-related derivatives and subforms (i.e., PSA velocity, PSA density, free PSA, hK2) have provided some improvement in terms of specicity [3]. Since the identication, characterization [4] and commerciali- zation (Progensa, Genprobe San Diego, California, USA) of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3), numerous studies have been published to investigate the performance of the PCA3 test as a prebiopsy diagnostic test and to compare its performance with the serum PSA test.In the present review, studies published in the year 2010 investigating the value of the PCA3 test will be summar- ized. The rst part of this review discusses studies on the PCA3 test as a diagnostic tool. The second part reviews studies that assessed the potential of the PCA3 test in prostate cancer staging. The prostate cancer gene 3 test as a diagnostic tool Very often the presented research focuses on the accuracy of the PCA3 test in men selected for prostate biopsy on the basis of a PSA test result. However, this exactly indicates the origin for potential bias in such studies, because frequently men are included based on a PSA test result (often in the so-called grey zone: 2.0 or 4.0 to 10.0 ng/ml) or based on a previous negative biopsy, which was initially indicated by an elevated PSA level. Com- parison of performance characteristics in these types of studies should always be interpreted with caution, because the predictive capability of the serum PSA test (used as the golden standard) is flawed, due to PSA-basedErasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Correspondence to Monique J. Roobol, MSc, PhD, Erasmus University Medical Centre, P.O. Box 2040, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands Tel: fax: Current Opinion in Urology 2011, 21:225-229Purpose of review With increasing evidence that prostate-specic antigen (PSA)-based screening can reduce disease-specic mortality but coincides with unacceptable levels of unnecessary testing and the diagnosis of potentially nonlife-threatening disease, the need for new, more specic biomarkers is urgent. Within this context the role of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) test is evaluated. Recent ndings Studies investigating the value of PCA3 as a diagnostic test virtually all show a benecial effect as compared to PSA with respect to specicity. Beside the fact that most of these studies are subject to potential bias, the observed increased specicity was accompanied by relatively low sensitivities. Two studies, attempting to avoid selection bias as much as possible, show a marginal benecial effect of the PCA3 test. Data on PCA3 as a staging tool for prostate cancer remain inconclusive. Summary The PCA3 test is not capable of replacing the PSA test in clinical practice and an appropriate cut-off level with acceptable performance characteristics is hard to dene. Its value as a rst-line diagnostic test is limited. The addition of PCA3 to risk assessment tools leads to an increase in predictive capability. Data relating to the accuracy of PCA3 on prostate cancer staging are contradictory and PCA3 as prognostic test should be subject of future studies.

Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard Cigna benefit plans. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy . In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supercedes the information in the Coverage Po licies . In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations. Proprietary information of C igna.

Testing includes, but is not limited to the (SNPs) Candidate gene panels Gene hypermethylation/DNA methylation General Background The expression and function of numerous genes have been shown to be altered in prostate cancer. Many of these genes are involved in cell cycle regulation, steroid hormone metabolism or regulation of gene expression. Analysis of changes in the levels of expression of large numbers of genes during prostate cancer progression has provided a better understanding of the basis of the disease, yielding new molecular markers with potential use in diagnosis and prognosis (Foley, et al., 2004). Page 2 of 12 Coverage Policy Number: 0332 Although serum prostate- specific antigen (PSA) measurement is regarded as the best conventional serum tumor marker available for prostate cancer, it has great limitations as well. Despite its adequate sensitivity, the use of PSA is limited by significant lack of specificity. Consequently, the clinical assessment of patients with an elevated PSA value will result in the performance of unnecessary prostatic biopsies in a substantial number of men. This can be explained by the fact that PSA is not specific for prostate cancer. One proposed approach to improve diagnostic accuracy of tests for prostate cancer and to reduce the number of biopsies is to identify prostate cancer -specific genes (Hessels, et al., 2003). Prostate Cancer Gene 3 (PCA3) One such gene is prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3), which is also known by the symbol DD3, a prostate- specific gene that is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue. Investigators pursued the analysis of urine obtained after digital rectal examination (DRE). Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the samples and tested by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for PCA3. PCA3 testing in clinical practice focuses on the detection of the PCA3 in urine samples following a digital rectal exam. One proposal is to use the PCA3 assay in conjunction with serum PSA measurements and digital rectal examination (DRE) to assist in decision making regarding the need for biopsy in men undergoing evaluation for prostate cancer. A ratio of the PCA3 mRNA and PSA mRNA in the urine are calculated to provide a PCA score. It is proposed that the PCA score provides the expression of PCA3 corrected for the background of prostate cells present in the specimen. It is also thought that this measurement may serve to validate that the yield of prostate specific RNA is su fficient to generate a valid or informative test . U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) February 2012, the PROGENSA PCA3 \u00a9 (Gen- Probe, San Diego, CA) assay received (PMA). The PMA notes that the progensa pca3 assay is indicated for use in conjunction with other patient information to aid in the decision for repeat biopsy in men 50 years of age or older who have had one or more previous negative prostate biopsies and for whom a repeat biopsy would be recommended by a urologist based on current standard of care, before consideration of progensa pca3 assay results. A pca3 score <25 is associated with a decreased likelihood of a positive biopsy. Prostatic biopsy is required for diagnosis of cancer. The FDA approval includes a Black Box warning: The PROGENSA PCA3 Assay should not be used for men with atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) on their most recent biopsy. Men with ASAP on their most recent biopsy should be treated in accordance with current medical guidelines. A warning is included in the FDA approval: The Clinical Study of the PROGENSA PCA3 assay only included men who were recommended for a repeat biopsy. Therefore, the performance of the PROGENSA PCA3 Assay has not been established in men for whom a repeat biopsy was not already recommended. Literature Review \u2014Prostate Cancer Gene 3 (PCA3) de la Taille et al. (2011) reported on a prospective, multicenter, observational study that evaluated the clinical utility of the PCA3 assay in guiding initial biopsy decisions. The st udy included 516 men with a serum total prostate specific antigen of 2.5- 10 ng/ml scheduled for initial biopsy. The patients PCA3 scores were determined using the PROGENSA PCA3 assay and compared to biopsy outcome. The diagnostic accuracy of PCA3 was compared to total prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and %free prostate specific antigen. The performance of the PCA3 assay was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity by comparing the PCA3 score to biopsy outcome. The positive biops y rate was 40%. An increasing PCA3 score corresponded with an increasing probability of a positive biopsy. The mean PCA3 score was higher in men with a positive as compared to a negative biopsy (69.6 vs 31.0, median 50 vs 18, p<0.0001). The PCA3 score was independent of age, total prostate specific antigen and prostate volume. The PCA3 score (cutoff of 35) had a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 76%. The ROC analysis showed a significantly higher AUC for the PCA3 score vs total prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and %free prostate specific antigen. The PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with biopsy Gleason score 7 or greater vs less than 7, greater than 33% vs 33% or fewer positive cores and significant vs indolent prostate cancer. Inclusion of PCA3 in multivariable models increased their predictive accuracy by up to 5.5%. The authors concluded that the PROGENSA PCA3 assay may improve the prediction of initial biopsy outcome. While the PCA3 score appears to be more accurate for predicting biopsy outcomes, it is still unknown what the appropriate cutoff for PCA3 score and the utility of this test for biopsy decisions. It should be further studied whether the PCA3 score may also be indicative of prostate cancer aggressiveness and if it can aid in the selection of men who can be treated with active surveillance.

Section 5 New Discussion Items Silver Compounds For Dental Caries Silver fluoride for dental caries Page 1 Question : Should coverage for silver compounds (silver nitrate plus topical fluoride or silver diamine fluoride) to prevent and treat dental caries be added to the Prioritized List? Question source : Senator Bates Issue : There is significant debate in the dental community about the use of silver nitrate (in combination with topical fluoride) as a treatment for dental caries. A single agent, silver diamine fluoride (SDF), that is used internationally to treat caries, is currently not FDA approved. Som e in the US are using silver nitrate plus topic fluoride as a proxy. Both methods are inexpensive, requires no anesthetic but does leave black spots on the teeth, which could be an issue with anterior (especially permanent) teeth. Evidence Summary MED, 2 012 1) Silver diamine fluoride appears to be effective at preventing and treating caries. 2) Limitations: a. No studies have been performed in the US b. Studies were compared to sodium fluoride, sealants , interim restorative treatment, or nothing . Use of toothpaste and toothbrushing may not be comparable to US populations. c. No comparative efficacy data on standard fluoride prevention and treatment such as fluoridated water and varnish were included. 3) There is no evidence on the effectiveness of sil ver nitrate plus topical fluoride. Summary There is evidence of effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride, however, there are significant limitations to the data. T he external validity is very limited, given that populations studied have very different prevalent rates of the standard prevention/treatment s in the U.S. (e.g. tooth brushing, varnish, community water fluoridation) . The long- term efficacy of arresting caries arresting with silver compounds (+/- restorative care) compared to usual care of rest orative treatment is unknown. Th ere is a significant risk of permanent tooth discoloration. Frequent application is required and restorative treatment may (always) be indicated. There is no evidence on the effectiveness of silver nitrate plus topical fluoride. Recommendations : 1) Do not add silver treatment s to the Prioritized List Silver Compounds For Dental Caries Silver fluoride for dental caries Page 2 2) Add a guideline to indicate that neither this treatment (Silver diamine fluoride) nor a proxy (silver nitrate plus fluoride) are included on the Prioritized List Guideline Note XX Silver compounds for dental caries Lines 58, 372, 373, 494, 621 Silver compounds for dental caries prevention and treatment are not included on these or any lines on the Prioritized List for coverage consideration. Steve Duffin, D.D.S. 11631 Lausanne St. Wilsonville, OR 97070 November 30 , 2012 Silver Nitrate Use In Dentistry HERC Value Based Benefits Subcommittee Ladies and Gentlemen: The founders of the modern dental profession , WD Miller (1890), GV Black(1908) and Percy Howe(1917) all used and taught the use of silver nitrate to arrest caries with remarkable success. Fluoride came on the scene in the 1950's and its success overshadowed the earlier use of silver nitrate. Today we have water fluoridation, fluoride tooth paste and fluoride varnish. In spite of this situation, dental cares is making a comeback. It is not known why this is, but the likely reason is changing dietary patterns and new types and quantities of sugars in processed foods. I knew that something different needed t o be brought to bear on the current epidemic of caries in high risk populations. I learned about a protocol to arrest caries using silver nitrate described in 1908 by G. V. Black. I then developed a simple method that consists of a combination therapy using silver nitrate (one drop) + fluoride varnish. The results were stunning. Essentially all of the cavities that were carefully treated with this technique became arrested and new cavities did not form in these patients . This meth odology is described in \"Back the Future, Medical Management of Caries\" Published in the November 2012 issue of the Journal of the California Dental Association . In addition, I am including a recent review paper covering the historical use of silver compounds in dentistry by Peng. Efficacy and safety are addressed well in this paper. By combining wisdom from the past together with modern fluoride varnish product s we now have a cost effective tool using minimum intervention to halt dental caries in its tracks. Over the past year I have had the opportunity to provide training in this protocol to many dental offices and in universities across the country . In Oregon , this training has been l argely within the Advantage Dental provider network. Evidence suggests that similar outcomes are beginning to be seen in this patient population. I hope that everyone who is involved with delivering oral health services might be come aware of this new/old tool that has come back to us. Sincerely, Steve Duffin steveduffin8@gmail.com cda journal, vol 40, n \u00ba1 1 november 2012 853caries lesions Back to the Future: t he Medical Management of c aries i ntroduction steven duffin, dds abstract Based on the literature, a protocol was developed involving the application of 25 percent silver nitrate directly to cavitated caries lesions, immediately followed by 5 percent sodium fluoride varnish. This protocol results in arrest of active caries lesions. This minimally invasive treatment is well-accepted by patients and reduces anxieties related to dental office visits. in the late 1970s, it looked like the dental profession might be close to finding the cure for caries\u2014the world's most prevalent disease. Initiation of community water system fluoridation programs in the 1950s plus the introduction of fluoridated toothpaste substantially cut caries rates across many demographics in America. And there was talk of a caries vaccine that would be available in 10 years or so that would essentially eliminate the disease. 1 Thirty-something years later, in many ways, things have not changed that much. Even today, there is still talk about a possible caries vaccine that would be available in 10 years. In more affluent populations within the United States, caries is a relatively minor health concern. Multiple studies show that 20 percent of author steve duffin, dds , owner of Shore view Dental LLC, practiced general dentistry for 30 years. He obtained a microbiology degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1979 and his DDS degree from Emory School of Dentistry in 1983.Conflict of Interest Disclosure: Steven Duffin, DDS, is owner of Shoreview Dental, LLC.the population have 80 percent of dental caries. Those high caries rate populations are characterized by lower socioeconomic status. Contributing factors for high disease ra tes may be increased exposure to dietary sugars, lower dental IQ, and ineffective oral hygiene practices. 2 What has changed is that we now have a much greater awareness that despite good oral health for a large proportion of Americans, there are great disparities among different populations within the United States; some continue to have a high prevalence of caries, and a correspondingly high morbidity from the disease. This is especially true for the children of some racial and ethnic minority populations, as was pointed out in the Surgeon General's report on Oral Health in America in the years 2000 and Review Silver compounds used in dentistry for caries management: A review J.J.-Y.

Introduction Since the 1800s, silver (Ag) has been used both in dentistry and medicine for its anticaries, antimicrobial and antirheumatic properties. In the 1900s, silver compounds were popular regimens for treating tetanus and rheumatism and before antibiotics were invented, clinicians attempted to treat coldsand gonorrhoea by utilizing silver compounds before anti- biotics were invented.1In the 1930s, penicillin and other antibiotics emerged and health professionals discovered that antibiotics were superior to silver compounds for their efcacy of combating infections and their easy of manufacture.2 Owing to these reasons, research and clinical interest in silver greatly reduced. However, in the 1970s, interest in silver compounds reappeared, due to the emergence of antibacterialj o u r n a l o f d e n t i s t r y 4 0 ( 2 0 1 2 ) 5 3 1 - 5 4 1 a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 9 June 2011 Received in revised form 23 March 2012 Accepted 26 March 2012 Keywords: SilverSilver compounds Tooth remineralization Dental caries Biolms Toxicitya b s t r a c t Objective: Silver compounds have been used for their medical properties for centuries and in dentistry for more than a century. The aim of this review is to examine the evidence supporting the therapeutic use of silver in dentistry and the outcomes from the clinical trials, as well as mode of action and biocompatibility. Data sources: Literature was searched using the PubMed database between the year 1966 and 2011, with principle key terms such searching was performed for relevant papers cited in the indices back to the year 1905. Results: In vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence have demonstrated that silver compounds are viable agents for preventing and arresting caries both in the primary and permanent dentition; however they are associated with adverse tooth discolouration and some reports that pulp irritation may occur. Further research has investigated its effectiveness as a dentine desensitiser, root canal disinfectant and even in silver impregnated restorative materials. The mode of action of silver compounds on carious tooth tissues is thought to include inhibition of the demineralization process, as well as an anti-bacterial effect by interference of bacterial cell membranes, cytoplasmic enzymes and inhibition of bacterial DNA replication. Conclusion: Silver compounds have been shown to be an effective anti-caries agent; how- ever, there is an incomplete understanding of how silver compounds prevent caries. Further research is required to help identify its most efcacious use and limitations. # 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Question source : Avanir Pharmaceuticals Issue : Currently, pseudobulbar affect is on line 687 NEUROLOGIC CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFEC TIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY. Avanir Pharmaceuticals is requesting that this condition be reviewed for higher placement, as they believe that their product NUEDEXTA (dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate) capsules is an effective treatment for this condition (see letter) . Pseudobulbar affect ( PBA ) refers to a neurologic disorder characterized by involuntary crying or uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays. PBA occurs secondary to neurologic disease or brain injury . PBA is also known as emotional lability or amitriptyline have been prescribed with moderate efficacy. In 2010, a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PBA. The drug, Nuedexta, was developed and created by Avanir Pharmaceuticals and became availab le on January 31, 2011. The pl acement of PBA was discussed at the HOSC meeting in August, 2011 when the new ICD - 9 code was reviewed. Per the HOSC minutes: \"310.81 (Pseudobulbar affect)...[was]...placed on NO OR MINIMALLY E FFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY rather than the dysfunction lines. Saha felt that these conditions did not have effective treatments and should not be paired with all of the treatments available on the dysfunction lines. \" PBA caused by other conditions, such as MS or strokes, is supposed to be billed first with the underlying diagnosis if one is known. Note that both components of Nuedexta are available in inexpensive, generic form (estimated to be about $20 a month). However, the cost of Nuedexta is estimated to be between $400 to $483 a month.

Concomitant depression or other conditions are covered on the Prioritized List Current Concepts in the Pharmacotherapy of Pseudobulbar Affect Erik P . Pioro Cleveland Clinic, insult, pseudobulbar affect (PBA) consists of uncontrollable episodes of crying or laughter incongruent to the patient's mood. The syndrome has been described by a plethora of names, including pathological laughing and crying, emotional lability, emotionalism and emo-tional incontinence, which hampers efforts to survey published assessments of pharmacological intervention. Still, until quite recently, all treatment has un- avoidably been off-label, chiefly involving antidepressants. Using PBA andother syndrome names as search terms, a PubMed search for English-languagecase reports and therapeutic trials involving at least five patients identified 22 such publications from 1980 through to 2010. Among the seven randomized, double-blind, antidepressant studies with placebo control, two trials assessed106 and 123 subjects, respectively. However, the other five assessed only 12 -28 subjects, and only one of these seven trials (with 28 subjects) measured change in syndrome severity using a validated scale. The three randomized, double-blind studies of dextromethorphan plus quinidine assessed 129, 150 and 326 subjects. Among these studies, two were placebo-controlled and all three used a validated severity scale. Across all placebo-controlled trials, responseto active treatment -either an antidepressant or dextromethorphan /quinidine -has in general been significantly greater than response to placebo, but placebo response has sometimes been substantial, suggesting caution in interpretinguncontrolled findings. In October 2010, dextromethorphan /quinidine re- ceived approval from the US FDA as first-in-class PBA pharmacotherapy. Advocates of a continuing role \u00a9 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd 1077Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a disorder of emo - tional expression characterized by uncontrol - lable outbursts of laughter or crying that lack an appropriate environmental trigger and may be exaggerated or incongruent with the underlying emotional state. It is a distinct neurologic condi - tion associated with various neurologic diseases or brain injuries [1,2]. Although reported preva - lence rates vary greatly, it may be most common in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [3] and stroke [4], where rates as high as 50% or more have been estimated. PBA is also reported in patients with multiple sclerosis [11,12] . Pseudobulbar affect is an added burden to patients who may already be disabled or expe - riencing a reduced quality of life due to their underlying neurologic disorder. Because of the embarrassment associated with an inappropri - ate outburst of emotion, patients' social interac - tion may be impaired [12]. The risk of depression and anxiety symptoms may be increased, and quality of life is often decreased [9,12]. PBA can also interfere with rehabilitation [13]. Although PBA continues to be underdiagnosed and under - treated [14], understanding of the condition has been advancing in recent years. This review will summarize the established knowledge in PBA, as well as recent findings related to its presen - tation, etiology, underlying mechanisms and emerging treatments. Taxonomy of emotional expression disorders The terminology associated with the naming and description of disorders of emotion has been unclear and confusing, and may contribute to the under- and mis-diagnosis of these disorders. The problem is twofold, in that the same or simi - lar disorders have been given multiple names, and the language used to describe the disorders has been inconsistent or misleading. In addition to PBA, symptomatology has been described as affective instability, compulsive laughing or weeping, emotional or affective lability, emo - tional incontinence, emotionalism, Pratt2 and Randolph B Schiffer3 1Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Carmel Medical Center, Department of Neurology, 7 Michal St., Haifa 34362, Israel 2Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Evoked Potentials Laboratory, Haifa, Israel 3PO Box 1566, Santa Fe, NM of uncontrollable outbursts of laughter or crying inappropriate to the patient's external circumstances and incongruent with the patient's internal emotional state. Recent data suggest disruption of cortico-pontine-cerebellar circuits, reducing the threshold for motor expression of emotion. Disruption of the microcircuitry of the cerebellum itself may likewise impair its ability to act as a gate-control for emotional expression. Current evidence also suggests that serotonergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission play key roles. Although antidepressants have shown benefit, the supportive clinical data have often derived from small numbers of patients and unvalidated measures of PBA severity. Dextromethorphan/quinidine, the first FDA-approved PBA medication, is a novel therapy with antiglutamatergic actions. As life expectancy lengthens and the neurologic settings of PBA become more common, the need for treatment can be expected to increase.

Schearon Stewart of Avanir requested that I contact you regarding my experience with Nuedexta in the residential care setti ng. The first thing you should know is that I own stock in nothing. I do not support Avanir, and they do not support me. The second thing is, I do not support new drugs for older people. Those things being said, I DO appreciate and have requested Nue dexta for some of my residents. I have only a small number of residents on this drug (despite my efforts to expand this number), but those few have demonstrated really remarkable improvements in behavior and comfort. Safety and comfort are the most importa nt issues I address in the population I work with. I have seen these people go from continuous tearfulness and confusion to calm in a matter of a few days. They can enjoy their families and fellow residents again. They are not snowed by a drug. They are just clear eyed and peaceful. It's quite remarkable. Getting the drug has been difficult secondary to the need for documentation for efficacy and on label use, as well as a prior authorization. I support the ability to obtain this drug without the ' speed bump' of a prior authorization. I believe it will reduce costs further down the care stream (fewer adverse drug event hospitalizations, etc). I know it has helped my residents, and I would like to see more of my residents on Nuedexta. Streamlining th e process for approval will help improve their lives, as well as the lives of those around them. Thank you very much for your consideration of this medication. Kind regards, Hope Murphy Hope Murphy Consultant Pharmacist Consonus (c) 360 640 9897 12/3 /12 Dear Dorothy Allen & The Health Evidence Review Commission, Hello. My name is Debbra Larson, and I am a RN care manager at a long term care geri - psych nursing care facility (Gracelen Terrace) in Portland Oregon. I am writing to you to express my thoughts on Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) and the role of Nuedexta in treating patients with this condition. I have been working in my current facility for the past 10 years. Gracelen Terrace specializes in providing cares to geriatric pat ients with mood and behavioral disturbances secondary to psychiatric & cognitive disease processes. In the past year I have treated three of these patients with Nuedexta to manage their PBA. I cannot express clearly enough to you, the benefit this medica tion has made in the lives of these patients. Each of these patients has utilized mood stabilizers, antidepressants, anti -anxiety, and antipsychotic medications in an attempt to manage their PBA symptoms. Despite multiple medication trials each of them continued to experience significant episodes of crying, screaming, and inappropriate laughing multiple times daily. Additionally their behavioral expressions were so severe that they often were unable to participate in activities and/or their daily cares. With use of Nuedexta each of these patients experienced significant decline in their level of distress without experiencing many of the side effects identified with use of antipsychotic medications. 2/3 of these patients were also able to have their psyc hoactive medications reduced. Given my exposure and experience with PBA, I highly encourage you to add Nuedexta to your list of approved medications as there are no other medications dedicated to the management of PBA symptoms.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of chronic articular disease, affecting approximately 27 million adults in the United States. The most commonly affected joint is the knee, with prevalence estimates ranging from 12% to 16%. To date, there is no known cure for OA nor is there a disease -modifying agent. Optimal management generally requires a combination of both nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies, and joint replacement surgery or a joint salvage procedure may be considered for selected patients with severe symptomatic OA who have not obtained adequate pain relief and functional i mprovement from medical therapy. Pharmacological therapy generally begins with acetaminophen, followed by nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if sufficient pain relief is not obtained. There is a small risk of systemic adverse effects with NSAIDs . Aspiration of fluid followed by intraarticular injection of a corticosteroid ameliorates pain in some patients, but duration of relief is usually limited to one to three weeks. Additionally, repeated intraarticular injections of corticosteroids have the potential to cause postinjection flare, infection, and progressive, long-term cartilage damage. Recently, viscosupplementation with hyaluronan has been introduced as an alternative intraarticular injection therapy for OA. Hyaluronans are also known as sodi um hyaluronate or hyaluronic acid (HA). H yaluronic acid is a normal component of synovial fluid and cartilage. The viscous nature of the compound allows it to act as a joint lubricant, whereas its elasticity allows it to act as a shock absorber. Hyaluronic products are characterized by their molecular weight, which varies according to the source of the compound and method of preparation. Five HA products are currently marketed in the United (Seikagaku Corporation), and Synvisc\u00ae (Genzyme). Synvisc is a derivative of HA that consists of cross -linked polymers; the compound is referred to as Hylan G -F 20. Hyaluronate preparations have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of pain associated with OA of the knee in patients who have not had an adequate response to nonpharmacological, conservative treatment and simple analgesics. Recent systematic reviews have come to contradictory concl usions regarding the effectiveness of viscosupplementation, and national guidelines vary in their recommendations. Evidence Review There is consistent evidence demonstrating that viscosupplementation results in lower mean pain scores and improves mean function scores a few weeks after treatment. However, the magnitude of benefit may be too small to be clinically important. This evidence is derived from a quantitative synthesis of six meta -analyses performed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual ity in 2007 which included 42 randomized placebo controlled trials and over 5000 patients (Samson 2007) . The authors found that the a verage change in pain score , although consistent and statistically significant, was small, with weighted mean differences i n the range of 1.0 to 22.5 on a 100 point visual acuity scale. While there is no definitive definition of clinical significance, several authors, including Sampson, consider a 20 to 40 point improvement on 100 point pain scales to be clinically significant . The authors also reviewed the five previously published study -level meta -analyses that came to a variety of conclusions regarding the efficacy of viscosupplementation. These ranged from negative to moderately positive to strongly positive. The authors of the Samson review considered only one meta -analysis to have reported data and analysis that fully supported the meta -analysis authors' conclusion. This was also the metaanalysis with a negative conclusion \u2014that the clinical effectiveness of viscosupplementation has not been proven and that viscosupplementation may be associated with a higher risk of adverse events. There is a much greater volume of evidence regarding impact on pain than on function, and many studies did not follow patients b eyond three months. Therefore, the impact of viscosupplementation on eventual recovery of function is uncertain. Compared with intraarticular corticosteroid injection, viscosupplementation appears to confer longer - lasting benefit, but the evidence was cons idered low quality. For comparisons with other treatments, there was insufficient evidence to allow any conclusion. Adverse events occur at a frequency of approximately 2% in single courses of treatment and are primarily transient local reactions, although rare, serious reactions are possible. The rate of adverse events per patient has been shown to increase with repeat courses of treatment, but the only available data were for hylan (high -molecular weight HA). Coverage Guidance: Viscosupplementation for Osteoarthritis of the Knee 10/11/2012 4 Evidence pertaining to issues other than effic acy and safety is of low quality: Available evidence suggests that viscosupplementation may be as effective as NSAIDs (four RCTs) and results in fewer systemic adverse events (two RCTs); in comparison with intraarticular corticosteroids, it has a delayed o nset and longer lasting benefit (nine RCTs plus meta -analysis). Hylan may have a superior benefit compared with that of non -cross -linked HA, but the magnitude of difference is very uncertain and hylan poses a small increase in the risk of adverse events. To date, there is no evidence of a difference in benefit between low and medium molecular weight HA. Younger age may be associated with greater efficacy; evidence pertaining to effectiveness by other patient characteristics and history is lacking. Overall S ummary While the evidence demonstrates that viscosupplementation results in lower mean pain scores and improved mean function scores a few weeks after treatment, the magnitude of benefit may be too small to be clinically important.

Coverage Guidance: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain 10/11/2012 3 SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background Low back pain is the fth most common reason for all physician visits in the United States. Approxi mately one quarter of US adults reported having low back pain lasting at least one whole day in the past three months, and 7.6% reported at least one episode of severe acute low back pain within a 1 -year period. Low back pain is also very costly . Total incremental direct health c are costs attributa ble to low back pain in the US were estimated at $26.3 billion in 1998. In addition, indirect costs related to days lost from work are substantial, with approximately 2% of the US work force compen sated for back injuries each year. Many patients have self -limited episodes of acute low back pain and do not seek medical care. Among those who do seek medical care, pain, disability, and return to work typically improve rapidly in the rst month. However, up to one third of patients repor t persistent back pain of at least moderate intensity one year after an acute episode, and one in five report substantial limitations in activity. Approximately 5% of the people with back pain dis ability account for 75% of the costs associated with low back pain. Many options are available for evaluation and manage ment of low back pain. However, there has been little consensus, either within or between specialties, on appro priate clinical evaluation and management of low back pain. Numerous studies show unexplained, large vari ations in use of diagnostic tests and treatments. Despite wide variations in practice, patients seem to expe rience broadly similar outcomes, although costs of care can differ substantially among and within specialties. Evidence R eview Recommendation #1: In patients with persistent radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, it is recommended that clinicians discuss risks and benefits of epidural steroid injection as an option (weak recommendation, moderate -quality evidence). It is recommended that shared decision -making regarding epidural steroid injection include a specific discussion about inconsistent evidence showing moderate short -term benefits, and lack of long -term benefits. There is insufficient evidence to adequately evalu ate benefits and harms of epidural steroid injection for spinal stenosis. For radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, evidence on benefits of epidu ral steroid injection is mixed. Although some higher -quality trials found epidural steroid injection asso ciated with moderate short -term (through up to 6 weeks) benefits in pain or function, others found no differences versus placebo injection. Reasons for the discrepancies between trials is uncertain, but could be related to the type of comparator treatment, as trials that compared an epidural steroid injection to an epidural saline or local anesthetic injection tended to report poorer results than trials that compared an Coverage Guidance: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain 10/11/2012 4 epidural steroid injection to a soft -tissue (usually interspinous ligament) placebo injection. Regardless of the comparator intervention, there is no convincing evidence that epidural steroids are associated with long -term benefits and most trials found no reduction in rates of subsequent surgery. Although serious complications following epidural steroid injection are rare in clinical trials, there are case reports of paralysis and infections. There is insufficient evidence on clinical outcomes to recommend a specific approach for performing epidural steroid injection , or on use of fluoroscopi c guidance. In addition, insufficient evidence exists to recommend how many epidural injections to perform, though one higher -quality trial found that if an initial epidural steroid injection did not result in benefits, additional injections over a 6 -week period did not improve outcomes. Decisions regarding use of epidural steroid injection should be based on a shared decision -making process that includes a discussion of the inconsistent evidence for short -term benefit, lack of long -term benefit, potential risks, and costs. Patient preferences and individual factors should also be considered. For example, epidural steroid injection may be a reasonable option for short -term pain relief in patients who are less optimal surgery candidates due to comorbidities. There is insufficient evidence to guide specific recommendations for timing of epidural steroid injection, though most trials enrolled patients with at least subacute (greater than 4 weeks) symptoms. Evidence on efficacy of epidural steroid injection for spinal stenosis is sparse and shows no clear benefit, though more trials are needed to clarify effects. Although chymopapain chemonucleolysis is effective for radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, it is less effective than discectomy and is no longer widely available in the United States, in part due to risk of severe allergic reactions. Three trials s uggest that intradiscal steroid injection has similar efficacy to chemonucleolysis , although none were placebo controlled . Recommendation #2: In patients with persistent nonradicular low back pain, facet joint corticosteroid injection, prolotherapy, and intradiscal corticosteroid injection are not recommended (strong recommendation, moderate -quality evidence). Injections and most interventional th erapies for nonradicular low back pain target specific areas of the back that are potential sources of pain, including the muscles and soft tissues (botulinum toxin injection, prolotherapy, and local injections), facet joints (facet joint steroid injection , therapeutic medial branch block, and radiofrequency denervation), degenerated intervertebral discs (intradiscal steroid injection, IDET, and related procedures), and sacroiliac joints (sacroiliac joint injection). There is no convincing evidence from ran domized trials that injections and other interventional therapies are effective for nonradicular low back pain. Facet joint steroid injection, Coverage Guidance: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain 10/11/2012 5 prolotherapy and intradiscal steroid injections are not recommended because randomized trials consistently found them to be no more effective than sham therapies. Recommendation #3: There is insufficient evidence to adequately evaluate benefits of local injections, botulinum toxin injection, epidural steroid injection, intradiscal electrothermal or nonradicular low back pain. For local injections1, there is insufficient evidence to accurately judge benefits because available trials are small, lower -quality, and evaluate heterogeneous populations and interventions. Trials of IDET and radiofrequency denervation reported inconsistent results. There were a small number of higher quality trials, and in the case of radiofrequency denervation, the trials had technical or methodologic shortcomin gs, making it difficult to reach conclusions about benefits . For other interventional therapies, data are limited to one to two small placebo -controlled randomized trials (botulinum toxin injection, epidural steroid injection for nonradicular low back pain , PIRFT and sacroiliac joint steroid injection), or there are no placebo -controlled randomized trials (therapeutic medial branch block, coblation nucleoplasty....or other medications). [Evidence Source ] Overall Summary For radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, evidence on benefits of epidural steroid injection is mixed, with some trials finding moderate short -term benefits and others finding no differences. There is no convincing evidence that epidural steroids are associated with long -term benefits and most trials found no reduction in rates of subsequent surgery . For nonradicular low back pain, there is likewise no convincing evidence that injections and other interventional therapies are effective, while there is consistent evidence that facet joint steroid injection, prolotherapy and intradiscal steroid injections are no more effective than sham therapies.

It may be indicated in is an app ropriate surgical treatment for chronic OME in children over 3 years with who are having their second set of tubes. First time tubes are not an indication for an adenoidectomy. Patients with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with hearing loss should have coverage based on an individualized treatment plan. 1 HEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION (HERC) COVERAGE GUIDANCE : MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION IN CHILDREN DATE: 10/11/2012 Note: Coverage guidance for recurrent acute otitis media is addressed in a separate document . RATIONALE FOR GUIDANCE DEVELOPMENT The HERC selects topics for guideline development or technology assessment based on the following principles: Represents a significant burden of disease Represents i mportant uncertainty with regard to efficacy or harms Represents important variation or controversy in clinical care Represents high costs, significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids) should not be covered for children with children with otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). There should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusion, and if documented persistent hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, referral for tympanstomy surgery may be covered, given short, but not long- term, improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry should be covered for children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer. Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss should have hearing testing covered initially upon diagnosis. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language or developmental delay should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. Adenoidectomy should not be covered at the time of the first pressure equalization tube insertion. Patients with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with hearing loss should have coverage based on an individualized treatment plan.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background Otitis media is one of the most frequent infections in children and is a leading cause of both visits to the physician and use of antibiotics in this population. The direct costs of otitis media are estimated at $3 to 5 billion per year i n the US. Recurrent infections or chronic fluid in the middle ear can cause hearing deficits, and there is concern that in a rapidly developing child, this could lead to language and other developmental pro blems. Pressure equalization (PE) tubes are small plastic or metal tubes that are surgically inserted into the tympanic membrane to allow for drainage of the fluid from the middle ear with the goal of improved hearing . The hope is that if hearing is improv ed, then language and other developments can be optimized. One of the challenges of determining which children require PE tube placement is that not all middle ear disease is associated with hearing loss , and even the presence of a mild to moderate hearing loss from a middle ear effusion does not necessarily translate into later speech or language delays in children. Further, the high rates of spontaneous resolution of both acute otitis media and middle ear effusions, and the fact that most PE tubes only remain in the ear drum for 6- 12 months, may lessen the potential benefit of PE tube insertion. Evidence Review There is evidence that PE tubes decrease the duration of otitis media with effusion (OME) over the first year . In addition, PE tubes provide short -term (three to six month) Coverage Guidance: Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion i n Children 10/11/2012 4 improvements in hearing , but this advantage dissipates by 12 months . Overall, there do not seem to be consistent benefits in language and development as a result of PE tube placement for OME . The most common complication of PE tubes appears to be otorrhea, which can result in increased use of oral or topical antibiotics . Tympanosclerosis and retraction pockets of the t ympanic membrane are also complications of PE tubes , but their clinical significance remains uncertain. Limited evidence suggests that children with PE tubes sustain higher costs in follow -up, in addition to the costs of the procedure itself , without consistent, measurable benefits in language and development. There are no clear risk factors that identify children who should have PE tubes placed. Some evidence suggests that children with poor baseline hearing (i .e., >25 dB) and those in daycare obtain more of a hearing benefit from PE tubes. In addition, there is limited evidence that children with baseline language or other developmental delays and hearing loss may benefit from earlier PE tube placement. Overall, the literature suggests that watchful waiting for at least three months is an appropriate initial step in the management of OME . The literature is less clear on management following this initial three months, with some evidence suggesting that even waiting as long as six months may not have deleterious effects on language and development in many children. In terms of other treatment options, there is no evidence that antihistamines, decongestants or nasal steroids are effective treatments for OME . Adenoidectomy may improve middle ear effusions at six months but does not lead to significant improvements in hear ing or in recurrent acute otitis media. Autoinflation may have some benefits in terms of resolution of effusion but may be difficult to use in young patients who might not be cooperative with the treatment . Oral steroids show short -term benefits for OME but fail to sustain these improvements over the longer term . Oral antibiotics may also improve OME in the short term , but the low quality of the evidence does not allow for definitive conclusions . Prophylactic antibiotics are also modestly effective at decre asing the number of episodes of acute otitis media in children with recurrent disease . There is concern for the development of antibiotic resistance with their chronic use, and despite the modest benefits, their use for recurrent acute otitis media and OME has declined. Guidelines Two guidelines that address the surgical management of OME (a joint guideline produced by the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, and American Academy of Pediatrics [AAFP/AA OHNS /AAP ]; a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE ] guideline produced by the National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Coverage Guidance: Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion i n Children 10/11/2012 5 Health ) provide similar but slightly different recommendations regarding the management of children with OME . Both recommend monitoring children for the first three months of middle ear effusion and evaluating the child's hearing if the effusion remains at three months . However, NICE recommends hearing testing both at the time of initial diagnosi s, and after three months, while t he AAFP/ AAOHN S/AAP guideline recommends hearing testing only after OME has been present for three months, unless there is language delay, learning problems or hearing loss is suspected. In addition, language testing is recommended for any child with a documented hearing loss by the AAFP/ AAOHNS /AAP guideline, but not mentioned by the NICE guideline. In addressing this, the text of the evidence review states the follow ing: \"A proportion of children referred with suspected OME will also have underlying sensorineural or permanent conductive hearing loss. The GDG [Guideline Development Group] wished to emphasize the need to identify any such component.\" Regarding surgical management, t he NICE guideline suggests that any child with persistent OME at three months who has a hearing threshold worse than 25 dB should be referred for PE tubes, and if tubes are contraindicated or not desired, then the child should be offered hearing aids and other educational/behavioral interventions . They note that surgical intervention for some children at hearing loss less than 25 to 30 dB may be considered i f hearing loss would be expected to significantly impact behavior or development . They specifically identify children with Down syndrome and cleft palate as needing comprehensive specialty care and hearing evaluation, but do not make specific recommendations regarding the timing or use of PE tubes . With regard to the hearing loss level, the text of the evidence review states the following: \"Persistent and/or fluctuating OME, resulting in a hearing loss of 25- 30 dBHL or greater may have adverse effects on a child's speech and language development, behaviour, emotional development and school progress. This 25 -30 dBHL value is of necessity somewhat notional. (italics added) Hearing levels fluctuate with time and would not predict the impact precisely even if the hearing history over time were known, because of differing susceptibilities. \" In contrast, the AAFP/ AAOHNS /AAP guideline recommends a risk -based approach, in which children at risk for or with language or other developmental delay should be referred more promptly for PE tubes . In children at low risk for delays, the guidelines recommend watchful waiting and monitoring every three to six months until the effusion disappears and referral if significant hearing loss develops or if language or other developmental delays appear . They divide hearing loss into three classes with different actions recommended for each level: Coverage Guidance: Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion i n Children 10/11/2012 6 Hearing Level Recommended Action 40 dB (moderate hearing loss) Comprehensive audiologic exam and if hearing loss persists at this level, surgery recommended . 21-39 dB (mild hearing loss) Comprehensive audiologic exam. Individualize based on effusion duration, severity of hearing loss, parent/c aregiver preference: can include optimizing listening and learning environment . Repeat hearing testing in 3- 6 months if otitis media with effusion persists and tympanostomy tubes have not been placed. 20 dB (normal hearing) Repeat hearing test in 3 -6 months if otitis media with effusion persists. The guideline states this recommendation is based on RCTs and observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. However, specific citations are not provided that pertain directly to the hearing levels noted above. The text of the guideline does provide citations for the following: \"Asymptomatic OME usually resolves spontaneously, but resolution rates decrease the longer the effusion has been present and relapse is co mmon. Risk factors that make spontaneous resolution less likely include: Onset of OME in the summer or fall season, Hearing loss more than 30- dB HL in the better hearing ear , History of prior tympanostomy tubes , and Not having had an adenoidectomy .\" Overall Summary Pressure equalization tubes likely decrease the duration of middle ear effusion over the first year. They also provide short -term improvement in hearing that dissipates by 12 months , resulting in no long -term benefits in language and development as a result of PE tube placement for OME . There are no clear risk factors that identify children who should have PE tubes placed. Some evidence suggests that children with poor baseline hearing (i.e., >25 dB) obtain more of a hearing benefit f rom PE tubes . Watchful waiting for at least three months and possibly up to six is an appropriate initial step in the management of OME . There is no evidence that antihistamines, decongestants or nasal steroids are effective treatments for OME . Adenoidecto my may improve middle ear effusions at six months but does not lead to significant improvements in hearing or in recurrent acute otitis media. Autoinflation may have some benefits in terms of resolution of effusion, while oral steroids and antibiotics show short -term benefit for OME , but longer term improvement is either not sustained or is uncertain.

Section 7 Previously Discussed Items Puberty Suppression Therapy for Transgender Youth 1 Question: What is the evidence supporting the use of puberty suppression therapy for transgender youth? Question Source : VbBS Issue : The HSC considered the evidence supporting the use of puberty suppression therapy for transgendered youth in August, 2011. This discussion was continued at the VbBS in March, 2012 and again in August, 2012. During the ICD -10 review, gender dysphoria was separated from several inappropriate diagnoses and made into its own line which is in a covered area of the Priorit ized List. Currently, the only treatments on this line are psychotherapy. Advocacy groups for transgendered persons has requested that puberty suppressing therapy be added to this line. The evidence for the benefits of puberty suppression therapy was re view ed at the October, 2011 and March, 2012 meetings. The decision at the March meeting was to add coverage for puberty suppressing therapy for youth; however, later questions from committee members about the safety of this therapy put this decision on hold. At the August, 2012 VbBS meeting, evidence regarding the safety of this type of treatment was reviewed. The decision at that meeting was to have HERC staff summarize all of the evidence of effectiveness for this therapy, and represent this topic at a later meeting for a more informed discussion. There was discussion at the March and the August VbBS meetings about a guideline for puberty suppressing therapy, to include psychiatric evaluation prior to initiation, and ongoing psychiatric care while re ceiving such treatment. Description : Puberty suppressing therapy is started in a child at the onset of biologic puberty to suppress the natural increase in birth -sex hormones which would lead to physical changes which are not consistent with the child's p erceived gender. The goal of this therapy is to delay puberty until the adolescent can clarify which gender he/she identifies with (with the help of psychotherapy). Expert Testimony In August, 2011, TransActive submitted extensive testimony regarding the need for, benefits of, and harms of puberty suppressing therapy. At the October, 2011 HSC meeting and at the March and August 2012 VbBS meetings, testimony was heard from various advocates and experts regarding the need for and effectiveness of this t herapy. Further written testimony has been received from TransActive, in response to HERC staff proposed guideline. \"TransActive staff and advisors have reviewed the evidence summary and the proposed recommendations pertaining to inclusion of coverage f or pubertal suppression treatment in transgender adolescents and we have concerns about only one aspect of the proposed guidelines for pubertal suppression coverage on OHP. We object to the requirement that Puberty Suppression Therapy for Transgender Youth 2 youth continue psychiatric treatment as a prerequ isite for receiving pubertal suppression with GnRH analogues. The degree of counseling, physical examinations, and laboratory evaluations should be individualized to a patient's needs. To summarize our concerns, we believe that requiring transgender yout h to be under psychiatric care in order to receive puberty suppressing treatment exceeds existing professional guidelines, intrudes on the patient/doctor, client/therapist relationship and subjects youth who may have no need for psychiatric care to suffer from the assumption that they are, in some way, \"psychologically disordered\" even though neither they nor their therapist may be of that opinion. It also subjects the youth and their parents to (potentially) unnecessary financial burden.\" Evidence summar y No evidence from NICE, SIGN, or Cochrane available 1) Evidence based reviews a. MED 2012 i. Puberty suppression in gender -questioning children/adolescents 1. Our core sources did not identify any systematic reviews or technology assessments addressing puberty suppression in children or adolescents with gender identity disorder (GID). However, the identified guideline by The Endocrine Society (Hembree 2009) does make recommendations on this point. b. Murad, 2010 i. Systematic review and meta- analysis of impact of hormonal therapy and sex reassignment on health outcomes ii. Included 28 observational studies, N = 1833 participants with GID (1093 male -to-female, 801 female- to male) who underwent sex reassignment that included hormonal therapies. iii. Results: after sex reassignment, 8 0% of individuals with GID reported significant improvement in gender dysphoria (95% CI = 68-89%; 8 studies; I2 = 82%); 78% reported significant improvement psychological CI = 56-94%; 7 studies; I2 = 86%); 80% reported significant improvem ent in of life (95% CI = 72-88%; 16 studies; I2 = 78%); and 72% reported significant improvement in sexual function (95% CI = 60-81%; 15 studies; I2 = 78%). iv. Conclusions: Very low quality evidence suggests that sex reassignment that includes hormona l interventions in individuals with GID likely improves gender dysphoria, psychological functioning and co- morbidities, sexual function and overall quality of life. v. Limitations - uncontrolled studies, all subjective outcomes, co-administered interventions of sex reassignment surgery, psychotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Puberty Suppression Therapy for Transgender Youth 3 c. Elamin, 2010 i. Systematic review of harms of hormone therapy in transgender persons ii. N = 16 uncontrolled studies (very low quality) iii. Conclusions: cross -sex hormone therapies increase serum trigl ycerides in MF and FM and have a trivial effect on HDL -cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in FM. Data about patient important outcomes are sparse and inconclusive. 2) Clinical guidelines a. Endocrine Society, 2009 i. 1.1 We recommend that the diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) be made by a mental health professional (MHP). For children and adolescents the MHP should also have training in child and adolescent developmental psychopathology. ii. 1.2 Given the high rate of remission of GID after the onset of puberty, we recommend against a complete social role change and hormone treatment in prepubertal children with GID. iii. 1.3. We recommend that physicians evaluate and ensure that applicants understand the reversible and irreversible effects of hormone suppre ssion (e.g., GnRH analogue treatment) and cross -sex hormone treatment before they start hormone treatment. iv. 1.4. We recommend that all transsexual individuals be informed and counseled regarding options for fertility prior to initiation of puberty suppress ion in adolescents and prior to treatment with sex hormones of the desired sex in both adolescents and adults. v. 2.1. We recommend that adolescents who fulfill eligibility and readiness criteria for gender reassignment initially undergo treatment to suppress pubertal development. vi. 2.2. We recommend that suppression of pubertal hormones start when girls and boys first exhibit physical changes of puberty (confirmed by pubertal levels of estradiol and testosterone, respectively), but no earlier than Tanner stage s 2-3. vii. 2.3. We recommend that GnRH analogues be used to achieve suppression of pubertal hormones. viii. 2.4. We suggest that pubertal development of the desired opposite sex be initiated at about the age of 16 years, using a gradually increasing dose schedule o f cross -sex steroids. ix. 2.5. We recommend referring hormone -treated adolescents for surgery when 1) the real -life experience (RLE) has resulted in a satisfactory social role change; 2) the individual is satisfied about the hormonal effects; and 3) the individual desires definitive surgical changes. x. 2.6. We suggest deferring surgery until the individual is at least 18 years old. Puberty Suppression Therapy for Transgender Youth 4 Summary There is very poor evidence of the benefit of puberty suppressing therapy for transgendered youth, based on the existing literature. Use of puberty suppressing therapy is based on expert opinion. The Endocrine Society recommends treatment of transgendered youth be treated with puberty suppressing medications at the first physical changes of puberty with GnRH analogues. HSC Staff Recommendations 1) Cover puberty suppressing therapy on the new Gender Dysphoria line with the following guideline a. These changes will be effective with the October, 2014 ICD -10 Prioritized List GUIDELINE XXX GENDER DYSPHORIA Line XXX Hormone trea tment is included on this line only for use in delaying the onset of puberty and/or continued pubertal development with GnRH analogues for gender questioning children and adolescents. This therapy should be initiated at the first physical changes of puber ty, confirmed by purbertal levels of estradiol or testosterone, but no earlier than Tanner stages 2 -3. Prior to initiation of puberty suppression therapy, adolescents must fulfill eli gibility and readiness criteria, and must have a full psychiatric evalu ation. Ongoing ps ychological care is strongly encouraged for continued puberty suppression therapy. 1 THURSDAY , DECEMBER 06, 2012 TRANS ACTIVE RESPONSE TO PUBERTY SUPPRESSION EVIDENCE SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS TransActive staff and advisors have reviewed the evidence summary and the proposed recommendations pertaining to inclusion of coverage for pubertal suppression treatment in transgender adolescents and we have concerns about only one aspect of the proposed guidelines for pubertal suppression coverage on OHP. We object to the requirement that youth continue psychiatri c treatment as a prerequisite for receiving pubertal suppression with GnRH analogues. Our objection is based on the following : 1. The decision whether or not to begin or continue psychiatric therapy should reside with the youth and their therapist. It should not be a \"quid pro quo\" for puberty blocking treatment. 2. This requirement presumes that all transgender youth require ongoing psychiatric care or that ongoing psychiatric care will provide some benefit to them, even if there are no therapist - identified conditions (morbid or co -morbid) present. 3. It places another unnecessary financial strain on families without health insurance coverage for what will be, in many cases, clinically unnecessary and in some cases, detrim ental treatment. 4. It establishes a \"ransom\" (psychiatric counseling) in return for which the adolescent will receive their physician recommended puberty blocking treatment. 5. It creates treatment criteria which exceeds that of the DSM -V (due for release in early 2013), The Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care 7th Versoin . The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) released a statement in May, 2010. It said, in part: \"... the expression of gender characteristics, including identities, that are not stereotypically associated with one's assigned sex at birth is a common and culturally -diverse human phenomenon [that] should not be judged as inherently pathological or negati ve.\" 2 Imposing this requirement on transgender youth would, in effect, perpetuate the notion (in opposition to professional ethical guidelines and care standards) that transgender identity is \"inherently pathological or negative.\" WPATH's Criteria for Pube rty Suppressing Hormones1: 1. The adolescent has demonstrated a long -lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria (whether suppressed or expressed); 2. Gender dysphoria emerged or worsened with the onset of puberty; 3. Any co -existing psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere with treatment (e.g., that may compromise treatment adherence) have been addressed, such that the adoles cent's situation and functioning are stable enough to start treatment; This criteria a ddresses the need for psychiatric evaluation PRIOR to therapist referral to a pediatric endocrinologist for assessment and treatment administration. There is no criteria which mandates ongoing psychiatric care while the youth is receiving pubertal suppression treatment. That decision should, ethically, be one made by the therapist and the client. The only recommended ongoing monitoring or supervision for all youth receiving this treatment is that of a pediatric endocrinologist so they can adjust the treatment as necessary and indicated by the individual developmental needs of the youth. 4. The adolescent has given informed consent and, particularly when the adolescent has not reached the age of medical consent, the parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment and are involved in supporting the adolescent throughout the treat ment process. WPATH Standards of Care, 7 th Version: Tasks Related to Psychotherapy 1. Psychotherapy is not an absolute requirement for hormone therapy and surgery \"A mental health screening and/or assessment is needed for referral to hormonal and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. In contrast, psychotherapy - although highly recommended - is not a requirement. \" 1 World Professional Association for Transgender Health: Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People, 7th Version, July 2012. http://www.wpath.org 3 WPATH Standards of Care, 7th Version: R esponsibilities of Hormone -Prescribing Physicians In general, clinicians who prescribe hormone therapy should engage in the following tasks: 1. Perform an initial evaluation that includes discussion of a patient's physical transition goals, health history, physical examination, risk assessment, and relevant laboratory tests. 2. Discuss with patients the expected effects of feminizing/masculinizing medications and the possible adverse health effects. These effects can include a reduction in fertility. Therefore, reproductive options should be discussed with patients before starting hormone therapy. 3. Confirm that patients have the capacity to understand the risks and benefits of treatment and are capable of making an informed decision about medical care. 4. Provide ongoing medical monitoring, including regular physical and laboratory examination to monitor hormone effectiveness and side effects. 5. Communicate as needed with a patient's primary care provider, mental health professional, and surgeon. 6. If needed, provide patients with a brief written statement indicating that they are under medi cal supervision and care that includes feminizing/masculinizing hormone therapy. Particularly during the early phases of hormone treatment, a patient may wish to carry this statement at all times to help prevent difficulties with the police and other authorities. Depending on the clinical situation for providing hormones (see below), some of these responsibilities are less relevant. Thus , the degree of counseling, p hysical examinations, and laboratory evaluations should be individualized to a patient's needs. To summarize our concerns, we believe that requiring transgender youth to be under psychiatric care in order to receive puberty suppressing treatment exceeds existing professional guidelines, intrudes on the patient/doctor, client/therapist relationship an d subjects youth who may have no need for psychiatric care to suffer from the assumption that they are, in some way, \"psychologically disordered\" even though neither they nor their therapist may be of that opinion. It also subjects the youth and their parents to (potentially) unnecessary financial burden.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of quality of life and psychosocial outcomes Mohammad Hassan Murad*,, Mohamed and Victor M. Montori*,- *Knowledge and Encounter Research Unit, Division of Preventive Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA, Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier de Rouffach, France, \u00a7Mayo Clinic Libraries and -Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, Nutrition, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA Summary Objective To assess the prognosis of individuals with gender identity disorder (GID) receiving hormonal therapy as a part of sex reassignment in terms of quality of life and other self-reported psychosocial outcomes.Methods We searched electronic databases, bibliography of included studies and expert les. All study designs were includedwith no language restrictions. Reviewers working independentlyand in pairs selected studies using predetermined inclusion andexclusion criteria, extracted outcome and quality data. We used arandom-effects meta-analysis to pool proportions and estimate the 95% condence intervals (CIs). We estimated the proportion of between-study heterogeneity not attributable to chance using the I 2 statistic. Results We identied 28 eligible studies. These studies enrolled 1833 participants with GID (1093 male-to-female, 801 female-to-male) who underwent sex reassignment that included hormonaltherapies. All the studies were observational and most lacked con-trols. Pooling across studies shows that after sex reassignment, 80% of individuals with GID reported signicant improvement in gender dysphoria (95% CI studies; I 2= 86%); 80% reported signicant improvement 72-88%; 16 studies;I 2= 78%); and 72% signicant CI = 60-81%; 15 studies; I2= 78%). Conclusions Very low quality evidence suggests that sex reassign- ment that includes hormonal interventions in individuals with GID likely improves gender dysphoria, psychological functioningand comorbidities, sexual function and overall quality of life. (Received 18 April 2009; returned for revision 4 May 2009; nally revised 6 May 2009; accepted 7 May 2009)Introduction Therapy with cross-sex hormones is used as a primary sex reassign-ment intervention or as an adjunct to sex reassignment surgeryin individuals with gender identity disorder (GID). Hormonaltherapies clearly exert a rapid and direct effect on gender specicbehaviours such as aggressiveness, arousal, verbal fluency and visuo-spatial abilities. 1Several studies have reported sex reassignment to be associated with favourable changes in family, psychological and social life, sexual relationships and gender dysphoria, dened as the distress that originates from the difference between one's biologicalsex and one's basic sense of being a male or a female. 2-4 Despite these putative benets, individuals with GID who undergo this transition continue to have high prevalence of psychi-atric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety disorders, aswell as a suicide rate that is higher than that of the general popula-tion. 2,5Hormonal therapies may also be associated with adverse effects that should be considered in addition to other costs and bur- dens of treatments. These adverse events have improved with theuse of newer transdermal preparations and the routine administra-tion of lower doses, 6,7but may continue to be of concern to patients and providers. We sought to systematically review the literature for the best available evidence regarding the benets and risks of hormonaltherapy administered in this context. In this manuscript, we sum- marize the available evidence abou t benets in terms of self-reported outcomes such as the resolution of gender dysphoria and the effectson sexual function, psychiatric comorbidities and quality of life. Methods The report of this protocol-driven systematic review adheres to thestandards for reporting Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE). 8 Eligibility criteria We considered studies to be eligible for this review if they enrolled male-to-female (MF) or female-to-male (FM) individualsCorrespondence: M.

Erwin*, and Victor M. Montori*,\u00a7 *Knowledge and Encounter Research Unit, Division of Preventive Medicine, Mayo Clinic Libraries and \u00a7Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, Nutrition, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA Summary Objective To summarize the available evidence on the cardio- vascular effects of cross-sex steroid use in transsexuals.Methods We searched relevant electronic databases and sought additional references from experts. Eligible studies reported on cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, blood pressure and fasting serum lipids. Data were extracted in duplicate. We usedthe random-effects model to estimate the pooled weighted meandifference (WMD) and 95% condence intervals (CIs).Results We found 16 eligible studies, mostly uncontrolled cohorts of varied follow-up durations (1471 male-to-female (MF)and 651 female-to-male (FM) individuals). In the MF individuals,cross-sex hormone use was associated with a statistically signicant increase in fasting serum triglycerides without changes in the other parameters (WMD = 23 \u00c639 mg/dl; 95% CI = 4 \u00c682-41 \u00c695). In the FM individuals, there was a similar increase of triglycerides(WMD = 31 \u00c635 mg/dl; 95% CI = 7 \u00c653-55 \u00c617) and a density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol )6\u00c609 mg/ dl; 95% \u00c644 to)0\u00c673). There was a statistically signicant but clinically trivial increase in systolic blood pressure(WMD = 1 \u00c674 mmHg; ciated with signicant heterogeneity across studies. There were very few reported cardiovascular events (deaths, strokes, myocardialinfarctions or venous thromboembolism), more commonly amongMF individuals.Conclusions Very low quality evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations of included studies, imprecision andheterogeneity, suggests that cross-sex hormone therapies increaseserum triglycerides in MF and FM and have a trivial effect on HDL-cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in FM. Data about patient important outcomes are sparse and inconclusive. (Received 20 April 2009; returned for revision 4 May 2009; nally revised 8 May 2009; accepted 11 May 2009)Introduction Gender identity disorder (GID) affects individuals preoccupied with their wish to live as members of the opposite sex. Such individ-uals intensely desire to adopt the social role of the other sex or toacquire the physical appearance of the other sex through hormonalor surgical manipulation. 1Sex reassignment therapy seeks to achieve this transition using a multi-modality approach thatoften includes psychological, hormonal and surgical interventions. 2 Men seeking transition to the female sex (MF) generally use oestrogen, antiandrogens (cyproterone acetate, spironolactone) or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonists).Women seeking transition to the male sex (FM) generally usetestosterone. 3 It is plausible that sex steroid use may be associated with potential adverse effects such as acne, venous thromboembolism,atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prostate hyper-plasia; and may cause or exacerbate neoplasia of the prostate, breast and ovaries. 3,4Two large randomized trials characterized the effect of oestrogen-containing hormonal use on cardiovascu-lar risk in women, 5,6and the Coronary Drug Project evaluated this therapy in men post-myocardial infarction.7A recent review reported on the weak available evidence linking testosteroneuse with cardiovascular risk in hypogonadal and eugonadalmen, 8a nding that was echoed in the recently published Endocrine Society guidelines for androgen use in women, in which the panel described limited evidence regarding the cardio- vascular safety of low-dose testosterone use in women withpresumed androgen deciency. 9The different characteristics of the patients and of the hormone schedule in these trials meanthese studies apply only indirectly to sexual steroid use intranssexual individuals. In this systematic review, we sought to summarize the available evidence of the effects of cross-sex hormone use on the cardiovas- cular risk of transsexual individuals. Outcomes of interest were cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, fasting serumlipid fractions and blood pressure.

CG_Trans09 Objective: The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for endocrine treatment of transsexual persons. Participants: An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a metho dologist, and a medical writer. Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system todescribe the strength of recommendations and thequality of evidence, which was low or very low . Consensus Process: Committees and members of The Endocrine Society , European Society of Endocrinology, European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology ,Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, and WorldProfessional Association Transgender Healthcommented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.Conclusions: Transsexual persons seeking to develop the physical characteristics of the desired gender require a safe, effective hormone regimen that will 1) suppress endogenous hormone secretion determinedby the person' s genetic/biologic sex and 2) maintain sex hormone levels within the normal range for the person's desired gender. A mental health professional (MHP) must recommend endocrine treatment and participate in ongoing care throughout the endocrinetransition and decision for surgical sex reassignment.The endocrinologist must confirm the diagnostic criteria the MHP used to make these recommendations.Because a diagnosis of transsexualism in a prepubertalchild cannot be made with certainty, we do notrecommend endocrine treatment of prepubertalchildren. W erecommend treating transsexual adolescents (Tanner stage 2) by suppressing puberty with GnRH analogues until age 16 years old, after which cross-sex hormones may be given. W esuggest suppressing endogenous sex hormones, maintainingphysiologic levels of gender-appropriate sex hormonesand monitoring for known male-to-female; RLE,real-life experience.Section 8 Guidelines Menstrual Bleeding Disorders 1 Question : Should guideline note 44, menstrual bleeding disorders, be modified? Question source : DMAP Issue : From DM AP: This is feedback from DMAP regarding the use of the Hysterectomy Guideline Note 44. I'm following up on the use of the Hysterectomy Guideline Note 44 when reviewing requests for prior authorizations. Many of these cases must be reviewed at the Administrative level through the Medical Management Committee because the medical documentation does not meet the coverage criteria for patient hi story of anemia as defined as having a hemoglobin less than 10 prior to iron therapy. Quite often we find that the client may have been started on iron supplements before they drop below a hemoglobin of 10 because they are \"at risk\" related to chronic bloo d loss. It is rare to find a medical record that the client had an acute blood loss resulting in a hemoglobin of less that 10 that was related to just a menstrual bleeding disorder. Most of the cases that are presented before the Medical Management Committee for admin review meet all other criteria in that guideline and the medical justification is present for approval. At some point in the future when these guidelines are re -reviewed and/or updated can the criteria for a hemoglobin of less than 10 be revi sited? As a side question for clarification...That guideline note includes the need for additional documentation to show B) Negative preoperative pregnancy test unless patient has been previously sterilized and C) Nonmalignant cervical cytology, if cervix i s present. I am wondering what the intent of those requirements are in the Guideline Note. I have not found them to be necessary in my reviews for authorization of hysterectomies related to menstrual bleeding disorders. While I realize that there are occasions when a woman may experience bleeding during a pregnancy wouldn't the criteria in (A) of this guideline suggest that the client would not be pregnant (particularly after a 6 month trial of hormonal treatment)? Would a practitioner perform endometrial sampling if the client was suspected of being pregnant? Is there a history to the requirement of a preoperative pregnancy test? As for the cytology requirement, are there circumstances in which the uterus is present (thus the request for hysterectomy) and the cervix is not present? Is there a reason to not perform a hysterectomy if the cervical cytology is malignant (in which case, I would assume that the condition falls on another line and does not have a Guideline Note for coverage criteria)? Clarificati on re: the history and intent of those requirements in the guideline note will help me provide information and training to providers, plans, and DMAP staff. Menstrual Bleeding Disorders 2 Expert input : Drs. Michelle Berlin and Sally Wentross (OB/Gyn consultants for the ICD -10 convers ion) Both agreed that \"evidence of anemia\" without a specific number would be fine in the guideline, and probably an improvement as most providers would start iron therapy before the hemoglobin level fell to 10. However, both felt that the pregnancy test requirement was prudent and standard of care. Additionally, the requirement for negative cervical cytology was considered necessary, as it would determine the type of procedure done (e.g. simple vs. radical hysterectomy). Recommendation : 1) Change guideli ne note 44 to read as below: GUIDELINE NOTE 44, MENSTRUAL BLEEDING DISORDERS Line 446 Endometrial ablation or hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women may be indicated when all of the following are documented (A -C): A) Patient h istory of (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5): 1) Excessive uterine bleeding evidence by (a and b): a) Profuse bleeding lasting more than 7 days and repetitive periods at less than 21- day intervals b) Anemia due to acute or chronic blood loss (hemoglobin less than 10) prior to iron therapy 2) Failure of hormonal treatment for a six -month trial period or contraindication to hormone use (oral contraceptive pills or patches, progesterone -containing IUDs, injectable hormone therapy, or similar) 3) No current medication use tha t may cause bleeding, or contraindication to stopping those medications 4) Endometrial sampling performed 5) No evidence of treatable intrauterine conditions or lesions by (a, b or c): a) Sonohysterography b) Hysteroscopy c) Hysterosalpingography B) Nega tive preoperative pregnancy test result unless patient has been previously sterilized C) Nonmalignant cervical cytology, if cervix is present Prenatal Genetic Testing Issue Summary 1 Question : What types of prenatal testing should be covered on the Prioritized List? Question source: OHP Managed Care Medical Directors, HERC Staff Issue: New microarray testing has been proposed for routine testing for women with positive maternal serum screening or advanced maternal age for prenatal diagnosis. This topic has come up at various Medicaid managed care plans and was also brought to the HERC's attention by Kerry Silvey, chair of the Genetics Advisory Committee. Ms. Silvey has indicated that publications supporting this type of testing are not yet published. Currently, on the Prioritized List there is an algorithm and test guideline for non- prenatal genetic testing, but nothing for prenatal genetic testing. This offered the opportunity t o review what are appropriate genetic tests to offer in the prenatal setting. The Medicaid Evidence- based Decisions (MED) project staff were asked to complete a Participant Request to assist Oregon in determining the level of evidence available for prenatal genetic testing. They produced 2 reports, the first identified high quality evidence based guidelines for prenatal care, the second looked at more specific questions and newer diagnostic services. Phase 1 found the following Table 1.

Any of the following, based on the woman's choice: First- or second - trimester serum marker assessment, translucency measurement, basic and comprehensive trimester ultras assessment, first - trimester chorionic villus sampling and second- trimester amniocentesis. If first trimester screening is elected: second- trimester serum AFP screening and/or US should be offered to screen for open neural tube defects.

Discussion of type of guideline envisioned 2) Bring the suggested guideline back to a future meeting for further discussion APRIL 2012 / MANAGED CARE 19EVIDENCE REVIEW Current clinical guidelines recommend first-trimester screening for Down syn-drome using a battery of biomarker blood tests in combination with nuchal trans-parency testing by ultrasound imaging. Uponreceiving a positive result (i.e., high risk) fromthese first-trimester tests, the woman may becounseled to undergo a similar biomarker test,which, if positive, may be followed by amnio-centesis (sampling surroundingthe fetus in tissue cells in utero), de-pending on the week of gestation, to confirmthe result. Invasive testing carries a risk of miscarriage. Women and their physicians have great inter-est in a more effective noninvasive test. Sequenom, Inc. located in San Diego, Calif. has developed the MaterniT21 test (formerlycalled the SensiGene Trisomy 21 test), a DNA-based, first-trimester screening assay for Downsyndrome. The test uses what the company calls\"fetal nucleic acid technology\" to detect andisolate circulating fetal DNA from a maternalblood sample. Repeated parallel sequencing candetect an excess of chromosome 21 DNA offetal origin, which indicates trisomy 21. The company asserts that circulating fetalDNA can be obtained from a maternal blood sample very early in pregnancy (as early as 10weeks, though the window for administeringthe test is broad) and could benefit pregnantwomen by helping rule out trisomy 21 abnor-malities and thereby avoid more invasive test-ing. Therefore, women on whom the blood testwas performed could have better informationmuch earlier in pregnancy and without risk ofmiscarriage to enable earlier informed decisionmaking. Perspectives and predictions According to the manufacturer, the Mater- niT21 assay detects and isolates circulating fetalDNA from a maternal blood sample to screenfor trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) as early as 10weeks into pregnancy with purportedly veryhigh sensitivity and specificity. The test could enable women with a negative result to avoid further invasive screening withits attendant risk of miscarriage, which couldhave great appeal to patients and their clini-cians. This test has potential to become a standard screening procedure; however, to date, clinicaltrials have studied the test only in high-riskpopulations (women over the age of 35). T oevaluate the true benefit of this blood test as ascreening test for trisomy 21, trials are neededto evaluate the test in a cross-section of thepopulation at large (e.g., women with normalrisks and low risks as well as high risk; womenof varying ages). The company launched the MaterniT21 test in late 2011 as a laboratory-developed test andinitially focused on dissemination in more than20 major metropolitan markets; the test couldbe available as a commercial test kit by early2013. Other entities are developing a similar test, but none of these tests are expected to be on themarket before 2014.

Reimbursement issues Typically, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medic- aid Services (CMS) does not permit coverage ofscreening tests unless Congress passes a separatestatute for coverage of a specific screening test. In2006, however, Medicaid services for pregnant womenwere extended; CMS required states to provide preg-nancy-related services, including prenatal care andservices for conditions that might complicate preg-nancy or medical conditions that might threaten thecarrying of the fetus to full term or safe delivery.Mandatory services that Medicaid must provide in-clude laboratory tests and various imaging tests, aswell as family planning services. Individual states maydecide to cover other services that are important toprenatal health; thus, the scope of what is provided de-pends on the state in which a woman on Medicaid re-sides. Thus, the trisomy 21 test might be considered for coverage under that statute. Medicaid payment ratesare, however, typically lower than Medicare nationalaverage payment rates. CMS does have coding in placefor all the screening tests currently used for prenatalscreening. Excerpted with permission from ECRI Institute's database of Health Technology Forecast Reports.

In addition, the MaterniT21 test is not associated with the same riskof miscarriage as standard screening procedures. Time to early adoption: (5 - Adoption occurring now)The MaterniT21 test is currentlyperformed as a laboratory-developed test through Sequenom, Inc. located in SanDiego, Calif. The companylaunched the MaterniT21 laboratory-developed versionof the test in late 2011 andplans to apply for premarketapproval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration inmid-2012.Health impact: (4 - Substantial) This test could benefit pregnant women by helpingrule out a trisomy 21 abnormality, and a negativeresult could help women avoid more invasive test-ing (i.e., chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis)that poses a risk of miscarriage. Therefore, womenin whom the blood test is performed could receivebetter information much earlier in pregnancy with-out risk of miscarriage to enable earlier informeddecision making about whether to undergo addi-tional invasive testing. Financial impact: (3 - Moderate)The company expressed its intention to price the test be-tween $1,500 and $3,000, inkeeping with the price for inva-sive trisomy 21 testing, accord-ing to the developer. As an add-on test to existing screeningtests, it will add to costs forwomen who test positive and re-quire confirmatory testing. If ithelps to avoid invasive testing inwomen whose test result is neg-ative, however, it may be costneutral.Process impact: (3 - Moderate)Adoption and diffusion of the MaterniT21 test will likelyhave no major impact on hospital operations but will havesome impact on outpatient clinical services of obstetricpractices and clinical laboratories if the test's sensitivity and specificity are equivalent to those of amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Women who are screened and receive a negative result could elect to not undergo invasive testing, thereby reducing the demand for amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling testing.
