Our Magic Food Mixes contain Ayurvedic herbs such as Triphala, Turmeric, Brahmi, Neem and Guggul and other healthy substances. They have been created to beat the daily life complaints and to promote a healthy lifestyle. Just thought I would let you know that your herbs are very effective. I am a herbalist and take a great interest in the quality of the herbs that I use in my client practice and also for my own personal needs. I have been using a range of your herbal capsules for over 3 months now and think they are superb. Please can I order.. Richard S, Scotland Your Chyawanprash is the best Chyawanprash that I have had. I have tried many of the other brands and they do not even come close to yours. It tastes lovely and I can see the beneficial effects...it's now a fixture in my daily routine.
