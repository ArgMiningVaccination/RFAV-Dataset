Many of these therapies arise from alternative medical systems, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, which have long histories of use across the world. As technology has enhanced our global connec-tions over the past three decades, therapies from alter-native systems have become increasingly available in the West and now present challenges to conventional care and increase the possibilities for symptom management. The world of CAM is vast (estimates count thousands of therapies and products from many systems of care; see http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam), and the collection of research evidence supporting the effective-ness and safety of CAM therapies for the management of OA is in its infancy. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has categorized CAM therapies as mind-body therapies, natural products, manipulative and body-based approaches, and other practices, including energy therapies. CAM therapies are considered complementary when combined with conventional treatment methods and al- ternative when used in place of conventional treatment. Alternative medical systems are whole systems of care that exist outside of conventional Western medicine.

DOI: 10.1097/NOR.0b013e31824fce6eOVERVIEW: Conventional medical treatment of osteoarthritis often successfully relieves pain but can also produce adverse gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects, especially with long-term use. Hence, many patients use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to prevent, control, and manage the pain of osteoarthritis. The author reviews the evidence on the ef cacy and safety of several CAM therapies often used for osteoarthritis management, including mind-body thera-pies, supplements, and body-based treatments. KEYWORDS: complementary and alternative medicine, osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA), an increasingly prevalent public health problem, affects the physical functioning and quality of life of millions of adults in the United States. A disease that causes progressive damage to joint cartilage, OA pro-duces pain, joint infl ammation, and stiffness with even- tual restriction of movement. The prevalence of clinical OA has continued to increase over the past decade, with estimates approaching 27 million adults in the United States alone. 1 OA affects individuals worldwide. Many studies report a higher incidence in women and increas-ing prevalence with age. 1 Given the intense symptom burden of OA and the resulting possibility of disability, costs related to this illness are immense. OA affects physical and social functioning, well-being, productivity, and self-image, all of which signi cantly impact quality of life. Current conventional pharmacologic treatment, often success-ful in relieving pain, has serious adverse effects in the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems, especially with long-term use. Hence, OA patients continue to search for alternative treatments while a cure remains elusive. This paper provides an overview of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies used to pre-vent, control, and manage OA, as well as evidence for their ef cacy and \u0081 Number 2 Content from the American Journal of Nursing .

Patients are very much involved in the changing health care arena as they seek relief from the symptoms of chronic illnesses. Prevalence of CAM Use Current estimates of CAM use in the United States, based on the 2002 and 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data, range from 34% to 76%, depending on the therapies included in the de nition of CAM and the population studied. 2-5 The number of participants who'd used at least one CAM therapy in the year preced-ing the NHIS interview increased from 2002 to 2007, with use higher among individuals affected by cancer in both years. The number of participants who used CAM ranged from 35% to 39% in 2002 and increased to 37% to 44% in 2007 in the noncancer and cancer popula-tions, respectively, demonstrating a continuing increase in CAM use over time. 4,6 Higher rates of CAM use for a variety of conditions were reported in 2007 for acu-puncture, massage therapy, meditation, and yoga, among others. 2 The greatest numbers of CAM users were among middle-aged, well-educated white women, and people experiencing chronic illness and bother-some symptoms. 4,6,7 Among people with arthritis, data revealed, the pro- portion of respondents who'd used CAM was signi - cantly higher than among those without it (41% and 34.6%, respectively). 5 In this population, herbs, supple- ments, and vitamins (24%) and mind-body therapies (21%) were most often used for treatment purposes, fol-lowed by chiropractic (9.4%) and massage (almost 5%). 5 Limitations of these data include the datedness of the information and the inclusion of multiple types of rheu-matic diseases, preventing a determination of CAM use speci cally for OA. Other estimates of use range from 59% to 90% but are often limited by sample location and differences in the de nition of CAM. 8-10 Among people with OA, differences in patterns of use have also been reported by ethnicity.11,12 Among the 80% of CAM users noted by Katz and Lee, most used dietary practices (71.5%), mind-body therapies (42%), topical products (38%), herbs and supplements (32.9%), and manipulative and body-based methods (21.4%). 12 African Americans were most likely to use CAM overall, speci cally prayer and topical products, and Asian Americans used alternative medical systems, supple-ments, and manipulation. Greater use of herbs, mag-nets, and copper has been reported by Hispanics, and the use of supplements is more prevalent among non-Hispanics. 11 Further study is needed to illuminate CAM usage patterns. In addition, information is needed on which CAM therapies are used speci cally for arthritis symptom management, as well as the bene ts and risks of use. Current data, however, do provide insight into pat- terns of CAM use among individuals with OA and high-light the need for updated population-speci c studies that use clear and consistent CAM de nitions. It is evi- dent that people with OA are using CAM therapies to manage symptoms such as pain and related problems, minimize adverse effects of pharmacologic treatment, and prevent disabilities arising from OA that affect functioning and quality of life. 13 It is also important to recognize that skepticism about conventional medical care may prompt people to seek CAM therapy, especially younger people with OA. 8 Literature Review I conducted an extensive literature review in late 2010 and early 2011 to obtain research studies on CAM thera-pies and OA. The databases and resources I searched include the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid SP, Biological Abstracts, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, Health Reference Center Academic, and the Cochrane Collaboration's systematic reviews, as well as the Web sites of ClinicalTrials.gov, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, http://online.statref.com [the American College of Physicians' Information and Education Resource], the Mayo Clinic, MD Consult, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the NCCAM, and Natural Standard. Keywords used in the search included but were not limited to osteoarthritis, arthritis (knee, hip, hand), tradi- tional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, yoga, qigong, t'ai chi, herbal and dietary supplements, mind-body, relaxation, guided imagery, herbal therapy, acupuncture, pain man-agement, massage, energy therapies (therapeutic touch, healing touch, Reiki), alternative medicine and therapies, complementary medicine and therapies, CAM, hypnosis, and vitamins . I restricted the search to articles pub- lished in a 10-year period and then removed that restric-tion for studies on energy therapies when that search yielded few studies. I also limited the search to articles published in English and excluded studies that exam-ined only patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mind-body Therapies Yoga, an ancient practice originating in Central Asia that is used in Ayurvedic medicine, is a feasible inter-vention for people with OA, although studies are limited and focus primarily on those with knee involvement. 14 FIGURE 1.

Hatha yoga includes varying intensities of physical movement, while yoga nidra is still and meditative. Yoga incorporates a spiri-tual component through meditation coordinated with movements, breathing, and stillness. Although yoga has existed for thousands of years, re- search on its use in medicine is relatively recent and sparse. Haaz and Bartlett found 10 yoga studies pub-lished in the past 30 years, six in individuals with RA and four in those with OA or both OA and RA. 15 Using a scoring system for study quality based on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' recom- mendations, 16 Haaz and Bartlett found that scores for the four OA studies varied from 3 to 5. The range of scores possible was 0 to 8, from low to high quality, for four categories (study design, sample size, intervention, and analysis). Recent work by Ulger and Yagli noted that yoga had a positive effect on gait and balance among women with OA and low-back pain, although they acknowledged that their small sample size (N /H11005 27) limits generalizability. 14 Pilot research (N /H11005 7) in treat- ing symptoms of knee OA indicated that an eight-week program of Iyengar yoga, a style of hatha yoga devel-oped by B.K.S. Iyengar that uses supportive props such as blankets and belts, resulted in signi cant reductions in pain and stiffness and increased physical functioning as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. 17 The authors further noted that yoga was feasible for older patients (older than 50 years of age) with OA, the majority of whom were also obese. Bukowski and colleagues also noted functional changes and improvement in quality of life with both yoga and stretching and concluded that more study was needed. 18 Raub, summarizing early research studies, stated that yoga may increase strength and fl ex- ibility in arthritis patients.19 Evidence for the use of yoga in OA is limited. There's a lack of studies speci cally on OA, but those that have been conducted indicate that its feasibility and safety are good. Future studies should include patients of di-verse ethnic groups and ages and use well-described yoga interventions that can be replicated in further studies, thereby increasing the generalizability of the results. Data from studies conducted abroad (which may be less accessible to some researchers because of their language of publication or a lack of information on the study participants) should be examined. However, studies do indicate that CAM practices that include physical movement and stretching, as yoga does, in-crease fl exibility and muscle strength, thereby promot- ing joint support. 20-22 In addition, yoga may decrease body fat and improve physical tness, which are known to be preventive factors for OA. T'ai chi ch'uan, an ancient martial art originating in traditional Chinese medicine, has received increased attention recently to determine its effects on physical functioning and pain. T'ai chi is a movement practice that facilitates the balanced fl ow of energy and uses meditation and breathing for health promotion and management of symptoms. Among older women with OA (N /H11005 82), t'ai chi increased endurance during knee fl exion and extension and bone mineral density while also decreasing fear of falling. 23 Signi cant improve- ments in pain related to knee OA, physical functioning, and gait following a six-week t'ai chi intervention in an-other study (N /H11005 40) also suggests that it has bene cial effects for gait kinematics (such as stride length) among older adults. 24 Evidence for the use of t'ai chi ch'uan in OA. That similar ndings are reported in the literature suggest there is a moderate level of evidence supporting the use of t'ai chi to manage pain and improve functioning in individuals with knee OA. 25-28 Further research is needed to deter- mine the most effective t'ai chi protocols according to age, ethnicity, and sites of OA. Energy Therapies Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, and Healing Touch, three energy therapies, focus on balancing energy fl ow through a series of techniques applied above and di-rectly to the body. Based on the premise that an ener-getic bio eld surrounds and penetrates the physical body, energy therapies aim to remove blockages that are thought to cause disease and hinder healing. Therapeutic Touch was developed in the 1970s by Dolores Krieger and includes three levels of practice; Healing Touch, de-veloped in the 1980s by Janet Mentgen, includes ve lev- els of preparation and is endorsed by the American Holistic Nurses Association; and Reiki, a practice from Japan, was developed by Mikao Usui in 1922 and incor-porates the use of symbols in the energy treatment. My review of the literature on the effects of energy therapies on OA revealed a paucity of research studies. This may refl ect a lack of funding support and meth- odologic dif culties such as the absence of instruments able to measure energy, questions concerning placebo effects, and the infl uence of the practitioner's presence and intention on the patient's reported results. However, there is signi cant, ongoing advancement in the science of energy healing by the members of, for example, the International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine. Early studies on the use of Therapeutic Touch for OA noted improved functional ability, decreased pain and distress, and improved mood. 29-31 The study authors noted limitations includ- ing sample sizes and study designs and cited the need for further research. Evidence for the use of Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, and Healing Touch in OA has not been established. Further research using rigorous scienti c methods, instruments that measure energy, and larger sample sizes is needed. Acupuncture, used for millennia in traditional Chinese medicine, has been the subject of intense re-search over the past two decades and is now a popular therapy across the globe. Using the process of system-atic research reviews, Ernst reported that acupuncture overall has an encouraging risk-benefit ratio. 32 Acupuncture protocols vary widely across studies, how-ever, complicating the ability to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Few studies compare acupuncture with or evaluate its effectiveness in combination with physical therapy (PT), an often prescribed and effective nonpharmacologic intervention for OA. Thus, further \u0081 Number 2 Content from the American Journal of Nursing . Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.study is recommended to determine and compare the effects of acupuncture used as an adjuvant to PT and medication regimens. 33 As a CAM therapy with a long history of effective use in the East, acupuncture works by improving the fl ow of energy, known as qi, and removing energy blockages re-lated to disease processes. 34,35 Thus, it differs from Western medicine in its theoretical view of OA pathol-ogy and in treatment methods. Maa and colleagues state that the mechanism of OA of the knee, for example, \"is a slowdown of Qi, the consequence of ineffective interac-tion between the liver, spleen and kidney networks,\" cre-ating joint disease and dysfunction. 34 Therefore acu- puncture treatment, whether performed as needling, pressure, heat, or electrical stimulation, is guided by the ancient depictions of the meridians (energy channels) throughout the body and the assessment of blockages by the practitioner. Data do support the use of acupuncture in the multimodal treatment of patients with knee OA. 34 Rigorous randomized control trials (RCTs) of vary- ing sample sizes have documented that acupuncture confers signi cant improvements in pain, functioning, and quality of life in patients with OA, although some ndings have been dif cult to interpret. Manheimer and colleagues, in their 2007 review of 11 RCTs on acupunc-ture in 2,821 patients with knee OA of a mean duration of ve years or more, found no clinical differences be- tween real and \"sham\" acupuncture, but did nd clini- cal relevance when acupuncture was compared with usual care. 36 These improvements were maintained at six months. The authors suggest there is a possible pla-cebo effect requiring further study and that acupunc-ture has \"a genuine biological effect, suggested by the small short-term improvements in pain and function compared with sham.\" No serious adverse effects were reported, which has been supported by more extensive subsequent reviews. 37 Manheimer and colleagues' 2010 systematic review indicates that as a treatment for knee or hip OA, acupuncture, when compared with sham acupuncture, being on a waiting list for treatment, or usual treatment, may result in small improvements in pain and physical functioning at eight weeks and for up to 26 weeks after treatment, with minor and infrequent adverse effects such as bruising and bleeding at the nee-dle insertion site. 37 Witt and colleagues, in a study using a three-group design (N /H11005 3,635) for a 15-week series of acupuncture treatments for hip and knee patients, reported signi - cant effects and positive outcomes that lasted through-out the ve-month study period. 38 Earlier, Berman and colleagues described similar ndings when \"true\" acu- puncture was compared with sham acupuncture and patient education. 39 In contrast, Tsang and colleagues found no signi cant differences in pain scores or anal- gesic use between groups receiving true and sham acu-puncture following knee arthroplasty; all participants also had PT, and improved range of motion was re-ported. 40 However, the sample size was small (N /H11005 30). Previous studies have also reported small improvements in pain or a lack of signi cance when comparing study groups. 41 I found one review on the safety of acupunc- ture, which noted that no adverse events were reported in 12 RCTs. 42 Evidence for the use of acupuncture in OA is moderate for pain relief. Wide variability existed in study designs, sample sizes, treatment protocols, and the control groups used for comparison. Systematic reviews have documented reduction of pain, primarily among pa-tients with knee involvement. 32, 33, 43, 44 Further study is needed to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on out-comes in patients with OA at other sites, in combination with standard treatment for OA, and on pain manage-ment and function over time. More data are also needed to determine adequate dosing (how many treatments are needed and how often), the infl uence of provider contact, and the effects on physiologic processes. Natural Products Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are consid- ered \"components to the extracellular matrix of articu-lar cartilage\" and have been used for the prevention and management of OA for more than 40 years based on the premise that the disease is caused by a de ciency. 45 It is hypothesized that glucosamine may repair cartilage by stimulating synthesis of chondrocytes. These products have been the focus of intense study over the past 15 years, with inconsistency still noted in results from RCTs, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. Recent results from a comprehensive meta-analysis (10 RCTs; N /H11005 3,803 patients with OA of the knee, hip, or both) concluded that glucosamine and chondroitin, used alone or in combination, did not decrease joint pain or infl uence joint-space narrowing over time. 46 The au- thors stressed that their use should not be recommended to new patients. Results from other meta-analyses and reviews indi- cate that the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin range from none to moderate. Lee and colleagues, who measured radiologic outcomes in six RCTs, reported positive effects of glucosamine or chondroitin on joint-space narrowing over two to three years of use. 47 Vlad and colleagues found glucosamine hydrochloride inef-fective but were unable to rule out the possibility of ef-fects from glucosamine sulfate. 48 In contrast, Vangsness and colleagues concluded that prior studies have pro-vided support for some level of ef cacy in managing symptoms of OA and altering disease progression, al-though the results were inconsistent. 45 The multisite Glucosamine-Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial showed a signi cant effect in individuals with severe OA. Follow-up study, however, has failed to con rm ef- fects on joint-space narrowing. 49 An earlier Cochrane review, one of the most comprehensive meta-analyses (N /H11005 2,570), also reported 28% and 21% improvements in OA pain and functioning, respectively; however, the researchers wrote that when including only \"the best de-signed studies,\" bene ts were no longer seen. 50 With re- gard to use of chondroitin, Reichenbach and colleagues found that effects disappeared when studies with large sample sizes and strong designs were combined for analysis. 51 Evidence for the use of glucosamine and chondroitin in OA is inconsistent. Long-term trials are needed. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses support a posi-tive safety pro le. Ongoing research, the Long-Term NOR200291.indd 118 31 \u0081 Number 2 119 Content from the American Journal of Nursing . Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Pycnogenol (pine bark extract), a supplement studied in knee OA, has shown signi cant effects in de- creasing pain and stiffness and improving functioning. Two studies (N /H11005 35; N /H11005 100) nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drug use over a two-to-three-month period, thus reducing the severity of the unwanted adverse effects of those drugs. 52, 53 Other natural products used for OA include devil's claw, cat's extracts, mineral supplements, and an-tioxidants. 54-56 Brien and colleagues concluded after re- viewing six studies on MSM and DMSO (N /H11005 681) that no de nitive conclusions could be made, although some positive outcomes were reported.55 Improvement in pain was noted in two of the four DMSO studies, al-though questions about the studies' methodology were raised. In contrast, the MSM studies provided \"positive but not de nitive evidence that MSM is superior to pla- cebo in the treatment of mild to moderate OA of the knee.\" Ameye and Chee conducted a systematic review of the evidence on nutraceuticals and functional foods for the management of OA. They included 53 RCTs explor-ing the bene ts of lipids, vitamins, minerals, plant ex- tracts, and other supplements. 54 Using a best-evidence synthesis, 18 of the functional ingredients studied dem-onstrated ef cacy in at least one clinical trial. The authors concluded that nutrition may improve OA symptoms and recommended further study of its effects on disease prevention and progression. Evidence for the use of pycnogenol in OA is good but moderate or lacking for other plant extracts . No evidence exists for most products, but there is good support for pycnogenol and ASU and moderate evidence for MSM and SKI306X. Body-Base d Manipulative Therapies Massage has been a well-researched CAM therapy for stress relief and relaxation in both healthy and chroni-cally ill individuals. Studies have focused predomi-nantly on low-back pain and have reported ef cacy, al- though massage's mechanisms of action are as yet unclear. 57-59 Fewer studies have focused on patients with arthritis. Perlman and colleagues noted signi cant changes in pain, stiffness, and physical function follow-ing massage in people with knee OA. 60 In another study, the use of essential oil with massage resulted in reduced pain and improved function in older adults with moder- ate-to-severe knee pain. 61 No systematic reviews on massage therapy for knee OA were found, as was also reported by Jamtvedt and colleagues. 62 A comprehen- sive meta-analysis published by Moyer and colleagues provided insight into physiological and psychosocial mechanisms of massage therapy and made interesting conclusions related to dosage and pain effects. 59 Although the study wasn't speci cally focused on OA, the authors' conclusion that massage works by both physiological and psychological mechanisms may hold relevance for this population that has pain as its pre-dominant symptom. They noted differences between the effects of single and multiple doses of massage. Single-dose massage resulted in decreased anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate as compared with the control group. However, results were inconsistent re-garding the effects on the parasympathetic nervous sys-tem and pain assessment. Multiple-dose massage, while also lowering blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety, also decreased depression and pain on assessment. Several researchers have investigated the safety of mas-sage and indicated that there is a need to understand the effects of various approaches and protocols and therapist training. 59, 63 Evidence for the use of massage therapy in OA is moderate for low-back pain and inconclusive for pain in the knee and at other sites. Research using strong meth-odology in the OA population is warranted. Implicati ons And Conclusions Much variation exists in the evidence supporting the use of CAM therapies for OA. It's clear that symptom man-agement should be multimodal and include nonphar-macologic therapies along with routine pharmacologi-cal treatment. Focusing on comorbid symptoms is also critical to improving function and overall quality of life. CAM therapies and other nonpharmacologic ap-proaches play roles in managing pain and perhaps the insomnia, depression, and anxiety that can result. 6, 59, 64-70 Effective therapies for these comorbid symptoms are es-sential for the holistic management of OA. Thus, one may conclude that further study is needed, as are clear and consistent de nitions of the therapies considered to be complementary or alternative. Consistency across studies is necessary for compari- son and will ultimately provide clearer answers on whether a therapy's use is supported. Data are needed on appropriate dosing for the various CAM therapies and the resultant outcomes. In addition, it's essential that researchers use standardized treatments, even though this may contradict the essence of some holistic practices. Comparison of studies on yoga, for example, becomes complicated when different yoga practices and traditions are used, which limits the strength of nd- ings. It's also essential to consider using new methodol-ogies for CAM study such as Whole Systems Research, which addresses the complexities of CAM interventions, many of which come from whole systems of care such as traditional Chinese medicine. Because there might be synergistic effects with concomitantly used therapies within these systems, a mixed-methods research ap-proach is needed. This should include qualitative as well as quantitative analyses to capture the effects of CAM therapies. 71 Also evident in CAM studies, particularly in the extensive glucosamine trials, is a tendency toward not comparing like to like. Differences in product for-mulation, CAM practices, and provider services may affect study results. As data increase, it will become pos-sible to include proven CAM therapies in the multimodal management of OA. \u0081 Number 2 Content from the American Journal of Nursing .
