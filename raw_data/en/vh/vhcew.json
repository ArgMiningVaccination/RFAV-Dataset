Holistic Medicine is based on the principle that we are interconnected beings, and what impacts one part of us will impact our entire self. When you visit us for holistic medicine at our Bingham Farms office, we don't see you as just the sum of your symptoms. We use your symptoms as clues to what causes are undermining your potential for optimal health and harmony. In today's fast-paced and chemically-overloaded world, it's never a question of if we are toxic, but of how toxic we are. We look at how nutritional deficiencies, a stressful lifestyle, environmental toxicants, genetic risks, and a negative emotional outlook might be assailing your body, spirit, and psyche.
