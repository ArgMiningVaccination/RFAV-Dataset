In addition, the AAP supports further research into the causes of autism. The following inform ation is to help pare nts and caregivers to understand some of the common issues a nd questions surrounding this topic. WHAT IS AUTISM? \u0083 Autism is not a specific disease, but ra ther a collection of disorders of brain development called \"autism spectrum disorders,\" or ASDs. Autism has a strong genetic basis. \u0083 Studies show that the incidence of autism ha s risen. The apparent increase in autism may be due to a combination of factors. For example, more and more behaviors and disorders are being included in the definition of in the definition of ASD than in the past. Also, the public and the medical profe ssion recognize these diso rders more often. \u0083 According to the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention (CDC), about 1 in 150 children have an ASD. \u0083 Although many theories have been discusse d, the cause or cause s of autism are not known \u0083 More research is being done every year to try to iden tify the causes and improve efforts to prevent, diagnose and treat AS Ds. The nation's top experts in pediatric neurology, genetics, and other fi elds are moving closer to answers about this group of disorders. \u0083 Early diagnosis is crucial. Pe diatricians should screen all children for ASDs at 18 and 24 months. They should also listen care fully to parents about their child's development. Parents are the most reliable sources of information. 2\u0083 When a child is diagnosed with ASD, th e child's family and caregivers should be given information and support. The child s hould be involved in autism intervention programs as early as possible to get the most benefit. WHAT IS MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE? \u0083 A recent case that went through the fede ral Vaccine Injury Compensation Program involved a child with a mitochondrial disorder or mitochondrial disease. This case has raised questions about what environmental triggers might bring on or worsen autism- like symptoms in children with such disorders. This case is sealed and details are not public. Mitochondrial cases are extremely ra re and should not be used to justify vaccine refusla. If more details are re leased, the AAP may be able to comment on specifics of the case. WHAT ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY? \u0083 From time to time, rumors circulate that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative once used in several vaccines (and still used in some flu vaccine), could contribute to ASDs. However, valid scientific studies ha ve shown there is no link. For example, a recent study in California showed that, ev en though thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines by 2002, cases of ASD did not decrease. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Ameri can Medical Association (AMA), the CDC, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. For the IOM report, please go to http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/4717.aspx \u0083 The National Institute of Child Health a nd Human Development says, \"To date there is no definite, scientific proof that any vaccine or combination of vaccines can cause autism. It's important to know that vacci nes actually help the immune system to defend the body.\" \u0083 Some parents are concerned about \"combi nation\" vaccines, which protect against more than one disease with a single shot . For example, the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella. These vaccines have been studied carefully and found to be safe. All vaccines contain antig ens, which cause the immune system to do its work to fight (and protect the body from) infections. It is important to remember that children are exposed to multiple antig ens in many ways during normal activities, such as playing outside or eating food. Healthy children's immune systems are equipped to handle these multiple exposures. \u0083 It is most important that pa rents and pediatricians continue to rely on immunizations to protect all children from preventable\u2014and potentially deadly\u2014illnesses. Many vaccine-preventable diseases can have dangerous consequences, including seizures, brain damage, blindness, and even death. Th ese diseases still exist even though many young parents today have never seen a case, due to the success of the nation's current 3immunization program. Death and harm fr om chickenpox, measles, meningitis and other diseases are still a threat to children who are not protected. \u0083 A parent's decision to skip or delay vaccines is not advisable, as this could leave the child vulnerable to disease for a longer period of time. Parents should follow the immunization schedule provided by the CDC, the AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the Advi sory Committee on Immunization Practices each year. This schedule is designed by experts to ensure maximum protection and safety for children at various ages. Pare nts should discuss any concerns with their child's pediatrician. \u0083 In a small number of patients, a particular vaccine may be associated with one or more adverse effects. Pediatricians continue to repo rt such effects, other than mild reactions such as swelling at the injection site or mild fever, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Any adverse effects are acted upon immediately when there appears to be an association. More information for parents and caregivers is available on the AAP Web site at the following links: On Autism: http://www.aap.org/heal thtopics/Autism.cfm On Vaccines: http://www.cispimmunize.org/ Note on the recent case from the Vaccine Inju ry Compensation Program, discussed at a news conference on 3/6/08: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this was a unique case and information about it has not been accurately characterized in the media and other public forums. It represents one special ca se and does not change the immunization recommendations for children in whom va ccines are otherwise recommended. More information is availabl e at the CDC Web site: www.cdc.gov The patient in the case has an underlying mitoch ondrial disorder, which affects the way that cells are able to produce energy. According to the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, \"there are no scientific studies documenti ng that childhood vaccinations cause mitochondrial diseases or worsen mitochondrial disease symptoms . In the absence of scientific evidence, the UMDF cannot confirm any association betw een mitochondrial dise ases and vaccines.\" American Academy of Pediatrics March 2008 "}
