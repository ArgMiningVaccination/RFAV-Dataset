It includes an introduction to each of the books. This interview was recorded for the 2018 Bio-dynamic conference of North America. anthroposophy Rudolf Steiner [RUDOLF STEINER (1861-1925)](https://www.goetheanum.org/en/anthroposophical-society/rudolf-steiner) brought a 'science of the spirit' based on his direct knowledge and perception of the spiritual world. Through his spiritual investigations came ideas that reinvigorated many activities including medicine, education, agriculture and the arts. His research into the spiritual nature of the human being and the evolution of humanity informs his many published works. Steiner called this science of the spirit Anthroposophy, meaning \"wisdom of the human being.\" Anthroposophy is non-denominational and enhances many aspects of Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and other traditions. He initiated Steiner/Waldorf education, bio-dynamic farming and gardening, an approach to the care and education for those with disabilities and special needs, anthroposophic medical work and an art of movement called eurythmy. [The Goetheanum](https://goetheanum.co/en) was designed and commissioned under the direction of Steiner. It is the home of the School of Spiritual Science and the General Anthroposophical Society and it supports the exchange of ideas on spiritual issues and training in artistic and scientific fields. The Conditions of Esoteric Training The first condition is that the student should pay heed to the advancement of bodily and spiritual health. The second condition is that the student should feel themself coordinated as a link in the whole of life. The third condition is that the student must work their way upward to the realisation that their thoughts and feelings are as important to the world as actions. It must be realised that it is equally injurious to hate a fellow being as to strike them. The fourth condition is to acquire the conviction that the real being of man does not lie in their exterior but in their interior. The fifth condition is steadfastness in carrying out a resolution. The sixth condition is the development of a feeling of thankfulness for everything with which the human being is favoured. All these conditions must be united in a seventh: to regard life unceasingly in the manner demanded by these conditions. "}
