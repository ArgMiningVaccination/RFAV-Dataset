Established dietary and oral hygiene habits will influence the condition of the oral cavity in the future. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate alterations in early school children's dietary and oral hygiene practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and to anticipate potential long-term health implications. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional online study involved guardians of Polish children aged 6-10 years, living in Western Poland, who were socially isolated at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 180 guardians were invited to participate in this study. The questionnaire included 17 questions divided into four different sections\u2014the child's anthropometric data, dietary habits, oral health, and attitude to dental visits. Results: The survey was completed by 106 guardians. The mean (standard deviation) age of the children was 8.12 (0.93) years (range 6-10 years). Overall, 24.5% of the surveyed individuals reported buying healthy products (fresh vegetables, fruit) more frequently during the pandemic. Furthermore, 35.8% admitted to snacking between meals more frequently and 16.0% less frequently. Almost one-quarter of the parents acknowledged that their children were less motivated to maintain oral hygiene during the pandemic and 28.3% declared a lower frequency of visits to the dentist from the outbreak of the pandemic for two main reasons: a fear of coronavirus transmission and economic reasons. Conclusions: In the group studied, the results of the assessment indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic had some effects on oral health that may lead to an increased risk of oral disease development, such as tooth decay in children. None of the respondents noticed an increase in their child's motivation about good oral hygiene despite spending more time at home. The irregularity of follow-up visits for one-third of the respondents hindered preventive measures and the continuation of dental treatment.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-31", "cleaned_text": "Diet, Oral Hygiene Habits, and Approach to Dental Visits of Early School-Aged Children during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Possible Long-Term Health Consequences [https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12175690](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12175690) [Children's Diseases, Family Management, these measures had unintended consequences on the accessibility and utilization of dental services, resulting in a complex set of challenges for both oral health professionals and the general population [ [2](#B2-jcm-12-05690)]. [3](#B3-jcm-12-05690)]. As the situation improved and vaccination efforts progressed, Poland began to gradually lift restrictions. By 16 May 2022, many of the pandemic-related restrictions affecting dental services were eased, allowing dental practices to resume normal operations [ [4](#B4-jcm-12-05690)]. [5](#B5-jcm-12-05690), [6](#B6-jcm-12-05690)]. Parents play a vital role in filtering the interaction between children and their environment with feeding habits, oral hygiene care, and other preventive practices [ [7](#B7-jcm-12-05690)]. [8](#B8-jcm-12-05690)]. Early school-aged children are in a transitional phase from primary to permanent dentition. This is also the time for changes in oral hygiene and dietary practices\u2014with unsupervised toothbrushing and increased consumption of cariogenic foods and beverages while at school or home, in turn causing a higher risk for developing caries. Therefore, special attention should be given to school-aged children regarding their oral hygiene and dietary practices [ [9](#B9-jcm-12-05690)]. 2. Materials and Methods [6](#B6-jcm-12-05690), [10](#B10-jcm-12-05690)]. We intentionally chose not to exclude children with general health issues from our research, so our questionnaire did not include specific inquiries about general health issues. Our decision was based on the premise that pandemic-related changes in diet and oral hygiene habits could be universally experienced, regardless of specific health conditions. [11](#B11-jcm-12-05690)], was developed by the authors to consider how guardians perceived their dietary habits, their children's oral hygiene, and their attitudes toward dental visits before the pandemic compared to the period during social distancing. The prefinal version of the questionnaire was pilot-tested on 10% of the calculated sample, with the aim of checking aspects related to the level of understanding and coherence of the questions. Finally, after some small necessary adjustments, the final form of the questionnaire was created. Considering that all questions were formulated by the researchers for this particular project, and due to the recent emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey had not undergone prior validation. [Supplementary Materials](#app1-jcm-12-05690). The questionnaire was preceded by a consent statement, in which the purpose of the study was specified, and the respondents were informed about the processing, the scientific use of data, and the anonymous nature of the form. 3. Results [Table 1](#jcm-12-05690-t001). 3.1. Influence of the Pandemic and Social Distancing (Suspension of Classroom Activities) on the Eating Habits of the Child and Parents [Figure 1](#jcm-12-05690-f001)), 24.5% of surveyed individuals reported buying healthy products (fresh vegetables, fruits) more frequently during the pandemic, and 4.7% reported buying healthy products less frequently. More frequent purchasing of processed snacks was reported by 6.6% of the respondents, while 48.1% believed that they reached for such products less often in the store. On the other hand, 35.8% admitted to snacking between meals more frequently, and 16.0% reported less frequent snacking between meals. [Figure 2](#jcm-12-05690-f002)). [Figure 3](#jcm-12-05690-f003)). Overall, 23.6% answered that they had more time to prepare home-cooked meals; a different opinion was shared by a similar group totaling 22.6% of those examined. 3.2. Influence of the Suspension of Stationary Classes on the Maintenance of Child Oral Hygiene [Figure 4](#jcm-12-05690-f004)). In addition, almost one-quarter of caregivers (24.5%) acknowledged that their children were less motivated to maintain oral hygiene during the pandemic, while 75.5% were just as motivated as before. 3.3. Attitude toward Visiting the Dentist during the Pandemic [Figure 5](#jcm-12-05690-f005)). Overall, 71.7% said they had not changed the frequency of dental check-ups for their children: they visited the surgery equally regularly or equally rarely at 52.8% and 18.9%, respectively. Most guardians (52.8%) believed that their visits were similarly frequent, while 28.3% declared a lower frequency of visits to the dentist since the outbreak of the pandemic for two main reasons: fear of coronavirus transmission\u2014chosen by 15.1% of respondents\u2014and for other reasons, e.g., economic, selected by 13.2% of respondents. [Table 2](#jcm-12-05690-t002)). Still, in an emergency situation due to toothache or dental trauma, parents were willing to arrange a dental visit sooner in the pandemic (p = 0.001, McNemar's test). 4. Discussion [11](#B11-jcm-12-05690), [12](#B12-jcm-12-05690), [13](#B13-jcm-12-05690), [14](#B14-jcm-12-05690)]. During holidays or days off from school, individuals tend to take a break from their routine and often indulge in different dietary and hygiene habits [ [10](#B10-jcm-12-05690), [15](#B15-jcm-12-05690)]. The lockdown and remote learning period during the pandemic can be likened to a holiday period in terms of changes in routine and lifestyle. However, it is important to note that the pandemic period was also characterized by stress and uncertainty, which were significant factors influencing the behavior of both adults and children. Unlike traditional holiday periods that are typically associated with relaxation and leisure, the pandemic-induced restrictions brought about unique challenges and concerns that affected individual well-being [ [11](#B11-jcm-12-05690), [13](#B13-jcm-12-05690), [14](#B14-jcm-12-05690)]. Recently published studies indicated that diverse patterns of lifestyle modifications emerged among individuals worldwide during the pandemic [ [14](#B14-jcm-12-05690)]. In children, the effects of the pandemic included, among others, inadequate nutrition with a risk of being both overweight or underweight, an addiction to screens, a lack of schooling, and psychosocial difficulties [ [14](#B14-jcm-12-05690)]. [16](#B16-jcm-12-05690)] and the constant exposure to COVID-19 news through media sources, which could have induced stress with individuals turning to excessive eating, particularly seeking out sugary \"comfort foods\" [ [12](#B12-jcm-12-05690), [16](#B16-jcm-12-05690), [17](#B17-jcm-12-05690)]. These foods, primarily composed of simple carbohydrates, could have helped in alleviating stress by promoting serotonin production [ [18](#B18-jcm-12-05690)]. At the same time, the increased amount of time spent at home may have yielded more favorable results, such as a higher frequency of cooking meals instead of relying on fast food options [ [19](#B19-jcm-12-05690)]. [13](#B13-jcm-12-05690)]. [12](#B12-jcm-12-05690)]. [20](#B20-jcm-12-05690)]. Although that study was conducted on a group of adults, mainly women up to 40 years of age, the data on fast food consumption are similar to ours. In our survey, almost a third of respondents (32.1%) declared that they had reduced the amount of fast food they consumed during the pandemic, while only 23.6% stated they had more time for preparing homemade meals. What is more, G\u00f3rnicka et al. found that approximately 19% of respondents increased their consumption of unhealthy food [ [20](#B20-jcm-12-05690)]. On the contrary, less than 10% of our respondents admitted to buying sweets and crisps in this study. One study on a pediatric population, conducted by Campagnaro et al., revealed that among those who claimed changes in eating habits, only 33.1% said they were choosing healthier foods, while in our study it was 24.5% [ [11](#B11-jcm-12-05690)]. [21](#B21-jcm-12-05690)], 60.4% of 6- to 10-year-olds admitted to having more snacks per day during the pandemic, of which 19.4% admitted to having more than three additional meals, while in our study, 35.8% of respondents reported snacking between meals more frequently, and 16.0% less often than before the pandemic. In Gotler et al.'s study, 18.9% of participants drank sugary/carbonated/juices/soda more frequently between meals during the COVID-19 lockdown, while in our research, only 3.8% confirmed such an adverse change in eating habits [ [21](#B21-jcm-12-05690)]. Restrictions on purchasing snacks and sugary drinks in our survey may be due to limited shopping funds because of reductions in family income after a year of the pandemic, but we did not investigate this particular aspect. [21](#B21-jcm-12-05690)], while in our research, 16% of children declared brushing their teeth less frequently. It was proven that the benefit of twice daily toothbrushing on caries development in newly erupted first permanent molar teeth is around 50% compared with brushing once a day or less [ [22](#B22-jcm-12-05690)]. Thus, more attention to the educational aspect should be exerted. A cross-sectional survey of parents of children aged 3-15 years from Brazil and Portugal showed that child oral hygiene habits changed in 43% cases during the social distancing period of the pandemic. Parents considered oral hygiene as poorer in 22.9% of cases and better in 19.8% of cases [ [2](#B2-jcm-12-05690)]. [11](#B11-jcm-12-05690)], about 56% of respondents said they were not leaving home to attend medical or dental appointments, and 86% of those who reported that their children experienced dental trauma during the pandemic did not seek dental care. In addition, 24.4% of the children had their dental treatment temporarily suspended [ [11](#B11-jcm-12-05690)]. In our study, 28.3% of respondents canceled regular visits. Still, in an emergency due to toothache or dental trauma, parents were willing to arrange a dental visit sooner in the pandemic than before (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, only one-third of Polish 7-year-olds attended regular check-ups the year before the pandemic. Reducing this already insufficient number of visits due to the pandemic may lead to a further deterioration in child oral health [ [23](#B23-jcm-12-05690)]. Our study results partially support the initial hypothesis. Parents were more willing to take a child for a dental check-up before the pandemic. However, in an emergency situation, such as a toothache or dental trauma, they were more willing to arrange a dental visit during the pandemic. [24](#B24-jcm-12-05690)]. Polish primary school children aged 10-16 years were examined at the beginning of the pandemic in June 2020. Within the area of food consumption habits, the number of students who declared ensuring that they ate at least one serving of fruit a day, or at least three servings of fruit most days, or at least one serving of vegetables or salad a day, or often choosing a fruit when they had a snack between meals, actually increased (p < 0.05). Participants of this study presented different eating habits than before, and most of the changes were positive [ [24](#B24-jcm-12-05690)]. [25](#B25-jcm-12-05690), [26](#B26-jcm-12-05690)], oral hygiene practices [ [27](#B27-jcm-12-05690)], changes in environmental conditions [ [28](#B28-jcm-12-05690)], and crisis situations such as wars, periods of famine, and pandemics [ [29](#B29-jcm-12-05690)]. These factors can have direct or indirect impacts on oral health, such as changes in dietary patterns affecting the prevalence of dental caries or disruptions in access to dental care during times of conflict or crisis [ [28](#B28-jcm-12-05690), [29](#B29-jcm-12-05690)]. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, it has undoubtedly had a lasting impact on the health of people globally, including oral health. 5.
