Vaccines The SNS holds both JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 vaccines that could be used to protect people from mpox infections. ASPR's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) supported the development of JYNNEOS, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent both smallpox and mpox. ACAM2000\u00ae, which was developed with support from SNS, is FDA approved for smallpox but could also be used to vaccinate at-risk individuals under an appropriate regulatory mechanism outside its labeled indication. CDC currently has an expanded access Investigational New Drug protocol that allows its use for mpox. JYNNEOS vaccine may be shipped either frozen or refrigerated and requires specific cold chain requirements for storage. The requirements for shipment and storage differ from the package insert. Before requesting product, read [Bavarian Nordic's letter on storage requirements](/SNS/Documents/MVA-BN-Information-Ltr-Effective-14June2022.pdf) for JYNNEOS vaccine and ensure you have a plan to meet these requirements. Following a [Section 564 determination](/legal/Section564/Pages/Monkeypox-9Aug22.aspx), the FDA announced an alternate strategy that allows health care providers to draw up to five doses of JYNNEOS vaccine from a single vial when administered intradermally.

CDC currently has an expanded access Investigational New Drug protocol that allows its use for mpox. The smallpox antiviral drug TPOXX\u00ae supplied by the SNS does not have an expiration date printed on its label. To determine the expiration date for product received from the SNS, find the lot number on the product label, and refer to the table below to identify the corresponding expiration date.

Clinicians with mpox patients necessitating brincidofovir treatment need to submit an e-IND request to FDA by email ( [DDI.EIND@fda.hhs.gov](mailto:DDI.EIND@fda.hhs.gov)) or phone 301-796-3400 or 1-855-543-3784 during normal business hours (8 am-4:30 pm ET M-F).
