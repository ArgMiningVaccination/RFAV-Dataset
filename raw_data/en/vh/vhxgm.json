PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection (injection) . Colo urless to slightly yellow, clear to very opalescent suspension (pH6-6.4). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications JCOVDEN is indicated for active immuni sation toprevent COVID -19caused by SARS -CoV -2in individuals 18years of age and older . The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Individuals 18 years of age and older Primary vaccination JCOVDEN is administered as a single -dose of 0.5 mL by intramuscular injection only. 3Booster dose A booster dose (second dose) of 0.5 mL of JCOVDEN may be administered intramuscularly at least 2months after the primary vaccination in individuals 18 years of age and older (see also sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). A booster dose of JCOVDEN (0.5mL) may be administered in individuals 18 years of age and older as a heterologous booster dose following completion of primary vaccination with an mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine oran adenoviral vector -based COVID -19 vaccine . The dosing interval for the heterologous booster dose isthe same as thatauthori sed for a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination (see also sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of JCOVDEN in children and adolescents (less than 18 years of age) have not yet been established . No data are available. Elderly No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals 65years of age. See also sections 4.8 and 5.1. Method of administration JCOVDEN is for intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, intravenously ,subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, se e section 4.4. For instructions on handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. A history of confirmed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following vaccination with anyCOVID -19 vaccine (see also section 4.4). Individuals who have previously experienced episodes of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) (see also section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded . Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 1 5minutes is recommended following vaccination .4Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety -related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection . It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting . Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. However, the presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Coagulation disorders Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome: A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia ,in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccina tion with JCOVDEN . This includes severe cases of venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus (CVST) ,splanchnic vein thrombosis as well as arterial thrombosis concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been reported. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination , and mostly in individuals under 60 years of age . Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia requires speciali sed clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists ( e.g., haematologists , specialists in coagulation ) to diagnose and treat this condition. Individuals who have experienced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome following vaccination with any COVID -19 vaccine should not receive JCOVDEN (See also section 4.3). Venous thromboembolism: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been observed rarely following vaccination with JCOVDEN (see section 4.8). This should be considered for individuals at increased risk for VTE. Immune thrombocytopenia: Cases of immune thrombocytopenia with very low platelet levels (<20000 per L) have been reported very rarely after v accination with JCOVDEN , usually within the first four weeks after receiving JCOVDEN . This included cases with bleeding and cases with fatal outcome. Some of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If an individual has a history of ITP, the risks of devel oping low platelet levels should be considered before vaccination, and platelet monitoring is recommended after vaccination. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia . Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches, seizures, mental status changes or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences spontaneous bleeding, skin bruising (petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention. Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within 3 weeks after vaccination with JCOVDEN should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis. Similarly, individuals who present with thrombosis within 3 weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thro mbocytopenia. Risk of bleeding with intramuscular administration As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (s uch as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.5Capillary leak syndrome Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported in the first days after vaccination with JCOVDEN , in some cases with a fatal outcome. A history of CLS has been reported. CLS is a rare disorder characterised by acute episodes of oedema mainly affecting the limbs, hypotension, haemoconcentration and hypoalbuminaemia. Patients with an acute episode of CLS following vaccination require prompt recognition and treatment. Intensive supportive therapy is usually warranted. Individuals with a kn own history of CLS should not be vaccinated with this vaccine. See also section 4.3. Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome and transverse myelitis Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and transverse myelitis (TM) have been reported very rarely following vaccination with JCOV DEN . Healthcare professionals should be alert toGBS and TM signs and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment and to rule out other causes. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with JCOVDEN (section 4.8). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often in males younger than 40 years of age. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such a s (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat these conditions. Risk of severe adverse events after a booster dose The risk of severe adverse events (such as coagulation disorders including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, CLS ,GBS , and pericarditis ) after a booster dose of JCOVDEN has not yet been characteri sed. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine ha venot been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of JCOVDEN may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. Duration of protecti on The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness Protection starts around 14days after vaccination. As with all vaccines, vaccination with JCOVDEN may not protect all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1). Excipients Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5mL dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.6Ethanol This medicinal product contains 2 mgof alcohol (ethanol) per 0.5 mL dose. The small amount of alcohol in this medicinal product will not have any noticeable effects. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Co ncomitant administration of JCOVDEN with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There is limited experience with the use of JCOVDEN in pregnant women. Animal studies with JCOVDEN do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, partu rition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Administration of JCOVDEN in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any pote ntial risks tothe mother and foetus. Breast -feeding It is unknown whether JCOVDEN is excreted in human milk. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines JCOVDEN has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the adverse reactions mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Primary vaccination (primary pooled analysis) The safety of JCOVDEN was evaluated in the primary pooled analysis from the double -blind phase of the randomised, A total of 38,538 adults aged 18 years and older received at least a single -dose primary vaccination of JCOVDEN . The median age of individuals was 52years (range 18 -100years ).For the primary pooled analysis, the median follow -up for individuals who received JCOVDEN was approximately 4 months after completion of primary vaccination. Longer safety follow -up of 6months is available for 6,136adults who received JCOVDEN . In theprimary pooled analysis , the most common local adverse reactions reported w asinjection site pain (54.3%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were fatigue (44.0%), headache ( 43.0%), myalgia (38.1%)andnausea (16.9%).Pyrexia (defined as body temperature 38.0\u00b0C) was observed in 7.2% of participants .Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity . Across the studies, most adverse reactions occurred within 1 -2days following vaccination and were of short duration ( 1- 2days). Reactogenicity was generally milder and reported less frequently in older adults .7The safety profile was generally consistent across participants with or without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection at baseline . A total of 10.6% ofindividuals that received JCOVDEN were SARS -CoV -2 positive at baseline (based on serology or RT -PCR assessment). Booster dose (second dose) following primary vaccination with JCOVDEN The safety of a booster dose (second dose) with JCOVDEN administered approximately 2 months after the primary vaccination was evaluated in an ongoing randomised, double -blind, placebo - controlled Phase 3 Study (COV3009). In the FAS (full analysis set), from the 15708 adults aged 18years and older who received 1dose of JCOVDEN , a total of 86 46individuals received a second dose during the double -blind phase. The safety of a booster dose (second dose) with JCOVDEN administered at least 6 months after the primary vaccination was eval uated in a randomised, double -blind Phase 2 Study (COV2008 Cohort 1 N=330). Overall, the solicited adverse reaction profile for the homologous booster dose was similar to that after the first dose. There were no new safety signals identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine Overall, in 3 clinical studies (including 2 independent studies ) approximately 500adults have received primary vaccination with 2 doses of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine andreceived a single booster dose of JCOVDEN , at least 3months after primary vaccination (COV2008, COV -BOOST and DMID 21 - 0012 studies). There were no new safety concerns identified . However, a trend towards an increase in frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic adverse events after the heterologous booster dose was observed when compared with the homologous booster dose of JCOVDEN. Booster dose following primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector -based COVID -19 vaccine The safety of a heterologous booster dose of JCOVDEN was evaluated in the COV -BOOST study following primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector -based COVID -19 vaccine. Participants received 2 doses of Vaxzevria (N=108) followed by a booster dose of JCOVD EN 77 days post second dose (median; IQR: 72 -83 days). There were no new safety concerns identified . Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse drug reactions observed in the primary pooled analysis or from post marketing sources are organised by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) . Frequency categories are defined as follows: Very common ( 1/10); Common (1/100 to < 1/10); (1/1000 to Rare (1/10000 to < 1/1000); Very rare ( <1/10000) ; Not known (cannot be estimated from the ava ilable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available . 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported . In Phase 1/2 studies where a higher dose (up to 2 -fold) was administered JCOVDEN remained well -tolerated, however vaccinated individuals reported an increase in reactogenicity (increased vaccination site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea and pyrexia) . In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.95. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic J07BN02 Mechanism of action JCOVDEN is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication -incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that encodes a SARS -CoV -2 full -length spike (S) glycoprotein in a stabilised conformation. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS -CoV -2 is transiently expressed ,stimulating both neutrali sing and other functional S -specific antibodies , as well as cellular immune responses directed against the S antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID - 19. Clinical efficacy Efficacy from a single -dose primary vaccination Primary analysis A primary analysis (cut -off date 22 January 2021) of a multicentre, randomi sed, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study (COV3001 )wasconducted in the United States, South Africa and Latin American countries to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single -dose primary vaccination of JCOVDEN for the prevention of COVID -19 in adults aged 18 years and older. The study excluded individuals with abnormal function of the immune system resulting from a clinical condition, individuals who are under immunosup pressive therapies within 6 months, as well as pregnant women. Participants with stable HIV infection under treatment were not excluded. Licensed vaccines , excluding live vaccines, could be administered more than 14 days before or more than 14days after the vaccination in the study. Licensed live attenuated vaccines could be administered more than 28 days before or more than 28 days after the vaccination in the study. A total of 44325 individuals were randomi sed in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive an intramuscular injection of JCOVDEN or placebo. A total of 21895adults received JCOVDEN and 21888 adults received placebo. Participants were followed for a median follow -upof approximately 2 months after vaccination . The primary efficacy analysis population of 39321 individuals included 38059 SARS -CoV -2 seronegative individuals at baseline and 1262 individuals with an unknown serostatus . Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among individuals who received JCOVDEN and those who received placebo. In the primary efficacy analysis population, among the individuals who received JCOVDEN , the median age was 52.0 years (range: 18 t o 100 years ); 79.7% (N=15646) of individuals were 18 to 64 years old [with 20.3% (N=3984) aged 65 or older and 3.8% (N=755) aged 75 or older ]; 44.3% of individuals were female ;46.8% were from Northern America (United States), 40.6% were from Latin America and 12.6% were from Southern Africa (South Africa). A total of 7830 (39.9%) individuals had at least one pre -existing comorbidity associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID -19 at baseline .Comorbidities included: obesity defined as asthma (1.3% ). Other comorbidities were present in 1% of the individuals. COVID -19 cases were confirmed by a central laboratory based on a positive SARS -CoV -2 viral RNA result using a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR )-based test.

The study excluded individuals with abnormal function of the immune system resulting from a clinical condition, individuals who were under immunosuppressive therapies within 6months, as well as pregnant women. Participants with stable HIV infection under treatment were not excluded. Licensed vaccines, excluding live vaccines, could be administered more than 14 days before or more than 14 days after the vaccination in the study. Licensed live attenuated va ccines could be administered more than 28 days before or more than 28 days after the vaccination in the study . A total of 31300 individuals were randomised in the double -blind phase of the study. In total, 14492 (46.3%) individuals were included in the pe r-protocol efficacy population (7484 individuals received JCOVDEN and 7008 individuals received placebo). Participants were followed for a median of 36days (range: 0 -172days) after vaccination. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among individuals who received at least two doses of JCOVDEN and those who received placebo. In the primary efficacy analysis population, among the individuals who received 2 doses of JCOVDEN , the median age was 50.0 years (range: 18 to 99 years); 87.0% (N=6512 ) of individuals were 18 to 64 years old [with 13.0% (N=972) aged 65 or older and 1.9% (N=144) 75 or older]; 45.4% of individuals were female; 37.5% were from North America (United States), 51.0% were from Europe (including UK), 5.4% were from South A frica, 1.9% from Philippines and 4.2% from Latin America. A total of 2747 (36.7%) individuals had at least one pre -existing comorbidity associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID -19 at baseline .Comorbidities included: obesity defined as BMI (8.9%), sleep (6.7%), type 2 heart (3.6%), (1.7%) and stable/well -controlled HIV infection (1.3%). Other comorbidities were present in 1% of the individuals. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID -19 and severe COVID -19 is presented in Table 6 below: Table 6: Analys is of vaccine efficacy against symptomatica -19-14days post-booster RT-PCR result and at least 1 respiratory sign or symptom or 2 other systemic signs or symptoms, as defined in the protocol. bFinal determination of severe COVID -19 cases was made by an independent adjudication committee, who also assigned disease severity according to the definition per FDA guidance. cPer-protocol efficacy population. dConfidence intervals were adjusted to implement type I error control for multiple testing. eOf the 8 participants with severe disease, 1 was admitted to an intensive care unit. Final analysis results of variants with sufficient cases available for meaningful interpretations (Alpha [B.1.1.7] and Mu [B.1.621]) show that, after the first dose of JCOVDEN , efficacy 14 days post -dose 1 (Day 15-Day these second Alpha There were only 7 Delta cases (4 and 3 Delta cases in the JCOVDEN group and placebo group, respectively) . There were no reference strain 14cases in either the JCOVDEN or placebo group in the follow -up 14 days after the booster dose (71days). Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic infections at least 14 days after second vaccination was34.2% (95% CI: -6.4; 59. 8). Immunogenicity of a booster dose(second dose) following primary vaccination with JCOVDEN It should be noted that there is no established immune correlate of protection. In a Phase 2 Study (COV2001 ), individuals 18 through 55 years of age and 65 years and older received a booster dose of JCOVDEN approximately 2 months after the primary vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring neutrali sing antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 Victoria/1/2020 strain using qualified wild -type virus neutrali sation assay (wtVNA). Immunogenicity data are available from 39 individuals, of whom 15 were 65 years of age and older, and are summari sed in Table 7.

Neutrali antibody immunosorbent assay )increases against the reference were also observed instudies COV1001 , COV1002 and COV2001 in a limited number of study participants after a boost given at 2, 3 and 6months ,when compared to pre -boost values. Overall, the increases of geometric mean titres ( GMTs ) pre-boost to 1 month post -boost ranged from 1.5 to 4.4 fold for neutrali sing antibodies, and from 2.5 to 5.8 fold for binding antibo dies. A 2-fold decrease in antibody levels was observed 4 months following 2 -month booster dose, compared to 1 month following 2 -month booster dose. Antibody levels were still higher than antibody levels following a single -dose at a similar timepoint .These data support the administration of a booster dose when administered at an interval of 2 months or longer after primary vaccination. Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with anmRNA COVID -19 vaccine COV -BOOST study is a mu lticentre, randomised Phase 2 investigator -initiated study (NCT 73765130) conducted in the United Kingdom, to evaluate a booster vaccination against COVID -19. Participants were adults aged 30 years or older . A cohort of participants received two doses of Comirnaty (N=89) , followed by a booster dose of JCOVDEN. The median interval (IQR) was 106 (91 -144)days between the second and booster dose. JCOVDEN boosted binding (N= 88), pseudovirus neutrali sing (N= 77) and wild type neutrali sing antibody responses (N=21) against the reference strain , as observed at Day 28. At Day 84 post -boost, GMTs were still higher than pre -boost values. Furthermore, JCOVDEN boosted pseudovirus neutrali sing antibody responses against the Delta variant assessed atDay 28 (N=89) .15DMID 21 -0012, an independent Phase 1/2 open -label clinical study (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States evaluated a heterologous booster dose of JCOVDEN . Due to the limited sample size, differences observed are only descriptive. A booster dose of JCOVDEN wa s administered toadults who had completed primary vaccination with a Spikevax 2-dose series or a Comirnaty 2-dose series at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment (mean interval [range] of 20[13-26] and 2 1[12-41] weeks for Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively) and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection . JCOVDEN boosted binding and pseudovirus neutrali sing antibody responses against thereference strain and the Delta variant in individuals primed w ith Spikevax 2-dose series (N=49) or Comirnaty 2- dose series (N=50) as observed Day 15 post -boost . JCOVDEN boosted pseudovirus neutrali sing antibody responses against Omicron BA.1 variant in individuals primed with Comirnaty 2-dose series (N= 50), as observed at Day 29 . Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector -based COVID -19 vaccine COV -BOOST study (see study design above) also evaluated a booster dose of JCOVDEN in participants who had received 2 doses of Vaxzevria (N=101) . The median interval (IQR) was 77 (72 - 83) days between the second and booster dose. JCOVDEN boosted binding (N=94) ,pseudovirus neutrali sing (N=94) and wild type neutrali sing antibody responses (N=21) against the reference strain. At Day 84 post -boost, GMTs were still higher than pre -boost values. Furthermore, JCOVDEN boosted pseudovirus neutrali sing antibody responses against the Delta variant assessed at Day 28 (N= 90). Descriptive data from the COV -BOOST study and DMID 21 -0012 study indicate that boosting with JCOVDEN after primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector -based vaccine induces lower antibody responses compared to heterologous boosting with a licensed mRNA vaccine after primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector -based vaccine .The studies also indicate that neutralising antibody titres reached at 1 month post -boost with JCOVDEN after primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine are comparable to after a homologous boost with an mRN A vaccine. Elderly population JCOVDEN was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older. The efficacy of JCOVDEN was consistent between elderly ( 65years) and younger individuals (18-64years). Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with JCOVDEN in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance ,and reproductive and deve lopmental toxicity . Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity JCOVDEN has not been evaluated for its genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.16Reproductive toxicity and fertility Female reproductive toxicity and f ertility were assessed in a combined embryo -foetal and pre -and post-natal development study in the rabbit. In this study a first vaccination of JCOVDEN was administered intramuscularly to female rabbits 7days prior to mating, at a dose equivalent to 2-fold above the recommended human dose, followed by two vaccinations at the same dose during the gestation period (i.e. , at gestational days 6 and 20 ). There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo -foetal or offspring dev elopment. The parental females as well as their foetuses and offspring exhibited SARS -CoV -2 S protein -specific antibody titr es, indicating that maternal antibodies were transferred to the foetuses during gestation .No JCOVDEN data are available on vaccine excretion in milk. In addition, a conventional (repeat -dose) toxicity study in rabbits with JCOVDEN did not reveal any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility. 6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET32Package leaflet: Information for the user JCOVDEN injection COVID -19 vaccine ( Ad26.COV2 -S [recombinant ]) This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are vaccinated because it contains important information for you. - Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. - If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. - If you get any side effects, talk to y our doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What JCOVDEN is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you are given JCOVDEN 3. How JCOVDEN isgiven 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store JCOVDEN 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What JCOVDEN is and what it is used for JCOVDEN is a vaccine used for preventing COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV -2 virus. JCOVDEN is given to adults aged 18 years and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you are given JCOVDEN Do not have the vaccine if You are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). You have had a blood clot occurring at the same time as having low levels of blood platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, TTS) after receiving any COVID -19 vaccine. You have a previous diagnosis of capillary leak syndrome, (a condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels). Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given JCOVDEN if: you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after injection of anyother vaccine, you have ever fainted following any needle injection , you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold , you have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you are taking an antico agulant medicine (to prevent blood clots) , 33 your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high -dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or cancer medicines) , you have risk factors for blood clots in your veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)). As with any vaccine, vaccination with JCOVDEN may not fully protect all those who receive it. It is not known how long you will be protected . Blood disorders Venous thromboembolism: Blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)) vaccination with JCOVDEN . Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome: A combination of blood clots and low levels of 'platelets' in the blood has been observed very rarely following vaccination with JCOVDEN . This includes severe cases with blood clots, including in unusual locations, such as the brain, liver, bowel and spleen in some cases in combination with bleeding. These cases mostly occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination and in individuals below 60 years of age. Fatal outcome has been reported. Immune thrombocytopenia: Very low levels of blood platelets (immune thrombocytopenia), that can be associated with bleeding, have been reported very rarely ,usually within the first four weeks following vaccination with JCOVDEN . Seek immediate medical attention, if you experience symptoms that may be signs of blood disorders: severe or persistent headaches, seizures (fits), mental status changes or blurred vision, unexplained bleeding, unexpla ined skin bruising beyond the site of vaccination which appear a few days after vaccination, pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination, develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain. Inform your hea lthcare provider that you have recently received JCOVDEN . Capillary leak syndrome Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported following vaccination with JCOVDEN . At least one affected patient had a previous diagnosis of CLS. CLS is a serious, potentially fatal condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint (low blood pressure). Seek immediate medical attention if you develo p these symptoms in the days following vaccination. Neurological disorders Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome Seek immediate medical attention if you develop weakness and paralysis in the extremities that can progress to the chest and face (Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome , GBS ). This has been reported very rarely after vaccination with JCOVDEN . Inflammation of the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) Seek immediate medical attention if you develop weakness inthearms orlegs, sensory symptoms (such as tingling, numbness, pain or loss of pain sensation) orproblems with bladder orbowel function . This has been reported very rarely after vaccination with JCOVDEN . Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericar ditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with J COVDEN (see section 4) . These conditions have occurred more often in males less than 40 years of age. In most of these people, symptoms began within 14 days following vaccination. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine: chest pain ; shortness of breath ; feelings of having a fast -beating, fluttering, or pounding heart . Risk of severe adverse events after a booster dose The risk of severe adverse events (such as blood disorders including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, CLS ,GBS , myocarditis and pericarditis after a booster dose of JCOVDEN is unknown .34Children and adolescents JCOVDEN is not recommended for children aged below 18 years. Currently there is not enough information available on the use of JCOVDEN in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age. Other medicines and JCOVDEN Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines. Pregnancy and breast -feeding If you are pregnant or breast -feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine . Driving and using machines Some of the side effects of JCOVDEN listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off be fore you drive or use machines. JCOVDEN contains sodium This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 0.5 mL, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. JCOVDEN contains ethanol This medicine contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each dose of 0.5 mL. The amount of ethanol in this medicine is equivalent to less than 1 mLbeer or wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. 3. How JCOVDEN is given Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into the muscle -usually in the upper arm. How much vaccine will you receive A single -dose primary vaccination (0.5mL) of JCOVDEN is injected . A booster dose (second dose) of JCOVDEN may be given at least 2 months after the primary vaccination in individuals 18 years of age and older. JCOVDEN may be administered as a single booster dose to eligible individuals 18years of age and older who have completed primary vaccination with anmRNA COVID -19 vaccine oran adenoviral vector -based COVID -19 vaccine .Thedosing interval for the booster dose is the same as that authorised for a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination. After the injection your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 4. Possible side effects Like all vaccines, JCOVDEN can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most of the side effects occur inthe1or 2days of getting the vaccination.35Get medical attention imme diately if within 3 weeks of vaccination you get any of the following symptoms: experience severe or persistent headache s, blurred vision, mental status changes or seizures (fits) ; develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain or persistent abdominal pain ; notice unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination . Get urgent medic al attention if you get symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions may include a combination of any of the following symptoms: feeling faint or light -headed changes in your heartbeat shortness of breath wheezing swelling of your lips, face, or throat hives or rash nausea or vomiting stomach pain The following side effects canhappen with this vaccine.
