We do not answer the phone during a session. The best way to reach us is to speak with the receptionist, leave a voicemail or email, and leave as much detail as possible so we can return your call after our sessions. Before your session, we will discuss your condition, plan of care, and estimated sessions. We will ask you many questions about your symptoms, health, and lifestyle, and you will do most of the talking. We may check your pulse and tongue OR conduct a physical exam to determine your constitution. This information will be organized to create a complete and comprehensive diagnosis of where your Qi has become blocked or imbalanced. The diagnosis process can last from 10-15 minutes. After the diagnosis, acupuncture or other traditional Chinese medicine and therapies that best suit you for the session will commence. See other treatments we could use: [services-and-treatments](https://chongmedicine.com/services-and-treatments/) Cost, insurance, and payment: We do not take insurance. Call to check, as things change all the time. Insurance can be complicated and only cover a specific portion of our services. Year by year, acupuncture services are getting less and less reimbursement from insurance companies. Filling out pages of paperwork, chasing after payment, and non-reimbursement of some services takes away the energy we have to give to our patients and creates frustration that impedes our work. This energy is best utilized to heal you and others that need them the most rather than insurance paperwork. The work we do encompasses a lot MORE than just acupuncture. The energy work & the traditional healing methods we employ are not reimbursable by insurance. Insurance does not pay for the years of cultivating internal Qi that we used to work on you. It does not cover sound therapy and energetic healing. We came from the East. This is my way of life. We have used this medicine in our family as preventative medicine, passed down from generations to generations. We treat the body before it becomes diseased. This is our ancestral medicine. It is an alternative medicine in the West but the people's medicine in the East. We grew up with acupuncture, making herbal medicine, cooking with herbs, cultivating the mind with meditation to heal the body, and using natural therapies for as long as I remember. We return annually to Asia to receive training from Master practitioners and keep ourselves updated with seminars and conferences in and out of the country. CA state requires 50 CEUs every two years, including classes, advanced training, and more hands-on work. We work hard to keep our fees reasonable for the training and experience we have to serve the patients we see. That said, you can use your HSA + FSA plan to pay for the acupuncture portion of the service. For your tax filing purposes, we offer receipt with details of your care to help you with some reimbursement and for your deductible at the end of the year. What conditions do we work with? Best way to work together: You are willing to commit to making the changes after our visit on your diet, lifestyle, and self-care, and are open to taking herbs for your conditions if your conditions allow it. You can commit to a series of sessions for a minimum of two-three months. Healing does not occur in 1 session. Chronic illness will take longer to resolve. We welcome other therapies that you are doing: physical therapy, natural path, conventional medicine, surgery, chemotherapy, IVF, and so on. Everyone has a role to play in your healing. Follow up with your maintenance plan to keep your conditions at bay, whether once a month, every other month, or through other programs. Not the best way: You are only here to do one session. The work we do is cumulative and builds upon each other. You have no Qi; either you have not eaten, slept for days, or are intoxicated or highly medicated. In this case, you will have to seek other medical services or schedule for another time. You require emergency help with your pain that could indicate more serious underlying conditions. If you don't show up, cancel late, are disrespectful, or are not present for your session. What health conditions do you work with? We work with most cases of health conditions, women's health, hormonal balance, fertility, pain management, gastrointestinal disorders, and mental-emotional balancing. Our system of healing does not zero in on the 'disease' of the body, whether it is Bell's palsy, infertility, arthritis, osteoporosis, acid reflux, PMDD, or other non-pronounceable diseases' names. We work on correcting the imbalance of the whole body, meaning the physical blockage and mental, emotional, or spiritual aspects. How does Qi work, and why do you need to feel my Qi? The Qi, prana, or vital force flows throughout the body through specific meridian pathways. They are fourteen meridians, each connected to particular organs and glands. Meridian pathways are like rivers. Where a river flows, it transports life-giving fluids to nourish the land and its living beings. In the same way, meridian pathways transport life-giving Qi to nourish and energize every cell, organ, gland, tissue, and muscle. When the Qi flows freely, one enjoys physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. An obstruction of Qi anywhere in the body is like a dam, backing up the flow in one area and restricting it in others. The blockage can hinder the distribution of nourishment the body requires to function optimally. What can affect Qi? Physical and emotional trauma, stress, overexertion in foods, sex, drugs, seasonal change, diet, chemical toxins, over-medication, accidents, or other excessive activity can lead to blockage and cause derangement of Qi. If the Qi is disrupted for a prolonged period and excessively, or when the body is weakened, then illness, pain, emotional stagnation, and other issues can set in. I work to undo years of these cumulative activities on you. It takes time. The older the car, the more maintenance you will need. Or the longer you have had these issues, the longer it will take. How do I book a session? You can book online. You will not be charged until you come in. If you cancel within 24 hours, the cancellation fee will take effect. So please cancel before that so that others can use the time slot. You can schedule online to use your program if you already purchase a package. Do you treat children? Yes, in some instance children actually respond more quickly than adults. Besides needles, acupressure or pediatric Tuina are used instead for the needle adverse. Does acupuncture hurt? Some sensations may be felt during acupuncture. When the needles are inserted, you might feel a slight prickling on the skin that will subside within a few seconds. Some may feel a tingling, heavy, or warming sensation during the session around the local area. Others might feel a sense of peace and calm and be so relaxed that they fall asleep. After treatment, most patients feel energized, less pain, comfortable, calm, and peaceful. Many report a feeling of zen. With a skillful acupuncturist, it should not hurt. Acupuncture needles are not syringes. They are thinner than a strain of hair and, most of the time, not even felt. If you are still scared-stiff, don't be. We've been practicing our unique touch, and we listen to you. We also offer Tuina Bodywork, massage, cupping, and Herbal Medicine that can assist in healing. What should I expect on my first time? The typical treatment takes more time than your regular visit with your MD, with more hands-on time without the office wait. First initial visit last for about 50 minutes, with 10 minutes for intake, where we ask a wide range of questions relating to many components of your health: physical symptoms, emotions, daily routine, diet, menstruation history (women), sleep patterns, bowel, and urinary functions and more. As Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is whole-body medicine, getting a big picture of your health is essential. We also inspect your tongue, take your pulse, and look at your appearance and overall behavior, and mental health. The data we observed is our diagnostic process in assessing your health and creating a comprehensive treatment plan. Follow-up visits will then be shorter, 45 minutes. How many treatments do I need? Each treatment plan differs depending on the condition, duration of the illness, level of imbalance, and other complicating factors. Acupuncture jumpstarts the body into healing itself. The course of treatment ranges from 3-10 treatments for acute conditions. It may be 1-2 times per week initially, then taper off to 1 time per week. The symptoms have been rooted for longer for chronic conditions and will need treatment 1-2 times per week for a few months. The effect of acupuncture is combined with Herbal Medicine and supplements to support the healing process. Once you have completed a course of treatment, you should follow up with Maintenance Treatment to prevent the symptoms and to feel great again. Seasonal treatments are also recommended to boost immunity and to avoid flu and colds when the season change. How can I get the most out of my treatment? Acupuncture works cumulatively, meaning one treatment builds on the next. Each session accelerates the healing process in your body, and each treatment gains momentum on the last. If treatments are too far apart, we will not acquire any momentum on the healing, and your treatment will be much less efficient. Similar to how medications are ineffective unless you take the prescribed dose, acupuncture needs to be 'prescribed' frequently enough & consistently and within an appropriate time frame to yield the desired outcome. So do not give up, stay on course and commit to your health.

No, not usually. Using Eastern and Western Medicine together is an excellent way to create an integrative health care plan. Acupuncture will not interfere with Western medications or treatments your regular doctor prescribes. However, it may enable you to reduce some forms of medicine. Acupuncture has been shown to reduce pain and may be able to reduce the use of narcotic pain medication. However, it would help if you always let us know your prescription, as it may affect your response to acupuncture treatment. For Herbal Medicines, we always cross-reference pharmaceutical drugs to enable us to custom blend herbal medicine that will not interfere with your medication. We want to work with you and your healthcare team to provide the best possible care. Our scope of practice also includes sending in for imaging and labs to give you a holistic approach to a happier and healthier you. Traditional Chinese Medicine and acupuncture has been proven to work for over 2,500+ years.
