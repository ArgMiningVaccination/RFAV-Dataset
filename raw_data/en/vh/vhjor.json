They typically heal on their own unless you have scratched them to the point of infection. The most important thing you can do is refrain from scratching or rubbing the affected area.

If the skin breaks and you continue to scratch with your nails or walk barefoot, you greatly increase your risk of infecting your already-ailing toes.
