Preliminary Fiscal Impact Statement There are no anticipated new costs associated with th e implementation of th ese regulation s to the state or its political subdivisions. Statement of Need and Reasonableness The following presents an analysis of the factors listed in 1976 Code Sections 1-23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9) - (11): DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION S: 61-34, Raw Milk for Human Consumption. 10 Purpose: The Department provides sanitation oversight for the production and sale of raw milk that has not been pasteurized for food safety in South Carolina. The Department proposes amending R.61- 34 to address the further processing and sale of raw milk products, specifically, cream and buttermilk, and any additional consumer advisory changes that would be needed for products that receive further processing or become necessary as a byproduct of further processing. The proposed revisions would also update raw milk standards as needed to align certain requirements with the 2019 version of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (\"PMO\"). 61-34.1, Pasteurized Milk and Milk Products. Purpose: The Department provides sanitation oversight of the production and sale of pasteurized milk and milk products for both intrastate and interstate commerce. The Department proposes adopting requirements of the 2019 PMO through amendment of R.61- 34.1. The regulation is currently based on the 2013 PMO and will not meet the federal standards after this year. The amendment of R.61 -34.1 to incorporate the updated requirements of the 2019 PMO would enable South Carolina milk producers to continue to meet federal standards and ship milk and milk products for interstate commerce. The Department further proposes clarification of requirements for potable water sources. The Department also proposes changes for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, and codification, and other regulatory text improvement. Proposed amendments to both regulations also include updates to administrative and enforcement provisions. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 44- 1-140(3) and 44- 1-150 Plan for Implementation: Upon t aking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendments and any associated information. The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdate s/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to these proposed amendment s. Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The purpose of R.61- 34, Raw Milk for Human Consumption, and R.61- 34.1, Pasteurized Milk and Milk Products , is to safeguard public health and provide consumers safe, unadulterated milk and milk products manufactured in South Carolina for sale and distribut ion in state, and pasteurized milk and milk products sold and distributed both in and out of state. These regulations govern the production, processing, storing, labeling, transportation, and distribution of milk and milk products. The Department last amended R.61- 34 in 2009 and R.61 -34.1 in 2015. Since th ose amendment s there have been changes in the milk an d milk products industry and numerous revisions to the PMO. The Department's regulations are based on the PMO and, in the case of R.61- 34.1, the procedur es of the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shippers (NCIMS), specifically Sections VI and VII of the Procedures Governing the Cooperative State -Public Health Service/Food and Drug Administration Program of the NCIMS and the FDA PMO, 2019 Revision, which provide that a state's dairy regulation must be at least as stringent as the PMO to meet requiremen ts for interstate commerce of pasteurized milk and milk products. Updating R.61- 34 and R.61- 34.1 to the most current amendments of the PMO ensures the regulations reflect current standards and sanitation practices. Furthermore, South Carolina milk producers and processors will be able to continue shipment of milk and milk products in interstate commerce and market their milk products as Grade \"A .\" Updating R.61- 34.1 to reflect the current federal standards also serves to reduce a dministrative 11 burdens on the regulated community by facilitating streamlined inspections and compliance under both state and federal requirements. The Department proposes amending the provisions of R.61- 34, Raw Milk for Human Consumption , and R.61- 34.1, P asteurized Milk and Milk Products , to incorporate relevant standards of the updated federal ordinance . In addition, the Department proposes amending the provisions of R.61- 34 to incorporate sanitation standards to address the further processing of raw milk for human consumption. These changes serve to make clear those raw milk products that may be produced and sold pursuant to a Department permit and to specify standards for these products to promote clarity and protection of public health. The proposed a mendments to these regulations also include updates to state- specific administrative and enforcement provisions that serve to improve the overall clarity and effectiveness of applicable administrative, enforcement, and other requirements. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: There are no anticipated new costs associated with the implementation of th ese regulation s. The proposed amendments will benefit public health by ensuring safe, unadulterated dairy food and dairy food products on the farm, at manufa cturing plants , and throughout the distribution chain. The proposed amendments to these regulations also serve to improve the overall clarity and effectiveness of applicable administrative, enforcement, and other requirements. The amendment of R.61- 34 and R.61- 34.1 wil l allow the regulations to be in compliance with the most current food safety science regarding milk and milk products. Furthermore, for R.61- 34.1 to be in compliance with the FDA Grade \"A\" Interstate Milk Shippers (IMS) procedures that govern the shipment of milk and milk products across state boundaries, the regulation may not be more than six (6) years behind the current NCIMS procedures and the PMO . By updating selected sections of R.61- 34.1 to the 2019 PMO by reference, the regulation will meet this cr iteria and South Carolina milk producers will be able to continue to ship milk and milk products outside the limits of the state. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: None EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: Implementation of these regulations will not compromise the protection of the environment or the public health. The proposed regulations will help to ensure that consumers are receiving safe, unadulterated dairy products. The amendment of R.61- 34 and R.61- 34.1 also provides effec tive means of reducing the risks of foodborne illnesses at dairy farms and dairy manufacturing plants, thus protecting consumers and industry from potentially devastating public health consequences and financial loss. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: There will be no adverse effect on the environment if the regulations are not implemented. Failure to adopt these amendments would prevent implementation of the latest sanitary standards and a comprehensive approach to food safety management needed in addressing food protection in the dairy industry. This could have a detrimental effect on the health of South Carolina's citizens and visitors. Statement of Rationale: 12 Here below is the Statement of Rationale pursuant to S.C. Code Section 1- 23-110(A)(3) (h): The Department proposes these amendments to meet the latest sanitation requirements for providing safe, unadulterated pasteurized and unpasteurized dairy products to consumers and to ensure a com prehensive approach to food safety management in the dairy industry. Furthermore, the amendments to R.61- 34.1 will satisfy requirements for the shipment of milk and milk products produced under this regulation to be shipped outside the limits of South Caro lina.

To be considered, the Department must receive comments no later than 5:00 p.m. on April 27, 2020, the close of the Notice of Drafting comment period. Synopsis: Pursuant to R.61- 34, Raw Milk for Human Consumption, the Department provides sanitation oversight for the production and sale of ra w milk that has not been pasteurized for food safety in South Carolina. The Department proposes amending R.61- 34 to address the further processing and sale of raw milk products, such as cream and buttermilk , and any additional consumer advisory changes tha t would be needed for products that receive further processing or become necessary as a byproduct of further processing (if allowed) . The proposed revisions would also update raw milk standards if needed to align certain requirements with the 2019 version of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (\"PMO\"). Pursuant to R.61- 34.1, Pasteurized Milk and Milk Products, the Department provides sanitation oversight of the production and sale of pasteurized milk and milk products for both intrastate and interstate commerce. The Department proposes incorporating requirements of the 2019 PMO through amendment of R.61- 34.1. The regulation is currently based on the 2013 PMO and will not meet the federal standards after this year. The amendment of R.61- 34.1 to incorporate the updated requirements of the 2019 PMO would enable South Carolina milk producers to continue to meet federal standards and ship milk and milk products for interstate commerce. The Department further proposes clarification of requirements for potable water sources. The Department may also include changes to both regulations for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, and codification, and other regulat ory text improvement. Amendments to both regulations may also inc lude updates to administrative and enforcement provisions. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1- 23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of these proposed amendments. 49 ATTACHMENT C SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES R.61-34 Raw Milk for Human Consumption As of the April 27, 2020, close of the Notice of Drafting c omment period: Name Section Charity Allen President & Founder PBL R.

The raw milk products in the northern SC area are excellent, high quality products, that many of my clients use to help with dairy allergies and sensitivities that they experience when using regular pasteurized, homogenized milk - but do not experience with raw dairy products.

I avoid all pasteurized dairy due to the side effec ts and raw dairy allows me to consume a form of dairy that provides calcium and other nutrients that I would otherwise not be able to. I would love to be able to easily have access to more raw products such as butter, cream, and buttermilk especially from local farmers.

Please consider letting licensed dairies sell products in more places. Department Response: Partially adopted - Consistent with the comment, the Department has proposed to allow the production of raw milk buttermilk and cream pursuant to a permit and in accordance with the proposed requirements of Section VIII.

Raw buttermilk and cream have been found to be very safe in states where they are legal. Raw milk farmers would be able to make a better living and be able to increase their ability to provide more healthy products. Please con sider making raw kefir legal also.

It appears that government officials are considering expanding the availability of raw dairy in South Carolina to Cream and Buttermilk. I v ote yes on this and ask the officials involved in this decision to do the same. Raw milk has healthfully nourished generations of people for thousands of years.

Date: January 7, 2021 To: South Carolina Board of H ealth and Environmental Control From: Division of Healthcare Quality Re: Continuation of Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regul ation Amending R.61-24, Licensed Midwives , Document No. 4974 I. Introduction The Division of Healthcare Qua lity (\"Healthcare Quality\") propo ses amending Regulation 61-24, Licensed Midwives , pursuant to South Carolina Code Sections 44-1-140 et seq ., which enables the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") to establish an d enforce basic standards for the licensure of midwives and midwifery services to ensure the safe and adequ ate treatment of persons served in this state. The proposed amendments incorporate and revise provision s relating to statutory mandates, update definitions to conform to the terminology widely used and under stood within the provider community, and revise requirements for scope of practice, incident reporting, continuing education training requirements, prescription medication administration, client and neonate care and services, infection control, monetary penalties, and other requirements for licensure. The Administra tive Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1- 23-120(A), requires General Asse mbly review of these proposed a mendments. II. Facts 1.

Gwen Thompson Deputy Director Healthcare Quality Attachments: A. Summary of Additional Informa tion and Revisions, Presented a t December 10, 2020, Board Meeting ATTACHMENT A SUMMARY OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND REVISIONS R. 61-24, Licensed Midwives Use of Lidocaine Issue: Some commenters stated they cannot suture without injectable li docaine and the proposed amendment only allows topical lidocaine. Current Regulation: Section N. Prohibitions in the Practice of Midwifery. 1. Medications. The midwife shall not administer any dr ugs or injections of any kind, except as indicated in Sections G.5 and M.2.b. Section G. 5. Medications. Drugs or medications s hall be administered only after consultation with and prescription by, a physician. The midwife shall not administer any drugs or medications except: a. For control of postpartum hemorrhage; b. When administering medication in accordance w ith regulations governing the prevention of infant blindness; c. When administering RhoGAM in accordance with accepted standards of professional practice. Section M.2. Examples of Emergency Measures. These are: b. Intramuscular administration of Pitoci n for the control of postpartum hemorrhage. Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: B. The Midwife shall only administer Medications as prescribed by the Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider. The Midwife shall only adm inister the following Prescription Medications: 5. Topical Lidocaine; Justification: Intravascular Lidocaine can cause life threatening hypotension, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Physician and other authorized healthcare providers support the use of to pical Lidocaine in the out of hospital setting, but state that the injection of Lidocaine is risky and should not be required in the setting of a normal, uncomplicated birth. The only reason injected Lidocaine would be required is if women have complex perineal lacerations and for these repairs should be tr ansferred to the hospital for surgical evaluation. Alternative to NFR: Section 1200. B. The Midwife shall only administer Medications as prescribed by the Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider. The Midwife s hall only administer the following Prescription Medications: 5. Topical or one percent (1%) injectable Lidocaine 2 Use of Antihemorrhagics Issue: Some commenters misoprostol in addition to oxytocin a s an antihemorrhagic. Current Regulation: G. 5. Medications. Drugs or medications shall be administered only after consultation with and prescription by, a physician. The midwife shall not administer any drugs or medications except: a. For control of postpartum hemorrhage; Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: Section 1200. B. The Midwife shall only administer Medications as prescribed by the Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider. The Midwife s hall only administer the following Prescription Medications: 4. Oxytocin; Justification: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), t he leading cause of maternal morb idity and mortality globally, is responsible for 130,000 materna l deaths annually. In the United States, 125,000 (2.9%) women who give birth will experience postpartum hemorrhage each year. Postpar tum hemorrhage is defined as blood loss of 500 ml or more within 24 hour s of birth. The average amount of blood loss after the birth of a single baby in vaginal delivery is about 500 ml (or about a half of a quart). The loss of 1000 ml or more is defined as major PPH. The average amount of blood loss for a c esarean birth is approximately 1,000 ml (or one quart). Licensed midwives are trained expe rts in the management of low- risk pregnancy and birth outside of the hospital. PPH with blood loss above 1000 ml would elevate the b irth to high risk, and thus it is outside the midwife's scope of practice. Midwives are required to initiate a medical consultation when high risk medical complications arise such as major PPH. The goal of the consultation is care and interventions that reduce the risk level such that care remains the responsibility of the midwife. A transfer of care is required when the primary care responsibilities required for th e appropriate care of the client fall outside of the midwife's scope of practice. Oxytocin is the recommend drug o f choice for PPH as the first l ine medication. Studies, cited by some midwives, state that in third w orld countries other medications may be used. However, their use is recommended only when oxytocin is not available. Misoprostol is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administr ation for postpartum hemorrhaging. Any such use is considered an off-label use. This medication is also used in combination with another drug to end a pregnancy. The medication may also be used for in duction of cervical softening and dilation in labor. The main problems cite d for the medication are hypers timulation, uterine rupture, and placental abruption. Oxytocin alone is the recommended uterotonic drug fo r the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, and if the hemorrhaging goes beyond use of oxytocin , it has elevated to high risk beyond the midwife's scope of practice. 3 Alternative to NFR: Healthcare Quality does not propo se potential alternative text for this issue. 4 Mandatory 911 Transport Issue: On the requirement to call 911 fo r transfer of care when a deli very proceeds beyond a midwife's scope of care, some commenters stated EMTs do not always arrive in the f astest time and are not trained in neonatal resuscitation and 911 should not be the only option fo r non-emergent transfer of care. Current Regulation: Not specifically addressed in the current regulation. Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: Section 1500. A and B. A. The Midwife shall immediatel y initiate a Transfer of Care d uring intrapartum and postpartum by dialing 911 when the care required is outside the Midwife's sco pe of practice pursuant to Section 400, as recommended by a Physician or o ther Authorized Healthcare Provi der during a Medical Consultation, or for any event during labor that compromises the health of the C lient or Neonate and/or normally requires emergency intervention. B. Upon arrival of the emergency medical services personnel, P hysician, or other Authorized Healthcare Provider, the Midwife shall transfer the care of the Client to the emergency medical services personnel, Physician, or other Authorized Healthcare Provider. The Midwife shall provide information as requested by the emergency me dical services personnel, Physicia n, or other Authorized Healthcare Provider. Justification: The transfers in this section of the proposed amendments are em ergent transfers only. When emergent events during intrapartum and/or postpartum move the pregnancy, birth, and/or condition of the client or neonate beyond the scope of midw ifery care, the client and/or n eonate are no longer considered low-risk and a transfer of care is required. EMS personnel are trained to id entify anatomical and physiologi cal changes that occur during pregnancy, demonstrate normal and abnormal deliveries, summarize signs and symptoms of common gynecological emergencies, and perform neonata l resuscitation. EMS personnel are required by statute to be NREMT certified. This certification in cludes completing a state cert ified training program that includes training in these areas and successfully passi ng the NREMT Cognitive and Ps ychomotor examinations which include questions and skill testing in obstetrics. Each permitted ambulance in the s tate is required to have an ob stetric kit and neonatal resuscitation equipment on board. EMS Agenci es are required to have Protocol s including standing orders for the administration of medications and the provision of treatment fo r mothers and infants. EMS personnel are required to maintain online medical control w ith a physician via two way radio, have the knowledge of which hospitals h ave the perinatal levels of c are for the specific patient, and transport patients to the nearest hospital to meet the needs and care of both the Client and the infant. EMS Agencies are required to have staffing pa tterns and, if necessary, mutu al aid agreements to ensure that an ambulance is en route with at least one EMT and one driver onb oard to all emergent responses within 5 five (5) minutes or the next closest staffed ambulance must be dispatched, excluding prearranged transports . Alternative to NFR: 1501. Non-emergent Transfer of Care A. The Midwife shall develop, pri or to thirty-six (36) weeks ge station, a written non-emergent transfer plan with participation of the C lient, as evidenced by their si gnatures and date. The Midwife shall implement the written plan at th e time of need and maintain doc umentation of the plan in the Client's record. B. In the event of non-emergent transfer of care for a Client t he Midwife shall accompany the Client to the hospital and remain with the Client until Transfer of Care is complete. If the Client declines the midwife accompanying the Client to the hospital and remaining w ith the Client until Transfer of Care is complete, then the Midwife sha ll secure documentation, evidence d by signature and date, that the Client declines the midwife's care. The Midwife shall not be the dri ver of the vehicle transporting the Client. 1502. Emergent Transfer of Care A. The Midwife shall immediatel y initiate an emergent Transfer of Care during intrapartum and postpartum by dialing 911 when the care required is outside the Midwife's scope of practice pursuant to Section 400, as recommended by a Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider during a Medical Consultation, or for any event during labor that compromises th e health of the Client or Neonate and/or normally requires emergency intervention. B. Upon arrival of the emergency medical services personnel, Ph ysician, or other Authorized Healthcare Provider, the Midwife shall tran sfer the care of the Client to the emergency medical services personnel, Physician, or other Authorized H ealthcare Provider. The Midwife shall provide information as requested by the emergency medical services personnel, Physician, or othe r Authorized Healthcare Provider. 6 Physician Sign-off on Low Risk Issue: Public comments were made that a written and signed statement b y the Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider that he or s he has determined to the best o f his or her ability that the pregnancy is a Low Risk Pregnancy is not possible. Current Regulation: D. Scope of Practice. The licensed midwife may provide care to low-risk women and neonates determined by medical evaluation to be prospectively normal for pregnancy and childbirth F. Prenatal Care. 1. Required Visits. The midwife shall, upon accep tance of a woman for care, require her to have two visits with a physician, community health center or he alth department. One of these visits must be in the final six weeks of pregnancy. The midwife shall make entries in the patient's record of the physician, health center, or health department visits. Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: 1101. A. Initial Physical Examination: 1. The Midwife shall require the Client to und ergo an initial Physical Examination completed by a Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider between ten (10) weeks and twenty (20) weeks of gestation. The Midwife may accept Clients after twenty (20) weeks of gestation provided the Client has undergone a Physical Examination that meet s the requirements in Section 1100.A.2. 2. The Midwife shall ensure the initial Physical Examination of the Client is documented in the Client's record and includes: a. A written and signed statement by the Physi cian or other Authorized Healthcare Provider that he or she has determined to the best of his or her ability that the pregnancy is a Low Risk Pregnancy as defined by this regulation; and b. Identification of special conditions and/or care required. B. Second Physical Examination: 1. The Midwife shall require the Client to un dergo a second Physical Examination completed by a Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider after thirty-four (34) weeks of gestation. 2. The Midwife shall ensure the second Physical Ex amination of the Client is documented in the Client's record and includes: a. A written and signed statement from the Physician or other Author ized Healthcare Provider that the pregnancy remains a Low Risk Pregnancy and the fetus is in the vertex position; and b. Orders for Medications need ed for intrapartum and postpartum. 7 Justification: This requirement is a clarifica tion of the current required doc umentation. Requiring a Physical Examination rather than a Medical Consultation is consistent wi th other regulations. S.C. Code 44-89- 60(4) requires a physician to mak e a written determination tha t the planned birth is low risk. The requirement for signatures for verification are consistent with other Department regulations. Alternative to NFR: 1101. Initial Physical Examination: A. The Midwife shall require the Client to undergo an initial Physical Examination completed by a Physician or other Authorized H ealthcare Provider between eight (8) weeks and twenty (20) weeks of gestation. The Midwife may accept Clients after twenty (20) wee ks of gestation provided the Client has undergone a Physical Examination that meets the requirements in Section 1100.A.2. B. The Midwife shall ensure the initial Physical Examination of the Client is documented in the Client's record and includes a written and signed documentation by the Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider verifying the following information: 1 . T h e C l i e n t ' s n a m e a n d d a t e o f b i r t h ; 2 . T h e a d d r ess of the facility and date of the appointment; 3 . T h e e s t i m a t e d g e s t a t i o n a l a g e ; 4 . I d e n t i f i c a t i o n o f s p e c i a l c onditions and/or care required; and 5 . T h e P h y s i c i a n o r o t h e r A u t h o r i z e d H e a l t h c a r e P r o v i d e r h a s determined to the best of his or her ability at the time of the appointment that: a .

Orders for maternal and ne onatal Medications needed for in trapartum, and postpartum and newborn periods. 9 Emergent Blood Loss Amount Issue: Public comment made related to the amount of blood loss due to PPH. Current Regulation : K. Maternal Conditions Requiring Physician Referral or Consultation. At any time in the maternity cycle, the midwife shall obtain medical consultation, or refer for medical care, any woman who: 43. Has bleeding of over three cups before or after delivery of placenta; Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: 1300. B. The Midwife shall obtain a Medical Consu ltation for Clients or Neonates presenting any of the following conditions: 3. Postpartum to include: b . H e m o r r h a g e g r e a t e r t h a n o n e t h o u s a n d m illiliters (1000 ml), and bleeding is uncontrolled; Justification: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), t he leading cause of maternal morb idity and mortality globally, is responsible for 130,000 mater nal deaths annually. In the Uni ted States, 125,000 (2.9%) women who give birth will expe rience postpartum hemorrhage each year. Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as blood lo ss of 500 ml or more within 24 hours of birth. The average amount of blood loss after the birth of a single baby in vaginal delivery is about 500 ml (or about a half of a quart). The loss of 1000 ml or more is defined as major PPH. The avera ge amount of blood loss for a cesarean birth is approximately 1,000 ml (or one quart). The amount id entified in the current regulation equates to approximately 700 ml. Studies show that visual estimation of blood loss increases in error as the amount of blood loss increases. Visual estimation is the means by which the amount of blood los s during delivery is determined. When determining how much blood can be lost before the situation is determined to be emergent, one should take into account a margin of erro r along with the loss of bloo d that will occur while waiting for transport and arrival to the hospital. Licensed midwives are trained expe rts in the management of low- risk pregnancy and birth outside of the hospital. PPH with blood loss above 1000 ml would elevate the b irth to high risk, and thus it is outside the midwife's scope of practice. Midwives are required to initiate a medical consultation when high risk medical complications arise such as major PPH. The goal of the consultation is care and interventions that reduce the risk level such that care remains the responsibility of the midwife. A transfer of care is required when the primary care responsibilities required for th e appropriate care of the client fall outside of the midwife's scope of practice. Alternative to NFR: 1300. B.

Current Regulation: D. Scope of Practice. The licensed midwife may provide care to low-risk women and neonates determined by medical evaluation to be prospectively normal for pregnancy and childbirth Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: Section 400. D. The Midwife shall not perform any of the following: 2. Provision of care for a Client with a previous cesarean section; Justification: It was and is the Department's position that VBACs are not low- risk deliveries and are therefore outside the scope of practice for licensed midwives. VBAC deliveries re quire continuous electronic fetal monitoring and attendance by li censed health care personnel fam iliar with potential complications. Uterine rupture often is sudden and may be catastrophic, and no accurate antenatal predictors of uterine rupture have been identified H owever the most common sign ind icative of uterine rupture is fetal heart rate abnormality, which has been associated with up to 70% of c ases of uterine ruptures. Licensed Midwives do not provide continuous fetal heart rate monitoring in the home. Not only have they requested to do intermittent fetal heart rate monitoring, they have requested to perform the monitoring at a less frequent rate than best practice. The South Carolina Board of Nursing does not endorse Certified Nurse Midwives to perform VBAC deliveries out of the acute care (hospital) setting and acknowl edges that VBAC deliveries only be performed within facilities capable of implementing emergency a nd surgical interventions. There was mention of information comparing VBAC outcomes in Sou th Carolina home births as compared to other states. This data is unavailable as VBACs are currently outside the scope of practice for South Carolina licensed midwives. A VBAC is the result of a successful Trial of Labor after Cesar ean (TOLAC). TOLAC is associated with the risk of uterine rupture which can cause brain damage or dea th of the baby and result in serious hemorrhage or hysterectomy in t he mother. VBAC poses more medi cal risks to the baby than a scheduled repeat c-section. A repeat c-sec tion poses more medical risks to the mother than VBAC. A C-section after a failed TOLAC is associate d with more risks than a c-sec tion done before labor has begun. Of the states that regulate midwives, nine do not permit VBACS, eleven allow them with stringent restrictions, and seven allow them with informed consent of the risks.

Issue: Some commenters state that the definition in the proposed revis ions may not be consistent with that suggested by NARM Current Regulation: Section A. 2. m. Midwifery Instructor. A physician, certified nurse- midwife or licensed midwife, licensed in the State of South Carolina, who has a supervisory rel ationship with an apprentice midwife. Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: 101.Z. Midwifery Preceptor. A Physician, Certified Nurse-Midwife, or Midwife, licensed in South Carolina, who has a supervisory relationship with an Apprentice Midwife. Justification: A NARM Registered Preceptor is a midwife who meets requirements for supervising CPM candidates and has current, approved registration through NARM. The Registered Preceptor must b e credentialed as a Certified Pr ofessional Midwife (CPM), Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM), Certified Mi dwife (CM); or he or she must be a licensed practitioner legally recognized by a state/jurisdiction to provide maternity care. A preceptor must have an additional three years of experience after creden tialing or fifty primary births beyond entry-level CPM requirements. Additionally, he or she must also have ten continuity of care b irths beyond entry-level CPM requirements. A preceptor must have attended a minimum of ten out-of-hospital births in the last three years. The proposed regulation allows midwives licensed in South Carol ina to practice the full scope of midwifery care and services as required by NARM for an apprenti ce midwife to practice and to show evidence of mastering skills throug h demonstration. There are some skills required by NARM for the apprentice to learn but that are not within the scope of practi ce in current and proposed regulation. NARM has allowed for those skills to be \"simulated\" by the appr entice as many states do not permit such skills to be included in the sc ope of practice for a direct ent ry midwife. Twenty-five Apprentice Midwives have received their NARM certif ication since the promulgation of the current regulation in 2013. Alternative to NFR: Healthcare Quality does not propo se potential alternative text for this issue. 13 Laceration Repairs. Issue: Some commenters stated that the performance of first and second -degree laceration repairs is within the scope of direct entry midwives. Other commenters, representing obstetricians and physicians, indicate that there could be long-term d amage if these procedures are no t performed properly and with adequate training. Current Regulation: N. Prohibitions in the Practice of Midwifery. 2. Surgical Procedures. The midwife shall not p erform any operative procedures or surgical repairs other than artificial rupture of membranes at the intr oitus, and clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord or as noted above in an emergency. Notice of Final Regulation (NFR) R. 61-24: C. The Midwife and Apprentice Midwife may perform any of the fo llowing after submitting signed and dated documentation to the Depar t m e n t o f t h e M i d w i f e r y B r i d g e C ertificate, Midwifery Education Accreditation Council, American College of Nurse-Midwives, or o ther Department-approved training course completion on the 2. Suturing of first-degree and second-degree tears; and Justification: A vaginal tear is a laceration to the perineum (the area betwee n the vagina and rectum) that occurs when the baby is pushed out. The tears are spontaneous, meaning no o ne made a cut. Vaginal tears are very common as 85% - 90% of first-time births result in vaginal tea rs. Rates of tearing are lower for subsequent births, roughly 60% tear, as well as for those givi ng birth with midwives. There are four degrees of vaginal tears. A first degree tear is a shallow tear to the skin of the perineum. Sometimes a first degr ee tear needs stitches, and oth er times it can heal without stitches. A Second degree tear is a tear t o the skin and muscle layers of the perineum. Second degree tears heal better when they are repaired w ith stitches. A third degree tea r is a tear through the perineal muscles and into the ring-shaped muscle that surrounds the anus (the an al sphincter). A fourth degree tear goes through the anal sphincter and into the anus. Alternative to NFR: C. The Midwife and Apprentice Midwife may perform any of the following after submitting signed and dated documentation to the Department of the Midwifery Bridge Certificate, Midwifery Education Accreditation Council, American College of Nurse Midw ives, or other Department approved training course completion on the topic: 2.
