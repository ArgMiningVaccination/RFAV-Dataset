[Understanding Resistance Mechanism to Enhance CAR-T Immunotherapy for MCL](/award/understanding-resistance-mechanism-enhance-car-t-immunotherapy-mcl) Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized by resistance to standard treatments and short survival. For the 2023 LLS MCLII Synergistic Team Award, we have assembled a team of leaders in basic, translational, and clinical research in MCL to tackle the current significant obstacles in understanding and treating MCL. In the last decade, we investigated the therapy resistance mechanism of MCL, and pioneered clinical trials for targeted therapies (ibrutinib, lenalidomide) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy. However, despite these dramatic advancements, resistance to these newer therapies, including targeted therapy and CAR-T cells, is seen in over 50% of patients. Thus, it remains an unmet need to better define the mechanisms of resistance and then develop rationally designed strategies to overcome resistance. The overall goal of this Synergistic Team Award is to develop improved curative therapies for patients with MCL at relapse. The goals will be addressed in three highly focused, independent but highly integrated projects that utilize state-of-the-art genomic technologies, patient-derived xenograft models, clinical data and primary MCL samples. With the joint effort of our laboratories, highly interactive and accomplished scientists, and physician researchers from multiple institutions with expertise in MCL and therapy, we are uniquely poised to develop improved next-generation of combination therapy for relapsed MCL patients.Program: Mantle Cell Lymphoma Research Initiative Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2027 [Pilot trial of microbial targeting to prevent myeloma](/award/pilot-trial-microbial-targeting-prevent-myeloma) Our recent studies have identified specific bacteria that can potentially promote the growth of human myeloma tumor cells.

All parameters will be integrated through biostatistical and artificial intelligence tools to establish a comprehensive model of relapse prediction and optimal salvage treatment. The proposal is conducted by the Eu-MCL-Network which is the largest group conducting clinical and translational research worldwide in MCL including the largest phase III trials ever conducted. MULTIPLY will exploit the extensive dataset and tissue bank of the TRIANGLE trial that will be presented as abstract #1 at the ASH plenary session. This study will establish a novel standard by the addition of ibrutinib to first-line treatment, but will also raise relevant issues for prediction and management of disease relapse in first-line BTK-era. The expected results will be the generation of comprehensive integrated models for relapse prediction MCL and development of an effective platform to develop rational chemotherapy-free strategies based on genetic alterations of the malignant cell and innovative biomarker-driven strategies.Program: Mantle Cell Lymphoma Research Initiative Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2027 [Identifying the oncogenic cooperation between IRF4 and MYD88l265p and their impact on the Tumor Microenvironment of Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia](/award/identifying-oncogenic-cooperation-between-irf4-and-myd88l265p-and-their-impact-tumor) Although many patients with IgM MGUS remain asymptomatic, some of them progress to Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) requiring treatment. Recently, we have found that the hereditable alteration of IRF4 gene increases the risk to develop WM, however little is known on the molecular mechanisms responsible for this feature. In this project, we aim to elucidate the role of the germline alteration of IRF4 in promoting WM through oncogenic cooperation with MYD88 and dysregulated immune microenvironment, ultimately paving the way for novel precision therapies for this patient population.Program: Special Grants Project Term: Start Date: August 21, 2023 End Date: August 20, 2025 [New Targeted Therapies for Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia](/award/new-targeted-therapies-pediatric-acute-myeloid-leukemia) Our research focuses on the preclinical evaluation of new targeted therapies for high-risk subtypes of childhood AML. We are deploying screening approaches to delete each gene, one-by-one, to identify genes whose deletion leads to death of the leukemia cells. We will evaluate drugs developed against these targets in state-of-the-art models of pediatric AML. Our goal is to translate the most promising findings to clinical trials for children with these very poor outcome subsets of AML.Program: Dare to Dream Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, [](/award-recipient/zachary-epstein-peterson) Zachary Epstein-Peterson, MD Memorial aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma associated with poor clinical outcomes in response to current therapeutic approaches. Recurrent oncogenic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) have been identified in patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and this represents a targetable lesion in other malignancies. However, comprehensive investigations of mutant IDH2 inhibition in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma are lacking, and this may represent a new therapeutic avenue for a patient population in need of newer treatmentsProgram: Academic Clinical Trials Program (ACT) Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [A Multi-Center, Multi-National Investigation of Survivorship and Patient-Reported Symptoms in Erdheim-Chester Disease](/award/multi-center-multi-national-investigation-survivorship-and-patient-reported-symptoms-erdheim) Advances in the treatment of Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) have led to a growing survivor population; however, there is a lack of information on the burden of chronic health problems, symptomatology, psychological dysfunction, and mortality experienced by this group of individuals. We propose a multi-institutional international study in collaboration with the ECD Global Alliance to answer these critical questions. Results from our study will help in counseling patients in the clinic about what to expect in the future and develop interventions to reduce the risk of health issues and disease or treatment-related symptoms.Program: Special Grants Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2025 [Aberrant Megakaryopoiesis in the MPNs](/award/aberrant-megakaryopoiesis-mpns) A key feature of the MPNs is aberrant megakaryopoiesis, including increased numbers of platelet-producing and atypical megakaryocytes that drive fibrosis in myelofibrosis (MF). Recent studies have found that increased activity of the chromosome 21 kinase DYRK1A, which is a feature of the MPNs, enhances megakaryocyte growth while its loss suppresses their expansion. This effect appears to be mediated, at least in part, by DYRK1A's control of NFAT2 phosphorylation and subcellular localization. The goals of this research are to determine whether DYRK1A is a therapeutic target in chronic phase MPNs and to define the contributions of NFAT2 phosphorylation to the disease.Program: Special Grants Project Term: Start Date: February 1, 2023 End Date: January 31, 2024 [](/award-recipient/robert-orlowski) Robert Orlowski, PhD, MD The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer CenterHouston, Texas [Targeting HSP70 to Immune Effector Cells to Overcome the Immune Suppressive Myeloma Microenvironment](/award/targeting-hsp70-immune-effector-cells-overcome-immune-suppressive-myeloma-microenvironment) Development of a strong anti-cancer immune response requires coordinated action of the innate and adaptive parts of the immune system, but cancer cells alter their environment to suppress virtually every step in this process, which promotes cancer progression and treatment resistance. One promising strategy could be to target Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immunity, and we therefore developed a series of novel antibodies to HSP70, one of which cured mice of multiple myeloma. Based on strong preliminary data, we propose additional studies to better understand how this antibody activates various types of immune cells, how it works against both cancer cells and modifies the immune environment in mouse models, and how it could work even better in combination with other agents against myeloma. Since this antibody is already being developed into a drug for phase I clinical trials, these studies will directly inform its use in the clinic against multiple myeloma, and possibly against other blood-related cancers such as B-cell lymphomas.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [211Astatine-CD123 Radioimmunotherapy for Cancer (Stem) Cell-Directed Treatment of Acute Leukemia](/award/211astatine-cd123-radioimmunotherapy-cancer-stem-cell-directed-treatment-acute-leukemia) Because acute leukemias are very sensitive to radiation, radioisotopes are ideal payloads to arm antibodies against these difficult-to-cure, aggressive blood cancers. Here, we will develop fully human anti-CD123 antibodies carrying the highly potent alpha-emitter astatine-211 (211At) as a new therapy for acute leukemia. CD123 is broadly displayed on acute leukemia cells in most patients and overexpressed on leukemic stem cells but is only found on a small subset of normal blood cells, enabling the use of 211At-CD123 radioimmunotherapy in the transplant and non-transplant setting with limited toxicities to normal tissues.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Stem cell features and Notch signaling in p53 deleted multiple myeloma](/award/stem-cell-features-and-notch-signaling-p53-deleted-multiple-myeloma) We have investigated the consequences of p53 loss on stem cell properties, namely clonogenic growth, self-renewal, and drug resistance in multiple myeloma. We have found that both the level of Notch signaling and BCMA impact these properties, and we will explore novel strategies to improve outcomes in p53 mutant multiple myeloma.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Development of a novel BCL2L1 armored CAR T-cell and a tumor-immune interactome in multiple myeloma](/award/development-novel-bcl2l1-armored-car-t-cell-and-tumor-immune-interactome-multiple-myeloma) Novel immune approaches have revolutionized the treatment paradigms in multiple myeloma (MM) with deep responses seen in heavily pretreated patients. However responses are largely not durable with significant gaps remaining in our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the immune escape to to CAR T cells and T cell engagers. Harnessing the power of single cell immunogenomics and building on the knowledge we amassed to date, we plan to address these therapeutics and mechanistic challenges firstly through the informed design and clinical development of a BCL2L1 armoured BCMA-targeting CAR T cell, and secondly by establishing a dictionary of the MM-TME interactome through serial interrogation of primary MM cells and their immunome generating a dynamic risk prediction model to better guide the delivery of immuno-therapeutics.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [NK cell immunotherapy to reduce relapse after haploidentical transplant for high-risk pediatric AML](/award/nk-cell-immunotherapy-reduce-relapse-after-haploidentical-transplant-high-risk-pediatric-aml) Leukemia recurrence remains the most common type of treatment failure after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant for children and young adults with high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), occurring in 40-50% of patients. Novel treatment strategies are needed to attain durable remissions and provide long-term cure. We have developed a novel memory-like (ML) NK cell immunotherapy that has demonstrated potent activity against AML in preclinical and early clinical studies. We propose a new clinical trial combining donor-derived ML NK cells adoptive cellular therapy with modified T cell-depleted haploidentical HCT to enhance graft-versus-leukemia and reduce relapse in pediatric and young adult patients with high-risk AML.Program: Academic Clinical Trials Program (ACT) Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [A phase 1b/2 T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive leukemia with limited treatment options after first-line chemotherapy. Our preclinical work in animal models of T-ALL demonstrated the activity of a novel-novel combination treatment strategy, which includes LP-118 (activator of suicide pathways within leukemic (inhibiting growth-promoting LCK and ACK1 signaling pathways). Leveraging the mechanistic insights gained from our laboratory work, we propose a phase Ib/II study investigating the feasibility and efficacy of the combined LP-118, ponatinib, and salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed T-ALL.

We have generated a novel anti-B7-H3 monoclonal antibody (T-1A5) to block B7-H3 function, showing the best in vitro and in vivo activity against AML cells.

We have recently uncovered that RSPO3-LGR4 pathway is a key regulator of leukemia-initiating cell activity and is exclusively activated in relapsed and refractory AML. Our project aims to investigate the mechanistic link between the pathway activation and therapy resistance, and design combination therapies that would overcome resistance and improve the treatment of relapsed leukemia.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Understanding molecular determinants of immune evasion to CAR-T cells at single clone resolution](/award/understanding-molecular-determinants-immune-evasion-car-t-cells-single-clone-resolution) Cellular immunotherapies such CAR-T cells are now firmly established as major pillars of anti-cancer therapy particularly in B-cell malignancies. However, despite their remarkable success in mediating an objective clinical response in up to 90% of patients, long-term durable remissions remain confined to only a minority of patients. It is now increasingly apparent that genetic evolution through the acquisition of new mutations cannot solely explain the molecular basis for therapeutic resistance. Therefore, to meet our ambition of precision medicine we need a better understanding of both the genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of malignant clonal dominance and therapeutic adaptation. To address this important challenge, we have developed new ex vivo and in vivo (mouse models) of resistance to CAR-T therapy. These will be coupled to a synthetic clone tracing strategy termed SPLINTR (Single-cell Profiling and LINeage Tracing) using expressed barcodes. In this proposal we will use SPLINTR in our models to uncover the clone intrinsic properties of cancer cells that enable them to evade these pioneering cellular immunotherapies. This research will deliver a blueprint around which future clinical trial strategies could be enabled to improve outcomes with these ground-breaking therapies.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Targeting GCK as a novel and selective therapeutic strategy against RAS mutated Multiple Myeloma](/award/targeting-gck-novel-and-selective-therapeutic-strategy-against-ras-mutated-multiple-myeloma) RAS/MAPK mutations are the key drivers in MM, which occurs in 50% of newly diagnosed and higher in relapsed MM patients. However, RAS remains undruggable in MM. We found that RAS mutation MM growth is highly dependent on germinal center kinase(GCK). The goal of this project is to develop small molecule inhibitors against GCK with the expected outcome to provide novel treatments for relapsed/refractory and especially multi-drug resistant MM with RAS mutation, as well as other B-cell malignancies.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Inhibition PKC as BTK inhibitor CLL](/award/inhibition-pkcb-strategy-btk-inhibitor-refractory-cll) Patients with CLL that have progressed on BTK inhibitors have high risk disease with few clinical options. Here we propose a novel, selective inhibitor of PKC, MS-553, as a strategy for these patients. Our project will evaluate this drug alone and in combination with venetoclax preclinically and will perform correlative studies from an ongoing phase 1/2 trial of this drug alone and in combination with venetoclax.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [CD70-directed CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of relapsed/refractory pediatric AML](/award/cd70-directed-car-t-cell-therapy-treatment-relapsedrefractory-pediatric-aml) In this project, we will test an innovative therapy called CAR T-cell therapy for children with a type of cancer called AML.

DHL has been linked to very poor outcomes when treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Effective treatments to prevent treatment failure remain a critical unmet need. This proposal will develop novel, mechanism-based therapeutic regimens for DHL that overcome chemotherapy resistance and defective immune surveillance to improve outcomes.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [](/award-recipient/yubin-zhou) Yubin Zhou, PhD, MBBS Texas A&M Institute of Biosciences and TechnologyCollege Station, Texas [Development of mutant GTPase-specific degraders for peripheral T cell lymphoma treatment](/award/development-mutant-gtpase-specific-degraders-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-treatment) This project aims to develop targeted therapies against peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), a diverse group of aggressive blood cancers with poor clinical outcomes. This project is tightly relevant to cancer control and treatment, promising to advance our understanding on how blood cancers initiate and progress, and lead to new therapeutics for the treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). We will develop targeted therapeutics to engage an oncogenic RHOA GTPase mutant to treat PTCL and other types of tumors with similar genetic backgrounds.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Developing Novel CAR-T Cell Therapy For Hematologic Malignancies](/award/developing-novel-car-t-cell-therapy-hematologic-malignancies) We observed that patients with many hematologic cancers expressed high levels of DKK1 and generated novel human DKK1-A2 CAR-T cells that can kill cancer cells from HLA-A2+ patients with myeloma, lymphoma, or leukemia. We also found that Th9-polarized T cells have enhanced antitumor effects in vivo. In this proposal, we will determine 1) whether and how Th9-polarized DKK1-A2 CAR-T cells are promising effector T cells for immunotherapy of human patients, and 2) whether Th9-polarized DKK1-A2 CAR-T cells are associated with reduced on- and off-target toxicities. Completing these studies are critical for developing new and effective CAR-T therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies who are still dying from the disease.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July End Date: inflammatory microenvironment in myeloma](/award/targeting-acetyl-coa-synthetase-2-remodel-obesity-evoked-inflammatory-microenvironment) Our proposal aims to develop a novel strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy for patients with multiple myeloma by remodeling obesity-induced inflammatory microenvironment. We hypothesize that acetyl-CoA synthetase 2, which is stimulated by obesity, enhances inflammatory cytokine production from myeloma cells, leading to an inflammatory niche where anti-tumor function of CD8+ T cells is dampened, and tumor growth is promoted. Our study will be the first to explore a novel insight for how obesity impacts the interaction between myeloma cells and microenvironment. In preparation of using the inhibitor of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 in the clinical setting, we will establish its potential as a single agent or in combination of other chemo- or immuno- drugs to treat myeloma.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Developing selective inhibitors of complex for myeloma therapy](/award/developing-selective-inhibitors-b-cateninbcl9-transcriptional-complex-myeloma-therapy) The b-catenin/BCL9 transcriptional complex, is a novel dependency in multiple myeloma (MM). Disruption of this complex inhibits MM cell growth in culture and in MM xenograft models. Development of potent selective b-catenin/BCL9 inhibitors will provide valuable tools to further investigate their mechanism of MM inhibition. We have established a chemistry, structural biology, and molecular pathology platform to facilitate novel inhibitor development, and explore its translational potential in MM.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Memory-like natural killer cells and venetoclax to eradicate measurable residual disease in AML](/award/memory-natural-killer-cells-and-venetoclax-eradicate-measurable-residual-disease-aml) This proposal is to conduct a phase I (early phase) clinical trial to test whether the combination of the approved targeted therapy venetoclax with memory-like Natural Killer (NK) cells is safe and active in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on laboratory research at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, we believe that the addition of memory-like NK cells obtained from an haploidentical ('half matched') donor will be able to eradicate residual leukemia cells left over after prior venetoclax treatment and hence prevent a future relapse of the disease. A total of 10 patients will be treated with two different doses of NK cells and a constant dose of venetoclax. We also plan scientific studies on patient samples to learn more about the function of NK cells when combined with venetoclax, evaluate for clearance of residual leukemia cells with this combination therapy and explore potential resistance mechanisms.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Designed biosensor to enhance CAR T cell therapy for multiple myeloma](/award/designed-biosensor-enhance-car-t-cell-therapy-multiple-myeloma) We will develop a novel T cell therapy strategy for multiple myeloma (MM) that will combine existing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with a novel designed biosensor responding to soluble factors abundantly present in the MM bone marrow environment in patients. The biosensor will be expressed as novel type of chimeric receptor in T cells concomitantly with the CAR and signal the T cells to persist longer and keep eliminating cancer cells from the body. We will deeply characterize the effects of our novel biosensor in CAR T cells to precisely understand how the treatment works. If successful, we expect that CAR T cell therapy for MM can be made more efficient, and the same strategy could potentially also be applied to other cancer types.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: September 1, 2023 End Date: August 31, 2026 [Health Insurance and End-of-Life Care for People with Hematologic Malignancies](/award/health-insurance-and-end-life-care-people-hematologic-malignancies) Patients with blood cancers from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to experience suboptimal end-of-life (EOL) care. These disparities may be partially driven by health insurance differences but there is limited research examining insurance access as a potential contributor to EOL care disparities for this population. We will leverage complementary local and national datasets to assess the relationship between insurance status and type with EOL quality measures. We will also develop a Blood Cancer Health Insurance Initiative to translate our research findings to policy initiatives to dismantle disparities in access to high-quality EOL care for patients with blood cancers.

It will also evaluate the association of cost sharing with patient abandonment of OAM prescriptions for blood cancers and conduct simulations under alternative cost sharing scenarios to inform policy reform proposals among commercially insured enrollees. Finally, the study will evaluate the effect of cost-sharing reductions under the Inflation Reduction Act on patient abandonment of new OAM prescriptions for blood cancers among Medicare Part D enrollees, overall and by sociodemographic factors.Program: Equity in Access Project Term: Start Date: June 1, 2023 End Date: May 31, 2026 [Investigating the Impact of Insurance Coverage on Access to Care and Outcomes among Lymphoma Patients](/award/investigating-impact-insurance-coverage-access-care-and-outcomes-among-lymphoma-patients) In this proposal we will investigate the association between insurance coverage and access to care, survival, and financial hardship among patients across Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes and to what extent insurance coverage explains and modifies racial disparity in access to care and outcomes. To this end, we will use the Optum Clinformatics DataMart database, the Texas Cancer Registry, the Harris Health System Cancer Database and Data from the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) Cohort Study. These four databases will provide a sample that covers a diverse patient population in terms of insurance coverage, race and ethnicity, and geographic regions. The LEO Cohort Study also provides information on self-reported financial toxicity that is not available in cancer registries, administrative claims data, or surveys. This study will reveal whether insurance coverage, neighborhood socioeconomic factors and healthcare resources are associated with access to care and outcomes of NHL patients.Program: Equity in Access Project Term: Start Date: June 1, 2023 End Date: May 31, 2026 [Towards Equity in Specialized Cancer Care for Adolescents and Young Adults with Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia](/award/towards-equity-specialized-cancer-care-adolescents-and-young-adults-newly-diagnosed-acute) Our study is designed to directly inform the pathways through which health insurance influences access to care at an SCC for individuals with AYA ALL using a combination of cancer registry, survey, and cost-benefit analyses. This research will contribute to knowledge of the implications of health insurance coverage on ALL cancer care in young adults and inform policy-relevant solutions, including determining whether patients are bypassing an SCC for treatment at a more distant facility, calculating estimates of insurance acceptance and access challenges at ALL treating facilities and identifying the financial implications of shifting care to SCCs with demonstrated survival improvements for this population.Program: Equity in Access Project Term: Start Date: June 1, 2023 End Date: May 31, 2026 [The Impossible Choice: The Role of Insurance Design on Financial Toxicity and Access to Care for Individuals with Blood Cancer](/award/impossible-choice-role-insurance-design-financial-toxicity-and-access-care-individuals-blood) The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of insurance design on financial toxicity and access to care among individuals with blood cancer. To understand this interplay, we will use a unique and innovative linkage of the 2012-2019 Colorado Cancer Registry (CCR) to the 2013-2021 Colorado All-Payer Claims Database and the LexisNexis and TranUnion financial and life event databases. Our specific aims are to 1) Estimate the number of individuals with blood cancer who are potentially underinsured over time relative to individuals with solid tumors or no history of cancer; 2) Examine the relationship between being underinsured and experiencing financial toxicity after diagnosis in individuals diagnosed with blood cancer relative to those with solid tumors or no history of cancer; and 3) Examine differences in access to cancer care including time to treatment, treatment intensity and survival in underinsured individuals with blood cancer versus those with more generous insurance coverage.Program: Equity in Access Project Term: Start Date: June 1, 2023 End Date: May 31, 2026 [Pharmacological strategies to enhance T- and NK-cell-based therapies in blood cancers](/award/pharmacological-strategies-enhance-t-and-nk-cell-based-therapies-blood-cancers) Although they represent a major therapeutic progress for blood cancers, CAR-T cells and other T-cell based therapies are subject to eventual development of resistance to many patients. Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies are highly active against many types of blood cancer cells which are resistant to T cells, but in our CRISPR studies death receptor signaling defects emerge as a common downstream mechanism of resistance to both T- and NK-cell therapies. Building on extensive pharmacological and genomic screens, this project will specifically examine the role of SMAC mimetics and JAK/STAT inhibitors in enhancing the response of blood cancer cells (e.g., multiple myeloma, leukemias) to CAR-T or NK cell therapies. We will place emphasis of studies with patient-derived samples in vitro (Integrated Functional Immune Profiling Platform) and in vivo, including humanized bone marrow-like scaffolds, to provide a translationally-relevant simulation of the potential of these compounds to enhance the clinical activity of cell-based immunotherapies in blood cancers.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, End Date: June [Targeting mutated MYD88 pro-survival signaling in B-cell malignancies](/award/targeting-mutated-myd88-pro-survival-signaling-b-cell-malignancies) Our laboratory and those of others discovered highly recurring mutations in the gene MYD88 which are found in patients with various B-cell cancers including Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (95-97%), ABC (10%) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (5-10%). Our laboratory and those of others showed that mutated MYD88 triggers BTK, which is the target of BTK-inhibitors like ibrutinib, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib though complete remissions are rare with these agents largely in part because other pro-survival molecules are activated by mutated MYD88 such as HCK and IRAK1. In these studies, we will develop potent and selective inhibitors to HCK and IRAK1, including PROTACs which inhibit and degrade these molecules, using lead molecules and scaffolds whose target selectivity and activity we previously validated. We will also investigate the mechanisms underlying the inactivation of the Inhibitor of BTK (IBTK) as a potential new target for development of inhibitors for use in MYD88 mutated lymphomas.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: 1, 2023 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Fecal microbiota transplantation to prevent acute GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation](/award/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-prevent-acute-gvhd-after-allogeneic-stem-cell) In up to half of patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the trajectory of a smooth recovery toward cure is disrupted by acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Inspired by the role of intestinal microbial communities in aGVHD pathogenesis, we recently completed the largest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) trial to date in transplant recipients.

Pediatric AML remains a devastating disease with only a 60% survival rate. Survivors often have long-term quality of life issues related to the toxic chemotherapy used to treat their disease. A better knowledge of the molecular basis of pediatric AML will help identify targets for therapeutic intervention. Some of these targets may be mutants of normal genes, while others may be overexpression of normal genes, which would provide a therapeutic window in which targeting the overexpressed gene product may preferentially kill tumor cells. Dr. Meshinchi has surveyed the gene expression spectrum of pediatric AML and has identified several targets which are overexpressed in pediatric AML. One protein, CD74, is highly expressed in a subset of AMLs. Another target is CD70, which is highly expressed in about half of all pediatric AML cases that include a fusion of the MLL protein. Patients with MLL fusions have a worse outcome. Lastly, some infant AML patients have another kind of fusion protein paired with overexpression of the FOLR1 protein. All three proteins that Dr. Meshinchi has identified as being highly expressed in subsets of pediatric AML have much lower expression in healthy cells. Therefore, targeting these proteins is a logical choice. These three proteins are all expressed on the surface of the cell, making them accessible to targeting by special therapeutic antibodies called \"antibody drug conjugates\" (ADCs). ADCs have a toxic payload attached to them. When the antibody binds to its target on the cell surface, the cell takes in the ADC releasing the toxic payload, which then kills the cell. This immunotherapy approach is a highly specific, personalized approach for treating cancer. ADCs to each of the protein targets identified by Dr. Meshinchi are being clinically evaluated in other diseases, providing the opportunity to potentially repurpose those drugs for pediatric AML. Therefore, Dr. Meshinchi proposes to evaluate these ADCs in laboratory models of pediatric AML. Should any of these drugs show promise in these laboratory models, Dr. Meshinchi will propose clinical trials in pediatric patients through LLS's Pediatric Acute Leukemia (PedAL) Master Clinical Trial. If any of the targets do not have an effective drug in the laboratory models, Dr. Meshinchi will create new ADCs using proven expertise currently available in his laboratory. Therefore, these studies present the possibility of new, targeted immunotherapy for specific subsets of pediatric AML patients, either rapidly through drug repurposing, or through the development of new ADCs. The goal is to improve the survival and quality of life for these vulnerable blood cancer patients.Program: Dare to Dream Project Term: Start Date: October 1, 2020 End Date: September 30, 2022 [Defining the role of DNA methylation modifier mutations in reshaping blood differentiation topology](/award/defining-role-dna-methylation-modifier-mutations-reshaping-blood-differentiation-topology) Coming soon.Program: Career Development Program Project Term: Start Date: 1, 2021 End Date: June 30, 2026 [Multi-modal Immunotherapeutic Targeting of AML-restricted Targets in Infants and Children](/award/multi-modal-immunotherapeutic-targeting-aml-restricted-targets-infants-and-children) Advances in understanding and management of AML in children has been stagnant for decades. Observed improvements in survival are more directly linked to improvements in supportive care or risk identification rather than advances in therapeutics. Excitement around FDA approval of two new IDH1/2 inhibitors did not reach the pediatric oncology community given paucity or absence of such mutations in children. This also highlights the stark differences between AML in older adults and that in younger patients. Thus, \"trickle down therapeutics\" where therapies that are developed in older adults are used effectively in children is a flawed concept. Discoveries and therapeutic development in younger patients must be prioritized if meaningful advances are to be made in curing AML in younger patients. Given that AML in children is not a priority for the pharmaceutical companies, alternate mechanisms for advancing therapeutics in children and young adults should be implemented.Program: Specialized Center of Research Program Project Term: Start Date: October 1, 2021 End Date: September 30, 2026 [Novel immunotherapeutic strategies in infants with high risk AML](/award/novel-immunotherapeutic-strategies-infants-high-risk-aml) Treatment of AML in infants is especially challenging given unique genetic make-up of the disease as well as specific susceptibilities of the host.

The institutional commitment to translational science is evident in City of Hope's investment in research support/regulatory affairs infrastructure and campus GMP manufacturing facilities. Since patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) have poor outcomes after autologous transplantation, our researchers have been developing new immunotherapeutic strategies to combat this disease. This RFA was timely, as our team was preparing several innovative projects specifically focused on MCL. Our projects are unified by a focus on specific cell and pathway targeting, and antibody-based biologic agents. In fact, 3 of the proposed agents to be tested in this grant were developed here and will be manufactured at City of Hope. The immunotherapies proposed here target a range of antigens, including a unique MCL-specific antigen, and employ novel mechanisms of action, including B-cell receptor (BCR) feedback control, T cell killing and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. Tumor target specificity is crucial to the safety and tolerability of any immunotherapy. However even with perfect specificity, targeting a single antigen or pathway is frequently insufficient due to antigen- and immune-escape mechanisms. Therefore we are exploring combining our antibody-based agents with inhibitors of B cell signaling (BTK, PI3K, Akt), as well as combining them between projects, in order to cut off tumor escape routes. Developing therapeutics with both high specificity and high potency against MCL is a lofty goal, but one that we aim to achieve. Project 1: Development of a unique tumor-specific, antibody therapy against mantle cell lymphoma (L Kwak, H Qin, L Chen). We have utilized a live cell-based phage display platform to target low-abundance, unique cell markers, discovering an antibody light chain binding domain specific to human MCL. We have further engineered a light chain antibody that binds highly specifically to MCL (MCLC-Ab), with no binding to other subtypes of B-cell lymphomas, nor to normal blood cells. This MCLC-Ab shows potent anti-tumor activity in xenograft MCL models. In Project 1, we will identify the MCLC-Ab target and confirm the antibody specificity for MCL by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry (SA1). The MCLC-Ab will then undergo preclinical development as both an MCL diagnostic antibody (SA2) and as a potent, MCL-specific therapeutic (SA3). Project 2: Combining CAR T cells with signaling modulators for treatment of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (S Forman, X Wang, E Budde, S Blanchard). CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is limited by suboptimal response rates in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), persistent B cell aplasia, and a high risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). To improve the remission rates for patients with MCL, we propose combining CAR T cells with 3 oral agents that modulate B and T cell signaling: the BTK inhibitor PI3K TGR-1202. First we propose a clinical trial of ibrutinib for relapsed MCL, followed by CD19CAR T cell infusion (SA1). We expect that ibrutinib will enhance response rates to CAR T cell therapy and may also decrease cytokine production, reducing severe CRS. This trial is built on our established clinical platform for CD19CAR T cell therapy for NHL. We will also optimize and pre-clinically develop the MCLC-Ab from Project 1 as a CAR, with the potential to avoid persistent B cell aplasia (SA2). Finally, we plan to test the use of Akt and PI3K inhibitors as part of CAR T cell manufacturing to improve T cell persistence and potency, and in vivo as combined therapy with CAR T cells (SA3). Project 3: Targeting oncogenic B cell receptor (BCR)-feedback control in refractory mantle cell lymphoma (M Muschen, V Ngo, R Chen, L Chen). Project 3 proposes to target the CD25 surface antigen present on both regulatory T cells (Tregs) and MCL cells, using a new CD25 antibody-pyrrolobenzodiazepine conjugate (ADCT-301). In SA1, in a humanized will use the CD25-ADC to pre-deplete immunosuppressive Tregs and enhance the activity of Project 1's MCLC-Ab and Project 2's CD19 CAR T cells. We have discovered that surface CD25 recruits inhibitory SHIP1, cycles from cytoplasm to surface of MCL cells, but can be forced to remain on the cell surface via CD19 engagement or PI3K/Akt inhibition. In SA2, we will combine CD19 antibody or CD19 CAR T cells with CD25-ADC to force CD25 surface expression, enhancing ADCT-301 targeting. In SA3, we will stimulate CD25 surface accumulation using Akt and PI3K inhibitors to maximize targeting. Core A: Pathology and Tissue Bank Core (WC Chan, J Song). Core A will provide tissue bank services, screen MCLC-Ab to validate its specificity (FFPE sections, flow cytometry) and diagnostic utility (Project 1), provide MRD and residual tumor assessment for the clinical trial (Project 2), and assess immune reconstitution in humanized mice (Project 3). Core B: Translational Core (S Thomas, C Matsumoto).

However, whether there is a causative role of HLX in the induction of AML is still unclear. Hence, the aim of my study is to better understand, using genetically engineered mice models, retroviral models, and human AML patient samples, how HLX drives AML at molecular level. This study will uncover potential therapeutic strategies for AML treatment in future.Program: Career Development Program Project Term: Start Date: April 1, 2021 End Date: [](/award-recipient/gareth-morgan) Gareth Morgan, PhD, MD, FRCPath, FRCP New York School of MedicineNew York, New York [Structural chromosomal rearrangements and the multi-step progression of multiple myeloma](/award/structural-chromosomal-rearrangements-and-multi-step-progression-multiple-myeloma) Two newly identified structural DNA changes, termed chromothripsis and chromoplexy, result in the formation of new chromosomal structures where multiple genes can be deregulated simultaneously.

Our recent study with ruxolitinib (a JAK inhibitor) showed that activation of a parallel oncogenic pathway, PI3-kinase, predicts for poor response to ruxolitinib in T-cell lymphoma. Building upon this observation, we are assessing whether dual inhibition of JAK and PI3-Kinase will lead to higher efficacy in T-cell lymphoma.Program: Career Development Program Project Term: Start Date: July 1, 2019 End Date: June for CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like is the most common subset of Ph-like ALL, has a very poor prognosis and lacks effective therapy.

However, relapse or progression occurs in ~60% of patients with majority of them experiencing CD19 loss in their tumors. Here, we will characterize the mechanism of CD19 loss in NHLs and develop CD79b CAR T-cell therapy as a novel approach to overcome CAR T resistance due to CD19 loss.Program: Translational Research Program Project Term: Start Date: myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) arise due to a combination of genetic mutations and epigenetic abnormalities that sustain the abnormal behavior of cancer cells. The genetic material of the cell is the \"hard drive\" full of instructions that allow cells to grow, have unique functions, and ultimately live or die. Epigenetics is the \"software\" of the cell, allowing access to the information from the hard drive in a controlled manner. This interplay between the hardware and the software culminates in gene expression, allowing the genetic material to be read and interpreted. Targeted therapy in other myeloid cancers only works for a fraction of patients. Most myeloid cancers have a constellation of mutations that, in combination, likely determine the outcome of patients. The genetic mutations in myeloid cancers often occur in genes that control the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. While it is not possible to correct the genetic abnormalities in cancer cells, it is becoming possible to target and reverse the epigenetic abnormalities, and either kill the cancer cell or make it behave more normally. The goal of this SCOR is to analyze basic mechanisms of disease in order to arrive at novel therapeutic strategies and develop biomarkers that can predict the likelihood of a therapeutic response.Program: Specialized Center of Research Program Project Term: Start Date: October 1, 2017 End Date: September 30, 2022 [Delineation of the molecular heterogeneity underlying treatment failure in follicular lymphoma](/award/delineation-molecular-heterogeneity-underlying-treatment-failure-follicular-lymphoma) A proportion of follicular lymphoma patients will experience early treatment failure and premature death.

Circa 70% of patients referred to MCR come from 5 states: MN, WI, IA, SD and ND inhabited by 10,483,946 people living primarily in a rural setting. To improve local care access, MCR has developed the Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS), a network of 17 community sites of which 7 have oncology care. In 2018, the MCR joined with the University of Minnesota to establish the Minnesota Cancer Clinical Trials Network (MCCTN) that includes 18 sites. These 2 networks encompass large areas of rural, economically disadvantaged populations and unrepresented minorities, including Native Americans, Latinos and African Americans. The MCR is actively supporting clinical research at MCHN sites, including access to clinical trials (CTs) portfolio. Oncology CTs are open in some of MCHS sites but of the 25 currently open, only 2 CTs target blood cancers. The University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE has opened epidemiological trials in the MCHS. The MCCTN is new and none of the 3 open CTs are hematologic. Lymphoma study accruals from the MCHS include 42 patients (1 therapeutic; 41 lymphoma epidemiology). The robust epidemiology trial accrual demonstrates that these new lymphoma patients are being seen at these sites and are willing to consent. While many patients from rural communities are seen at MCR for initial diagnosis, these patients often are unable to enroll into trials due to distance from MCR. Feedback from providers from both Networks identified barriers to accrual to lymphoma CTs: i) lack of local lymphoma trials; ii) competition with the more common solid tumor CTs for scarce resources; iii) very busy clinical practices that limits dedicated time for enrollment of intensive complex hematology patients. The practice pressure particularly affects patients requiring language or financial assistance. In this proposal, we outline our plans to address the 3 barriers identified.Program: IMPACT Project Term: Start Date: April 1, 2021 End Date: March 31, 2026 [](/award-recipient/thomas-koehnke) Thomas Koehnke, MD Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior UniversityPalo Alto, California [The role of truncating ASXL1 mutations in disease initiation and progression of human myeloid malignancies](/award/role-truncating-asxl1-mutations-disease-initiation-and-progression-human-myeloid-malignancies) N/AProgram: Career Development Program Project Term: Start 2021 End Date: June 30, 2024 [Leveraging dysregulated signaling networks for therapeutic benefit in myeloproliferative neoplasms](/award/leveraging-dysregulated-signaling-networks-therapeutic-benefit-myeloproliferative-neoplasms) The objective of this project is to decipher mechanisms driving transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) to secondary acute leukemia (sAML).

Despite the efficacy of these measures, patients with B cell malignancies and associated precursor conditions remain at a high risk of adverse outcomes due to COVID-19 infection. These patients were excluded from pivotal vaccination trials that tested the efficacy in the general population. Historically, patients with hematologic malignancies have a 20-50% rate of immunogenicity to routine vaccinations - either due to the underlying malignancy itself or due to immunosuppressive therapies. We are currently enrolling patients in an observational study (NCT04748185) to assess the immunogenicity and safety of commercially available vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with B cell malignancies and associated precursor conditions such as monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Eligible patients who those with a diagnosis of a B cell malignancy (without regard to treatment status of the underlying malignancy). In collaboration with the Mayo Vaccine Center, we will determine immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by: a) measuring antibody response (including anti-spike antibody, anti-nucleocapsid antibody, and blocking antibody titers); and b) measuring cell mediated immune response (including T cell ELISpot assay).Program: Special Grants Project Term: Start Date: Date: December 31, 2021 [Targeting dysregulation of transcription factor control in acute myeloid leukemia](/award/targeting-kinase-dependent-dysregulation-transcription-factor-control-acute-myeloid-leukemia) Defining mechanisms of dysregulated gene control are central to understanding cancer and the development of effective therapies.

T cells can be trained to target cancer cells by genetic modification. In fact, previous support from the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society allowed us to successfully develop CAR T cells targeted to CD19, a pan-B cell marker. This treatment, generically called CART-19, was approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL) and in 2018 for some non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with promising results in other B cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Thus, the development of a single therapy for a single disease (initially, CLL) paid handsome dividends when translated to a broader range of CD19-expressing malignancies (ALL, NHL).Program: Specialized Center of Research Program Project Term: Start Date: October 1, 2019 End Date: September 30, 2024 [](/award-recipient/craig-jordan) Craig Jordan, PhD University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical CampusAurora, Colorado [Therapeutic targeting of AML stem cells](/award/therapeutic-targeting-aml-stem-cells) Our SCOR team seeks to fundamentally reinvent the ways in which physicians diagnose and treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For over 40 years, AML has been treated with a combination of chemotherapy drugs that have major side effects and usually only provide short-term benefit to patients. Indeed, survival rates for most AML patients are dismal, and quality of life for these patients is poor. Consequently, improved strategies for AML are a huge priority for the field. We believe that the lack of progress against AML is due to a single, fundamental failure of existing therapies: While current therapies attack leukemia cells, they fail to act against the real root of the problem, namely leukemia stem cells. It's like mowing over weeds in a lawn. If the roots are not removed, the weed (disease) will grow back. And like eradicating the roots of weeds, AML stem cells have proved difficult to treat. This is primarily due to the fact that AML stem cells within a given patient can exist in multiple forms, each of which has a differing response to therapy. In other words, while various drugs can often kill some AML stem cells in a patient, completely eradicating all the AML stem cells can be very difficult.Program: Specialized Center of Research Program Project Term: Start Date: October 1, 2018 End Date: September 30, 2023 [Dissecting the role of a key epigenetic modulator in Mixed Lineage Leukemia](/award/dissecting-role-key-epigenetic-modulator-mixed-lineage-leukemia) We study how a protein called Dpy30 controls blood cancers by regulating chromatin, the physical structure where our genes reside.

Moreover, each successive treatment failure is associated with a more rapidly proliferating disease and fewer practical treatment options. For example, the BTK inhibitor (BTKi) ibrutinib has unprecedented activity but failure is virtually universal and is associated with dismal outcomes. Understanding the genomic basis and mechanisms for drug resistance in MCL is therefore urgently needed. Our goal is to develop superior therapies for MCL that are practical, well tolerated and amenable to patient stratification, by defining the genomic and the molecular and immunological mechanisms for drug resistance in the context of rationally designed clinical trials with targeted agents. Targeting the cell cycle represents a rational approach to MCL therapy, as dysregulation of CDK4 and aberrant cyclin D1 expression underlie unrestrained proliferation in disease progression. We have demonstrated that induction of prolonged early G1 arrest (pG1) by inhibiting CDK4 with palbociclib not only prevented proliferation of primary MCL cells but also reprogrammed them for killing by clinically relevant targeting agents including ibrutinib and PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki)s. By longitudinal functional genomics of serial biopsies from MCL patients treated with either palbociclib or ibrutinib we discovered a close association of clinical response with inactivation of PI3K and activation of the tumor suppressor transcription factor FOXO1. Moreover, chromatin remodeling appeared to be the proximal event that reprograms MCL cells in response to CDK4 inhibition. Collectively, our findings suggest that through regulation of PI3K and FOXO1 and inhibition reprograms MCL for a deeper and more durable clinical response to BTKi and PI3Ki. Supporting this hypothesis, in our phase 1 clinical trial of palbociclib + ibrutinib (PALIBR) in recurrent MCL (N=27) the overall response rate was 67% with 43% complete responses. The responses were rapid and durable; only 2 responding patients have progressed in the 32 months since the trial opened. To further accelerate the development of targeted MCL therapies, we have developed a novel inhibitor for protein arginine methyl transferase 5 (PRMT5), which is dysregulated in MCL and many human cancers. Inhibition of PRMT5 reverses PRMT5 catalyzed epigenetic marks, restores regulatory pathways and enhances survival of preclinical models of MCL and kills ibrutinib-resistant primary MCL cells. Building on these novel findings and capitalizing on the upcoming multi-center phase 2 PALIBR in recurrent MCL, we propose to investigate drug resistance and develop new strategies that circumvent drug resistance in three integrated projects. Project 1: Development of rational treatment strategies for new and recurrent MCL (PI: Peter Martin, M.D.; co-PI: Jia Ruan, M.D., Ph.D., and Kami Maddocks, M.D.). We aim to develop regimens that can be targeted to the appropriate patient subset, are well tolerated, and can be administered in the community. We will conduct a multicenter feasibility trial of lenalidomide + rituximab (R2)+ durvalumab in untreated MCL with real-time monitoring of MRD. We will explore whether durvalumab can overcome immune-mediated resistance to R2 and whether using MRD to modify therapy improves tolerability and practicality without compromising efficacy. We will also conduct a multicenter phase 2 trial of PALIBR in previously treated MCL to better define patients most likely to benefit from this therapy while providing information on mechanisms of resistance in collaboration with Project 2 and 3. Project 2: Functional genomics and mechanism of drug The clinical response from the phase 1 clinical trial of PALIBR supports our hypothesis that induction of pG1 by CDK4 inhibition reprograms MCL for a deeper and more durable clinical response. To understand the underlying mechanism, we aim to identify the genomic resistance biomarkers by longitudinal functional genomics in the context of the clinical response to PALIBR in the phase 2 clinical trial in collaboration with Project 1. We will further elucidate the mechanism of pG1 reprograming for ibrutinib vulnerability, and target the therapy vulnerability conferred by the genomic resistance biomarkers discovered in this study, such as targeting PRMT5 in collaboration with Project 3. Project 3: Targeting the in evidence, we hypothesize that dysregulation of PRMT5 and FOXO1 causes epigenetic and gene expression changes promoting MCL proliferation and survival. Thus, targeting PRMT5-regulated epigenome may restore FOXO1-mediated cytotoxic gene expression and induce MCL killing. Our goal is to characterize the epigenetic recruitment of PRMT5 and FOXO1 for mechanism-based targeting of MCL epigenome. We aim to identify direct targets of PRMT5 necessary for MCL proliferation and survival, and to define the role of FOXO1 in killing of MCL cells by targeting the epigenome, in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2.

Pediatric blood cancers comprise about 40% of all pediatric cancers. The most common pediatric blood cancer is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is curable in most patients through the use of chemotherapy. Though beneficial in the short term, destroying the cancer through chemotherapy often leads to long term health problems. For those that do not respond to chemotherapy, there are fewer therapeutic options. Another pediatric blood cancer is acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is a more aggressive and lethal disease. Therefore, many pediatric acute leukemia patients require better therapeutic options, and a precision medicine approach targeting specific mutations will likely lead to a better clinical benefit.Program: Dare to Dream Project Term: Start Date: October 1, 2020 End Date: September 30, 2022 [Pediatric AML PDX Models and Drug Testing-Gateway to Novel PedAL Trials](/award/pediatric-aml-pdx-models-and-drug-testing-gateway-novel-pedal-trials) Pediatric AML is a disease with poor outcomes and a need for improved therapeutic options.
