Natural medicine, also known as holistic, complementary, naturopathic or alternative medicine, is the fastest growing of all \"non-conventional\" healing disciplines. It is a form of alternative medicine which involves homeopathy, herbalism, auricular therapy (needleless acupuncture), diet and lifestyle counseling, and more. Natural medicine is a natural approach to health and healing that recognizes the integrity of the whole person. Doctors of natural medicine follow a vitalistic, bio-energetic model of health rather than a Western conventional model of diagnosis and treatment. Natural medicine is often referred to as Vital Energy medicine. Its natural methods of healing are used to stimulate the vital force (bio-energy) in the human body to heal itself and restore harmony to the whole person. Medicine is in transition. Conventional biomedicine is giving way to an expanded, integrative model that emphasizes healthcare as well as physical and mental illness care, treats people not just diseases and disorders, and incorporates multiple therapeutic approaches, old and new, to offer patients greater choice. Bioenergetic medicine, such as Bio-Resonance analysis and therapy, offered at Reflective Wellness Mind & Body, is a powerful wellness tool that can elevate individuals to the next level in their healing journey. While the East (Asia) has relied upon bioenergetic medicine for centuries (think Traditional Chinese Medicine and acupuncture, Tai chi and Qi gong, Ayurvedic medicine and yoga, chakra balancing, etc.) the West (North America and Europe) have only recently begun to understand its potential, power and effectiveness for healing the mind and body from a multitude of conditions, often more gently and effectively than chemical treatments.
