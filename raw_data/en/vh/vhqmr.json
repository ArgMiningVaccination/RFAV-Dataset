CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 Protocol -2019 Title A phase 2b, multi- center, non -inferiorit y immunogenicit y and safet of Biologicals' Meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (GSK3536820A and Menveo) administered to healthy adults 18 to 40 y ears of age. Indication Active immunization to prevent invasive meningococcal disease caused b y Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. Rationale for the study and study designRationale for the stud y GSK Biologicals' Menveo (Meningococcal CRM 197conjugate vaccine; MenACWY ) is licensed for use in infants through adults in more than 60 countries. Menveo vaccine is delivered as a vial including the liquid MenCWY conjugate components and a vial containing the ly ophilized MenA conjugate component. The l yophilized component has to be reconstituted with a liquid component immediately prior to vaccination, which adds to complexity of vaccine administration. Furthermore, vaccine components come in separate vials which make it bulky and consume cold storage space. To simplify the vac cine administration, prevent occurrence of administration errors and to optimize vaccine shipment and storage, a fully liquid formulation of MenACWY vaccine has been developed. Results of development stability studies indicate that the percentage of free saccharides (FS) for serogroup A will increase over time when stored at a temperature of 2- 8 C. Additionally , the O -acetylation level of the MenA component of the MenACWY liquid vaccine is expected to decrease over time during the storage of the vaccine. Hence, the rationale of this study is to assess the impact of serogroup A oligosaccharide degradation as well as of acetylation levels on immunogenicit y and safet y of investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine. GSK plans therefore to compare the immunogenicit y and to assess the reactogenicity/safet y of the currently licensed MenACWY vaccine ( Menveo) with the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine formulation tailored to include approximately 30% free serogroup A saccharides. A 30% MenA FS level was selected as t he upper limit of the expected FS range at release for the Menveo liquid formulation. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 08-FEB -2019 9For this study , the formulation with approximately 30% of free MenA oligosaccharides will be obtained b y storing a fresh manufacturing MenA lot at approximately 22.5\u00b0C (72.5\u00b0F) forthe time needed to accelerate the formation of the free saccharides following the Arrhenius model. Since a certain degree of loss of the O -acetyl groups on the conjugated MenA component may occur when stored at temperature higher than 2 to 8\u00b0C, the O -acetylation level of N. meningitidis serogroup A capsular pol ysaccharide of the fully liquid vaccine formulation will also be monitored. The purpose of the study is to assess the non- inferiority of the immune response against serogroup A between the currently licensed MenACWY vaccine and the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS. The immune response against serogroups C, W and Y and the reactogenicit y and safety profiles of the stud y vaccines will also be evaluated. H owever, as the CWY components of the investigational vaccine formulation is identical to that of the licensed formulation, non -inferiorit y will not be assessed for these serogroups. Safety will be evaluated for 6 months after a single dose vaccination. Rationale for the stud y design Study population: healthy adults 18 to 40 y ears of age (YoA) will be enrolled in this study as agreed with regulatory authorities for the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine. Vaccination dose and route of administration: s ubjects will receive a single dose of licensed MenACWY vaccine or investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine (i.e. dosing scheme currently indicated for Menveo in adults). Study blinding: given the different appearance of the investigational liquid vaccine and currentl y licensed MenACWY vaccine, double blinding is not possible. The study will therefore be conducted in an observer - blind manner . Objectives Primary To demonstrate non -inferiority of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS to that of currently licensed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y the human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) directed against N. meningitidis serogroup A at Day 29 after a single dose vaccination. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol to demonstrate non- inferiority: Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of hSBA GMTs against serogroup A between the liquid formulation and the licensed formulation is greater than 0.5. Secondary To compare the immunogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS and the currentl y licensed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y hSBA GMTs directed against N. meningitidis serogroups C, W and Y at Day 29. To compare the immunogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS to the currently licensed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y the percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in post -vaccination hSBA titer for N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29 compared to Day 1. Note: The following definition will be used for 4- fold rise: a) for individuals whose pre -vaccination titers are < the limit of detection (LOD), the post-vaccination titers must be 4 -fold the LOD or the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) whichever is greater; b) for individuals whose pre -vaccination titers are the LOD and the LLOQ, the post -vaccination titers must be at least four times the LLO Q; c) for individuals whose pre - vaccination titers are > the LLOQ, the post vaccination titers must be at least four times the pre- vaccination titer. To compare the immunogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS to the currently licensed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer 8 and LLOQ* against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29. * Note: To be assessed for each serogroup if the pre- defined LLOQ value for that serogroup is >8. To assess the safet y/reactogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS and the currentl y licensed MenACWY vaccine.

The definition of a child in care does not include a child who is adopted or has an appointed legal guardian. Eligible: Qualified for enrollment into the study based upon strict adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria. End of Study (Synonym of End of Trial)For studies without collection of human biologicals samples or imaging data EoS is the Last Subject Last Visit (L SLV). For studies with collection of Human Biologicals Samples, EoS is defined either as last subject last visit of the study (LSLV) or as the date of the last testing/reading* released of the Human Biological Samples or imaging data related to primary and secondary endpoints if occurred after LSLV. * In this case, EoS must be achieved no later than 8 months after L SLV. Epoch: An epoch is a set of consecutive timepoints or a single timepoint from a single protocol. Epochs are defined to support a main purpose which is either to draw conclusions on subject participation or to draw a complete conclusion to define or precise the targeted label of the product. Supporting means that data collected at the timepoints included in an epoch must be sufficient to fulfil the purpose of the epoch. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol -2019 examples of epochs are screening, primary vaccinations, boosters, yearl y immunogenicity follow - ups, and surveillance peri ods for efficacy or safet y. eTrack: GSK's tracking tool for clinical trials.

Meningococcal C, 3 08-FEB -2019 291. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background Neisseria (N.) meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis worldwide, capable of causing outbreaks and epidemics of invasive disease. Meningococcal disease is associated with high morbidity and mortalit y even among patients who receive early antibiotic treatment. Based on antigenic differences in their capsular poly saccharide, 13 serogroups of N. meningitidis have been identified. Virtuall y all disease -associated isolates are encapsulated, with serogroups A, B, C, W and Y responsible for the majority of invasive meningococcal infections worldwide [ Granoff to a protein carrier have been developed and successfull y licensed worldwide. These vaccines induce T cell -dependent immune responses, and are immunogenic also in infants and y oung children, conferring long lasting protection in all age groups, and priming for diphtheria CRM 197conjugate vaccine; MenACWY) i s licensed for use in infants through adults in more than 60 countries. I n the United States, MenACWY is approved for active immunization of individuals from 2 months through 55 y ears of age. In the European Union, Menveo is licensed for the active immuniz ation of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults. As of March 2017, more than 30,000 subjects were exposed to MenACWY vaccine in the GSK sponsored completed clinical studies and more than 28 million doses of the vaccine were distributed glo bally. Menveo vaccine is delivered as a vial including the liquid MenCWY conjugate components and a vial including the l yophilized MenA conjugate component. The lyophilized component has to be reconstituted with a liquid component immediately prior to vac cination, which adds to complexity of vaccine administration. Furthermore, vaccine components come in separate vials which make it bulky and consume cold storage space. To simplify the vaccine administration, prevent occurrence of administration errors and to optimize vaccine shipment and storage, a fully liquid formulation of MenACWY vaccine has been developed. The investigational liquid formulation of the MenACWY vaccine contains the same meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y oligosaccharides conjugated to CRM 197 protein as the ones included in currently licensed MenACWY ( Menveo) vaccine. The amount of oligosaccharides (10 \u00b5g for serogroup A and 5 \u00b5g for each serogroup C, W and Y) and the injection volume (0.5 mL ) are the same for both vaccine formulation s. The key difference between Menveo and the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine is that serogroup A component is not ly ophilized in the vaccine candidate, and therefore, sucrose and potassium dihy drogen phosphate are not included as excipients. CONFIDENTIAL -2019 30During the manufacturing process, the conjugated oligosaccharides are produced by a covalent attachment of the oligosaccharides to the carrier protein (CRM 197). The results of development stability studies indicate that the percentage of free saccharides (FS) for serogroup A will increase over time when stored at temperature of 2 -8 C. Oligosaccharides for serogroups C, W and Y, however remain substantially unchanged and no degradation has been observed during stability studies. This is not unexpected, given that the manufacturing and storage processes for the C, W and Y components have not changed from those used for the currentl y licensed formulation. Additionally , the O -acetylation level of the MenA component of the MenACWY liquid vaccine is expected to decrea se over time during the storage of the vaccine. One clinical trial with Nimenrix showed no impact of different degrees of O -acetylation of a MenACWY conjugated vaccine on shown that completely non- O-acetylated poly saccharide vaccines were not immunogenic and failed to elicit bactericidal antibodies against MenA meningococci. Please refer to the current Menveo Investigator Brochure for information regarding the pre-clinical and clinical studies and the epidemiological information of the investigational liquid formulation of the MenACWY vaccine. 1.2. Rationale for the study and study design 1.2.1. Rationale for the study The purpose of the study is to assess the non- inferiority of the immune response against serogroup A between the currentl y licensed GSK Biologicals' MenACWY vaccine (Menveo ) and the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS (MenACWY liquid) . Immune response against serogroups C, W and Y and the reactogenicity and safet y profile of the stud y vaccines will be also evaluated. However, as the CWY component of the investigational vaccine formulation is identical to that of the licensed formulation, non -inferiorit y will not be assessed for these serogroups. Reactogenicit y will be evaluated for 7 days, and safety for 6 months after a single -dose vaccination. For this study , the formulation with approximately 30% of free MenA oligo saccharides will be obtained by storing a fresh manufacturing MenA lot at approximately 22.5\u00b0C (72.5\u00b0F)forthe time needed to accelerate the formation of the free saccharides following the Arrhenius model. Since a certain degree of loss of the O- acetyl groups on the conjugated MenA component may occur when stored at temperature higher than 2 to 8\u00b0C, the O -acety lation level of N. meningitidis serogroup A capsular pol ysaccharide of the fully liquid vaccine formulation will also be monitored. The results of this study will provide immunogenicity and safet y data to support the MenACWY liquid specifications at release. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 311.2.2. Rationale for the study design Study population : healthy adults 18 to 40 y ears of age (YoA) will be enrolled in this study as agreed with regulatory authorities for the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine. Vaccination dose and route of administration: subjects will receive a single dose of licensed MenACWY vaccine or investigational MenACWY l iquid vaccine (i.e. dosing scheme currentl y indicated for Menveo in adults). Study blinding : given the different appearance of the investigational liquid and currentl y licensed MenACWY vaccines, double blinding is not possible. The study will therefore b e conducted in an observer -blind manner. 1.3. Benefit: Risk A ssessment Please refer to the Prescribing Information for information regarding the summary potential risks and benefits of the licensed Menveo vaccine. The risks are anticipated to be the same for th e investigational liquid formulation of the MenACWY vaccine. The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation str ategy for this study protocol: 1.3.1. Risk A ssessment Important Potential/Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Menveo and investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine Important Identified risk: Reconstitution errorsCases describing medication errors due to administration of the MenCWY conjugate liquid component only, without reconstitution with the MenA conjugate lyophilized component ,or due to administration of the MenA conjugate lyophilized component only after reconstitution with a different solvent, have been reported during the MenACWY clinical development program.In several sections of the protoc ol (e.g .Section 6.1 \"Description of study vaccines \") it is clarified that the 2 vaccine components have to be reconstituted before vaccine injection. Important potential risk: Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)GBS has been observed with other vaccines. No cases have been reported during the MenACWY clinical development program.GBS will be monitored through SAE collection. Important potential risk: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)ADEM has been observed with other vaccines. Two cases from clinical trials were retrieved from the GSK's global safety database for MenACWY. None of them has provided sufficient evidence of a causal association b etween ADEM and MenACWY.ADEM will be monitored through SAE collection. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol -2019 risk: ThrombocytopeniaImmune thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in association with several licensed vaccines. Two cases related to MenACWY were reported during the clinical development program, but none of them has provided a clear association between thrombocytopenia and the vaccine.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura will be monitored through SAE collection. Important potential risk: Facial paresisFacial paresis was recognized as an important potential risk following the results of a sponsored observational study (V59_34OB) which found an imbalance of cases of facial paresis following vaccination with MenACWY, mainly when administered concom itantly with other vaccines. No cases of facial paresis were reported from interventional clinical trials.Paralysis of the face is mentioned in the list of side effects in the ICF. Facial paresis will be monitored through SAE collection. Important potent ial risk: Vasculitis including Kawasaki disease (KD)There were 7 cases of suspected KD reported in three clinical studies of Menveo. The occurrence of the cases in Menveo studies is consistent with the known epidemiology of KD in terms of geographic and t emporal clustering, and seasonal variation. Therefore there is no evidence of a causal association between KD and MenACWY vaccine. As the exposure in clinical trial of subject was limited considering the incidence of the disease, KD is considered as a potential risk.Vasculitis including Kawasaki disease will be monitored through SAE collection. Study Procedures Risk of blood sampling Blood sampling associated risk of syncope, dizziness, infection at the site after or during venepuncture.Blood samples will be obtained by a trained professional and medical assistance will be available. The potential risk of feeling faint, or experiencing mild local pain, bruising, irritation or redness at the site where blood was taken, is mentioned in the Informed Conse nt Form (ICF). The amount of blood to be taken for sampling will not be harmful to the subject's health. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 Benefit A ssessment Benefits considerations include: Medical evaluations/assessments associated with this study (i.e. phy sical examination). Potential benefit of receiving GSK's investigational or licensed meningococcal vaccine during study duration that may have clinical utility . 1.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion Considering the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study , thepotential or identified risks in association with the licensed and investigational MenACWY vaccine are justified by the potential benefits (prevention) that may be afforded to subject(s) receiving the MenACWY vaccines. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1. Primary objective To demonstrate non -inferiority of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS to that of currently licensed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y the human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) directed against N. m eningitidis serogroup A at Day 29 after a single dose vaccination. Criterion to demonstrate non- inferiority: Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower limit of the two- sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of hSBA GMTs against serogroup A between the liquid formulation and the licensed formulation is greater than 0.5. Refer to Section 10.1 for the definition of the primary endpoint. 2.2. Secondary objectives To compare the immunogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS and the currently licensed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y hSBA GMTs directed against N. meningitidis serogroups C, W and Y at Day 29. To compare the immunogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS to the currently licensed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y the percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in post -vaccination hSBA titer for N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29 compared to Day 1. Note: The following definition will be used for 4- fold rise: a) for individuals whose pre-vaccination titers are < the limit of detection (LOD), the post -vaccination titers must be 4-fold the LOD or the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) whichever is greater; b) for individuals whose pre -vaccination titers are the LOD and the CONFIDENTIAL 08-FEB-2019 34LLOQ, the post -vaccination titers must be at least four times the LLOQ; c) for individuals whose pre -vaccination titers are > the LLOQ, the post vaccination titers must be at least four times the pre -vaccination titer. To compare the immunogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS to the currently licen sed MenACWY vaccine, as measured b y the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer 8 and LLOQ * against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29. *Note: To be assessed for each serogroup if the pre -defined LLOQ value for that serogroup is >8. To assess the safet y/reactogenicity of the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine with approximately 30% Men A FS and the currently licensed MenACWY vaccine. Refer to Section 10.2 for the definition of the secondary endpoints. 3.

Conduct of the study includes, but is not limited to, the following: Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Indepen dent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and favourable opinion/approval of study protocol and any subsequent amendments. Subject informed consent. Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol. GSK will provide full details of the above procedu res to the investigator, either verbally , in writing, or both. Freely given and written or witnessed/ thumb printed informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or each subject's parent(s)/LAR(s) and subject informed assent , as appropriate, prio r to participation in the study . GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody the ICH GCP and GSK Biologicals required elements. While it is strongly recommended that this model I CF is to be followed as closely as pos sible, the informed consent requirements given in this document are not intended to pre- empt an y local regulations which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y effective. Clinical judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final structure and content of the local version of the ICF. In accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, those subjects who can only be enrolled in the study with the consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative (e.g. minors), should be informed about the study to the extent compatible with the subject's understanding and, if capable, the subject should sign and personall y date a written informed assent form (IAF). It i s required that the assent be signed b y each subject, if capable, in addition to the informed consent that is to be signed b y his/her legal representative. It should be assessed whether an assent is required depending of the age of the study population and the local requirements. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 08-FEB -2019 40GSK Biologicals strongly recommends that if the subject reaches the age of consent during the stud y the y will be asked to provide consent at the next study visit (if applicable). This procedure should be applied according to local laws and regulations. The investigator has the final responsibility for the final presentation of the ICF and IAF, respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF and IAF generated by the investigator with the assistance of the sponsor' s representative must be acceptable to GSK Biologicals and be approved (along with the protocol, and an y other necessary documentation) b y the IRB/IEC. 5.2. Subject identification and randomization 5.2.1. Subject identification Subject identification numbers will be a ssigned sequentially to the subjects who have consented to participate in the study, according to the range of subject identification numbers allocated to each study center. 5.2.2. Randomization of treatment 5.2.2.1. Randomization of supplies The randomization of supplies within blocks will be performed at GSK Biologicals, using MATerial EXcellence ( MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Anal ysis System ( SAS) (Cary , NC, USA) by GSK Biologicals. Entire blocks will be shipped to the study centers /warehouse(s). To allow GSK Biologicals to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than anticipated at individual centers in this multi-center study and to thus reduce the overall study recruitment period, an over- randomization of supplies will be prepared . 5.2.2.2. Treatment allocation to the subject The treatment numbers will be allocated b y dose. 5.2.2.2.1. Study group and treatment number allocation The target will be to enrol approximately 972 eligible subjects who will be randomly assigned to two study groups in a (1: 1) ratio (approximately 486 subjects in each group). Allocation of the subject to a study group at the investigator site will be performed using the Source DataBase for Internet Randomization sy stem (SBIR). The randomization algorithm will use a procedure accounting for center. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 3 08-FEB -2019 41After obtaining the signed and dated ICF from the subject and having checked the eligibility of the subject, the site staff in charge of the vaccine administration will access SBIR. Upon providing t he subject identification number, the randomization sy stem will determine the stud y group and will provide the treatment number to be used for the dose. The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine Administration sc reen. When SBI R is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the Study Procedures Manual (SPM) for specific instructions. 5.3. Method of blinding (Amended 08February 2019) Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By observer- blind, it is meant that during the course of the study , the vaccine recipient and those responsible for the evaluation of an y stud y endpoint (e.g. safet y, reactogenicity) will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine preparation and administ ration will be done by authorised medical personnel who will not participate in any of the study clinical evaluation assay s. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing will be blinded to the treatment as well as to the subject number . In addition, a randomly selected subject code will be used for each timepoint tested. This subject coding will prevent the laboratory from linking the consecutive visits to a specific subject. 5.4. General study aspects Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the safet y of the subjects.

Collect demographic data Record demographic data such as year of birth, sex, race and ethnicit y in the subject's eCRF. Differences in the safet y and efficacy of certain me dical raciall y and ethnicall y distinct subgroups. These differences may be attributabl e to intrinsic factors (e.g. genetics, metabolism, elimination), extrinsic factors (e.g. diet, environmental exposure, sociocultural issues), or interactions between these factors. Therefore, both race and ethnicity will be collected for all subjects participating in the MENACWY CONJ -032 [V59_71] study . Subgroup performed. CONFIDENTIAL (MENACWY Protocol 08-FEB -2019 445.6.4. Medical history Obtain the subject's medical history by interview and/or review of the subject's medical records and record an y pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the study vaccination in the eCRF. 5.6.5. Physical examination Review of s ystems is a structured interview that queries the subject as to any complaints the subject has experienced across each organ s ystem. This will be performed before enrollment and used to guide phy sical examination. Collect vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure), and temperature (preferabl y taken orally). Measure height and weight. A general ph ysical examination is to be performed by a qualified health care practitioner. \"Qualified health care practitioner\" refers to an y licensed health care professional who is permitted by institutional policy to perform phy sical examinations and who is identified within the Study Staff Signature Log (or alternat ively called Delegation of Responsibilities L og). The data collected through study assessments listed above will be written in the source document. Should the phy sical assessment reveal an y abnormal values or events, these must be documented in the CRF Adv erse Events Form. Collected information needs to be recorded in the eCRF. Physical examination at each stud y visit subsequent to the vaccination visit, will be performed onl y if the subject indicates during questioning that there might be some underly ing p athology (ies) or if deemed necessary by the Investigator or delegate. If the investigator determines that the subject's health on the day of vaccination temporaril y precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled. Treatment of an y abnormality observed during phy sical examination has to be performed according to local medical practice outside this study or by referral to an appropriate health care provider. 5.6.6. Urine pregnancy test Female subjects of childbearing potential are to have a urine pregnancy test prior to any study vaccine administration. The study vaccine may only be administered if the pregnancy test is negative. Note: Pregnancy test must be performed even if the subject is menstruating at the time of the study visit. 5.6.7. Check contraindications, warnings and precautions to vaccination Contraindications, warnings and precautions to vaccination must be checked at the beginning of the vaccination visit. Refer to Sections 6.5and 6.6for more details. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY 08-FEB -2019 455.6.8. Assess pre -vaccination body temperature The oral bod y temperature of each subject needs to be measured prior to any stud y vaccine administration. If the subject has fever (fever is defined as bod y temperature 38.0\u00b0C/100.4\u00b0F regardless the location of measurement) on the day of vaccination, the vaccination visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit (see Table 5). 5.6.9.

Sampling Refer to the Module on biospecimen management in the SPM and the Central Laboratory Manual for detailed instruc tions for the collection, handling and processing of the samples. 5.6.11.1. Blood sampling for immune response assessments Blood samples will be taken during certain study visits as specified in Table 4(List of Study Procedures). A volume of approximately 20 mL of whole blood should be drawn from all subjects for each analy sis of humoral immune response at each pre -defined timepoint (Visit 1 and Visit 2). After centrifugation, serum samples should be kept at -20\u00b0C/ - 4\u00b0F or below until shipment. Refer to the SPM or Central L aboratory Manual for more details on sample storage conditions. An overall volume of approximately 40 mL will be collected during the entire study period. 5.6.12. Study Vaccine administration After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, one dose of study vaccine will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid of the non- dominant arm (refer to Section 6.3for detailed description of the vaccine administration procedure). If the investigator or delegate determines that the subject's health on the day of administration temporarily prec ludes vaccine administration, the visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit (refer to Table 5). CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 08-FEB -2019 46The subjects will be observed closel y for a t least 30 minutes following the administration of the vaccine, with appropriate medical treatment readil y available in case of anaph ylaxis. 5.6.13. Distribution of Subject Card For information regarding the Subject Card, please refer to Section 8.9. 5.6.14. Subject Diary An Electronic Diary (eDiary ),hereafter referred to as Subject Diary will be used in this study to capture solicited adverse events. The subject should be trained on how and when to complete each field of the Subject Diary . Subject Diary training should be directed at the individual(s) who will perform the measurements of adverse events and who will enter the information into the Subject Diary . Thi s individual may not be the subject /subject's parent(s)/LAR(s) , but if a person other than the subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) enters information into the Subject Diary , this person's identity must be documented in the subject's source record. Any indiv idual that makes entries into the Subject Diary must receive training on completion of the Subject Diary at the time of the visit when Subject Diary is dispensed. This training must be documented in the subject's source record. The same individual should c omplete the Subject Diary throughout the course of the study . The subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) should be trained on how to self- measure local solicited adverse events and body temperature. The measurement of solicited local adverse events is to be p erformed using the ruler provided b y the site. Subjects /parents/LARs will be instructed to measure and record the oral body temperature in the evening. Should additional temperature measurements be performed at other times of day , subjects/parents/LARs will be instructed to record the highest temperature in the Subject Diary . Subject Diary assignment and use: Each subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be assigned a Subject Diary and shown how to use the device - this will include how to access the diary , performing test data entry on sample questions, and how to charge and store the device. The subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will self -select a numeric access code secret to themselves. The same individual should make the assessments and complete the Subject Diary throughout the course of the study . The subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will select an alarm time that suits their daily routines whilst ensuring compliance with protocol requirements. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 Diary instructions must ensure that the subject/ subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) understands the following: Timely completion of the Subject Diary on a dail y basis is a critical component to study participation. The Subject Diary will allow certain time windows for completion of each day 's observations. The S ubject Diary employ s the use of audio-visual alarms to ensure timel y completion of data entry . The trained and assigned user of the Subject Diary must not share access codes with anyone. A helpdesk will be provisioned for users of subject diary in case of technical issues, though it must be stressed that the Helpdesk is not a replacement for normal medical care and no medical issues can be discussed with the agents. The Subject Diary itself must never be considered a substitute for direct medical care and a ny concerns must be communicated to site staff as soon as possible. 5.6.14.1. Post -vaccination reminders Reminder calls or alerts are not intended to be an interview for collection of safet y data. If the subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) wishes to describe safet y information, this information should only be collected b y a healthcare professional at the site, and the safet y data described must be written down in the subject's medical chart. 5.6.14.1.1. Subject Diary Reminder Alerts The subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will re ceive daily reminders via the Subject Diary device's in- built audio -visual alarms to alert the user to complete the diary during the post vaccination period. From Day 1 through Day 7, the users will receive daily alerts through the Subject Diary to record solicited adverse events, and the incidence of any potential unsolicited AEs, and whether these AEs were medicall y attended (defined as symptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider), or wer e of concern. In case of such events, subject/subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to report the event(s). The Subject Diary system will also allow for regular alerts to be issued via email to site staff indicating where subjects may need to be contacted due to: Non-compliance (i.e. failing to enter or transmit diary data), Reporting of an y severe solicited reactions, Subject experienced an unsolicited adverse event that was medicall y attended or was of concern. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 48Sites must assess these alerts when received and contact subjects as necessary . Please refer to Section 9.2on the premature withdrawals from the study and Section 8.3.3 on the evaluation of Adverse Events for guidance on necessary action in the event of one of these alerts. 5.6.14.2. Safety Follow -up calls Safety follow -up calls will be performed on Day 15, Day 91,and Day 181 (or within the allowed interval specified in Table 5). Safety follow -up calls are calls made to the subject by a healthcare professional designated on the site log. These calls will follow a script which will facilitate the collection of rele vant safety information. The subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be interviewed according to the script, and information relating to unsolicited adverse events (including unsolicited adverse events (AEs) within 28 day s post -vaccination, serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended adverse events, AEs or SAEs leading to withdrawal, and/or intercurrent medical conditions) and concomitant medications or vaccinations associated with those events will be collected, as well as information on pregnancy for females of childbearing potential. All safety information described by the subject must be written down in a designated location within the source document and not written on the script used for the telephone call. The site should schedule the next study activity (clinic visit/ safety call) with the subject /subjects' parent(s)/L AR(s) . The subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be reminded to contact the site if there are any questions and to contact the site immediatel y (or as soon as the subject is medi cally stable) if the subject has a medical condition that leads to a hospitalization or an emergency room visit. 5.6.15. Check and record concomitant medication/vaccination and intercurrent medical conditions Concomitant medication/vaccination must be checked and recorded in the eCRF as described in Section 6.7. Intercurrent medical conditions must be checked and recorded in the eCRF as described in Section 6.8. 5.6.16. Recording of A Es, SA Es and pregnancies Refer to Section 8.3for procedures for the investigator to record AEs, SAEs and pregnancies. Refer to Section 8.4 for guidelines and how to report SAE and pregnancy reports to GSK Biologicals.

Study conclusion The investigator will: review data c ollected to ensure accuracy and completeness complete the Study Conclusion screen in the eCRF. 5.7. Biological sample handling and analy sis Please refer to the SPM and to the Central Laboratory manual for details on biospecimen management (handling, storage and shipment). Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subject but will be coded with a unique sample identifier. Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related to the improvement, develop ment and quality assurance of the laboratory tests described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality of these tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test methods, as well as making sure that ne w tests are comparable to previous methods and work reliably . It is also possible that future findings may make it desirable to use the samples acquired in this study for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be asked to give a specific consent to allow GSK or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and will only be performed once an independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has approved this research. Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from GSK Biologicals. Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject /subjects' parent(s)/L AR(s) . Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot perform an yother biological assay s except those described in the protocol or its amendment(s). Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last subject performed the last study visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidel ines require different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall y to and discussed and agreed with GSK Biologicals. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 505.7.1. Use of specified study materials When materials are provided by GSK Biologicals or designated vendor, it is MANDATORY that all clinical samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could r esult in the exclusion of the subject from the per -protocol anal ysis (see Section 10.4 for the definition of analysis sets to be anal ysed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel and the laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision comply with this requirement. However, when GSK Biologicals or designated vendor does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical samples, appropriate materials from the investigator's site must be used.

The measure of immunogenicity used in this study is standard, i.e., widel y used and generall y recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant (able to describe the quality and extent of the immune response). Testing will be conducted b y a GSK or designated laboratory in a blinded manner towards the subject number andthe treatment arm (please refer to Section 5.3Method of blinding) . The functional measure of immunogenicit y used in this study , Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA), is a measure of the ability of antibodies, mediated with human complement, to kill meningococci, and is widely used and generally recognized as the serological correlate of protection. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY -2019 following laboratory assay s are planned: Table 7 Humoral Immunity (Antibody determination) System Component TBD = to be determined * For each of the indicator strains to be used in hSBA assays, assay cut -offs and unit will be determined following validation of the selected MenACWY hSBA format. This will be documented in the clinical report. ** GSK Biologicals laboratory refers to the Clinical Laboratory Sciences (CLS) in Rixensart, Belgium; Wavre, Belgium; or Marburg, Germany. Additional exploratory testing on the vaccine and/or on the disease under study may be performed within the framework of the stud y if deemed necessary for accurate interpretation of the data or should such assay(s) become available at GSK. These assay s may not be represented in the objectives/endpoints of the study protocol. The GSK Biologicals' clinical laboratories hav e established a Quality System supported by procedures.

Seropositivity cut-off or other hSBA titer values used to support 4-fold rise definitions may change following the generation of additional qualification/validation data as expected by Center for Biologicals Evaluation and Research (CBER) to support the intended use of the MenACWY hSBAs. The values of LLOQ and LOD for each serogroup will be defined at the time of the generation of qualification and/or validation data. The clinical endpoints used in this study are standard measures use d routinely to estimate protection against meningococcal disease and have been previously agreed with CBER in the frame of Menveo licensure. The anticipated margin of the GMT ratio (lower limit of 0.5 for the 95% CI of the GMT ratios between groups) for study success has previously been used in the demonstration of lot- to-lot consistency in pivotal Menveo trials in adolescents . The investigator is encouraged to share the immunological assay results for non- responders with the study subjects /subjects' paren t(s)/L AR(s) at the end of the study , as soon as the results are available. For the subjects identified as non- responders, it remains the responsibility of the investigator in charge of the subject's clinical management to determine the medical need for re -vaccination and to re -vaccinate the subjects as per local/regional practices. Subjects who do not achieve a 4-fold rise in hSBA titers (according to the definition in the objectives) against any of the 4 serogroups at 1 month post -vaccination with the investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine will be offered one dose of a licensed quadrivalent MenACWY vaccine (preferabl y Menveo) after the end of the study and outside study procedures. 6.

Storage and handling of study vaccines The study vaccines must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to authorized study personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre- study activities under the responsibility of the sponsor study contact. The storage temperature should be continuously monitored with calibrated (if n ot validated) temperature monitoring device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for more details on storage of the study vaccines. Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius. Any temperature excursion outside the range of 2.0 to +8.0 C (for +2 to +8\u00b0C/+36 to +46\u00b0F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (I MPs) must be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form (Advanced Temperature Excursion Analy sis and Management [ATEAM]). The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor. Non-IMPs that are impacted by a temp erature excursion may not be used and must be quarantined at label storage conditions until usage approval has been obtained from/via the local study contact (e.g. Site Monitor).

All concomitant medications/products, except vitamins and dietary supplements, administered during the period of 28 day s following the dose of study vaccine (Day 1 to Day 29). Any concomitant vaccination administered in the period starting 14 day s before the dose of study vaccine and ending at Day 29. Prophy lactic medication (i.e. medicatio n administered in the absence of ANY symptom and in anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination). E.g. an anti -pyretic is considered to be prophy lactic when it is given in the absence of fever and an y other s ymptom, to prevent fever from occurring (fever is defined as body temperature 38.0\u00b0C/100.4\u00b0F regardless the location of measurement). The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the oral cavity . Any concomitant medications/products/vaccines listed in Section 6.7.2. During the follow -up period, after Day 29 until the last safet y phone call, any concomitant medications/products/vaccines relevant to a SAE, an AE/SAE lea ding to withdrawal or to an AE requiring a medically attended visit to be reported as per protocol. In addition, concomitant medications relevant to SAEs need to be recorded on the expedited Adverse Event report . 6.7.2. Concomitant medications/products/vaccines t hat may lead to the elimination of a subject from per- protocol analy ses The use of the following concomitant medications/products/vaccines will not require withdrawal of the subject from the study but may determine a subject's evaluability in the per-protocol anal ysis. See anal yses sets to be anal ysed. Any investigational or non- registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines used during the study period. Immunosuppressants or other immune -modify ing drugs defined as follows: Systemic administration of corticosteroids (PO/IV/I M) within 90 day s prior to informed consent, and until the Day 29 blood draw. Administration of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents or radiotherap y within 90 day s prior to informed consent, and until the Day 29 blood draw.

SAFETY The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol. Each subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately should they manifest any signs or s ymptoms they perceive as serious. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 Safet y definitions 8.1.1. Definit ion of an adverse event An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavour able and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefit s (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. Examples of an AE include: Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccines administration even though they may have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study vaccines or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE). Signs, sy mptoms temporally associated with study vaccines. Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. Pre-or post -treatment events that o ccur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject's previous therapeutic regimen). AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs. Examples of an AE DO NOT include: Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the study vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 588.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: a.Results in death, b.Is life -threatening, Note: The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which h ypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe. c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, Note: I n general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been admitted at th e hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician's office or in an out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered serious. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalization' occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-e xisting condition (known or diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is NOT considered an AE. d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) whi ch may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. 8.1.3. Solicited adverse events The term \"reactogenicit y\" refers to solicited signs and symptoms (\"solicited adverse events\") occurring in the hours and day s following a vaccination, to be collected by the subjects /parents/LA Rsfor 7 consecutive day s (6 hours - Day 7), using a pre -defined Subject Diary . Solicited adverse events continuing bey ond Day 7 should continue to be recorded in the eDiary until resolution or next visit. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 Protocol 3 08-FEB -2019 59The following solicited adverse events are includ ed in the Subject Diary . Each adverse event is to be assessed using the scoring s ystem reported in parentheses below: 8.1.3.1.

The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the oral cavity . 8.1.3.3. Other Solicited A dverse Events Other indicators of reactogenicity : Use of analgesics / antipy retics retics for prophy laxis; The study staff must review the data entered into the Subject Diary as described in Section 11.2. Note: Any solicited adverse event that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into subjects' source document (see Section 11.2) and also as an adverse event on the Adverse Event CRF: Solicited local or sy stemic adverse event that leads to a visit to a healthcare provider (medicall y attended adverse event, see Section 8.3.3.4 ). Solicited local or sy stemic adverse event leading to the subject withdrawing from the study or the subject being withdrawn from the study by the investigator (adverse event leading to withdrawal). Solicited local or sy stemic adverse event that otherwise meets the definition of a serious adverse event (see Section 8.1.2). CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 08-FEB -2019 608.1.4. Unsolicited A dverse Events An unsolicited adverse event is an adverse event that was not solicited using a Subject Diary and that was spontaneously communicated by a subject /parent(s)/LAR(s) who has signed the informed consent. Potential unsolicited AEs may be medicall y attended (defined as s ymptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider), or were of concern to the subjects/parents/LARs. In case of such events, subjects /parents/LARs will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to report the event(s). The detailed information about the reported unsolicited AEs will be collected b y the qualified site personnel during the interview and will be document ed in the subject's records. Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by subjects /parents/LARs will be collected during interview with the subjects/parents/LARs and by review of available medical records at the next visit. 8.1.5. Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments qualify ing as adverse events or serious adverse events In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry , haematology , urinal ysis) or other abnormal assessments (e .g. clinical signs, ECG, radiological or diagnostic assessments) that are judged b y the investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Sections 8.1.1 and 8.1.2). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantl y worsen following the start of the study will also be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinicall y significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are pres ent or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.

Pregnancy Female subjects who become pregnant after the vaccination may continue the study at the discretion of the inve stigator. While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any adverse pregnancy outcome or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded and reported as an AE or a SAE. Note: The pregnancy itself should alw ays be recorded on an electronic pregnancy report. The following should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in Sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.3: Spontaneous pregnancy loss, including: spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy loss before/at 22 weeks of gestation) ectopic and molar pregnancy stillbirth (intrauterine death of foetus after 22 weeks of gestation). Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the EMA Guideline on pregnancy exposure [ EMA , 2006]. I t is recognized that national regulations might be different. Any earl y neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 days of life). Any congenital anomal y or birth defect (as per [ CDC MACDP ] guidelines) identified in the offspring of a study subject (either during pregnancy , at birth or later) regardless of whether the foetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes anomalies identified by prenatal ultrasound, amniocentesis or examination of the products of conception after elective or spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy AND considered by the investigator to be reasonabl y related to the study vaccines will be reported to GSK Biologicals as described in Section 8.4.3. While the investigator is not obligated to activel y seek this information from former stud y participants, he/she may learn of a pregnancy through spontaneous reporting.

The time period for collecting and recording SAEs, AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study , and medically -attended AEs and SAEs will begin at the receipt of study vaccine and will end 180 days following administration of the dose of study vaccine for each subject ( at the contact at Day 181). See Section 8.4 for instructions on reporting of SAEs. All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study will be collected and recorded from the time of the receipt of study vaccine(s)/ product(s) . In addition to the above -mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study participation (i.e. protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy ) or are related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine will be collected and recorded from the time the subject consents to participate in the study until she/he is discharged from the study . The time pe riod for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin at the receipt of study vaccine and will end 181 day s following administration of the dose of study vaccine.

Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse events As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject or the subjects' parent(s)/L AR(s) be asked a non-leading question such as: 'Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccines or since the previous visit? ' When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE on the in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject's medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the eCRF .

The maximum intensity of local injection site er ythema /induration will be scored at GSK Biologicals as follows: Absent: < 25 mm diameter Mild: 25 mm to 50 mm diameter Moderate: > 50 mm to 100 mm diameter Severe: > 100 mm diameter CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 08-FEB -2019 66Body temperature will be summarized separatel y according to the 3 schemes described below and will be broken down according to route of measurement: by 0.5 \u00b0C increments from 36.0\u00b0C (< versus ): 38.0, 38.5, 39.0, 39.5, 40.0\u00b0C. The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment will be based on the investigator's clinical judgement. Adverse events, reported at a clinic visit or at a scheduled safety call, should be recorded inthe eCRF verbatim, as reported b y the subject . The severit y of unsolicited adverse events reported on the Adverse Events eCRF will be determined b y the investigator as: Mild: transient with no limitation in normal daily activity . Moderate: some limitatio n in normal daily activity. Severe: unable to perform normal daily activity . 8.3.3.2.2. Assessment of causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y vaccines and the occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. I n case of conc omitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify if the AE could be causally related to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e. investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causa l relationship to a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the investigator should indicate the AE to be related to all products. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study vaccines will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products to determine his/her assessment. Ther e may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However, it is very important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK Biologicals. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 3 08-FEB -2019 67All solicited reactions will be considered causall y related to vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the following question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study vaccine? YES :There is a reasonable possibility that the study vaccine contributed to the AE. NO :There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the administration of the study vaccine. There are other, more likely causes and administration of the study vaccine is not suspected to have contributed to the AE. If an event meets the criteria to be determined as 'serious' (see Section 8.1.2 ), additional examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL possible contributing factors for each SAE. Possible contributing factors include: Medical history . Other medication. Protocol required procedure. Other procedure not required by the protocol. Lack of efficacy of the vaccine, if applicable. Erroneous administration. Other cause (specify ). 8.3.3.3. Assessment of outcomes The investigator will assess the o utcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study as: Recovered/resolved. Recovering/resolving. Not Fatal (SAEs onl y). 8.3.3.4. Medically attended visits For each solicit ed and unsolicited sy mptom the subject experiences, the subject/subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked if he/she received medical attention defined as hospitalization, or an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason , includi ng emergency room visits.

The updated report should be faxed to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor I nformation ) or to GSK Biologicals Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance department within the designated reporting time frames specified in Table 13. 8.4.6. Regulatory reporting requirements for serious adverse events The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to GSK in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 8.4.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal resp onsibility to promptly notify , as appropriate, both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the Stud y Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of other subjects are met. Investigator safety reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investig ator safet y report is prepared for a SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccines and unexpected. The purpose of the report is to fulfil specific regulatory and GCP requirements, regarding the product under investigation. 8.5. Follow -up of adverse events, serious adverse events, and pregnancies 8.5.1. Follow -up of adverse events and serious adverse events 8.5.1.1. Follo w -up during the study After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject's condition to GSK Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 13). All SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designate d as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the last visit of the subject. All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until 30 days after the last vaccination. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol -2019 718.5.1.2. Follo w-up after the subject is discharged from the study The investigator will follow subjects: with SAEs, or subjects withdrawn from the stud y as a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, he/she will provide this information to GSK Biologicals using a paper/ electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy report as applicable. GSK Biologicals may request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. I f a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, GSK Biological s will be provided with any available post -mortem findings, including histopathology . 8.5.2. Follow -up of pregnancies Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . At the end of the pregnancy , whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK Biologicals using the electronic pregnancy report and the Expedited Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generall y, the follow -up period doesn't need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery . Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study , if the pregnancy outcome is a SAE, it should alway s be reported as SAE. 8.6. Treatment of adverse events Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current good medical practice. Any medication administered for the treatment of a SAE should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject's eCRF (refer to Se ction 6.7). 8.7. Unblinding GSK Biologicals' policy (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial Directive and US Federal Regulations) is to unbl ind the report of an y SAE which is unexpected and attributable/suspected to be attributable to the study vaccines, prior to regulatory reporting. The GSK Biologicals' Central Safet y Physician is responsible for unblinding the treatment assignment in accord ance with the specified timeframes for expedited reporting of SAEs to Section 8.4.1 ). CONFIDENTIAL unblinding Unblinding of a subject's individual treatment code should occur only in the case of a medical emergency, or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged by the investigator. The emergency unblinding process consists of the automated system SBIR that allows the investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to the subject's individual study treatment. The investigator has the option of contacting a GSK Biologicals' On-call Central Safety Physician (or Backup) if he/she needs medical advice or needs the support of GSK to perform the unblinding (i.e. he/she cannot access the automated Internet-based system). Any emergency unblinding must be fully documented by using the Emergency Unblinding Documentation Form, which must be appropriately completed by the investigator and sent within 24 hours to GSK Biologicals. GSK Biologicals' Contact information for PPD PPDCONFIDENTIA L 205343 (MENACW Y CONJ -2019 738.9. Subject card Study subjects/subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main contact for information about the clinical study . The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a \"subject card\" to each subject /subjects' paren t(s)/L AR(s) . In an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible attending phy sician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant information may be obtained by contacting the investigator. Subjects /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at all times during the stud y duration. 9. SUBJECT COMPLETION A ND WITHDRA WAL 9.1. Subject completion A subject who is available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol is considered to have c ompleted the study . 9.2. Subject w ithdrawal Withdrawals will not be replaced. 9.2.1. Subject w ithdrawal from the study From an anal ysis perspective, a 'withdrawal' from the study refers to any subject who was not available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol. All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for the a nalysis. A subject is considered a 'withdrawal' from the study when no study procedure has occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact. Investigators will make an attempt (3 telephone calls on different day s and different times of day , and a certified letter to the last known address) to contact those subjects who do not return for scheduled visits or follow-up. Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y the subject himself/herself, by the subjects' parent(s)/L AR(s), or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possib le reasons was responsible for withdrawal: Serious adverse event. Unsolicited non -serious adverse event. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 3 08-FEB -2019 74Solicited adverse event Protocol violation (specify ). Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*. Moved from the stud y area. Lost to follow -up. Other (specify ). *In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she /thesubjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) haswithdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified b y the subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) , in the eCRF . Subjects who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study as result of a SAE/AE until re solution of the event (see Section 8.5.1.2). 10. STATISTICA L METHODS 10.1. Primary endpoint The following measures will be summarized: hSBA GMTs against N. me ningitidis serogroup A at Day 29, for each vaccine group and between -group ratios. 10.2. Secondary endpoints The following measures will be summarized: hSBA GMTs against N. meningitidis serogroups A (except Day 29), C, W and Y at Day 1 and at Day 29, for each vaccine group and between -group ratios. Within -group ratios of hSBA GMTs against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29 compared to Day 1. Percentages of subjects with a 4-fold rise in post -vaccination hSBA titer for N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29 compared to Day 1, for each vaccine group and between- group differences. Note: A 4-fold rise is defined as: a) for individuals whose pre-vaccination titers are < the LOD, the post -vaccination titers must be 4 -fold the LOD or the LLOQ whichever is greater; b) for individuals whose pre -vaccination titers are the LOD and the LLOQ, the post -vaccination titers must be at least four times the LLOQ; c) for individuals whose pre -vaccination titers are > the LLOQ, the post-vaccination titers must be at least four times the pre- vaccination titer.

Safety of the study vaccine formulations will be evaluated for all vaccine groups in terms of the frequency (percentage) of reported adverse events inc luding: Any unsolicited AEs reported within 30 minutes after vaccination; Solicited local and sy stemic AEs reported from Day 1 (6 hours) through Day 7 after vaccination ; Other indicators of reactogenicity (e.g. use of analgesics / antipy retics, body temperature) within 7 days after vaccination ; All unsolicited AEs reported from Day 1 through Day 29 after vaccination ; Medically -attended AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and SAEs reported from Day 1 through Day 181 (during the entire study period). 10.3. Determination of sample size With an evaluable sample size of 437 subjects in each group, there will be approximately 90% power to reject the null hy pothesis that the ratio of the hSBA GMT of the ACWY_L iqto the ACWY group is equal to or less than 0.5 (given an underly ing ratio of 0.8), assuming a common standard deviation (on log scale) of 0.929 (upper limit of the 80% confidence interval of the SD observed in study V59P13 for serogroup A in the age group 19-55 years), using a two group t -test with a 0.025 one- sided significance level . Assuming a 10% dropout rate, a total of approximately 972 subjects will need to be enrolled in the study , with approximately 486 subjects randomized to each group (ACWY and ACWY_L iq). Calculations have been performed using \" Two-Sample T -Test Assuming Equal Variance (Enter Difference)\" procedure in PASS 2012 (Power Analy sis and Sample Size Version 12.0.2). 10.4. Analysis Sets 10.4.1. All Enrolled Set All screened subjects who provide infor med consent and provide demographic and/or baseline screening assessments, regardless of the subject's randomization and treatment status in the study and received a Subject ID. 10.4.2. All Exposed Set All subjects in the enrolled set who receive a study vaccinati on. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 08-FEB -2019 7610.4.3. Safety Set 10.4.3.1. Solicited Safety Set (solicited local and sy stemic adverse events and other solicited adverse events) All subjects in the Exposed Set with any solicited adverse event data. 10.4.3.2. Unsolicited Safety Set (unsolicited adverse events) All subjects in the Exposed Set with unsolicited adverse event data. 10.4.3.3. Overall Safety Set All subjects who are in the Solicited Safety Set and/or Unsolicited Safet y Set. Subjects will be analy zedas \"treated\" (i.e., according to the vaccine a subject received, rather than the vaccine to which the subject may have been randomized). 10.4.4. Full A nalysis Set (FAS) Immunogenicity Set FAS (Day 29) All subjects in the All Enrolled Set who: are randomized; receive the study vaccination; provide an evaluable serum sample at Day 29 that has an available result for serogroup A (primary objective)/ for at least one serogroup (secondary objectives). For percentages of subjects with a 4-fold rise, a baseline (Day 1)and a Day 29 result for at least one serogroup will be needed. In case of vaccination error, subjects in the FAS sets will be analy zed \"as randomized\" (i.e., according to the vaccine a subject was designated to receive, which may be different from the vac cine the subject actually received). 10.4.5. Per Protocol (PP) Set for Immunogenicity Set PPS (Day 29): All subjects in the FAS (Day 29) who: correctly receive the vaccine (i.e., receive the vaccine to which the subjects is randomized and at the scheduled time poi nt). have no protocol deviations leading to exclusion as defined prior to unblinding. are not excluded due to other reasons defined prior to unblinding. PPS are subsets of FAS and should be alway s defined even if the objectives do not require it. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 77Examples for subjects excluded due to other reasons than protocol deviations are: Subjects who withdrew informed consent. 10.4.6. Other A nalysis Sets There are no additional analysis sets. 10.4.7. Subgroups A subgroup anal ysis for GMTs , percentage of subjects 8 and LLOQ* against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29, will be performed for subjects who were seronegative at baseline. In addition, subgroup analy ses will be performed for GMTs, 4- fold rise, percentage of subjects with hSBA titer 8 and LLOQ* by sex, by race, and by country . * Note: To be assessed for each serogroup if the pre -defined LLOQ value for that serogroup is > 8. 10.5. Derived and transformed data Immunogenicit y Assay cut-off and unit will be determined following validation of the MenACWY hSBAs. This will be documented in the clinical report. A seronegative subject is a subject whose titer is below the LOD. A seropositive subject is a subject whose titer is greater than or equal to the LOD. The Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) calculatio ns are performed b y taking the anti-log of the mean of the log concentration/titer transformations. Values to be used for the antibody concentrations/titers below the assay cut-off will be described in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP). Handling of miss ing data: for a given subject and a given immunogenicity measurement, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Reactogenicity and Safety Handling of missing data: Subjects will be analy sed to the extent that they are exposed to study vaccines and according to the available safety data for the subject during an y study period. Subjects who withdraw earl y or who are lost to follow -up will be removed from the denominator for the time period in which they have no available safety data collected. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 7810.6. Analysis of demographics Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for age, height and weight at enrollment will be calculated overall and b y study group. Distributions of subjects by sex, race and ethnic origin will be summarized overall and by study group. 10.7. Analysis of immunogenicity The primary anal ysis will be based on the per- protocol set for analy sis of immunogenicit y. If, in any stud y group and timepoint, the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the per- protocol set for analy sis of immunogenicit y is 5% or more, a second anal ysis based on the FAS will be performed to complement the per -protocol anal ysis. GMTs, between -group ratios of Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs) The hSBA titers at each visit will be logarithmically transformed (base10) to obtain approximately normall y distributed data. For each N. meningitidis serogroup A, C, W and Y, GMTs will be calculated, with their associated two -sided 95% CIs, b y exponentiating the corresponding log- transformed means and their 95% CIs. The between -group ratio of hSBA GMTs and corresponding 95% CI, at each of Day 1 and Day 29 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y will be obtained by exponentiating the mean between -group differences in log -transformed titers and the corresponding 95% CIs at each of the specified timepoints. Within each study group and for each serogroup, GMRs will be calculated at Day 29 versus Day 1.The GMRs and 95% CIs will be constructed by exponentiating the mean within -group differences in log- transformed titers and the corresponding 95% CI s. The mean differences will be obtained from an Analy sis of Covariance (ANCOVA) including pre -vaccination titer (Day 1) as a covariate and with vaccine group and center (if applicable) as factors in the model. Percentages of subjects with a 4- fold rise in post-vaccination hSBA (Day 29) The p ercentage of subjects with a 4 -fold rise in post -vaccination hSBA ( at Day 29 compared to Day 1) and associated two- sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CI s will be computed by group and N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. Differences in percentages and associ ated 95% CIs between study groups will be calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen score method. Percentage of Subjects With hSBA titer 8 and LLOQ* (Day 1 and Day 29) For each stud y group the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer 8 and LLOQ* and associated two -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CI s will be computed by the N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y on Day 1 and Day 29. Differences in percentages and CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol 08-FEB -2019 79associated 95% CIs between study groups will be calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen score method. * Note: To be assessed for each serogroup if the pre- defined LLOQ value for that serogroup is >8. 10.8. Analysis of safety Analy sis will be performed on the solicited safet y set for solicited reactions and on unsolicited safet y set for unsolicited adv erse events. 10.8.1. Analysis of Solicited Local, Sy stemic and Other A dverse Events All solicited adverse events will be summarized according to defined severity grading scales. Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each adverse event will be prese nted for each s ymptom severity . Summary tables showing the occurrence of an y local or s ystemic adverse event overall and at each time point will also be presented. Post-vaccination solicited adverse events reported from Day 1 to Day 7 will be summarized fo r the intervals Day 1 (6 hours) -Day 3, Day s 4-7, Day 1 (6 hours) -Day 7 by maximal severit y and by stud y group. Separate anal yses will be performed for solicited AEs reported 30 minutes after vaccination. The severit y of solicited local adverse events, including injection -site ery thema and induration, will be categorized based on linear measurement: Absent (0- 24 mm), Mild (25- 50 mm), Moderate (51 -100 mm) or Severe (> 100mm). Injection site pain and s ystemic reactions, including fatigue, headache, myalgi a, arthralgia, chills, nausea, loss of appetite, occurring up to 7 day s after each vaccination will be summarized according to \"mild\", \"moderate\" or \"severe\". Each solicited local and systemic adverse event will also be further summarized as \"absent\" vers us \"any \". Use of antip yretics and analgesics will be summarized by frequency , by type of use (proph ylactic versus treatment) and percentage of subjects reporting use . Body temperature will be summarized separatel y according to the 3 schemes described below and will be broken down according to route of measurement: by 0.5 \u00b0C increments from 36.0\u00b0C 39.0, 39.5, 40.0\u00b0C. 08-FEB -2019 8010.8.2. Analysis of Unsolicited A dverse Events This analy sis applies to all adverse events occurring during the study , judged either as probably related, possibly related, or not related to vaccination by the investigator, recorded in AE CRF, with a start date on or after the date of first vaccination. AE starting prior to the first vaccination will only be listed. The original verbatim terms used by investigators to identify adverse events in the CRFs will be mapped to preferred terms using the MedDR A dictionary . The adverse events will then be grouped by MedDRA preferred terms into frequency tables according to sy stem organ class (SOC). All reported adverse events, as well as adverse events judged b y the investigator as at least possibly related to study vaccine, will be summarized according to SOC and preferred term within SOC. These summaries will be presented b y study group and by interval of study observation. When an adverse event occurs more than once for a subject, the maximal severity and str ongest relationship to the vaccine will be counted. Separate summaries will be produced for the following categories: Adverse events that are possibly or probabl y related to vaccine Unsolicited AEs reported within 30 minutes after vaccination Unsolicited A Es reported within 28 day s after vaccination Adverse events leading to withdrawal Adverse events leading to a medicall y attended visit Serious adverse events. Data listings of all adverse events will be provided by subject. In addition, adverse events in the categories above will be provided as listed data. 10.9. Interpretation of analy ses 10.9.1. Primary immunogenicity objective The anal ysis population for the non -inferiority analy sis is the Per Protocol Set (PPS). To demonstrate non -inferiority of the investigational M enACWY liquid vaccine to the currentl y licensed MenACWY vaccine ( Menveo ), the lower limit of the two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the hSBA GMT ratios for serogroup A at Day 29, must be greater than 0.5. Hy pothesis testing will be performed at an overall significance level () of 2.5% (one -sided) using a non -inferiority margin of 0.5 for GMT ratios: Null hy pothesis ): 08-FEB -2019 81Where: 0.5 is the non- inferiority margin for the ratio of GMTs between Group ACWY_L iq and Group ACWY ; and are the population means of the logarithmicall y (base of 10) transformed titers for serogroup A in Group ACWY_L iq and Group ACWY, respectively . If the lower limit of the two -sided 95% CI for the hSBA GMT ratio is greater than 0.5, then we conclude non -inferiority . 10.9.2. Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives Analy sis of secondary objectives will be descriptive. 10.10. Conduct of analy ses Any deviation(s) or chang e(s) from the original statistical plan outlined in this protocol will be described and justified in the final study report. 10.10.1. Sequence of analy ses The anal ysis will be performed in the following steps: An interim anal ysis will be performed after the availability of the Visit 2 (day 29) immunogenicit y and safety data. The analysis on immunogenicit y and safety data collected up to day 29 (Visit 2) might be reported in an interim clinical study report (CSR) for regulatory purposes. The anal ysis on safety data received after Visit 2 until study end (Day 181) will be performed after study end, once all data are available and cleaned. A final integrated CSR including the interim and the final anal yses will be written at this point in time. An integrated clinical study report containing all data will be written and made available to the investigators. 10.10.2. Statistical considerations for interim analyses The interim and final analy ses will be performed sequentially . An interim analy sis will include the anal yses of the primary and secondary endpoints and safety data. The anal ysis will be performed after the availability of the Visit 2 immunogenicity and safet y data. The results of the interim anal ysis will provide inf ormation to plan the study design for a Phase 3 stud y. The interim anal ysis will be performed b y the BioStatistics and Statistical Programming department. Details on how the interim analysis will be performed will be added to the Statistical Analy sis Plan . ACWY_Liq30ACWY CONFIDENTIAL INISTRA TIVE M ATTERS To comply with ICH GCP administrative obligations relating to data collection, monitoring, archiving data, audits, confidentiality , public disclosure requirements and publications must be fulfilled. 11.1. Electronic Case Report Form in structions A validated GSK defined electronic data collection tool will be used as the method for data collection. In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to GSK. Subject data necessary for anal ysis and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database or data s ystem. Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures. While completed eCRFs are reviewed b y a GSK Biologicals' Site Monitor at the study site, omissions or inconsistencies detected b y subsequent eCRF review may necessitate clarification or correction by the investigator or appropriatel y qualified designee. In all cases, the investigator remains accountable for the study data. The investigator will be provided with an electronic format in read only mode of the final version of the data generated at the investigational site once the database is archived and thestudy report is complete and approved b y all parties. 11.2. Subject Diary Electronic Diaries (eDiaries), hereafter referred to as Subject Diaries will be the only source document allowed for solicited local and s ystemic adverse events (including bod y temperatur e measurements), starting after the initial 30 minute post- vaccination period at the clinic. The following additional rules appl y to documentation of safety information collected in the Subject Diary . The Investigator or delegated staff should monitor the Subject's Diary status throughout the study for compliance and an y solicited local and systemic adverse events that were of concern to the subject. No corrections or additions of data recorded by the subjects/parents/LARs will be allowed once diary complet ion for that day has been performed. The Subject Diary will be designed in such a way as to prevent an y blank, incomplete or biologically implausible entries. Subjects /parents/LARs will be instructed to fully complete the Subject Diary each day , as per the instructions provided. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 Protocol 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 83At or just in advance of each subject visit, site staff must review the Subject Diary data via the provider's web portal. It is necessary for site staff to acknowledge in the source documents that review of Subject Diary data for th e preceding post - vaccination period has been performed. At the end of the study it is necessary for the investigator to acknowledge in the eCRF that the review of Subject Diary data has been performed for each subject. For vaccination visits, site staff mu st ensure that each subject's Diary is prepared for data capture in the ensuing post -vaccination period by confirming the visit within the eDiary /eDiary system. Any new safet y information reported during the site visit (including a solicited adverse event) cannot be entered into the Subject Diary. Such information must be described in the source notes as a verbally -reported event. Any adverse event reported in this fashion must be described as an unsolicited adverse event and therefore entered on the advers e event page of the eCRF. 11.3. Stud y Monitoring by GSK Biologicals GSK will monitor the study to verify that, amongst other items, the: Data are authentic, accurate, and complete. Safety and rights of subjects are being protected. Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol, any other study agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the monitor dire ct access to all relevant documents. The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel for monitoring visits. Direct access to all stud y-site related and source data is mandatory for the purpose of monitoring review. The monitor will perform a eCRF review and a Source Document Verification (SDV). By SDV we understand verifying eCRF entries by comparing them with the source data that will be made available by the investigator for this purpose. The Source Documentation Agreement Form describes the source data for the different data in the eCRF. This document should be completed and signed by the site monitor and investigator and should be filed in the investigator's study file. Any data item for which the eCRF will serve as the source must be identified, agreed and documented in the source documentation agreement form. Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study , the monitor will conduct site closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as approp riate, in accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 8411.4. Record retention Following closure of the study , the investigator must maintain all site study records (except for those required by local regulations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and secure location. The records must be easily accessible, when needed (e.g. audit or inspection), and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the facility , supporting s ystems, and staff. Where permitted by applicable laws/r egulations or institutional policy , some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format other than hard copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate cop y of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the investigator must ensure that an acceptable back -up of the reproductions exists and that there is an acceptable quality control procedure in place for making these reproductions. GSK will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records to comply with all applicable regul atory requirements. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated b y ICH GCP, any institutional requirements, applicable laws or regulations, or GSK standards/procedures, otherwise, the minimum ret ention period will default to 25 y ears after completion of the study report. The investigator/institution must notify GSK of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but not limited to archival at an off -site facility , transfer of ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site. 11.5. Qualit y assurance To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, GSK may conduct a qualit y assurance audit. Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory inspection of this study . Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to all ocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 11.6. Posting of information on publicly available clinical trial registers and publication policy GSK assures that the key design elements of this protocol will be posted on the GSK website and in publicly accessible database(s) such as clinicaltrials.gov, in compliance with the current regulations. GSK also assures that results of this study will be posted on the GSK website and in publicly accessible regulatory registry (ies) within the required time-frame, in compliance with the current regulations. The minimal requirement is to have primary endpoint summary results disclosed at latest 12 months post primary completion date (PCD) and to have se condary endpoint disclosed at latest 12 months after the last subject last visit (LSLV) as described in the protocol. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 Protocol 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 85As per EU regulation, summaries of the results of GSK interventional studies (phase I- IV) in adult population conducted in at least one EU member state will be posted on publicly available EMA registers within 12 months of EoS (as defined in the protocol) in the concerned EU member state. However, where, for scientific reasons detailed in the protocol, it is not possible to submit a summary of the results within one y ear in the concerned EU member state , the summary of results shall be submitted as soon as it is available. In this case, the protocol shall specify when the results are going to be submitted, together with a justification. GSK also aims to publish the results of these studies in searchable, peer reviewed scientific literature and follows the guidance from the I nternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors. 11.7. Provision of study results to investigators Where required b y applica ble regulatory requirements, an investigator signatory will be identified for the approval of the study report. The investigator will be provided reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the opportunity to review the complete study results at a GSK site or other mutually - agreeable location. GSK Biologicals will also provide the investigator with the full summary of the study results. The investigator is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as appropriate. 11.8. Data Sharing Under the framework of the SHARE initiative, results of GSK studies may be combined with non- GSK studies, to investigate further about the study product(s) and other product(s), and /or the disease/condition under investigation and related diseases and conditions.

Requirements for Germany Explanatory statement concerning Gender Distribution ( Article 7, paragraph 2 (12) of the German GCP ORDER) Recruitment for this MENACWY CONJ -032 [V59_71] study will include males and females. A subgroup analysis b y sex will be performed for the primary and secondary objectives. To not expose pregnant women and their foetuses/children to the new liquid formulati on of the MENACWY vaccine, females enrolled in this trial will either be of non-childbearing potential (i.e., have a current tubal ligation or occlusion, sterectom y, bilateral ovariectomy or premenarchal or postmenopausal), or if she is of childbearin g potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 day s prior to the beginning of the administration of study treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions during the entire treatment period (1 month after vaccination) ( Refer to the study protocol, Section 4.2\"Inclusion criteria\" and Section 4.3\"Exclusion criteria\"). The recruitment will be closed to females who are pregnant or lactating. The indication of the vaccine under investigation is active immunization to prevent invasive meningococcal disease caused b y N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y. Meningococcal disease affects both men and women. Based on surveillance by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the annual notification rate of invasive meningococcal disease per 100,000 population is 0.94 in males and 0.8 3 in females of all age groups [ Whittaker , 2017]. There are no reports of gender differences in the efficacy or safet y outcomes for persons having r eceived the licensed Menveo vaccine. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY 08-FEB -2019 8713.

Clinical conditions representing a contraindication to intramuscular vaccination and blood draws. In Section 5.1 Regulatory and ethical considerations, including the informed consent process , the following changes have been made: Freely given a nd written or witnessed/ thumb printed informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or each subject's parent(s)/LAR(s) and subject informed assent , as appropriate, prior to participation in the study . GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Inform ed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody the ICH GCP and GSK Biologicals required elements. While it is strongly recommended that this model I CF is to be followed as closely as possible, the informed consent requirements given in this document are not inten ded to pre -empt an y local regulations CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 3 Final 08-FEB -2019 92which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y effective. Clinical judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final structure and content of the local versio n of the ICF. In accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, those subjects who can only be enrolled in the study with the consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative (e.g. minors), should be informe d about the study to the extent compatible with the subject's understanding and, if capable, the subject should sign and personally date a written informed assent form (IAF). It is required that the assent be signed by each subject, if capable, in addition to the informed consent that is to be signed by his/her legal representative. It should be assessed whether an assent is required depending of the age of the study population and the local requirements. GSK Biologicals strongly recommends that if the subj ect reaches the age of consent during the study they will be asked to provide consent at the next study visit (if applicable). This procedure should be applied according to local laws and regulations. The investigator has the final responsibility for the f inal presentation of the ICF and IAF, respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF and IAF generated by the investigator with the assistance of the sponsor's representative must be acceptable to GSK Biologicals and be approved (along with the protocol, and any other necessary documentation) by the IRB/IEC.

In Section 8 Safety, the following change was made: Each subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately should they manifest any signs or s ymptoms they perceive as serious. In Section 8.1.3 Solicited adverse events , the following change was made: The term \"reactogenicit y\" refers to solicited signs and symptoms (\"solicited adverse events\") occurring in the hours and day s following a vaccination, to be collected by the subjects /parents/LARs for 7 consecutive days (6 hours - Day 7), using a pre -defined CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 08-FEB -2019 97Subject Diary . Solicited adverse events continuing bey ond Day 7 should continue to be recorded in the eDiary until resolution or next v isit. In Section 8.1.4 Unsolicited Adverse Events , the following changes were made: An unsolicited adverse event is an adverse event that was not solicited using a Subject Diary and that was spontaneously communicated by a subject /parent(s)/LAR(s) who has signed the informed consent. Potential unsolicited AEs may be medicall y attended (defined as s ymptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider), or were of concern to the subjects/parents/LARs. In case of such events, subjects /parents/LARs will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to report the event(s). The detailed information about the reported unsolicited AEs will be collected b y the qualified site personnel during the interview and will be documented in the subject's records. Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by subjects /parents/LARs will be collected during interview with the subjects /parents/LARs and by review of available medical re cords at the next visit. In Section 8.3.3.1 Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse events , the following change was made: As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject or the subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) be asked a non-leading question such as: In Section 8.3.3.4 Medically attended visits , the following change was made: For each solicited and unsolicited sy mptom the subject experiences, the subject/subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked if he/she receiv ed medical attention defined as hospitalization, or an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason , including emergency room visits. This information will be recorded in the eCRF . In Section 8.9 Subject card , the following chang es were made: Study subjects/subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main contact for information about the clinical study . The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a \"subject card\" to each subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) . In an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible attending phy sician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant information may be obtained by contacting the investigator. Subjects /subject s' parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at all times during the stud y duration. CONFIDENTIAL 205343 (MENACWY CONJ-032 08-FEB -2019 98In Section 9.2.1 Subject withdrawal from the study , the following changes were made: Information relative to the withdrawal will be doc umented in the eCRF. The investigator will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y the subject himself/herself, by the subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s), or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal: *In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she /thesubjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified b y the subject /subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) , in the eCRF . In Section 10.4.7 Subgroups , the following changes been made: A subgroup anal ysis for GMTs , percentages of 8 and LLOQ* against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at Day 29, will be performed for subjects who were seronegative at baseline. In addition, subgroup analy ses will be performed for GMTs ,and four 4-fold rise , percentages of subjects with hSBA titer 8 and LLOQ* by sex, by race, and by country . *Note: To be assessed for each serogroup if the pre- defined LLOQ value for that serogroup is > 8. In Section 11.2 Subject Diary, the following changes were made No corrections or additions of data recorded by the subjects/parents/LARs will be allowed once diary completion for that day has been performed. The Subject Diary will be designed in such a way as to prevent an y blank, incomplete or biologically implausible entries. Subjects /parents/LARs will be instructed to fully complete the Subject Diary each day , as per the instructions provided.

Amended text has been included in bold italics and deleted text in strikethrough in the following sections: On the protocol cover page , the second coordinating author's name was deleted and only original protocol author's name was retained as per the template guidance. In Section 1.2, Rationale for the study and study design , the following statement was updated to correct a typographical error: For this study, the formulation with approximately 30% of free MenA oligosaccharides will be obtained by storing a fresh manufacturing MenA lot at approximately 22.5\u00b0C (7772.5\u00b0F) for the time needed to accelerate the formation of the free saccharides following the Arrhenius model. In Section 1.3, Benefit: Risk Assessment , the risk table was updated to reflect the potential and identified risks for MenACWY vaccine in alignment with the current version of the EU-RMP and as follows: \u0003 CONFIDENTIAL Potential /Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Menveo and investigational MenACWY liquid vaccine Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis Thrombocytopenia Vasculitis including Kawasaki disease Brachial neuritis Facial Paresis Severe injection site reactions Systemic reactions (severe), including febrile convulsion Vaccination failure (lack of efficacy)Potential risks as included in the Menveo EU Risk Management Plan.Accept as Menveo is a licensed product and the incid ence of the potential risks is low to very low. Important Identified risk: Reconstitution errorsCases describing medication errors due to administration of the MenCWY conjugate liquid component only without reconstitution with the MenA conjugate lyophilized component , or due to administration of the MenA conjugate lyophilized component only after reconstitution with a different solvent ,have been reported during the MenACWY clinical development program.In several sections of the protoc ol (e.g. Section 6.1. \"Description of study vaccines \") it is clarified that the 2 vaccine components have to be reconstituted before vaccine injection. Important potential risk: Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)GBS has been observed with other vaccines. No cases have been reported during the MenACWY clinical development program.GBS will be monitored through SAE collection. Important potential risk: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)ADEM has been obse rved with other vaccines. Two cases from clinical trials were retrieved from the GSK's global safety database for MenACWY. None of them has provided sufficient evidence of a causal association between ADEM and MenACWY.ADEM will be monitored through SAE co llection. Important potential risk: ThrombocytopeniaImmune thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in association with several licensed vaccines. Two cases related to MenACWY were reported during the clinical development program, but none of them has provided a clear association between thrombocytopenia and the vaccine.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura will be monitored through SAE collection. CONFIDENTIAL (MENACWY CONJ-032 [V59_71]) Protocol -2019 101Important Potential /Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Important potential risk: Facial paresisFacial paresis was recognized as an important potential risk following the results of a sponsored observational study (V59_34OB) which found an imbalance of cases of facial paresis following vaccination with MenACWY, mainly when administered concomitantly with other vaccines. No cases of facial paresis were reported from interventional clinical trials.Paralysis of the face is mentioned in the list of side effects in the ICF. Facial paresis will be monitored through SAE collection. Important potential risk: Vasculitis including Kawasaki disease (KD)There were 7 cases of suspected KD reported in three clinical studies of Menveo. The occurrence of the cases in Menveo studies is consistent with the known epidemiology of KD in terms of geographic and tempo ral clustering, and seasonal variation. Therefore there is no evidence of a causal association between KD and MenACWY vaccine. As the exposure in clinical trial of subject was limited considering the incidence of the disease, KD is considered as a potential risk.Vasculitis including Kawasaki disease will be monitored through SAE collection. Study Procedures Risk of blood sampling Blood sampling associated risk of syncope, dizziness, infection at the site after or during venepuncture.Blood samples will be obtained by a trained professional and medical assistance will be available. The potential risk of feeling faint, or experiencing mild local pain, bruising, irritation or redness at the site where blood was taken, is mentioned in the Informed Consent Form ( ICF). The amount of blood to be taken for sampling will not be harmful to the subject's health. For consistency throughout the protocol, the phrase \"solicited s ymptoms\" was changed to \"solicited adverse events\". Section 8.3.3.2.1, Assessment of intensity , has been updated to correct the intensity scores of some of the AEs solicited .
