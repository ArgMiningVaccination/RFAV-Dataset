He seeks to offer a judgment free zone which frees us from fear, resentment and judgment. His approach integrates Compassionate Communication and Acceptance and Commitment Training into a model that supports present moment focus with compassionate self care and unhooking from mental/emotional stuckness. Values clarification, strengths acknowledgement, encouragement and deep listening support the client in moving forward one day at a time with enhanced serenity, less craving in a direction that is toward valued clean and sober living. Relationship coaching begins with noticing our relationship with ourselves and how that effects our other relationships. Mike has found that most of us have learned communication styles that do not support mutual respect, empathic understanding, acceptance with non-judgment and equality. Those are the qualities that build trust, loving kindness, joyful living and appreciation. With learning the practice of Compassionate Communication and Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT), we can develop our emotional intelligence and awareness of our needs and values. We can learn to support ourselves and each other with mutual empowerment and \"power with\" each other rather than \"power over\" the other. We can then translate awareness and knowledge into mutually satisfying relationships. Most of our struggles are with not wanting to be present and accepting of our here and now experience. Compassionate Communication and Acceptance and Commitment Training are mindfulness based approaches to relieve human suffering through freeing ourselves with awareness, acceptance, appreciation and affection. Radical responsibility and radical acceptance can free us and empower us to move forward in our most valued direction with meaning, joy and balance. The Compassionate Communication Circle is an ongoing group focused on developing a practice of Nonviolent Communication (NVC). NVC is a method that uses mindfulness and authentic language to strengthen our connection with ourselves and with others. As a group, we will develop fluency in empathy, awareness of feelings and needs, and mutual respect. Growth will be supported in a safe and accepting space that is challenging, playful, and transformative. Call or email us for more information.
