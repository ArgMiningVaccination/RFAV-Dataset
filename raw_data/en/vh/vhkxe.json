Fancher, M.D. State EMS Medical Director SUBJECT : Mobile Intensive Care Technician Standing Orders for Mass Prophylaxis Following a Bioterrorism Incident The document, Mobile Intensive Care Technician Biological Outbreak/Exposure Mass Prophylaxis & Immunization Standing Orders , is the first edition of a manual that provides the Department of Health with standing orders for preventive antibiotic therapy and/or immunizations in the event of a bioterrorism attack due to anthrax, brucellosis, plague, smallpox, or tularemia. The document contains 1) an over view of the bioterrorism preparedness response plans regarding mass prophylaxis and immunization; 2) standing order protocols for anthrax, brucellosis, plague, smallpox, and tularemia; 3) antibiotic information for practitioners; 4) antibiotic information brochures for patients; and 4) data management and consent forms. This document should be considered an annex to the State of Hawaii EMS MICT Standing Orders and Extended Standing Orders . The standing orders contained within this document become activ ated when the Director of Health declares a state of emergency due to a specific bioterrorism incident, and issues a memorandum ordering the EMS prehospital providers to begin mass prophylaxis. The memorandum would contain information regarding the nature of the bioterrorism incident, the causative microorganism, the population at risk, and the mass prophylaxis protocol to be followed. This document may be reviewed annually to ensure that the standing orders are up to date, and reflect the latest availabl e recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response. cc: EMS Medical Directors Mobile Intensive Care Technician Biological Outbreak/Exposure Mass Prophylaxis and Immunization Standi ng Orders OVERVIEW INTRODUCTION An intentional biological agent release may produce thousands of casualties. Victims of a bioterrorism (BT) incident may die despite the best medical management. Case fatality rates will depend upon the specific microbial agent released, and the susceptibility of the exposed population. The rapid implementation of a mass prophylaxis program is the most effective method of countering the consequences of a biological incident. The best chance to save lives following such an event is through early recognition and prompt administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and, if available, vaccines to exposed (infected) individuals before symptoms occur. The standing orders in this manual are specific for the mass prophylax is and immunization for BT incidents involving anthrax, brucellosis, plague, smallpox, and tularemia. They can be adapted for other BT agents that might be used in a BT attack. The bacteria that cause anthrax, plague, tularemia, and brucellosis are susce ptible to antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy of exposed, or potentially exposed, individuals will prevent or mitigate these diseases and save lives. No preventive antiviral drugs against smallpox currently exist. Vaccine supplies for smallpox and anthrax are currently limited. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccines against aerosol exposure to plague, brucellosis, and tularemia either do not exist, or are ineffective. POLICIES 1. A mass prophylaxis program will be implemented within 24 hours of recognition of a BT incident. 2. The Department of Health (DOH) has the legal authority to adopt rules requiring and governing immunizations against any communicable disease if a suitable immunizing agent is available for the disease, and a need for immu nization against it exists within Overview Page 2 the State. The department may also provide vaccines and other immunizing agents to private and public health care providers for administration to the general public (\u00a7325 -32, Hawaii Revised Statutes). The DOH will establish standing orders for the administration of antibiotics and vaccines, and establish a priority list for the distribution of these prophylactic pharmaceuticals. 3. If a BT event occurs, the DOH will define the distribution and determina nts of the disease event, including the case definition, etiology, source, time, person, place, disease pattern, risk factors, exposed populations, and mass prophylaxis recommendations. OPERATIONS 1. The State Epidemiologist will investigate suspected or co nfirmed outbreaks involving BT organisms (e.g., anthrax, brucellosis, plague, smallpox and tularemia); and other mysterious or undiagnosed disease outbreaks that threaten the public's health. The State Epidemiologist will determine appropriate disease con trol measures, and report findings and recommendations to the Director of Health. 2. The Director of Health activates the DOH Emergency Operations Center (EOC), as outlined in the State of Hawaii DOH Emergency Operations Plan , when notified by law enforcemen t agencies of a credible BT threat, or by recommendations of the State Epidemiologist that a true state, or county - wide, infectious disease emergency exists. 3. The Director of Health may order DOH personnel and EMS providers to activate plans for mass proph ylaxis and/or immunization when: a. A single confirmed case is identified in the community that can't be attributed to a natural infection. b. Multiple confirmed or highly suspected cases have occurred within a short period of time, and the source of the infect ion is unknown. c. Law enforcement or public health officials have determined that a definite or highly probable release of a virulent biological agent has occurred within the community. 4. The Public Health Nursing Branch (PHNB) and EMS providers will conduct mass prophylaxis at Public Health Clinics identified and activated by the Director of Health following a BT event. Other clinic sites may be activated, if necessary, at neighborhood fire stations, additional city and county locations, or other state govern ment facilities depending upon the magnitude and location of the exposure or outbreak. These clinics will be referred to as Neighborhood Assistance Centers (NAC). Overview Page 3 5. The NAC will provide basic information to the public, provide prevent ive medications and/or immunizations, and direct victims to appropriate treatment centers. Public health nurses and other DOH employees together with community volunteers will staff NAC sites as outlined in the State of Hawaii DOH Emergency Operations Pla n. 6. The EMS Administration will be the central point of communication, mobilization, and staffing for DOH prophylaxis sites during a BT event. The Deputy Director for the Health Resources Administration will determine the nursing personnel that will repor t for duty, and their distribution in the field to include: nursing offices, emergency units, shelters, public health clinic sites, and field operations. 7. NAC will administer antibiotics and/or vaccines to exposed asymptomatic individuals. Symptomatic, or ill individuals will be referred to hospitals, private physicians, or mass care centers depending upon the severity of the symptoms and magnitude of the BT event. 8. NAC personnel which may include EMS personnel are responsible for client registration, inf ormed consent, maintaining client health records, and tracking individuals. 9. NAC personnel will collect the following data on a daily basis and report theses findings to the EMS provider administration which will be transmitted to the Director of Health: a. The number of clients starting antibiotic prophylaxis or vaccination. b. The number of clients completing antibiotic prophylaxis or vaccination. c. The number of clients presenting with symptoms. d. The number of clients developing symptoms during or after proph ylaxis and/or vaccination. e. The number of clients referred to an in -patient medical facility for treatment. f. The number of clients developing adverse reactions to prophylaxis or immunization. 10. NAC personnel will report the names of clients who are infected w ith identified BT agents, people directly exposed to these cases, or people environmentally exposed to these microbial agents and transmit information to the Director of Health. 11. Each client will receive a one -week supply of antibiotics. This will require that clients return to the NAC for refills. 12. Infection control procedures will follow recommendations outlined in the document written by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and the CDC entitled Bioterrorism Read iness Plan, a Template for Healthcare Facilities. 13. Public Health Nursing sections are responsible for maintaining adequate infection control supplies and protective clothing for the clinic staff. Overview Page 4 REFERENCES 1.

Fancher, M.D. Effective Date: November 1, 2001 Subject: Mobile Intensive Care Technician Standing Orders for Administration of Immunizations Review Date: November 30, 2002 PROTOCOL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VACCINES & MEDICATIONS GENERAL GUIDEL INES All those who administer medications or vaccines must be aware that the recipient could experience an adverse reaction following the injection. Adverse reactions to vaccines are infrequent, but if an allergic reaction does occur, it can be life threatening. Staff need to be prepared to respond immediately and appropriately to such emergencies. All clinic personnel must familiarize themselves with the management protocols contained herein and know where the emergency supplies are kept. TYPES OF ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to an injection can range from a general feeling of faintness to a severe allergic reaction. Faintness or syncope are the more common of adverse reactions and are usually self limited; true allergic react ions are rare. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may be mild, such as itching and hives, or severe , with shortness of breath, wheezing, and/or anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions may begin almost immediately after the injection is given. Anaphyla xis is characterized by acute, progressive, respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse (shock). Early recognition of an anaphylactic reaction is important because death can occur within minutes following the first symptoms. It is important to distinguish between faintness/syncope and anaphylaxis. Should an adverse reaction occur, assess the patient and FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED IN THE ATTACHED PROTOCOL.

Several countries around the world maintain biological weapons. Use of these weapons could cause widespread illness among unprotected gro ups of people. Anthrax is the biological weapon most likely to be encountered because it is highly lethal, easy to produce in large quantities, relatively easy to develop as a weapon, easily spread over a large area, and easily stored and dangerous for a long time. There is reason to believe that you may have been exposed to anthrax either through a natural exposure, or through an act of biological terrorism or war. What is anthrax? Anthrax is a disease normally associated with plant -eating animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, and swine. It is caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis. Once common where livestock were raised, it is now controlled through animal vaccination programs. Anthrax still occurs in countries where animals are not vaccinated, mainly in Africa and Asia. It does occur infrequently in the United States. Human infection with anthrax usually results from direct contact with infected animals, or animal products such as wool, meat or hides. However, when anthrax is used as a biolog ical weapon, breathing anthrax that is released into the air infects people. Inhalational anthrax is the disease that results from breathing anthrax. Symptoms of inhalation anthrax can begin as early as 24 hours after breathing anthrax spores. Initial s ymptoms include: fever, cough, and weakness and usually progress to breathing problems, shock, and death. Why Vaccinate? Vaccines prevent illness by stimulating the body's natural disease -fighting abilities. They are among the most powerful tools devel oped by modern medicine for keeping people healthy. Vaccines are routinely used in the United States to protect against diseases such as mumps, measles, whooping cough, and polio. What is the anthrax vaccine? Anthrax vaccine is a sterile product made from filtrates of cultures of a strain of the anthrax organism that does not cause disease. The vaccine contains no living or dead anthrax organisms. The anthrax vaccine is not new. Human anthrax vaccines were developed in England and the U.S. in the 19 50s and early 1960s. The anthrax vaccine you will receive was licensed by the FDA in 1970 and has been manufactured by the Michigan Biologic Products Institute (MBPI) under Establishment License No. 99. BioPort purchased MBPI in September of 1998 and wil l continue to manufacture the anthrax vaccine. It has been safely and routinely administered in the United States to veterinarians, laboratory workers, and livestock handlers for more than twenty -five years. Anthrax Vaccine Information Brochure For Health Care Professionals Page 2 Facts about the anthrax vaccine? ? Vaccination is a critical part of protection against infection and disease. ? Manufactured in the United States. ? Safely used for more than 25 years. ? As with other vaccinati ons, pain may occur at the site of injection. ? Temporary side effects (sore arm, redness, slight swelling, and a small nodule or knot under the skin) may occur. ? No known long term side effects. ? Six shots are required over 18 months, follow ed by an annual booster for routine prevention. ? In a post -exposure situation, people that have never received an anthrax vaccine will receive a primary series of immunization consisting of three shots given at 0, 2, and 4 weeks administered subcutane ously. ? Individuals previously vaccinated with fewer than three doses will receive a single 0.5 ml booster dose subcutaneously. Is this an experimental vaccine? No, anthrax vaccine has been FDA approved since 1970. Is the vaccine safe? Yes, this v accine has been safely and routinely administered in the U.S. to veterinarians, laboratory workers, and livestock handlers since 1970. The manufacturer, the Michigan Biologic Products Institute, has received no reports of serious adverse effects. Is ther e anyone who should not receive the vaccine? Anthrax vaccine should not be administered to anyone who has a known history of allergic reaction to a prior anthrax shot. What about pregnancy? There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the vaccine is harmful during pregnancy. The vaccine is usually not administered during pregnancy during routine situations. However, if a pregnant woman is exposed to aerosolized anthrax spores, the benefits of anthrax immunization far outweighs any potential risk. What other medical conditions could affect the use of this vaccine? In the event of an exposure to aerosolized anthrax spores, only allergy to the vaccine would be a reason not to receive the protection from the vaccine. Anthrax Vaccine Information Brochur e For Health Care Professionals Page 3 How many shots will be given? ? Six shots are required over 18 months, followed by an annual booster for routine prevention. ? In a post -exposure situation, people that have never received an anthrax vaccin e will receive a primary series of immunization consisting of three shots given at 0, 2, and 4 weeks administered subcutaneously. ? Individuals previously vaccinated with fewer than three doses will receive a single 0.5 ml booster dose subcutaneously. What are the side effects? As with other vaccinations, pain may occur at the site of injection. Temporary side effects (sore arm, redness, and slight swelling may occur. The vaccine has been in use since 1970 with no known long -term side effects. State of Hawaii Department of Health Emergency Medical Services System Page 1 of 3 Approved By: Donald C.

INDICATION Post-exposure vaccination for individuals exposed to a case of smallpox or aerosolized variola virus following a bio -terrorism event . PRIORITY LIST 1. Exposed individ uals 2. Essential Service Personnel 3. General Population (if warranted) DOSAGE , ROUTE , AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION 1. Vaccination is performed by cutaneous inoculation of vaccinia virus and scarification using the multiple -puncture technique with a bifurcated n eedle. 2. A sterile bifurcated needle is inserted into an ampoule of reconstituted vaccine and, on withdrawal, a droplet of vaccine sufficient for vaccination containing an infectious dose of about 2 x 105 plaque forming units of vaccine strain vaccinia virus is held by capillarity attraction between the two tines of the needle.

Fancher, M.D. Effective Date: November 1, 2001 Subject: Smallpox Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (Vaccinia Virus Vaccination) Review Date: November 30, 2002 3. The needle is held at right angels to the skin. 4. The wrist of the vaccinator rests against the arm. 5. Fifteen perpendicular str okes of the needle are rapidly made in an area of about 5 mm in diameter that penetrates into the epidermis of the deltoid region of the arm. 6. The strokes should be vigorous enough that a trace of blood appears at the vaccination site after 15 to 30 second s. 7. After vaccination, excess vaccine should be wiped from the site with sterile gauze. The gauze should then be discarded in a hazardous waste receptacle. 8. The site should be covered with a loose, non -occlusive bandage to deter the individual from touchin g the site and perhaps transferring virus to other parts of the body. The vaccination site should be covered at all times with a porous bandage until the scab has separated and the underlying skin has healed. An occlusive bandage should not be used. The site should be kept dry. When the client bathes, the site should be covered with an impermeable bandage. 9. Two to five days after primary vaccination, a papule forms and then becomes a vesicle two to three days later. The vesicle reaches a maximum size b y day 8 to 10. A scab forms within two weeks leaving behind a scar when healing is complete. Mild fever and localized (regional) swollen lymph glands are often present during the first two weeks after vaccination. Precautions 1. Before administering the v accine, a careful history should be performed to document the absence of contraindications to vaccination among both clients and their household contacts. 2. Eczema, a history of eczema, or immunodeficiency are contraindications to smallpox vaccination. 3. Vaccinia vaccine should not be administered if the above conditions are present among clients or their household contacts.

Fancher, M.D. Effective Date: November 1, 2001 Subject: Smallpox Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (Vaccinia Virus Vaccination) Review Date: November 30, 2002 Contraindications 1. Hypersensitivity to the vaccine or its components including pe rsons allergic to polymyxin B sulfate, streptomycin sulfate, chlortetracycline hydrochloride, or neomycin sulfate. 2. Immunodeficiency including HIV infection, and transplant recipients. 3. A history or presence of eczema, or presence of active skin conditions s uch as burns, atopic dermatitis, impetigo, or varicella zoster. vaccinia. 5. Accidental inoculation of vaccine to o ther sites or unvaccinated contacts. 6. Bullous erythema multiforme and uriticarial and erythematous eruptions. Treatment Complications 1. Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG): 0.6 mL/kg IM 2. The standard VIG dose may be large (a total dose of about 40 mL in 70 kg adults). Therefore, the dose may need to be divided and given over a 24 to 36 hour period. Doses may be repeated, usually at intervals of 2 -3 days, until recovery begins. VIG is effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality from vaccinia nec rosum, eczema vaccinatum, severe cases of generalized vaccinia, and possibly ocular inoculation. It is of no benefit for the treatment of postvaccinial encephalitis. VIG and Vaccinia Virus Vaccine are only available through the CDC (404 -639- 3670). Vacci nia (Smallpox) Vaccine What You Need To Know WHAT IS SMALLPOX ? Smallpox is a serious highly infectious disease that affects humans. A virus called variola causes smallpox. This disease was eradicated from the world through a worldwide vaccination progra m. There has been no natural case of smallpox reported on earth since 1977. Smallpox is initially characterized by the sudden onset of chills, high fever, headache, backache, and muscle aches with the subsequent development of a widespread skin rash. The rash consists of pimples that eventually blister, produce pus, and form pockmarks. Smallpox is spread from person to person. The attack rate (spread) among contacts of smallpox is about 50%. Today, the only way a person could \"catch\" smallpox is by accidental exposure with the virus in a smallpox research laboratory; intentional release of an aerosol containing the smallpox virus as a result of a bio -terrorism event; or from contact with a person that developed smallpox following such an exposure. If the smallpox virus is used in a bio -terrorism incident, the virus would most likely be disseminated in an aerosol cloud, and exposed individuals would breathe the virus into their lungs, and be spread throughout the body eventually producing smallpox disea se. Secondary cases would arise in the community from person to person spread of the virus. Smallpox is deadly, and up to 40 % of smallpox cases will die. There is no known treatment for smallpox. WHAT IS THE VACCINIA (SMALLPOX ) VACCINE ? Vaccinia vacci ne, previously known as smallpox vaccine, is highly effective in producing immunity (protection) to smallpox. Because of the low risk of contracting smallpox, the routine use of vaccinia vaccine in the United States was discontinued after 1971. The vacci nia vaccine protection against smallpox lasts about 10 years. The opinion of public health experts is that almost all of the United States population is now susceptible to the smallpox virus. The vaccinia vaccine licensed in the United States contains live vaccinia virus, derived from the New York City Board of Health strain of vaccinia. Vaccine is administered using the multiple puncture technique with a bifurcated needle. It produces a usually harmless vaccinia virus infection in the vaccine recipien t that also leads to greater than 95% protection against the deadly smallpox virus. YOU ARE BEING OFFERED IMMUNIZATION WITH V ACCINIA VIRUS BECAUS E THERE IS EITHER CONFIRMATION OR STRO NG EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED T O SMALLPOX ! PAGE 1 WHO SHOULD RECEIVE VACCINIA VIR US? The United States Public Health Service recommends vaccinia vaccine for the following persons: 1. Laboratory workers who directly handle animals, or microbial cultures contaminated or infected with vaccinia virus, or other smallpox -related viruses; 2. Individuals exposed to aerosols containing variola virus (smallpox) virus, or exposed to cases of smallpox as the result of a bioterrorism incident. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF VACCINIA VACCINA TION ? The vaccine will be highly successful in preventing smallpox infection in people exposed to the smallpox virus, and in stopping a community wide smallpox outbreak. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF VACCINATION ? Successful vaccination, particularly in persons receiving their first dose of vaccine, is associa ted with tenderness, redness, swelling, and a lesion at the vaccination site, and may cause fever for a few days. The lymph nodes in the armpit of the vaccinated arm may become enlarged and tender. These symptoms are more common in persons receiving their first dose of vaccine than in persons being revaccinated. The overall risks of serious complications of smallpox vaccination are low, and occur more frequently in persons receiving their first dose of vaccine, and among young children. The most frequent s erious complications of vaccination are encephalitis (brain inflammation), vaccinia necrosum (progressive destruction of skin and other tissues at the vaccination site), and eczema vaccinatum (severe and destructive infection of skin affected by eczema or other chronic skin disorder caused by spread of vaccinia virus). Among persons receiving their first dose of vaccine, the following serious complications have been observed: 1. encephalitis - about one in 300,000 doses. 2. vaccinia necrosum - this complication has been limited to recipients who have abnormalities of their immune system, for whom the vaccine is contraindicated. 3. eczema vaccinatum - this complication has been limited to recipients who have eczema or other chronic skin conditions, for whom the vacc ine is contraindicated. Among persons being revaccinated, the following serious complications have been observed: 1. encephalitis - about one in 200,000 doses. 2. vaccinia necrosum - this complication has been limited to recipients who have abnormalities of the ir immune system, for whom the vaccine is contraindicated. PAGE 2 3. eczema vaccinatum - this complication has been limited to recipients who have eczema or other chronic skin conditions, for whom the vaccine is contraindicated. Other less serious complicatio ns include: 1. Generalized vaccinia -vaccination lesions developing away from the vaccination site. This occurs in one in 5,000 primary vaccinations and one in 110,000 revaccinations. 2. Accidental transfer of vaccinia from the vaccination site to other parts of the body. This occurs in one in 1,700 primary vaccinations and one in 40,000 revaccinations. Generalized vaccinia in persons without underlying illness (such as immune deficiency) is generally self limited and requires little or no therapy. Accidenta l transfer of vaccinia from the vaccination to other parts of the body can be prevented by handwashing after touching the vaccination site. On rare occasions, almost always after primary vaccination, vaccinia virus has been reported to cause fetal infecti on after vaccination of a pregnant woman. Fewer than 50 instances of fetal vaccinia are known, but cases have been observed as recently as 1978. Fetal vaccinia usually results in stillbirth or death of the infant shortly after delivery. Vaccinia vaccine is not known to cause congenital malformations. Because the vaccinia virus is present at the vaccination site, other persons can become infected if they come in direct contact with the vaccinee's lesions. Vaccinees can also transfer virus from the vaccinati on site to another person by touching the lesion and then touching the other person. The exact risk of infection by such routes of transmission is unknown; however, virus can be cultured from the vaccination site until the skin heals. Most instances of con tact transmission of vaccinia do not lead to serious illness in the contact. However, about 30% of contact transmission results in eczema vaccinatum. WHO SHOULD NOT BE VAC CINATED ? 1. Persons who have ever been diagnosed as having eczema , even if the conditi on is mild or is not presently active. 2. Persons whose household contacts have eczema , or a history of eczema . 3. Persons with diseases or conditions which cause immunodeficiency , such as HIV infection , leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, agammaglobulin emia, or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticosteroids. 4. Persons whose household contacts have an immunodeficiency disease or therapy listed above. PAGE 3 5. Persons with other acute or chronic skin conditions, s uch as atopic dermatitis , burns, impetigo, or varicella zoster (shingles) should not be vaccinated until the condition resolves. 6. Women who are pregnant , or who are planning to become pregnant within a month following vaccination. 7. Persons with serious, life -threatening allergies to the antibiotics , or neomycin FOR AND DO AFTER THE VACCINA TION ? 1. Three to five days following primary vaccination, a small bump develops at the site of vaccination. The bump bec omes a blister, which then becomes pus -filled, and reaches its maximum size by 8 -10 days. The pus -filled blister dries and forms a scab, which separates by 14 -21 days after vaccination, leaving a distinct scar. Vaccinia virus is shed from the site from 4 d ays following vaccination until the scab separates from the skin. Persons being revaccinated may not develop a blister, and the progression of the lesion at the site of vaccination may be shorter. 2. The objectives in caring for a smallpox vaccination site ar e to avoid spread of virus from the vaccination site to another area of the body (such as the eyes), to avoid spread to another person, and to keep the area clean and dry. 3. Keep the site covered with a bandage, at all times until the scab has fallen off and the underlying skin is healed. An occlusive (air -tight) bandage should not be used. 4. Keep the site dry. When showering, cover the site with plastic and rubber bands or tape the plastic down with adhesive tape to prevent wetting. Do not direct shower water to the vaccinated area. After drying off, replace the plastic cover with a simple bandage. 5. After changing the bandage, or any time the vaccination site is touched, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. This is the most important measure to prev ent transmission of vaccinia to another person, or to another part of the body. 6. Avoid contact with anyone at risk of complications of smallpox vaccination listed above until the scab has fallen off. WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT VACCINIA VACC INE? If you have questions about vaccinia vaccination, you should ask your doctor, or the person responsible for vaccination at your health care facility. In December 1991, the United States Public Health Service published its recommendations for the use of vaccinia vaccine in the Recommendations and Reports series of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . A copy of these recommendations may be obtained by writing to Information Services, National Center for Prevention Services, Mailstop E -06, Centers for Dis ease Control, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, or by calling (404) 639 -1819.

Less than 1% of patients will experience dizziness, confusion, seizur es, anemia, increased liver enzymes, tremor, arthralgia, ruptured tendons, or acute renal failure. G. Drug Interactions 1. Enteral feedings may decrease ciprofloxacin plasma concentrations. Ciprofloxacin should not be administered with enteral feedings. The feedings need to be discontinued for two hours prior to, and after, ciprofloxacin administration. 2. Aluminum/magnesium products, didanosine, and sucralfate may decrease absorption of ciprofloxacin if administered concurrently. Administer ciprofloxacin two hours before, or 4 hours after, the dose of these agents. Withhold antacids for two hours after giving ciprofloxacin. 3. Calcium, iron, zinc, and multivitamins with minerals may decrease absorption of ciprofloxacin significantly if administered concurre ntly. Administer ciprofloxacin two hours before, or at least two hours after the dose of these agents. 4. Caffeine and theophylline can increase central nervous system stimulation when administered concurrently with ciprofloxacin. 5. Cyclosporine may increa se serum creatinine levels when administered concurrently with ciprofloxacin. Cyclosporine serum levels need to be monitored when the patient is taking ciprofloxacin.
