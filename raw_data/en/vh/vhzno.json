Veterinary endocrinologists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville (UTK) have been investigating this phenomenon. They found that many dogs have elevated steroid intermediates (also called steroid precursors or \"sex steroids\") with normal cortisol. They disease,\" or \"adrenal hyperplasia-like syndrome.\" It has been suggested that cases of atypical Cushing's disease may be caused by a problem in the steroid production pathway. Elevated steroid intermediates have been linked to sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS), which causes sudden blindness in dogs. These steroid intermediate hormones include 17-hydroxyprogesterone (also called 17-OH progesterone or 17-OHP), progesterone, androstenedione, estradiol, and aldosterone. UTK developed a steroid hormone profile test to measure these hormones both before and after ACTH stimulation. Steroid hormone profiling is indicated when other tests of adrenal function are negative (ACTH stimulation and LDDS), but the dog still exhibits signs of Cushing's. One or more of these steroid intermediate hormones are increased in affected patients, both before and after ACTH stimulation. Estradiol does not respond to either ACTH or dexamethasone, while 17-OHP shows an exaggerated response to ACTH administration in cases of both atypical and typical Cushing's. Atypical Cushing's can adrenal. Dogs pituitary-dependent atypical Cushing's usually have an enlarged liver, hepatopathy (liver abnormalities), and enlargement of both adrenal glands, along with increased levels of endogenous ACTH. Dogs with the adrenal form will also have an enlarged liver and elevated liver enzymes, but in this case only one adrenal gland will be enlarged (the other may be atrophied), and endogenous ACTH levels will be decreased. Both forms cause the usual clinical signs of Cushing's disease, including bloodwork changes and haircoat problems. If aldosterone is elevated, it can cause hypertension (high blood pressure), high sodium, and low potassium leading to muscle weakness. In some cases, adrenal tumors can secrete other steroids besides cortisol, and cortisol levels may be normal. Ultrasound is recommended to confirm whether a tumor is present before beginning treatment. If a tumor is found, surgical removal is recommended, especially since noncortisol-secreting adrenal tumors are almost always carcinomas. If that is not possible, mitotane (Lysodren) is the next choice, although it will not affect estradiol levels, and these types of noncortisol-secreting adrenal tumors tend to respond poorly to medical treatment. Trilostane is not recommended, as it can cause increases in intermediate steroid hormones. Elevated estradiol, called hyperestrinism or hyperestrogenism, causes many of the same signs as elevated cortisol does. In dogs with hyperestrinism, ACTH stimulation and LDDS tests are usually normal for cortisol, thyroid function is normal or controlled, and liver problems are frequent and typical (very high alkaline phosphatase, enlarged liver, and other liver abnormalities). Symptoms frequently include excessive drinking and urination, along with haircoat problems. Panting may also be present. A skin biopsy will suggest endocrine abnormalities. Veterinarians at UTK advise treating atypical Cushing's and hyperestrinism with melatonin, which decreases cortisol and sometimes estradiol levels as well, and lignans, a type of phytoestrogen, which may also inhibit enzymes involved in the production of estradiol. Lysodren (mitotane) can be combined with melatonin and lignans to help lower sex steroid levels other than estradiol, along with suppressive effect on cortisol level. A very small percentage of Cushing's cases result from medical treatments for other conditions, such as the use of prednisone or other corticosteroid medications to control allergies, arthritis, or autoimmune conditions. This is called \"iatrogenic\" (doctor-caused) Cushing's. In these cases, the Cushing's is treated by gradual discontinuation of the corticosteroid drugs (if the drugs are withdrawn too quickly, an Addisonian crisis can result). Patients can take as long as three months to recover after corticosteroid drugs are stopped. Also known as Alopecia X, pseudo-Cushing's is identified by symmetrical alopecia (hair loss) on the trunk of the body, thighs, or neck, along with darkening of the skin where hair is lost. The coat's color may change as well. The condition does not cause itching. Pseudo-Cushing's is seen in young dogs (ages 1 to 5) with plush coats, such as Pomeranians, Poodles, Samoyeds, Alaskan Malamutes, and Siberian Huskies. Pseudo-Cushing's is thought to be a mild form of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Dogs with this disorder may respond to castration, methyltestosterone, melatonin, growth hormone supplementation, or one of the drugs used to treat Cushing's disease. One study showed that 90 percent of dogs with pseudo-Cushing's treated with trilostane responded within eight weeks. 1. Don't dismiss changes in your dog as normal aging. Your veterinarian may nd an underlying, treatable cause. 2. Treatment for Cushing's can improve quality of life for your dog. Don't be afraid to try drugs when needed. 3. Watch closely for signs such as lack of appetite that may indicate drugs need to be stopped or dosage adjusted. 4. lf your dog has all the signs of Cushing's but tests are negative, consider atypical Cushing's or adrenal exhaustion as a possible cause. Sometimes life-threatening illnesses develop so slowly that no one pays much attention. An older dog who's always thirsty drinks huge quantities of water. He's hungrier than usual and has developed a thin coat and pot belly. He pants all the time, and now his hind legs are losing muscle tone and getting weak. Many owners dismiss these as normal signs of aging, but they are classic symptoms of Cushing's disease, which affects an estimated 100,000 dogs in the U.S. every year. Also known as hyperadrenocorticism, Cushing's is the opposite of Addison's disease. Both illnesses involve the adrenal glands, which produce cortisol - a stress hormone that helps prepare a dog for fight or flight by breaking down muscle and fat to convert into glucose. While Addison's disease results from insufficient cortisol, Cushing's disease results from too much - and prolonged exposure to cortisol can have negative effects on the entire body. Cushing's puts dogs at increased risk for diabetes, pancreatitis, calcium oxalate bladder stones, pulmonary thromboembolism, hypertension (high blood pressure), urinary tract infections, protein-losing kidney disease, hair loss, skin problems, and congestive heart failure. Cushing's disease affects primarily middle-aged and older dogs. The majority (about 85 percent) of Cushing's disease cases are caused by tumors of the pituitary gland; these are usually benign (adenomas). About 15 percent of Cushing's cases are caused by tumors of the adrenal gland; about half of these adrenal tumors are benign and about half are malignant (carcinomas). In pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH), (ACTH), which signals the adrenal glands to release cortisol. The average age at diagnosis with PDH is 10 years, and the most commonly affected breeds are Poodles, Dachshunds, Beagles, German Shepherds, Boxers, Boston Terriers, Labrador Retrievers, and terriers, with 75 percent of patients weighing less than 44 pounds. With adrenal-dependent Cushing's, the adrenal tumor itself secretes excessive cortisol. The average age for diagnosis with adrenal tumors is 11 years, with Poodles, German Shepherds, Dachshunds, Labrador Retrievers, and terriers predominating. About half of all cases occur in dogs weighing more than 44 pounds, and females may be more commonly affected. Kris Hackleman Pituitary Cushing's Disease in Dogs Girl, a Miniature Schnauzer, has lived with Cindy Bright of Indiana, Pennsylvania, since her first owner passed away in 2006. Girl is famous for eating anything (including dehydrated or living toads); at 27 pounds, she was seriously overweight. By February 2008, Girl's symptoms included excessive thirst and urination, overeating, urinary incontinence, and occasional hyperexcitement or aggression. She was diagnosed with PDH and was given Vetoryl (trilostane), a drug that was not approved in the U.S. until 2009 for the treatment of both pituitary- and adrenal-dependent Cushing's, but which has been used in the U.K. since 2001. Bright imported the drug from the U.K. (something that could be accomplished with a prescription and by filling out a form to obtain permission from the FDA). Today Girl is doing well, and her weight is a normal 19 pounds. Her occasional health setbacks tend to follow dietary indiscretions, such as her consumption of a 6-pack of English muffins that someone set outside the basement freezer and her indulgence in wild rabbit droppings, which Bright describes as Girl's \"caviar.\" Girl suffered a serious bout of pancreatitis in 2010. \"Life is like walking the tightrope,\" Bright says. \"One slip and it's difficult to get everything back on course.\" Like Girl, all dogs with Cushing's disease require careful monitoring. Depending on the drug used to control symptoms, even minor changes in condition or behavior can signal major problems, and conscientious caregivers keep a close eye on anything that seems unusual or different. In Springfield, Vermont, Kathy Mason's Beagle, Chance, was diagnosed with PDH at 8 years old. He was treated with Anipryl, which was not effective, and then switched to Lysodren (mitotane). \"After about two years of good bloodwork,\" says Mason, \"Chance went into an Addisonian crisis. We thought we were going to lose him, but he survived and stayed Addisonian for the rest of his life. It was so much easier to treat. He passed away in January, five years post diagnosis, at the age of 14 years old.\" While most pituitary tumors are microscopic, 10 to 20 percent are larger than 10 millimeters (3/8 inch) in diameter. Called macrotumors or macroadenomas, almost all of these pituitary tumors are benign, but about half are large enough to compress the brain and cause neurological symptoms such as listlessness, poor appetite, confusion, walking in circles, or seizures. Most dogs are diagnosed with Cushing's at least six months before neurological symptoms develop. Breeds with short noses, such as Boxers and Pugs, tend to have the largest pituitary tumors. Most dogs with pituitary tumors are treated with medication because their tumors are considered inoperable. However, a rather new surgical technique allows some tumors to be removed. Another option for large pituitary tumors is radiation therapy, which is expensive ($3,000 to $5,000 in the Los Angeles area) and can have adverse side effects such as skin and hair loss, hearing loss, or problems with tear production in the eyes. Although successful in 70 percent of cases, further treatment for Cushing's is usually required, and tumors treated with radiation are likely to recur. Survival time is not increased if neurological problems are severe. Adrenal Cushing's Disease hree years ago Maggie, a 12-year-old black Labrador Retriever/hound-mix in Atlanta, Georgia, developed a voracious appetite, drank incredibly large amounts of water, and began raiding the trash. Her owner, Kristin Boggs, took Maggie to their veterinarian, who suspected Cushing's. \"Usually Cushing's is pituitary-based,\" she says, \"but instead of assuming this, my vet ordered an ultrasound test. He had once before seen a case of Cushing's that was caused by an adrenal tumor. Sure enough, Maggie had a large tumor on her adrenal gland.\" The solution was to remove the entire gland. Maggie's surgery took place at a special internal medicine veterinary clinic, where a post-surgical nurse attended her through the night. \"Maggie came through with flying colors, despite an incision almost the full length of her belly,\" says Boggs. \"She's a tough old girl. Thankfully the tumor was benign. After a few weeks of medication to balance her cortisol levels, she was back to normal.\" In Toledo, Ohio, Linda Boyle's Springer Spaniel, Cody, was diagnosed with Cushing's disease at age 11 after developing a ravenous appetite and gaining weight. Cody's ultrasound exam revealed tumors on both adrenal glands. \"A bilateral adrenalectomy is very risky,\" says Boyle, \"but it worked well for Cody. He became an Addison's dog because his body no longer produced any cortisol at all, but he lived another two years with good quality of life before passing away from what we believe was pneumonia.\" Because Cushing's patients tend to have high blood pressure and poor healing ability, several months of medical therapy may be needed to strengthen the patient prior to surgery. After surgery, prednisone or other corticosteroids may be required for a few months until the dog's ability to produce cortisol recovers, and some dogs may need mineralocorticoid replacement as well. In a survey of 63 dogs who had surgery, 4 (6 percent) had inoperable tumors and were euthanized; 18 (29 percent) died during surgery or soon after because of complications; and the average post-surgical life span for the remaining 41 dogs was 46 months. As this article goes to press, Maggie's Cushing's symptoms have returned, caused by a new tumor on her remaining adrenal gland. \"I can't believe this has happened to us again,\" says Boggs. \"It's an exact repeat of what we went through three years ago. We don't know if the tumor is malignant or benign, as we don't feel extensive surgery at her age (15 \u00bd) is reasonable. My vet and I have decided to treat her with trilostane and see how she does. My priority now is that she is happy and comfortable.\" Diagnosing Cushing's Disease in Dogs Cushing's disease isn't always easy to diagnose. Routine test results that can point toward Cushing's include: High or very high alkaline phosphatase (ALP, ALKP, SAP). Although this is a \"liver enzyme,\" marked elevation is associated with cortisol. It does not indicate liver disease if other liver enzymes such as ALT (alanine aminotransferase) are normal. Increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes (stress leukogram). Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides due to abnormal fat mobilization. Fasting hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance. Liver enzymes may be mildly elevated. Dilute urine (low specific gravity) due to excessive drinking. Protein in urine (microalbuminuria or proteinuria). X-rays may show an enlarged liver and occasionally calcium deposits in the skin (calcinosis cutis, which feel like rocks and cause itching). Dogs with Cushing's are prone to bladder, skin, and other infections due to the immunosuppressive effects of cortisol. About 20 percent of dogs with Cushing's have an inapparent bladder infection, requiring a culture (not just urinalysis) to detect. Confirming a Cushing's diagnosis can be challenging, especially as false positives are common in dogs with nonadrenal illness. The following tests are commonly used: Urine Cortisol:Creatinine Ratio (UCCR) is a screening test only. A negative result rules out Cushing's, but anything that increases stress can cause a positive result, necessitating further testing. Use urine samples caught at home for this test so that the stress of a vet visit doesn't influence the results. Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression (LDDS), considered the most accurate for diagnosing Cushing's, takes eight hours in the hospital. A baseline blood cortisol level is measured, then a tiny dose of dexamethasone (corticosteroid) is injected. In a normal dog, blood cortisol levels drop after eight hours. Blood samples are sometimes checked after four hours, as this can help classify the form of Cushing's. About 95 percent of dogs with Cushing's test positive, but false positives are also common, and the more severe a nonadrenal illness, the more likely a false positive result. This test is preferred if an adrenal tumor is suspected. ACTH Stimulation: No longer recommended for diagnosis, as its sensitivity is poor, its cost is high, and it cannot differentiate between pituitary and adrenal forms. This test is more specific than LDDS, however, meaning that strongly positive results definitely indicate Cushing's disease, and false positives are unusual, but false negatives are common. This test is useful for monitoring treatment, and it is the only test that can be used for dogs currently being treated with corticosteroids. A low-normal or blunted response indicates iatrogenic Cushing's (see sidebar, facing page). This may be the preferred test if symptoms are mild, for it is better to miss the diagnosis than get a false positive. Test results must be considered in combination with symptoms. A dog with at least three of the typical signs plus a positive test is considered to have Cushing's, but a dog with no signs but maybe high ALP and a positive test may not, in which case it's best to take a wait-and-see approach. If signs are present but test results are negative, consider retesting in three to six months or test for atypical Cushing's. Different Types of Cushing's Disease Classifying the type of Cushing's disease as pituitary or adrenal helps determine which treatment is best. The endogenous ACTH level is felt by many to be the most accurate method of identifying the type of Cushing's, but this test is difficult to run, as serum must remain frozen during transport to the lab. Dogs with pituitary tumors have high ACTH levels, while those with adrenal tumors will have low or no measurable ACTH. LDDS may be used for classification when a 4-hour sample is drawn. If the 8-hour sample is > 30 nmol/L and the 4-hour sample is < 30, or both are less than half of the baseline sample, the pituitary form is likely. The high dose dexamethasone suppression (HDDS) test is similar to LDDS, but a high dose of dexamethasone is used. This test is done only on dogs already known to have Cushing's. Dogs with a pituitary tumor will show suppression in circulating cortisol levels 75 percent of the time, but those with adrenal tumors never show suppression. Adrenal tumors can be seen on ultrasound 30 to 50 percent of the time. An adrenal tumor is suspected whenever one adrenal gland is observed to be enlarged while the other is not visible. If they have not spread, adrenal tumors should be removed, if possible, but surgery is difficult and usually requires a specialist. Two normal or large adrenal glands indicate the pituitary form of Cushing's, although enlarged adrenal glands are also often seen in cases of nonadrenal disease due to the chronic stress of the illness. An MRI or CT scan can detect pituitary tumors and determine their size. Two-thirds of dogs with tumors greater than 10 millimeters initially will develop neurological signs and may benefit from immediate radiation therapy, even before signs are seen. Medical Treatment for Cushing's Disease in Dogs The best treatment for Cushing's disease depends on the severity of symptoms, type of Cushing's, risk of adverse effects, and cost factors. Medical therapy is used to control clinical signs, but it does not cure the disease. It is not likely to prolong life but does improve the dog's quality of life. Not treating is also a viable option, particularly if symptoms are minimal. In this case, complementary care may be especially useful. If the dog suffers from a concurrent medical condition, it is important to treat and stabilize that illness if possible before treating for Cushing's. Treatment for dogs with concurrent nonadrenal illness, such as diabetes, is complex and beyond the scope of this article. Mitotane Mitotane (Lysodren\u00ae), which is used for both pituitary and adrenal Cushing's, was the only treatment available until recent years. Mitotane is convenient and relatively inexpensive, but it has potentially severe side effects. A chemotherapy drug, it works by selectively eroding the two inner layers of the adrenal cortex that produce cortisol while tending to preserve the outer layer that makes aldosterone. If too much is eroded, the result is a cortisol deficiency. About 30 percent of dogs treated with mitotane develop short-term reactions. If this happens, mitotane is discontinued and the dog is treated with prednisone until the adrenal glands recover. The destruction may be permanent, requiring treatment for atypical (or sometimes typical) Addison's. Mitotane's risk of a permanent or life-threatening Addisonian reaction is considered 2 to 5 percent. Mitotane is given once or twice a day during the \"induction\" phase, during which adrenal erosion is induced. The drug must be given with food or it will not be absorbed. Mitotane should not be used for dogs with a poor appetite; inappetence indicates that something else is going on that must be diagnosed and addressed prior to beginning Cushing's therapy. During the induction phase, caregivers should notify their veterinarians as soon as their dog experiences any appetite reduction, decrease in water consumption, diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy, or listlessness. It is important to watch for these signs starting around the third day of treatment. These symptoms indicate that the end of the induction has been reached and it's time for an ACTH stimulation test. The induction time is variable, usually between 7 and 14 days, but some patients require just two to three days and others can take as long as six weeks, especially if they are being given other drugs that interact with Lydsodren, such as phenobarbital or insulin. If there is no response, dosage can be increased or mitotane can be reformulated in an oil base to increase absorption, or the drug trilostane can be used instead. When the ACTH test and clinical signs indicate that sufficient adrenal erosion has taken place, daily use (induction phase) is stopped and lifelong \"maintenance\" treatment once or twice a week is begun. The ACTH test can be repeated after about a month, then one to four times a year thereafter. If vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, or listlessness occur at any time during treatment, the dog may need a prednisone \"antidote\" pill, which should produce improvement within 30 minutes to two hours. Your veterinarian will probably prescribe prednisone and discontinue mitotane for a couple of weeks after that, before resuming at a lower dose. If there is no improvement, something else is causing the symptoms. About half of the dogs treated with mitotane relapse at some point and require a second round of induction, and their maintenance dose may have to be increased. Marked improvement should be seen within six to eight weeks of starting the maintenance dose, with a full reversal of clinical signs after four to six months of treatment. Usually the first improvements are more normal water consumption, urination, and appetite, and the last is hair regrowth. Muscle strength and exercise tolerance improve over the first three to four weeks. Mitotane can be used to treat adrenal Cushing's, but a higher dosage is needed, resulting in more adverse reactions. The average survival time in this case is 16 months. Trilostane Trilostane (Vetoryl\u00ae), used to treat both disease, inhibits the enzyme 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which is involved in the production of several steroids, including cortisol. Because trilostane can block aldosterone as well as cortisol, it can cause side effects such as dehydration, weakness, and electrolyte changes (low sodium and high potassium). In this case, the medication must be stopped temporarily; some dogs may also require fluid support. For reasons that are not understood, trilostane occasionally causes acute adrenal gland necrosis, which can occur within days of starting the drug or after several months. The condition is unpredictable and is not dose-dependent. It requires prompt treatment with fluid therapy, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids or it can be fatal (Addisonian crisis). This complication is permanent and irreversible, and lifelong supplementation of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids will be necessary (i.e., treatment for typical Addison's). Trilostane is given once or twice a day with food. Side effects may be less common when given twice a day. Starting dosage is 1 to 3 mg per pound of body weight daily. Starting at the low end of that range is safest, even though the suggested starting dosage in the product brochure is higher. Close monitoring in the beginning and after any dose adjustment is essential. Discontinue trilostane and contact your veterinarian immediately if signs of intolerance are seen. Common side effects include mild lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and appetite reduction, especially in the beginning. Most reactions are minor and are reversed by decreasing the dose or discontinuing therapy, but serious or fatal Addisonian reactions are also possible. Side effects should be followed by electrolyte and ACTH testing. Once symptoms resolve, the drug can be restarted at a 50 percent dose reduction. Most dogs show decreases in drinking, urination, and appetite within one week, but some may take two months or longer. Trilostane controls clinical signs in dogs with adrenal tumors, but will not slow tumor growth. Trilostane may be safer than mitotane, as side effects tend to be less severe and most are reversible. The risk of a permanent or life-threatening Addisonian reaction from trilostane is considered to be 2 to 3 percent. Cost is trilostane's main disadvantage, though monitoring costs may be less than with mitotane. Baseline cortisol levels measured 4 to 6 hours after trilostane administration may provide adequate monitoring without the need for ACTH stimulation tests. Trilostane seems to predispose dogs to increased adrenal toxicity from mitotane, so it's best to wait at least a month in between if switching to mitotane. When changing from another drug to trilostane, wait a couple of weeks or until clinical signs recur. This drug is not recommended for dogs with liver or kidney disease. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole (Nizoral\u00ae) is used to treat Cushing's. This antifungal medication suppresses adrenal hormones in about 80 percent of dogs as a side effect. A low dose is used for a week; then, if no side effects are seen, a higher maintenance dose is used. It is not possible to induce Addison's disease with ketoconazole, so monitoring tests aren't needed, other than after a month or so to determine if the medication is working. Side effects can include vomiting and diarrhea, but no \"antidote pill\" is needed. Just discontinue until side effects go away, then restart at a lower dose. Ketoconazole's disadvantages are that it must be given twice a day indefinitely and its effect may be mild or temporary. This drug may reduce clinical signs in up to 30 percent of dogs with adrenal tumors, but side effects are common. L-Deprenyl L-Deprenyl (Anipryl\u00ae or selegiline) is used to treat pituitary Cushing's only. It is also used to treat canine cognitive dysfunction. L-Deprenyl works by inhibiting ACTH secretion via high dopamine levels in the intermediate pituitary area, where 30 percent of pituitary tumors are located, and may work only for dogs with such tumors. This drug has no serious side effects, but approximately 5 percent of patients experience minor nausea, restlessness, or reduced hearing. It cannot induce Addison's disease, and no monitoring is required. Because it's difficult to determine whether the drug is working, and it may take considerable time to take effect, few veterinarians report good results. However, because some dogs improve and its safety margin is high, it may be worth trying in dogs with mild symptoms that are progressing slowly. L-Deprenyl can be combined with mitotane or trilostane for dogs with cognitive dysfunction, and it may increase the dog's activity level and quality of life. Anipryl is not recommended for dogs who also have diabetes, pancreatitis, heart failure, renal disease, or any other serious illness. Freelance writer CJ Puotinen lives in Montana.

Overcrating, traumatic, or stimulating experiences while crated, improper introduction to the crate, and isolation or separation anxieties are the primary causes of crating disasters. If, for whatever reason, your dog is not a fan of the artificial den you've provided for him, and assuming he can't be trusted home alone uncrated, here are some things you can do regarding his dog crate anxiety: 1. Find confinement alternatives Every time your crate-hating dog has a bad experience in a crate, it increases his stress and anxiety and makes it harder to modify his crate aversion. Your dog may tolerate an exercise pen, a chain-link kennel set up in your garage, or even a room of his own. A recent Peaceable Paws client whose dog was injuring herself in the crate due to isolation anxiety found her dog did just fine when confined to the bedroom when she had to be left alone. 2. Utilize doggy daycare Many dogs who have dog crate high anxiety are delighted to spend the day at the home of a friend, neighbor, or relative who is home when you are not, or at a good doggie daycare facility - assuming your dog does well in the company of other dogs. This is not a good option for dogs with true separation anxiety, as they will be no happier with someone else when they are separated from you than they are in a crate. 3. Teach him to love his crate. Utilize a combination of counter-conditioning (changing his association with the crate from negative to positive) and operant conditioning/shaping (positively reinforcing him for gradually moving closer to, and eventually into, the crate) to convince him to go into his crate voluntarily. Then, very gradually, work your way up to closing the door with your dog inside, and eventually moving longer and longer distances away from your crated dog for longer and longer periods of time. (See \"Dog Crating Difficulties,\" WDJ May 2005). Note: If your dog has a separation/anxiety issue, you must address and modify that behavior before crate-training will work. 4. Identify and remove aversives. Figure out why your dog has dog crate high anxiety. If he was crate-trained at one time and then decided he didn't like it, what changed? Perhaps you were overcrating, and he was forced to soil his den, and that was very stressful for him. Maybe there are environmental aversives; is it too warm or too cold in his crate? Is there a draft blowing on him? Is it set near something that might expose him to an aversive sound, like the washing machine, buzzer on a clothes dryer, or an alarm of some kind? Perhaps his crate is near the door, and he becomes overstimulated when someone knocks, or rings the doorbell, or when mail and packages are delivered. Is someone threatening him when he's crated - another dog, perhaps? Or a child who bangs on the top, front, or sides of the crate? Maybe he's been angrily punished by someone who throws him into the crate and yells at him - or worse. All the remedial crate training in the world won't help if the aversive thing is still happening. You have to make the bad stuff stop. If he's a victim of generalized anxiety or separation anxiety and the crate aversion is part of a larger syndrome, or his stress about crating is extreme, you may want to explore the use of behavior modification drugs with your behavior knowledgeable veterinarian, or a veterinary behaviorist, to help reduce stress enough that he can learn to love his crate. Note - if your vet is not behavior knowledgeable, tell her that many veterinary behaviorists will do free phone consults with other veterinarians. 5. Take him with you. Of course you can't take him with you all the time, but whenever you can, it decreases the number of times you have to use another alternative. Some workplaces allow employees to bring their dogs to work with them; you don't know until you ask. Of course you will never take him somewhere that he'd be left in a car, unattended, for an extended period of time, or at all, if the weather is even close to being dangerous. A surprising number of businesses allow well-behaved dogs to accompany their owners; if it doesn't say \"No Dogs\" on the door, give it a try! Your dog will thank you. 1. Don't punish! It may (or may not) suppress barking in the moment, but is unlikely to modify the behavior in the long run. In fact, it may actually make the barking worse or cause new behavior problems. 2. Teach your vocal dogs a positive interrupt so you can minimize their barking behavior. 3. Learn how to apply operant and counter-conditioning protocols to modify your dogs' barking when you can't or don't wish to manage the behavior. 4. Have reasonable expectations: accept barking is normal and appropriate for dogs. Identify times when you can allow your dogs to vocalize. It's feeding time at the Miller household. All is calm until I pick up Scooter's bowl to carry it to the laundry room where the little Pomeranian can eat without harassment from the larger dogs. As I lift the bowl from the counter, Scooter erupts with high-pitched barking and spinning, and Lucy the Corgi joins in with her deeper-but-still-sufficiently irritating vocals. It's more of an annoying bit of ritual than a dangerous or disturbing one, but it's annoying just the same, and one that would be nice to extinguish. But how does one modify behavior if the protocol requires the offering and removal of reinforcement based on the subject's behavior, when there are two subjects, and reinforcement for one automatically reinforces the other? Stated in plain English, how do I get two (or more) dogs to stop barking when rewarding the quiet one also rewards the barking one? When One Dog Starts Barking, the Rest Follow If I set the bowl back down on the counter when both dogs bark, I'm using negative punishment; the dogs' behavior of barking makes the good thing - delivery of their meal - go away. When the dogs stop barking I use positive reinforcement; the dog's quiet behavior results in a good thing: I pick up the bowl and proceed with delivery of dinner. Now, here's the dilemma: When I pick up the bowl, Lucy stays quiet, so I should positively reinforce that by continuing with dinner delivery. But Scooter starts barking again; I need to abort delivery so I'm not reinforcing Scooter's barking. But if I set the bowl back down, I'm punishing Lucy for being quiet. Get it? The answer to the dilemma is this: I can modify the behavior of only one dog at a time. I need to select which dog I want to work with first, and figure out how to manage the other dog's behavior until I'm ready to work with her. In this scenario, I might change my dog-feeding routine by putting Lucy in my office before I begin food preparation so I can work with Scooter's barking behavior. After he gets his dinner, I can let Lucy out to join the rest of the group, and feed all of them. When Scooter no longer barks at food delivery time, I can try reintroducing Lucy to the mix. If her barking re-triggers Scooter's barking, then I might need to put Scooter away while I work on modifying Lucy's barking. When each can handle dinner delivery without barking, then I can try them together. Counter-Conditioning Multiple Dogs at Once Many multi-dog training programs break down because owners, understandably, aren't always willing to work with the dogs separately. The prospect of implementing multiple behavior modification programs for multiple dogs can be quite daunting. We're lucky only two of our five dogs bark at dinnertime. If all five joined in, the cacophony of barking would be overwhelming, not to mention the prospect of working with each of five dogs to modify barking behavior. They might never get fed! Yet, individual modification work is almost always necessary for success with behaviors that involve multiple dogs. One dog's barking just sets the other(s) off if the other's barking hasn't been solidly modified. Perhaps the two most common examples of multi-dog barking are when an owner walks two or more dogs on leash at one time, or when multiple dogs in a home (or in the yard) are aroused by some stimulus, such as someone at the door, someone walking past on the sidewalk, a squirrel or cat running across the yard or up a tree, a car going by . . . I see the pained expression on my clients' faces when I suggest to them that they need to walk their dogs individually, or at least with separate handlers. In many households, one person is in the habit of taking both (or all) dogs for a walk at the same time. I can see them doing the math in their heads; a 30-minute walk per day with three dogs has suddenly compounded into three 30-minute walks, or 90 minutes per day. That equals 10.5 hours per week instead of 3.5 hours. Wow. Who has that much extra time to devote to dog walking? Still, it's important. When dogs-on-leash are barking at an outside stimulus, such as another dog or a passing car, my favorite approach to modification is counter-conditioning. The instant your dog sees another dog (or the approaching vehicle), feed bits of chicken (or other very high-value treat), preferably before your dog begins barking. Pause, let him look at the approaching dog (car), and quickly feed more chicken, again before he barks. Continue with your pause/look/treat procedure until the dog (or car) has passed. Then resume your walk until the next dog (car) comes along. Over time, your dog will learn that the appearance of another dog/car makes you feed him chicken, and instead of barking, he'll look to you for chicken. This works whether the stimulus causing him to bark is a dog, a car, a kid on a bicycle, or anything else. In time, as his \"stimulus/chicken\" association becomes very strong, you'll be able to gradually - and significantly - reduce the amount of chicken you have to feed. In time, you'll be able to leave the chicken home and just use his regular everyday treats to reinforce his looks at you when a target passes. As simple as this process is, it's virtually impossible to do it with two dogs at the same time. The timing of your treat delivery is critical; it must happen the instant after your dog sees the stimulus but before your dog starts to bark. You simply can't manage two potential barkers and get the timing right for both. Hence the mandate to walk one dog at a time - or at least one dog per handler - if you're serious about getting the barking under control. When you have solidly established the conditioned emotional response (CER) - the \"where's my chicken look\" - for each dog separately, you can begin to walk them together. Multi-Dog Training: Positive Interrupt You can modify multi-dog \"someone's at the door\" barking in a similar fashion - but it's harder because all the dogs are usually in the home. You could do a lot of one-at-a-time set-ups with the other dogs out of earshot. (See \"Knock, Knock,\" WDJ February 2010). Still, chances are when someone comes a-knockin', at least one of your multiple dogs may bark, which just might set everyone off. The same is true with outside/backyard stimuli. Despite your best efforts to counter-condition, the arousal behavior of multiple dogs is likely to cause mutual escalation or arousal, and barking will happen. For those times, a positive interrupt is a powerful tool. I use a voice cue (\"Over here!\") as a positive interrupt for an individual dog, but in the chaos of multi-dog barking, a louder signal is called for. If you are blessed, as I am, with the ability to give a shrill mouth-whistle, that can work. If not, there are wonderful whistles for sale that are so loud you'll need to cover your ears when you blow them, or risk damage to your hearing. My favorite is the Storm Whistle. You might want to buy several, so you can stash them in strategic locations around your house and yard. You'll want to \"charge\" your whistle in the same way you charge a clicker, to give your dog a very positive association between the sound of the whistle and something wonderful. I tend to fall back on chicken as my favorite \"something wonderful\" - dogs usually love it, and it's relatively low-fat, low-calorie, so you can use it generously without adding too many pounds to your dog, and with a low risk of tummy upsets. Charge the whistle one dog at a time. With one dog close to you and the others put away out of earshot, blow the whistle (not too loudly) and feed a treat. Blow the whistle, feed a treat. Repeat many times. When your dog makes the connection between whistle and chicken, you'll see his eyes light up at the sound, and he'll be looking for the treat. Next, go out in the yard where he can be farther away from you, and repeat your whistle/treat routine, until the sound of the whistle brings him running for a treat even when he's some distance away, sniffing the ground. Now put him away and try it with the next dog. When all dogs are \"charged,\" try it with two dogs at a time, gradually adding dogs to the group until your entire pack will interrupt what they're doing and come running to you at the sound of the whistle. (By the way, this doubles as a great recall tool as well!) Now you're ready to try it for real. If you're confident your dogs will respond, give it a try with the whole pack. If you think that's too much for your canine pals, start your real life trials one, or maybe two dogs at a time, just like you did with charging the whistle. Arrange a set-up that you know will trigger your dog(s) to bark. Have your whistle handy. When the barking starts, blow the whistle, and reward your dogs generously when they stop barking and come running to you. Then pat yourself on the back. Continue practicing with set-ups for as many different stimuli as you can think of. The more you practice, the better your dogs will respond when real-life stimuli trigger a bout of barking. If you're really good, your dogs may start running to you in anticipation of the whistle/treat game when they see or hear stimuli that used to cause barking. When that happens, you deserve to reinforce yourself with dinner and a movie. Pat Miller, CBCC-KA, CPDT-KA, CDBC, is WDJ's Training Editor.

Its moisture content is closer to that of meats, eggs, fruits, and vegetables - the sort of things that canines have eaten for the tens of thousands of years before commercial dog foods were invented. Wet foods usually contain more animal protein - the optimum base of a carnivore's diet - than even very high-quality dry foods. Even the varieties that are formulated with grain - not at all what dogs have eaten as they evolved - contain far less grain than dry foods. Pound for pound, wet dog food is also more expensive to feed (especially large dogs) than dry foods. That's because, with its high moisture content, the food is less \"energy dense\" than dry foods; you have to feed a larger volume of it to give your dog the calories and nutrients he needs. All that moisture is expensive to package and ship. But the benefits of wet food are many. It's therapeutic for dogs with kidney ailments, or any disorder that worsens if a dog gets dehydrated. Wet foods are generally far more palatable than dry foods, which can be a literal lifesaver when feeding very thin, sick, or picky dogs. Most dogs digest high-quality wet foods with fewer problems (gas, vomiting, and diarrhea) than dry foods. Wet foods also tend to be far less adulterated with synthetic ingredients than dry foods; artificial colors and flavors are rare in wet foods. And preservatives are not added to canned or pouched foods, since the oxygen-free packaging maintains their freshness. Even without preservatives, wet foods retain their nutrient value far longer than dry foods - two years or more. WDJ's Selection Criteria Because of all of these benefits, some holistic veterinarians are of the opinion that even a lower-quality wet food is healthier than good-quality dry foods. We won't go that far, because we like to see high-quality ingredients used in any food that's fed to our canine companions. Not because we like to imagine that's what we'd like to eat - the \"humanization\" marketing ploy - but because we know that diets comprised of a variety of locally sourced, fresh, unprocessed or lightly processed, unadulterated \"real food\" ingredients are healthiest for any living organism. How do we determine whether a wet food contains these high-quality ingredients? There are two places on a product label we pay attention to: the ingredients panel and the \"guaranteed analysis.\" These sections of the label are required by law and tend to be subject to closer review and regulation by state feed control officials than the rest of the package. We pay no attention to the pictures of the sort of ingredients that are purportedly in the food; they are almost never included in the form depicted on the label. When looking at the ingredients list, we look for the following (these things are good): WHOLE MEAT, FISH, OR POULTRY AS THE FIRST INGREDIENT. This means that by weight, there is more of this ingredient than anything else in the food. Wet foods are generally around 78 percent to 82 percent moisture. There are some good wet foods with water (or broth) first on our \"approved foods\" list (starting on page 6), but since fresh meat is so high in moisture, most top-notch foods feature an animal protein (fresh meat) first on the list, and water or broth (required for processing) in the second or third position. The point is to look for products that contain as much meat as possible. There has been a resurgence of popularity of complete and balanced wet foods that contain nothing but meat, water, and a vitamin/mineral supplement; many of these are labeled with a \"95% meat\" claim. Remember: while some dogs benefit from the inclusion of some carbohydrates in their diets, dogs have no dietary requirement for carbohydrates! They can thrive on diets that contain only protein and fat. IF GRAINS OR VEGETABLES ARE USED, WE LOOK FOR THE USE OF WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES. This means we prefer foods that contain \"rice\" rather than rice flour, rice bran, brewer's rice, etc. Also, if grains are used in a wet product, we don't want to see a lot of them! Even a product with an animal protein first on its ingredients list may contain more grain than meat if it has several grains or grain \"fragments\" on the label, too. THE WORDS \"COMPLETE AND BALANCED\" SHOULD APPEAR ON THE LABEL. Some manufacturers produce a few wet food products that are meant for \"supplemental or intermittent\" use only. These products do not meet the specifications for a \"complete and balanced diet\" as defined by the model regulations developed by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and adopted by each state. While these \"supplemental\" foods may be useful as part of a varied diet, they can't be relied on to provide all the nutrients your dog needs. There are also a number of things we look out for - attributes that would cause us to reject a wet food product (these things are bad): PROTEINS OR FATS THAT ARE NOT IDENTIFIED BY SPECIES. \"Animal fat\" and \"meat proteins\" are euphemisms for low-quality, ingredients of uncertain origin. MEAT BY-PRODUCTS OR POULTRY BY-PRODUCTS. There is a wide range in the quality and type of by-products that are available to pet food producers. And there is no way for the average dog owner (or anyone else) to find out, beyond a shadow of a doubt, whether the by-products used are kept clean, chilled, and used fresh within a day or two of slaughter (as some companies have told us), or are comprised of ingredients that were literally swept off a floor, dumped down the floor drains at the processing plant, and kept for hours or days on unrefrigerated loading docks and trucks. In recent years, we've learned that there is far more variation than we knew in the quality of even named, \"whole\" meats used in pet foods - the ingredients we've described for years as ideal. We were under the impression that whole, named meats were far too expensive to be handled in anything less than a similar fashion to meats meant for human consumption (the legal description is \"edible\"). We were wrong; we learned this when we had a chance to tour a raw ingredient (meat) plant. We'll discuss this more in our review of dry foods (in our February 2012 issue). But in the meantime, all we can say is that the whole, named meats tend to be of higher quality and are more likely be maintained in a clean, chilled state prior to processing. WHEAT GLUTEN. Wet foods often contain some sort of thickener or binder. Various types of \"gum\" (such as guar gum, from the seed of the guar plant, and carrageenan gum, from seaweed) are common thickeners. Whole grains, potatoes, and sweet potatoes also can be used to thicken wet food. But wheat gluten (and some other glutens) are generally only used in wet foods to hold together artificially formed \"chunks\" meant to resemble chunks of meat - you know, those perfect cubes of meaty mush found in low-cost dog foods? If chunks of meat are present in a wet dog food, they should be actual chunks of meat. SUGAR OR OTHER SWEETENERS. A food that contains quality meats shouldn't need additional palatants to entice dogs. ARTIFICIAL COLORS, FLAVORS, or ADDED PRESERVATIVES. Fortunately, these are rare in wet foods! Other Ingredients Some ominous-sounding chemicals in a dog food turn out to be a source of a needed vitamin or mineral. Generally, all the vitamins and minerals on a good label are grouped together at the end of the ingredients list. If an ingredient appears after the vitamins and minerals, it's just \"window dressing\" - present in the food in a completely insignificant amount. What about products that contain a long, long list of vegetables and herbs and nutraceuticals? They make a food sound so appealing! Just keep in mind that the more of all this stuff there is in a food, the less room there is for meat - the main reason to feed a wet food. Let's Talk About Pet Food Manufacturing Sites Since the infamous recalls of 2007, we have required any pet food company that wanted its products considered for our approval to disclose their manufacturing sites. Having this information can vastly reduce the panic and uncertainty a dog owner may experience upon hearing of a pet food recall stemming from a certain pet food manufacturing facility; you would know immediately whether your dog's food was involved or not. Not all pet food companies will disclose this information, however. Many fear that if any product made at that plant is recalled, their own foods will be \"brushed\" with the same tar reserved for the recalled products, even if their ingredients are procured and stored separately, and the production lines are well cleaned between their own manufacturing runs and those for other companies' products. These are valid concerns. There are pet owners who, since the 2007 recalls of melamine-contaminated foods, have refused to buy anything that came out of a Menu plant (that's the company that manufactured most - not all - of the recalled foods). (Note: those plants are now owned and operated by Simmons Pet Food, North America's largest wet pet food private-label and contract manufacturer. Some of 2007's recalled foods were manufactured at American Nutrition Inc.) We've heard all sorts of reports of alleged misconduct at Evanger's Dog & Cat Food Company. We're also aware of a serious recall of foods made by Merrick Pet Care (in 2004). You'll notice that these three manufacturers (with 7 facilities among them) are responsible for making most of the products on our approved foods list; they are also responsible for making almost all of the high-quality wet pet food in this country. The fact is, there are fewer than a dozen \"contract manufacturers\" (also known as co-packers) in this whole country that manufacture wet pet food for companies that don't own and operate their own plants. (All the corporate giants have their own plants.) No matter where a product is made, preventing the production of a product that will cause a recall requires the procurement and management of top-quality ingredients, good manufacturing practices, and scrupulous oversight and auditing of the manufacturing process. It's far more effective to ask a pet food company about what it does to accomplish those tasks than it is to blacklist every product made in any facility that ever had a recalled food. With the exception of the brand-new plant launched by Lotus Pet Foods this year, we're not sure there are any other plants with a perfectly clean record. Finally, speaking of Lotus, we recently toured its facility and observed the production of a batch of its food. An article describing exactly how wet pet food is made (and photos of the process) appears on the WDJ website. The Approved Canned Food List Below is our list of \"approved wet foods\" for 2011. All of these products have met our selection criteria and the company whose name is on the label has disclosed its manufacturer/s. There are probably more products that both meet our criteria (as described above) and whose makers would answer your questions about their manufacturers. Rest assured that any food that you find that meets our selection criteria is just as good as any of the foods on our list. We've listed the foods alphabetically by company name. Some companies make several lines of food. We've listed each line that meets our selection criteria. We've also highlighted one variety from each company as a representative product, to show what sort of ingredients and macro-nutrient levels (protein, fat, fiber, and moisture) are typically found in that maker's foods. Rather than try to list all the ingredients in each food we highlight, we've listed the first 10 ingredients - the major components of the food. Remember, quality comes with a price. These foods may be expensive and can be difficult to find, depending on your location. I saw a news item over the weekend announcing that my state's governor (California's Jerry Brown) signed \"Molly's Bill\" (AB 258), exempting certain dogs from the rabies vaccine requirement. Dogs whose lives would be endangered by the vaccination \"due to disease or other considerations that a veterinarian can verify and document\" \u2014 as determined by a licensed veterinarian on an annual basis - now have a legal means of avoiding vaccination against rabies. California is the 14th state to sign such a bill into law. This is great news for dogs who have suffered adverse reactions to rabies vaccines, and for debilitated senior dogs (who have perhaps the longest history or previous vaccinations, the least risk of coming into contact with rabid animals, AND the most risk of suffering side effects of the rabies vaccine). However, it's NOT a tool that should be used to justify the failure to vaccinate just ANY dog against rabies, for a number of reasons: 1. According to the bill, any dog who receives this exemption would be required to be \"confined to the premises of the owner, keeper, or harborer, and would require, if the dog is off the premises of the owner, keeper, or harborer, the dog to be on a leash not to exceed 6 feet in length and to be under the direct physical control of an adult.\" Also, \"A dog that is exempt from the provisions of this section shall not have contact with a dog or cat that is not currently vaccinated against rabies.\" That's pretty restrictive for many adult dogs - although not necessarily a burden for others. 2. Dogs should be vaccinated against rabies; no responsible owner would forego vaccination altogether. Pet vaccination has reduced the incidence of the disease in pets, wildlife, and humans in this country over the past few decades, but rabies still afflicts plenty of wild animals and poses risks to dogs and cats who come into contact with infected wildlife. 3. Your dog may be vaccinated, and titer tests may show that he is adequately protected from contracting the disease...but if he has been exempted from vaccination by meeting the provisions of this law, he will be considered unvaccinated in the eyes of the law. This can have serious repercussions should he bite another dog or a human and a bite report is filed - or if he has an encounter with a wild animal. In some communities, a dog in these situations might be ordered to be quarantined for 10 days at home; in others, he might be seized by animal control officers and quarantined at an animal shelter. Rabies vaccinations are a good thing; every dog should have at least two in his lifetime. It's debatable whether more are needed for the dog's protection (or to protect public health) - though far more vaccinations are required by state law. We strongly support the Rabies Challenge Fund, which is conducting research that should demonstrate that existing rabies vaccines convey much longer protection than their labels indicate. These studies may well provide the proof needed to further change state laws, so that fewer vaccinations against rabies are required during our dogs' lifetimes. See rabieschallengefund.org for more details. Why don't more people train their dog? Surely everyone wants a well-mannered canine companion, and new dog owner's intentions are usually good. Most dog owners make a genuine effort to train their dogs, only to give up because they find that training is more work or harder than they expected. Learning to communicate with your dog can be an awe-inspiring experience of mutual empowerment. Did you know that by receiving rewards for desired behaviors your dog learns how to choose to do the right thing, rather than just how to avoid doing the wrong thing? Take jumping on people. Lots of dogs jump up. Jumping up is one of their most annoying behaviors. Why do dogs jump up? To greet people, because face to face greetings are natural dog behavior, and because it's exceptionally rewarding to them. And sometimes even yelling is attention, and they are rewarded often enough that it's always worth a try. Remember: you want to reward the behaviors you want, and ignore or prevent the behaviors you don't want. Instead of physically punishing your Jumping Jack, ignore him by not making eye contact, by not speaking to him, and by turning your back on him until he does something good like sits, and then you reward with treats and attention. If you do this consistently, Jack will learn to run up to you and sit as hard as he can for attention. Dogs repeat behaviors that are rewarding to them. Whether you've never trained a dog or are just switching over to positive training, Pat Miller's book, The Power of Positive Dog Training will show that training your four-legged friend with positive training tools is easy, fun and effective. Available now at Whole Dog Journal. The good news: For each of the past two weekends, someone I know has come to my town from hundreds of miles away to adopt a dog from my local shelter. It's not luck; it's thanks to my relentless promotion of dogs I've met while volunteering - AND because I tell everyone I know who is looking for a dog that if they adopt from my shelter, they receive that dog's lifetime of FREE \"tech support\" from me. The challenge: Actually finding the time to provide that promised support to new and somewhat inexperienced dog owners. Just a few of the questions I've answered so far: Why won't she poop? If he pees at 6:40 pm, but hasn't pooped since this morning, should we let him loose in the house or does he have to go back in the crate? How do I get her to pee on the side of the house that is dirt, rather than only the grass? How soon can I take him for a long walk? Does that stuff kill fleas, too? Because I just saw a flea on her! Should the pet sitter/dog walker be bonded? Should I pass on this pet sitting company because they have a lot of employees and it might be a different walker every day? How do I keep her out of the living room and dining room; I have an open floor plan and the entrances to these rooms are 20 feet wide! My partner keeps telling the dog NO! How do I get him to stop that and \"divert and distract\" the dog \u2014 without getting in a huge fight? When will all those puppy teeth fall out? The adult teeth are already pushing in! Should I be brushing them every day? How many treats a day are too many? How many hours in a crate is too many? How soon can he graduate to being loose in the kitchen with the crate door open, without ruining his potty-training? And of course: What kind of food should I buy? It's been an exhausting but good reminder of just how much inexperienced dog owners need to learn, fast, if they have a strong desire to do everything right in order to produce a happy, healthy, well-behaved forever member of the family. I keep finding myself looking up and sending articles to them, and copying advice from this email and pasting it in that one . . . It finally occurred to me: I need to write a book for new dog owners, so I can just send them the book. Now, how am I going to find time to do that? Hmmm... The purity of your pet's drinking water is a serious consideration. In his book Pet Allergies, Alfred Plechner lists contaminated drinking water as a common cause of health problems. The simple act of replacing tap water with distilled, bottled or filtered water can bring surprising, dramatic improvements. Water is the only thing to which your pet should have unlimited access. Animals know when they're thirsty and they should have free access to clean containers of pure, healthy water. Municipal water contamination has become a national concern now that chemical pesticides, fertilizers, industrial solvents, road salt, bacteria, parasites and heavy metals have found their way into kitchen faucets. Whatever you can do to improve your drinking water is worth the effort. Your own health as well as your pet's health will improve. Excerpted from long-time Whole Dog Journal contributor CJ Puotinen's incredible resource, The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care. This 500+ page volume is everything you need to know to ensure good health and long life for your dog. It's nine o'clock on Tuesday evening. I don't know what to do with myself. The dishes are done, the dogs are fed. They are quite relaxed for Border Collies; they romped for hours in the warm spring air. I don't want to sleep. Tomorrow everything will change. But right now my two B&W companions are snoozing happily next me on the bed. I want to hold this moment still for as long as possible. I want it to stretch out and wrap its memories around me forever. Right now, this moment, all is right with the world. Tomorrow at 8AM, I drop Daisy off for her chemotherapy treatment. This is our \"normal.\" She has cancer; we live with it. We treat it; we won't be able to cure it. We play a lot of Frisbee and are still amazed at how much weight we are both gaining. Tomorrow at 11AM, I take Daisy's sibling Duncan in to see her internist/oncologist. We have him checked yearly for signs of the same type of cancer that Daisy has as it can be genetic. But that's not the reason for this visit. Duncan, aka Lad of the Lumps, has nine lipomas. When I found out that one in ten lipomas are malignant, I joked with his veterinarian that he has one more to go. I know it doesn't work that way, but when you're dealing with cancer on a regular basis, sometimes a warped sense of humor seeps out. This past Sunday, I found the tenth growth. It is huge, almost baseball-sized, and located in an area that doesn't seem typical for lipomas. I can't believe that I've somehow missed this growth. I had just checked him on Saturday as he has an upcoming visit with his holistic veterinarian and I was searching for new lumps so they could be checked and aspirated during the visit. I didn't feel the growth on his shoulder then. How did I miss it? How long have I missed it? About six months ago Duncan had his regular check up with the chiropractor. He's a wild boy and has of late been getting a little creaky. His chiropractor examined him thoroughly, made a few minor adjustments and proclaimed him good to go for another six months or so. Since then, I've noticed him limping slightly on his right front leg. Not enough to inhibit his all-out ball chasing, but just enough that I could see it ever so slightly. And then there was the overall stiffness during the evenings after these rambunctious games of fetch. It wasn't consistent; it would come and go. But something about it kept nagging at me. So I made an appointment with his holistic vet to start the diagnostic process. That appointment is scheduled for this coming Saturday. I've gotten really good over the past year at not anticipating diagnostics. Long-term cancer treatment has that effect I guess. Besides, the clinical reality and the dog reality can be two different things. I look to my girl to tell me how she is doing. I watch her play chase and inhale her food. I watch her snarfle in the pillows and wrestle with her brother. All is good. It's not that I forget she has cancer. It's just that sometimes I don't remember. And in between chemo treatments and ultrasounds and blood tests, I've learned not to worry about the next set of results. There's nothing I can do about it. Besides, I think she'll tell me long before a test will. In this moment, everything is still okay. I cherish it. I want to drench myself in it like a favorite perfume with the scent lingering for days. I watch their deep synchronized breaths, their occasional sighs and stretches. They are happy, content, relaxed. They are not thinking about tomorrow. I really wish I could say the same. \u2014 Barbara Dobbins In my editorial in the September issue, I mentioned that both my writers and I have endured some various challenging life events this summer, which delayed the appearance of a few articles. Fortunately, other terrific pieces were prepared ahead of schedule, or in a few cases, appeared out of thin air from one of my regular contributors. Despite the drama, we've been able to bring you a full 24 pages of information you could immediately put into practice - even if it wasn't on the topics we hinted at in the \"what's ahead\" bar that appears on page 24. Mentioning these difficulties last month accomplished one nice side effect: I received a number of notes or email messages containing suggestions for other articles. It gave me an idea: While regrouping, I should take this opportunity to formally ask all of you about what you'd like to see in WDJ. And so I've asked the Web guys at our publishing HQ to add a link to WDJ's home page (whole-dog-journal.com) for a short survey. Would you please go to the survey and answer just a few questions about what you'd like to see more of, or less of, in WDJ? Just so you know: When planning each issue, I try to maintain a balance between dog-friendly, force-free training; holistic healthcare (including conventional medicine) for dogs; product reviews; and nutrition. In the best of all possible worlds, I'd have a bit of information about each of these in each issue. Sometimes, however, the pendulum swings hard one way or the other for an issue or two. Last month, for example, we had a lot of training and behavior-related articles; this month, the issue is top-loaded with two in-depth articles having to do with health: chemotherapy for dogs with cancer, and Addison's disease. We're going to have a ton of food-related coverage in the next few months. It all evens out eventually - at least, I hope it does. I also try to balance some of the very long, detailed feature articles with shorter offerings, such as the \"5-Step Action Plan\" column and \"Canine News You Can Use.\" Generally speaking, the idea with the long pieces is to give a reader who is struggling with that particular subject everything they need to know to really make a difference to their dog's condition, whether the issue is health- or behavior-related. I understand that if you are not, yourself, dealing with that issue with your dog, these long pieces can be tedious. The idea is, though, that if your dog - or your brother's dog, or your neighbor's dog - ever did develop that condition, boom! You'd have an article on file that would really help address the problem. Check out the \"Survey\" link on whole-dog-journal.com. And thanks for "}
