The Works Committee reports, for the information of Council, having requested the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services to submit a report to the Committee by the endof 2001 on the incidences of illegal dumping. The Works Committee submits the following communication (August 11, 2000) from the City Clerk: City Council, at its meeting on August 1, 2, 3 and 4, 2000, had before it the attached Clause No. 3 contained in Report No. 15 of The Works Committee, headed \"Proposed Residential SolidWaste Collection By-law\". Council directed that the aforementioned Clause be struck out and referred back to the Works Committee for further consideration. (Clause No. 3 of Report No. 15 of The Works Committee) (City Council on August 1, 2, 3 and 4, 2000, struck out and referred this Clause back to the Works Committee for further consideration.) The Works Committee recommends the adoption of the report dated June 28, 2000, from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services. The Works Committee reports, for the information of Council, having requested the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services to submit a report directly to Council for itsmeeting on August 1, 2000, on the following motion, such report to include consideration ofissues related to weight and storage space: Moved by Councillor Shiner:\"That the following be deleted from the proposed by-law:(1) the requirement for the use of plastic bags for the collection of paper; and(2) the reference to bi-weekly recycling collection for Multiple Household Residences.\" The Works Committee submits the following report (June 28, 2000) from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services: Purpose: To summarize and address the comments received from stakeholders and present the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law for approval.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 14 Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report. Recommendations: It is recommended that:(1) the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, consolidating and harmonizing the residential components of the former Area Municipalities' solid waste collection by-laws,be enacted; (2) the following by-laws continue to be in effect, provided that in the event of a conflict between the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law and a by-law referred to below,the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law will prevail: - Chapter 309, City of Toronto Municipal Code, as amended; - Chapter 149, Etobicoke Municipal Code, amended; (3) authority be granted for the introduction of the necessary Bill to give effect thereto; (4) staff be authorized to take all steps necessary to enforce the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law; (5) residents of the City of Toronto be advised accordingly;(6) the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services be given full authority to discontinue solid waste collection services at any residential location due tonon-compliance with the by-law, and only in the event that the Ward Councillor is of theopinion that the location should remain eligible for solid waste collection services whilein contravention of the by-law, will the issue be sent to the Works Committee andCouncil for resolution; and (7) the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services be directed to initiate site investigations at multiple household residential locations and authorize the adjustment ofgarbage and/or recycling collection service based on the protocol identified in this report. Background: Since amalgamation, solid waste collection in the City of Toronto has been regulated by six separate by-laws. Due to fundamental differences in collection policies and enforcementprocedures, the need for a harmonized solid waste collection by-law has been critical tooperational and service level consistencies.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 15 The current solid waste collection by-laws deal with all services, however, due to the time required to properly research institutional and commercial eligibility issues and multiplehousehold residential service fees, the attached by-law (Attachment 1), prepared in consultationwith the Legal Department, deals only with residential curbside collection requirements andharmonizes collection policies and standardizes enforcement procedures across the City, whileproviding a fair and efficient collection system for our residential customers. Upon approval by Council, all six current by-laws will remain in effect. However, in the event of a conflict between the new by-law and the former municipal by-laws, the new by-law willprevail. All existing by-laws must remain in effect for the purposes of enforcing multiplehousehold bulk bin rental fees and commercial and institutional collection requirements.Following the harmonization of multiple residential household service fees and institutional andcommercial issues, the approved residential by-law will be amended to encompass all services.At that time, all former municipal by-laws will be repealed. In a report to each Community Council from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, dated March 9, 2000, staff provided a copy of the proposed Residential Solid WasteCollection By-law and outlined the changes that may affect the residents in each CommunityCouncil Area (CCA) for review. For the convenience of members of the Works Committee andCouncil, a copy of the report has been attached as Attachment 2. Community Councils haveprovided their comments directly to the Works Committee as part of this agenda or, alternatively, requested staff to report on their comments as part of this report. In addition to the consultation with each Community Council, newspaper advertisements were placed in each community newspaper(s) outlining the significant changes to collection services.A 24-hour response telephone line, in addition to an e-mail address was provided to allowresidents and other stakeholders the opportunity to provide their comments and concerns.Community Councils also held public information sessions at their May meetings. Two publicmeetings at separate venues were also scheduled at the request of the Scarborough and TorontoCommunity Councils. A summary of the stakeholder consultation has been provided in Part C ofthe Comments section. Staff were requested by Community Councils to report on the following items when the matter of the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law is considered by Works Committee: (1) provide clarification for existing situations as to what constitutes health or safety issues, and who determines what is a health and safety issue as it relates to whether or notgarbage will be collected from storage bins on private property owned by businesses ormultiple residential buildings (as requested by East York Community Council); (2) include a recommendation on a protocol for implementing collection for multiple residential units from twice a week to once a week (as requested by EtobicokeCommunity Council); (3) in consultation with the City's recycling firms, report on the requirement that newspapers and magazines be bagged, given the concern of the Toronto Community Council that thisToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 16 requirement may reduce participation in recycling and make residents guilty of an offence for undertaking an activity which, in the past, was legal (as requested by TorontoCommunity Council); and (4) report on adding a new section to the proposed by-law which would ensure the proper setting out of garbage and proper recycling of materials for buildings with two or moredwelling units with an absentee landlord (as requested by Toronto Community Council). Staff have provided the requested information in Part A in the Comments section.In addition, the following are recommendations from the Community Councils respecting the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law that have been included as part of this meeting'sagenda as submissions from the Community Councils for the consideration of the WorksCommittee: (1) (a) the retention of eight bags per collection, instead of the proposed six, having regard for the fact that the former City of Scarborough approved eight bags percollection when it adopted the once-a-week collection schedule (as requested byScarborough Community Council); and (b) the implementation of six bags per collection when garbage collection across the City has been harmonized (as requested by Scarborough Community Council); (2) as single family homes, townhouses, semi-detached homes and multi-residential developments, other than apartment buildings, are all taxed at the same rate, they shouldall receive the same level of service for waste collection and curbside collection, and thatcentral point collection be eliminated at all properties except those that may wish to retaincentral point collection (as requested by North York Community Council); (3) Section 15.1(c) be amended to provide that only grey and green recycling boxes be used for the collection of newspapers, telephone directories, magazines and catalogues, andthat all references to the use of bags for the collection of paper be deleted (as requestedby North York Community Council); (4) the wording of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law be amended to provide that the authority for ceasing of solid waste collection be only at the discretion ofCity Council (as requested by North York Community Council); (5) Section 2.5 of the proposed by-law attached to the report (March 9, 2000) from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, be amended to read: \"2.5 The Commissioner may determine that Owners of multiple household residences who do not participate fully in the City's collection of Recyclable Materials orwho sell or otherwise transfer Recyclable Materials to persons other than the Cityare not eligible to receive any Services.\" (as requested by Toronto CommunityCouncil);Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 17 (6) a Schedule of set fines be submitted to Council prior to the adoption of the by-law (as requested by Toronto Community Council); and (7) appropriate advertising and public education be undertaken to ensure residents are made aware of changes to their collection service upon approval of the by-law (as requesteddirectly to staff by East York Community Council). Discussion of each recommendation has been provided in Part B of the Comments section.Comments: A. Requests for Further Information: The following addresses the requests from Community Councils as they pertain to the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law: (1) Health and Safety Issues:If a health and safety issue arises related to whether or not garbage will be collected from storage bins on private property (excluding bulk or automated/rear bin), the existing by-law orrequirements will be reviewed. If, as in the case of the East York CCA, the current by-law statesthat collection will not take place on private property or from a storage room, the Solid WasteManagement Services supervisor will discuss changing the collection point with the property manager or owner. In turn, the collection method may change. Upon approval of this by-law, collection can be refused at any location that is deemed dangerous to City employees. In thecase of storage bins, a health and safety audit done in the Toronto CCA in 1993 showed thatsignificant health and safety concerns were identified that included rodents, sharps(syringes/needles), bin lids and packaging problems. When staff feel that their work environment may pose a health and safety risk, under the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act, the immediate supervisor is responsible for calling inrepresentatives from the designated Health and Safety Committee. The two representativeswould be union staff and management staff respectively. These two representatives woulddetermine if the situation is a health and safety issue. The staff member who originally lodgedthe complaint would then be informed of the Committee's decision. If the staff member is notsatisfied with the decision, a representative from the Ministry of Labour would be called in toinvestigate. At that point, the Ministry of Labour decision is binding. (2) Multiple Household Residence Protocol for Decreasing Current Twice/Week Service Levels: It is proposed that every location that currently receives twice-per-week garbage collection will receive a site visit by Solid Waste Management Services staff. At that time, staff will review thesite configuration and storage requirements with the property management company or arepresentative of the development. Based on estimated generation rates, we would require aminimum of approximately 1.2 cubic metres of space per unit on site to accommodate thestorage of garbage and recyclables weekly and bi-weekly respectively. The storage area(s)Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 18 should be ventilated and rodent proof and located internally within the actual building or in an enclosure on site. If staff are satisfied from the site investigation that the storage requirements cannot be met, the location would be exempt from the once-per-week collection clause. In conjunction with reducing curbside garbage collection service from twice per week to once per week, staff are reviewing the reduction of cart/toter collection service from the weeklycollection of each product (paper/commingled) to the collection of one product on alternatingweeks or both products bi-weekly (as is the current situation with single family householdsreceiving once-per-week garbage collection). Additional carts/toters will be required at theselocations to accommodate the additional storage needs. Again, if based on the site investigation,staff are satisfied that additional storage is not available, the recyclable collection service willremain status quo. (3) Grey Box Requirements:Currently, the proposed grey box requirements (i.e., newspaper, catalogues and magazines must be bagged and placed beside the grey box or on top of the other loose paper in the grey box) arecurrently practised in the Toronto and Scarborough CCAs. This policy is based on an ergonomicstudy undertaken in the Toronto CCA which showed that lifting grey boxes full ofnewspapers/magazines and catalogues posed a health risk. In these two CCAs, newspapers must be bagged, which allows staff to lift each bag separately. The Etobicoke and York CCA currently require that all paper be bagged to avoid litter problems on windy days. As such,generation rates in these four Community Council Areas will not be affected by the provision inthe new by-law. It should be noted that Community Council Areas with these restrictions stillrealized high diversion rates and it is anticipated that this requirement will not significantlyreduce the capture rates of fibre materials in the North York and East York CCAs. Calendars and advertisements will continue to promote the proper way of placing grey/green box material at the curb based on the approved by-law requirements. However, should staffdetermine that a resident is consistently placing out loose materials in the grey box and the boxesare deemed heavier than average, staff will visit the location and explain why newspapers,magazines and catalogues must be bagged. If the containers continue to be overfilled and heavy,staff will not collect the materials until they have been packaged correctly. Residents will befined as a final option only. (4) Multiple Household Set-Out Requirements:A separate section is not required in the by-law to ensure the proper setting out of garbage and recycling materials for buildings with two or more dwelling units with an absentee landlord asthe proposed by-law wording covers this issue. Under the new by-law, enforcement staff have the power to issue tickets where garbage and recyclables have not been set out properly. Both the owner and occupant are responsible toensure garbage and recyclables are placed out under the terms of the by-law. The City has theoption of cutting off service to locations not participating in the recycling program and/or leavingToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 19 materials behind due to by-law infractions. In these cases the City will have the ability to clean- up the boulevard and charge the owner directly on the taxes. As opposed to the full removal ofservices, the City also has the ability to take the owner to court for continued contravention ofthe by-law, whereby the owner may face a jail sentence. Both these enforcement procedures willensure that an absentee landlord is responsible for his/her tenants' actions. B. Community Council Recommendations: (1) Bag Limits:As stated in the report of March 9, 2000, it is anticipated that reducing the number of items allowed per collection day will not affect the majority of residents in the City of Toronto. It isanticipated that those residents who will be adversely affected by a six-bag limit do not regularlyparticipate in the City's recycling program or put out illegal materials for collection (i.e.,commercial waste). Based on the item limit study undertaken in the Scarborough CCA, households put out approximately 2.15 items weekly. In addition, a phone survey undertaken in November 1999 forthe purposes of evaluating summer twice-per-week collection, indicated that Scarboroughresidents felt that, on average, they put out 2.4 bags/containers on each collection day. In the original study done for the purposes of this by-law, residents put out approximately 2.86 items weekly. Therefore, by setting a low but realistic item limit, it is anticipated that residents who normally place out less that six items will be further encouraged to increase theirrecycling and composting efforts and divert reusable items to a number of agencies locatedwithin the City. In addition, this item limit will allow staff the opportunity to identifyhouseholds that may require additional blue/grey boxes and/or educational materials regardingrecycling and other diversion options. Staff will also be able to identify locations that may beconsistently putting out prohibited items such as trade waste for residential collection. Approving an eight-item limit initially until all CCAs receive summer twice/week collection will ultimately cause confusion among residents when the bag limit is adjusted. While the NorthYork CCA and some Toronto CCA residents are enjoying a higher level of service this summer,our studies have indicated that, on average, residents do not put out more than six items in totalover the two collection days in each week. In addition, tonnage collected is generally 25 percentlower on the second day and only 47 percent of the residents typically use the second day. It isexpected that the average resident will not abuse the twice-per-week collection system byplacing more than six items out weekly. (2) Central Point Collection:As stated in the report entitled \"Proposed Solid Waste Management Services Requirements for Developments and Redevelopments\" from the General Manager, Solid Waste ManagementServices, dated March 9, 2000, to each Community Council, the proposed requirementsrecommend garbage and recycling collection services from central collection points (i.e., bulklift collection or shared single point collection) at all new and applicable redevelopments wheretownhouses/rowhouses etc. face a private roadway. Factors that influenced the proposedToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 110 requirement include liability issues, problems associated with roadways not built or maintained to City standards, lack of by-law enforcement capabilities on private property and therequirement that garbage collected in rigid containers or bags be collected from the publicportion of the street allowance. Should door-to-door collection be requested, it is recommendedthat developers propose to provide roads in the development that can be assumed by the City. Inaddition, the proposed requirements set out by Urban Planning and Development Services(UPDS) in the draft document entitled \"Design Guidelines and Development Standards for InfillHousing\" recommend that freehold housing be developed on existing public streets wherepossible, or alternatively, on newly created public streets that are not deadended. While it is realized that infill townhouse locations are taxed at the same rate as single family homes, the elimination of single point collection at all existing locations is not possible due tothe issues that were factored into the original decision to provide single point collection. Factorsaffecting the approvals included lack of appropriate storage facilities, private road widths andaccess issues. Many locations do not have storage in each individual dwelling unit, therefore,central storage facilities and collection points are critical. In addition, existing locationscurrently not receiving door-to-door collection do not have sufficient road widths that will allowour existing vehicles access onto the site. In addition to the narrow roads, these locations maynot have sidewalks which provide for the safety of residents and children when vehicles aremoving through the site. Access is also a critical factor to collection on these narrow privateroadways due to parked cars and snow banks, thereby resulting in missed collections; and, asstated previously, we have no by-law enforcement capabilities on private property. For example, should a resident choose to store their garbage at the private road allowance, we cannot issue tickets or clean up orders. These factors, in addition to the fact that service levels have not changed at these locations as a result of amalgamation, staff are recommending that the collection method at all existinglocations serviced by the City remain status quo. It is important to note that this is not governedby the by-law. (3) Grey/Green Box Set Out:Currently, all CCAs, with the exception of the North York and East York CCAs, require that newspapers, magazines and catalogues be bagged and placed beside or on top of other loosepaper in the grey/green box due to health and safety issues and litter concerns. Loose papertends to create serious litter problems on windy days. Heavier boxes, due to overloading orstorage in wet weather conditions, have created a cause for concern with regards to back injuriesdue to the deeper bend required to lift recycling boxes in comparison to garbage cans. Anergonomics study was undertaken in the former City of Toronto when the grey box was firstintroduced and based on recent correspondence from the City's ergonomist, it is recommendedthat the set-out requirements in the proposed by-law be approved. Approval of all loose paperproducts in the grey/green box will compromise the City's efforts to maintain a safe workingenvironment and a clean city. (4) Removal of Collection Services:Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 111 By changing the authority for ceasing solid waste collection from the Commissioner to City Council, the time frame for enforcing the by-law and the requirement of monthly reports to theWorks Committee and City Council will be onerous on both staff and Council. Currently, in theScarborough CCA, staff ensure that Councillors are made aware of locations in their Ward thatmay be removed from our collection service due to the refusal of the property manager toimplement or maintain a recycling program for residents. As such, Councillors are made awarewell in advance of any notification of removal of services and have sufficient time to contact theproperty manager or Solid Waste Management Services staff regarding the location. Staff are recommending that this procedure be established across the City upon approval of the by-law. Councillors will be copied on all correspondence relating to the potential removal ofservices at any residential location due to the mandatory recycling provision or health and safetyviolations. After staff have provided copies of all relevant documentation to support the removalof services, the Councillor has the opportunity to review the situation. If the Councillor does notoppose our recommendation, the Commissioner will have the authority to discontinue services.However, if the Councillor wishes to have a location exempt from the by-law, staff are proposingthat a report be provided to the Works Committee and Council in order to exempt the locationfrom this by-law provision. (5) Mandatory Recycling:Staff have recommended that all single family and multiple family households be subject to the mandatory recycling by-law. While the by-law is critical to encouraging owners of multiple household residences to participate in the City's recycling program, it is also critical foraddressing single family household residents who consistently do not recycle and are in constantcontravention of the item limit. Staff are of the opinion that mandatory recycling is a powerfulmotivational tool. In addition, when fibre revenues increase significantly, some residents andproperty managers are willing to sell their paper to companies other than the City. In instancessuch as these, the City will realize a loss in revenues. Again, the mandatory recycling clause canbe used to ensure we do not lose paper products to entrepreneurs during peak market prices.Staff are therefore recommending that the mandatory recycling clause remain as originallypresented during the public consultation. (6) Set Fines:The proposed set fines that have been drafted and forwarded to the Legal Department for their review have been included as Attachment 3. Upon review and modification, where required, theproposed wording and fines will be submitted to the Ministry of the Attorney General forapproval. However, the by-law must be approved by Council before the short form wording andsuggested set fines are forwarded by the Legal Department to the Ministry. The Ministry has theopportunity to amend the set fines at that time. (7) Public Education:Solid Waste Management Services staff, in consultation with the Public Consultation and Community Outreach Unit, will create an appropriate public education plan to ensure thatresidents are made aware of any changes to their collection service as a result of the harmonizedToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 112 by-law. The plan will include newspaper advertisements and flyers delivered in conjunction with annual solid waste collection calendars. In addition, when a residential location is inviolation of an infraction that has changed as a result of the by-law, staff will provide aneducation package highlighting changes to the by-law on the first infraction, as opposed to finingthe resident. However, staff will undertake the normal enforcement procedure on anysubsequent offences. C. Results of Stakeholder Consultation: In addition to each Community Council reviewing and commenting on the proposed by-law, residents and other stakeholders were given the opportunity to provide feedback. All ratepayergroups in the City and approximately 200 property managers were provided through the mail orvia facsimile, with information on the proposed by-law and an invitation to attend their localpublic meeting. All stakeholders were given the opportunity to provide feedback at any publicmeeting and through a 24-hour comment line and via e-mail. The following table summarizes comments received from stakeholders through one of the above means: CommentsNo. of Similar ResponsesSolid Waste Management Services Recommendation Elderly residents use the publiclitter bins for garbage disposaland, as such, should not beillegal.1 The use of public litter bins is currently illegal across the City and must remain sodue to the problems encountered withabuse.

Increased enforcement requiredfor people who dump householdgarbage in public litter bins.1 The new by-law prohibits the use of public litter bins for household garbage.Enforcement staff regularly open bags leftin the litter bins. However, tickets can onlybe issued if evidence is found. Problems with automated bins inthe North York CCA -unsightly.3 A working committee made up of Councillors and staff is addressing the issueof automated bins and will recommendalternative methods of collection. Lack of storage space a problemat some townhouses, therefore,twice-per-week garbagecollection is necessary.1 Staff have recommended criteria that will be used to determine if a multiple householdresidence receiving curbside garbagecollection can be adjusted from twice perweek to once per week. Locations withinsufficient storage space will continue toreceive twice-per-week collection.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 113 CommentsNo. of Similar ResponsesSolid Waste Management Services Recommendation Legislation should be in place toenforce the repair of electricalappliances as opposed todisposal.1 Provincial/Federal mandate. Concern of space requirements due to the mandatory recyclingclause.1 Staff assisted with identifying space and provided the cost of recycling containers. Reduction in bag limit will resultin more litter, dumping.1 The majority of residents are in compliance with a six-item limit. D. Other: As a result of an extensive review of the proposed by-law during the consultation phase, minorwording changes have been made. However, these will not affect the service levels andrequirements originally presented during the consultation process, nor do they affect the purposeof the by-law. These changes allow for better enforcement capabilities. Conclusions: Based on comments received from all stakeholders during the public consultation process, staff are of the opinion that the attached by-law provides a fair and reasonable collection system to allresidents of the City of Toronto. By making changes to bag limits or mandatory recycling, theCity will be compromising its efforts to increase diversion and decrease the amount ofunauthorized waste going to landfill.

Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report.Recommendations: It is recommended that:(1) this report be received for information;(2) consultation with stakeholders be held at the next meeting of Community Council or, alternatively, at a separate open house; and (3) each Community Council notify the General Manager of Solid Waste Management Services of their preference with regards to Recommendation No. (2) to allow forappropriate planning; and (4) any comments be forwarded to the contact noted at the end of this report by May 12, 2000. Background: Since amalgamation, solid waste collection in the City of Toronto has been regulated by six separate by-laws. Due to fundamental differences in collection policies and enforcementprocedures, the need for a harmonized solid waste collection by-law is essential. The former solid waste collection by-laws deal with all services, however, due to the time required to properly research institutional and commercial eligibility issues and multiplehousehold residential user fees, the draft by-law deals only with the curbside residentialcollection requirements. Solid Waste staff, in consultation with the Legal Department, haveprepared a residential solid waste collection by-law that harmonizes collection policies andstandardizes enforcement procedures across the City, while providing a fair and efficientcollection system for our customers. In conjunction with Community Council review, the proposed by-law is currently being presented to the public for comment. Upon completion of this consultation process, andapproval by Council, all applicable portions of the six current by-laws will be repealed andreplaced with the harmonized City of Toronto Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law. AllToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 136 existing by-laws will remain in effect for the purposes of enforcing multiple household bin rental fees and commercial and institutional collection requirements. Following completion of theinstitutional and commercial issues, the approved residential by-law will be amended toencompass all services. Comments: The attached proposed by-law ensures that residents receive the same level of service across the City, provides a fair and efficient enforcement system and ensures that garbage and litter placedon public property is minimized. The following summarizes key issues addressed in the proposed by-law that may affect the current service levels in each Community Council Area. In addition, Table 1 outlines thesignificant changes that will be realized in each Community Council Area due to the integrationof services and restrictions recommended in the proposed by-law. (a) Development and Redevelopment Requirements (Section 2.4):This section deals with the requirements of all new developments and redevelopments to adhere to the solid waste requirements during the site plan approval process. This will ensure that allnew and redevelopments plan for appropriate storage and collection locations. Adherence to thisrequirement will ensure that problems related to inadequate planning (including access issues) are addressed prior to construction and will ultimately allow for a smooth transition to city collection services. The draft document \"Requirements for City of Toronto Garbage andRecycling Collection at Developments and Redevelopments\" is presented for comment in aseparate report on this agenda. (b) Mandatory Recycling (Section 2.5):This section deals with the ability of the City to withdraw waste management services to any single family or multiple household residence which does not participate fully in the City'srecycling program. The purpose of this clause is two fold: (a) to encourage non-participatinglocations to participate in the City's recycling program; and, (b) to encourage locations whichconsistently put out contaminated materials for collection, to remove all contaminants prior tocollection. The anticipated results will include an increase in multiple household recycling ratesand an increase in revenues due to the additional materials generated combined with the absenceof contaminants. This clause is currently enforced under existing by-laws in Scarborough and Etobicoke. Generally, locations that are informed of this provision have chosen to participate in the City'srecycling program. In addition, in February 1999, Council approved a staff recommendation thata mandatory recycling clause be included in any new waste management by-law. (c) Frequency of Garbage Collection Services (Section 3):This section summarizes the type and frequency of service provided to each class of property and includes a provision for summer twice-per-week collection.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 137 Due to the importance of harmonizing service levels and encouraging waste reduction and recycling, the draft by-law stipulates that all locations receiving residential curbside garbagecollection (including door-to-door and single point collection) will be eligible for once-per-weekgarbage collection unless there is a verifiable health risk associated with this frequency (i.e.,limited storage space). This requirement will affect some multiple household locations,including townhouse locations and low and medium rise buildings. Multiple household locationscurrently receiving twice-per-week curbside collection have been enjoying an additional level ofservice not currently provided to other locations receiving curbside collection. In addition, the provision of once-per-week collection at multiple household locations will reduce the number of potential days that garbage is placed at the curb. Currently, locations thatreceive twice-per-week collection potentially have garbage at the curb four days per week.Once-per-week collection will reduce that to a maximum of two days per week. Prior to amalgamation, the Scarborough Community Council Area changed curbside garbage collection frequency at all multiple household locations from twice per week to once per weekwith no adverse affects on our customers. In addition, as a result of this change, many of theaffected locations opted to participate in the City's recycling program. Locations that proved tohave storage problems that could not be rectified still receive twice-per-week collection. Prior toenforcement of this clause, staff plan to recommend a policy that addresses issues associatedwith collection frequency such as storage space. Approximately 653 multiple household locations in the City, with the majority located in the Toronto Community Council Area, receive twice-per-week curbside collection of garbage. It isestimated that, if all locations could easily be converted to once-per-week garbage collection,and once every other week recycling collection, an annual savings of almost $250,000.00 may berealized. Recycling collection frequency for multiple household locations will vary depending on the specific requirements of the building and whether the location receives curbside blue/grey boxcollection, cart collection or bulk lift collection. The minimum collection frequency for multiplehousehold recycling is once every two weeks. (d) Collection Limits (Section 8):Section 8.1 limits the amount of items to be set out for residential curbside collection to a maximum of six per collection. Based on surveys done in various areas throughout the City, theaverage household puts out 2.86 items for collection on each collection day. Approximately4 percent of the dwellings surveyed put out greater than six items on any collection day. Ofthese set outs, the average was approximately nine items with a maximum at one dwelling of 18.In many instances, these locations did not participate in the City's recycling program during thestudy period. Setting an item limit will encourage non-participating residents to recycle,encourage residents to reduce the amount of waste they generate, increase current recycling ratesand encourage the use of backyard composters.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 138 (f) Weight Limits (Section 13.2): It is recognized that all former municipalities, with the exception of the former City of Toronto, had a weight limit of 23 kg. However, an ergonomic study completed by the former City ofToronto showed that it was problematic for collection staff to collect garbage containers that areheavier than 20 kg. Studies have shown that the average household puts out containers that areless that 20 kg and, based on those results, a change in the weight limit would not significantlyaffect the current services residents receive, nor the amount of containers set out. (g) Times for Setting Out Garbage and Recyclables (Section 14):In an attempt to harmonize set out times, both the desire to maintain clean, aesthetically pleasing streets and the current set out times were evaluated. While Scarborough, East York, Etobicokeand York stipulated earlier times, the proposed by-law recommends a \"no earlier than 8 p.m. onthe day before collection\" set out time. This will effectively prohibit the setting out of garbage atthe curb during the evening rush hour and avoid creating an unappealing streetscape, particularlyduring the summer months. It is assumed that the change in set out times will not create asignificant hardship on residents and will ultimately provide for a cleaner community. (h) Preparation of Recyclable Materials for Collection (Section 15):Recyclable material set out requirements have not changed in each Community Council Area, with the exception of grey box set outs. Based on studies undertaken for the purposes of this proposed by-law, it was determined that the average weight per grey box set out filled with paperwas approximately 25 lbs. However, 8 percent of the set outs were over 40 lbs., with an averageweight of approximately 51 lbs. Heavier boxes, due to overloading or storage in wet weatherconditions, have created a concern about back injuries related to the deeper bend required to liftrecycling boxes in comparison to garbage cans. Based on an ergonomics study undertaken in theformer City of Toronto when the grey box was first introduced, and recent correspondence fromthe City's ergonomist, it is recommended that residents be required to bag newspapers andmagazines before placing them beside the grey box. The draft by-law reflects these recommendations, however, in an attempt to make the set out easier for residents, prevent paper from blowing out of the boxes, maintain or increaseproductivity and to ensure that staff are not exposed to back injuries, it is proposed that annualcollection calendars advertise that residents be required to bag their newspapers and magazinesand place the bags on top of the loose paper in the grey box. The collector then has the option ofpicking up the paper in one lift, depending on the weight, or remove individual bags. (i) Prohibited Acts (Section 19):This section summarizes such activities as illegal dumping and any other type of disturbance of garbage and materials placed at the curb. In particular, this section deals with littering and theabuse of public litter bins.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 139 (j) Charging of Expenses Against the Property (Section 20): This policy was practised in the former Cities of Scarborough and Etobicoke and allows By-law Enforcement Officers to add the cost of clean-up orders to individual property taxes. In additionto using this as a punitive measure, this ensures that the City recoups all costs for clean-ups, andin the case of a rented dwelling, the owner will ultimately be responsible for their tenants'actions. Previous practice has shown that this is a deterrent for those that abuse the collectionservices and are in constant contravention of the by-law. Conclusions: The proposed residential solid waste collection by-law has been developed to provide a fair and equitable collection system for our customers and also addresses opportunities for improvedservice delivery, increased efficiencies and increased waste diversion. Comments received fromeach Community Council, coupled with comments received from our customers, will beincorporated into the draft by-law prior to submission to the Works Committee in June 2000.

Background: The Toronto Community Council, on May 23, 2000, had before it a report (March 9, 2000) from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, respecting the Proposed ResidentialSolid Waste Collection By-law.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 145 The following persons appeared before the Toronto Community Council in connection with the foregoing matter: - Mr. Chris Kyla Community Council's recommendations are noted above. _________ The Works Committee also submits the following communication (May 30, 2000) from the City Clerk (North York Community Council): The North York Community Council, on May 23, 2000:(1) received the report (March 9, 2000) from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, Works and Emergency Services; and (2) referred the following recommendations respecting the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law to the Works Committee for its consideration: (a) that as single family homes, townhouses, semi-detached homes and multi-residential developments, other than apartment buildings, are all taxed at thesame rate, they should all receive the same level of service for waste collectionand curbside collection, and that central point collection be eliminated at allproperties except those that may wish to retain central point collection; (b) that Section 15.1(c) be amended to provide that only grey and green recycling boxes be used for the collection of the newspapers, telephone directories,magazines and catalogues, and that all references to the use of bags for thecollection of paper be deleted; and (c) the wording of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law be amended to provide that the authority for the ceasing of solid waste collection beonly at the discretion of City Council. The North York Community Council also reports having requested the Commissioner, Works and Emergency Services to: (i) investigate and report on new vehicles and alternative methods that could be used in order to facilitate curbside collection in all townhouse developments and single familyhomes, including those on laneways and non-standard roadways; and (ii) bring a clean-up crew from downtown to the former City of North York area to undertake a one-time clean-up of litter, in areas where the flower pot bins are located.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 146 Background: The North York Community Council had before it the following reports: - (March 9, 2000) from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, Works and Emergency Services, providing each Community Council an opportunity to reviewand comment on the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, prior toCouncil consideration and recommending that: (1) this report be received for information;(2) consultation with stakeholders be held at the next meeting of Community Council or, alternatively, at a separate open house; (3) each Community Council notify the General Manager of Solid Waste Management Services of their preference with regards to RecommendationNo. (2) to allow for appropriate planning; and (4) any comments be forwarded to the contact noted at the end of this report by May 12, 2000; and - (May 9, 2000) from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, Works and Emergency Services, providing the North York Community Council with information requested as a result of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, andrecommending that this report be received for information. The following persons appeared before the North York Community Council in connection with the foregoing matter: - Ms. Charlotte Nowack, who also filed a written submission, a copy of which is on file in the office of the City Clerk, North York Civic Centre. - Mr. Jack Goldberg, on behalf of York Condominium Corporation No. 5;- Ms. Thelma Davidson;- Ms. Sara Schneider; and- Mr. Samuel Wilkes, on behalf of York Condominium Corporation No. 175.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 147 (Report dated May 9, 2000, from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, addressed to the North York Community Council) Purpose: To provide the North York Community Council with information requested as a result of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law. Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report.Recommendation: It is recommended that this report be received for information.Background: At its meeting of March 23, 2000, North York Community Council requested the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, to submit a report for consideration at the May 23,2000 meeting on the following specific issues relating to the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law: (a) the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law containing a provision that requires a minimum of three days between garbage pick-ups; (b) identifying high compliance/use areas of recycling and the cost of providing once-per-week recycling pick-ups in those areas; (c) providing previously requested information regarding the cost of instituting once-per-week recycling pick-up City-wide; and (d) providing a copy of the provincial regulations regarding the frequency of recycling pick-up in relation to the frequency of garbage pick-up. Discussion: (1) Minimum of Three Days Between Garbage Pick-ups:Staff have reviewed the feasibility of including a provision in the proposed by-law that requires a minimum of three days between garbage pick-ups. This type of provision does not affectonce-per-week garbage collection. However, with respect to twice-per-week garbage collection,a number of factors limit our ability to ensure that there will be a minimum of three daysbetween garbage pick-ups. In Community Council Areas currently provided with curbsidecollection on a four consecutive day schedule (North York, Scarborough, East York), collectinggarbage from the same collection area at least three days apart is not viable. The fourToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 148 consecutive day schedule (Tuesday - Friday) was implemented to avoid shifting collection days on weeks with a statutory holiday on the Monday. In order to accommodate a three-day gap inthese communities, collection would need to be scheduled on a Saturday or Sunday. This willcreate a disturbance in residential areas, and result in additional labour costs being incurred. (2) High Recycling Compliance Areas:Table 1 shows the recyclable tonnages collected in each calendar area in the North York CCA between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2000. Calendar AreaTonnes Collected January 2000 - March 2000Average Tonnes Collected Bi-WeeklyAverage Kilograms Per Collection Per Household 6.5 As can be seen in Table 1, calendar areas 2C, 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D generate the highest amountsof recyclables. The additional cost of providing once-per-week collection in high generation areas is dependent on the number of calendar areas receiving additional services and the associated number ofvehicles and labour required. As such, it is not possible at this time to provide an actual dollarfigure associated with providing additional services to specific areas. (3) Cost of Once-per-Week Recycling Collection City-wide:As stated in the November 1, 1999, staff report to North York Community Council, the estimated additional operating cost to increase the level of recycling pick-up city wide from once everysecond week to once per week is $2.5 million per year. This does not include the capital costrequirements for new vehicles. The total estimated operating cost for providing once-per-weekrecycling is $15 million per year. The additional driving time required for once-per-weekcollection would also increase vehicle emissions and associated greenhouse gas emissions. (4) Provincial Regulations:The Provincial Regulations pertaining to Blue Box waste management systems has been included as Attachment \"A\". Clause 7(5) deals specifically with the frequency of recyclablecollection in relation to garbage collection which requires that recycling collection to occur atone half the frequency of garbage collection. Based on the current summer twice-per-weekpolicy in the Toronto CCA, recycling continues to be collected bi-weekly, or at one-fourth theToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 149 frequency of garbage collection. Ministry of the Environment staff have confirmed that this practice does not appear to conflict with the EPA regulation.In addition, the Ministry of the Environment in a consultation paper dated June 2, 1998 entitled\"Draft Regulation - General - Waste Management\", promulgated under the EPA, proposes thatonly bi-weekly recycling collection will be required under the provincial regulation regardless ofthe frequency of garbage collection. However, to date, there has been no notice given withrespect to when the draft regulation will be passed. Conclusions: This report addresses the issues raised at North York Community Council regarding the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law.

(A copy of the draft Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law appended to the report dated March 9, 2000, from the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, to eachCommunity Council, and of the attachment to the report dated May 9, 2000, from the GeneralManager, Solid Waste Management Services, to the North York Community Council, has beenforwarded to all Members of Council with the agenda for the Works Committee meeting ofJuly 12, 2000, and a copy thereof is on file in the office of the City Clerk.) _________ (City Council on August 1, 2, 3 and 4, 2000, had before it, during consideration of the foregoing Clause, the following report (July 25, 2000) from the Commissioner of Works and EmergencyServices: Purpose:Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 150 To provide Council with an update on the staff investigation of alternative methods for curbside collection at townhouse developments, as requested by North York Community Council.Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report. Recommendation: It is recommended that this report be received for information.Background: At its meeting on May 23, 2000, North York Community Council requested the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services to \"investigate and report on new vehicles and alternativemethods that could be used in order to facilitate curbside collection in all townhousedevelopments and single family homes, including those on laneways and non-standardroadways\". In addition, at its meeting on July 18, 2000, North York Community Council requested that the above report \"be forwarded and dealt with by City Council at the same time as the ProposedResidential Solid Waste Collection By-law which is scheduled to be considered by City Council at its meeting to be held on August 1, 2, and 3, 2000\". Comments: While a report has been requested at the same time as the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, it is important to note that the proposed by-law does not govern the type ofcollection at townhouses (or any other type of developments). Only the frequency, based on theapproved type of collection, is governed by the proposed by-law. In an effort to research possible alternatives to the current collection system at townhouse locations not receiving door to door collection, staff are currently conducting site visits to reviewthe existing situation and identify collection options. To ensure that a recommended alternativecollection system will not negatively impact the solid waste collection operation or budgetrestrictions, staff require additional time to evaluate other municipal experiences, potential costsof the collection system and liability issues. As this issue is not critical to Council approval of the proposed by-law, staff are continuing to research any potential curbside collection system alternatives for all townhouse locations notcurrently serviced door to door and will provide a report, with recommendations, to a futureWorks Committee. It is expected that the review will be completed by September 2000. Conclusion Upon completion of the review and analysis of an alternative curbside collection system at all townhouse locations, a report will be forwarded to Works Committee in September 2000.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 151Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 152 Contact: Catharine Daniels Senior Analyst, Policy DevelopmentSolid Waste Management ServicesWorks and Emergency ServicesMetro Hall, 19 th Floor Phone: 392-4632 392-4754E-mail:daniels@city.toronto.on.ca Correspondence from Linda McIlwain, Senior Ergonomics Consultant) _________ (City Council also had before it, during consideration of the foregoing Clause, the following report (July 27, 2000) from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services: Purpose: To provide Council with information relating to the collection of grey boxes and bi-weekly recycling collection for multiple household residences. Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report.Recommendations: It is recommended that:(1) the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law require the use of plastic bags for the collection of newspaper, magazines and catalogues; (2) the protocol outlined in the report to the Works Committee from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services dated June 28, 2000, be approved; and (3) in the event that Recommendation No. (2) is not approved, the following amendments be made to the proposed by-law: (i) in Section 3.1, the word \"more\" be changed to \"less\" so that the amended Section 3.1 would read \"The City shall collect Garbage no less than once perweek from Household Residences and Multiple Household Residences whoreceive Curbside Collection\"; andToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 153 (ii) in Section 4.1, the word \"more\" be changed to \"less\" so that the amended Section 4.1 would read \"The City shall collect Recyclable Materials no less than once every two weeks from Household Residences and Multiple HouseholdResidences who receive Curbside Collection of Garbage.\" Background: At its meeting on July 12, 2000, the Works Committee requested the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services to submit a report directly to Council for its meeting on August 1, 2000,on the issues relating to weight and storage space, respectively, on the following motion: \"That the following be deleted from the proposed by-law:(1) the requirement for the use of plastic bags for the collection of paper; and(2) the reference to bi-weekly recycling collection for multiple household residences.\" Comments: (a) Grey Box Set Out Requirements: Staff have recommended, as outlined in Section 15.1 of the proposed by-law, that newspapers, magazines and catalogues be placed in shopping bags and placed beside the grey box (green boxin the North York Community Council Area). All other paper and boxboard can be placed loosein the grey box. This recommendation is based on a review of existing policies in each Community Council Area (CCA), in addition to a recommendation from the City's ergonomics consultant. Litter concernswere the basis for the Etobicoke and York CCA's policies. In addition, during the first year ofgreen box collection in the former City of North York, staff received numerous complaints dueto litter as a result of loose paper in the green box. Since then, staff in the North York CCA haveadvised residents in all promotional material that paper products should be bagged. The City'sergonomic consultant has stated that the lifting of overloaded grey boxes is problematic due tothe deeper bend required to lift recycling boxes in comparison to garbage cans. As such, theweight of the grey box was directly related to the policy of the Scarborough and Toronto CCA's.Correspondence from Linda McIlwain, Senior Ergonomics Consultant is attached(Attachment 1). In addition to the ergonomics consultant's recommendation, it is important to note that under Section 25.(2) of the Ontario Occupation Health and Safety Act (OHSA) \"an employer shall takeevery precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker\". In addition,Section 27.(2) states that a Supervisor responsible for recycling collection \"shall advise a workerof the existence of any potential or actual danger to the health and safety of the worker of whichthe supervisor is aware\". As such, under Part V of the OHSA, a worker has the right to refuse orto stop work where their health and safety is jeopardized.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 154 While it is recommended that paper other than newspapers, magazines and catalogues be placed loose in the grey/green box, staff are cognisant of the litter concerns of those CCAs that askedresidents to bag all paper. Therefore, all promotional material will state that residents shouldplace their bagged material on top of their loose paper products. Collection staff will have theoption of collecting the box if it is within the safe weight limit, or removing the bags individuallyprior to emptying the grey/green box. (b) Frequency of Recycling Collection at Multiple Household Residential Locations:As discussed in the report from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services, dated June 28, 2000, to the Works Committee, staff have recommended that multiple householdlocations receiving twice per week curbside garbage collection (defined in the by-law as alocation that receives collection via a rear loading collection vehicle) be reviewed to determine ifthese locations have sufficient storage space to accommodate once per week garbage collection.In some cases, locations may have been originally designed to accommodate less frequentcollection. The protocol for this review is presented in the above-mentioned report. It should benoted that the storage space required in the protocol (1.2 cubic metres) is a guideline only andstaff will exercise flexibility when reviewing locations and take into account factors such asrecycling or separate areas for larger items. In conjunction with any rationalization of garbage collection service, staff have proposed that, at locations that receive weekly garbage collection service, recycling collection be provided once every other week (or in the case of the Toronto CCA, alternating weekly collection of fibre and containers). Staff will only recommend a change in service levels if there is sufficient spaceavailable to accommodate any need for additional recycling containers. This recommendation to change service frequency is not meant to hamper current recycling efforts. Collection of both garbage and recyclables at multiple household locations can easily beintegrated into current single family residential collection routes. This integration will reduceCO2 emissions from our fleet, vehicle traffic and reduce the potential for accidents involvingstaff and the public by eliminating up to four (4) different vehicles weekly in each residentialneighbourhood. In the event Council chooses not to approve the staff recommendation or protocol, the by-law must be adjusted accordingly. However, the reference to bi-weekly recycling collection formultiple household locations must remain in the by-law as a number of locations receive bluebox collection bi-weekly. (Please refer to Recommendation No. 3.) Conclusion: In an effort to keep the City clean and provide a safe work environment, the collection of newspapers, magazines and catalogues should be facilitated by placing them in grocery bags ontop of other loose paper in the grey/green box or, alternatively, place them beside the grey/greenbox. In addition, by integrating the multiple household curbside collection routes with the singlefamily household collection routes, truck traffic safety will be increased and environmentalimpacts will be reduced.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 155 Contact: Catharine Daniels Senior Analyst, Policy DevelopmentSolid Waste Management ServicesWorks and Emergency ServicesMetro Hall, 19 th Floor Phone: (416) 392-4632Fax: (416) 392-4754E-mail:daniels@city.toronto.on.ca Attachment: 1. Correspondence from Linda McIlwain, Senior Ergonomics Consultant)(City Council also had before it, during consideration of the foregoing Clause, a communication (July 14, 2000) from Mr. Glenn Napier, forwarding comments with respect to the proposed SolidWaste Collection By-law.) The Works Committee also submits the following report (January 23, 2001) from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services, entitled \"Set Fines and Clean-UpOrders\": Purpose: To provide revised fines and clarification of the short form wording associated with the proposed residential collection by-law. Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report.Recommendations: It is recommended that:(1) Section 19 of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, presented to Council in the report dated June 28, 2000, from the Commissioner of Works andEmergency Services, be amended, for the purposes of facilitating the short form wordingonly, to include the following two sub-clauses: 19.1 No person shall:19.1 (g) set out any waste for collection unless it is in appropriate Regulation Containers as specified in this By-law;Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 156 19.1 (h) set out any waste in a Regulation Container that is not in good working order; (2) the revised set fines provided as Attachment 2 in this report replace the original set fines presented to Council in the report dated June 28, 2000, from the Commissioner of Worksand Emergency Services entitled \"Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law\"; (3) upon approval of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection by-law, the Legal Services Division be authorized to forward the fine schedule to the Ministry of theAttorney General for approval; (4) following receipt of approval from the Ministry of the Attorney General, staff be directed to apply the fine schedule as part of the residential by-law enforcement procedure; and (5) following approval of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, staff be authorized to issue clean-up orders for material that is deemed, by a By-law EnforcementOfficer, to be offensive to the public or attractive to animals and collect the cost in a likemanner as taxes. Background: In August 2000, staff presented the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law to Council for approval. Council referred it back to the Works Committee for further review. As such, the proposed by-law is presented in a separate Works Committee report on this agenda. The proposed by-law includes recommended short form wording and associated set fines. Following review of the by-law by the Works Committee on July 12, 2000, various mediasources publicized aspects of the short form wording and set fines. Unfortunately, in someinstances, the short form wording was taken out of context and presented to the publicinaccurately. In addition, residents and Councillors felt that the recommended fine of $105.00plus a $25.00 provincial victim surcharge for all set fines was not appropriate for all offences. This report provides clarification of the proposed short form wording and revisions to some of the set fines to vary them in accordance with the severity of the infraction. Comments: The proposed by-law sets the requirements that residents must follow in order to ensure that their garbage is collected and also to ensure the safety of collection workers and other residents, inaddition to setting guidelines that would keep our City clean. The requirements set in theproposed by-law do not differ significantly from any of the existing six by-laws currentlyenforced in the City. However, how financial penalties are applied under each by-law doesdiffer significantly. In the Toronto Community Council Area (CCA), set fines are already in place for infractions. In the other CCAs, a Part III Summons is issued to the resident and a Justice of the Peace willdecide, in court, the amount of the fine. As well, the Scarborough and Etobicoke CCAs have theToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 157 ability under existing by-laws to recover costs for the municipal clean-up of improperly set out garbage by adding the costs directly onto the taxes of the property owner. In an attempt to harmonize the enforcement procedure and simplify the process for both the resident and enforcement staff, proposed set fines have been included as part of the proposedby-law. Currently, if a Part III Summons is issued, the resident is required to appear in court.However, the issuance of a ticket with a set fine does not require the resident to appear in court,unless they choose to oppose it. By-law enforcement focuses on the most serious infractions. To October 2000, 240 by-law infraction fines or clean-up orders were issued to both single family and multiple familyresidential properties, primarily for waste left at the curb for extended periods of time. Inaddition, 40 by-law infraction fines were issued to residents who had been identified as dumpingtheir waste on other properties. These offenders or locations represent less than one percent ofthe total single family and multiple family residential units the City provides service to. Based on current practices and depending on the severity of the infraction, education provided directly by staff usually removes the need for further warnings or tickets for the offence inquestion. For example, if a household exceeds the item limit, staff will visit the resident andexplain why we limit collection to a set number of items. In the majority of instances, residentsare content to comply. However, if a resident put out hazardous materials for collection, awarning with a requirement to remove them immediately would be issued. If necessary, a ticket and/or municipal clean-up order would be issued as soon as possible. Some Councillors have raised concerns about the proposed \"short form wording\" associated with the set fines. This wording was taken directly from the by-law and abbreviated in order toprovide a short and consolidated set of infractions that allows the issuance of tickets. In manycases, this wording does not fully describe the offence. However, the ticket does identify theSection of the by-law that has been contravened and can be referred to for clarification. In an attempt to facilitate the short form wording and provide a more concise list of infractions, staff have modified Section 19 of the proposed by-law to include the following two additionalsub-clauses: 19.1 No person shall:19.1(g) set out any waste for collection unless it is in appropriate Regulation Containers as specified in this By-law; 19.1(h) set out any waste in a Regulation Container that is not in good working order.These sub-clauses merge seven similar clauses that fall under different sections of the by-law. The creation of these sub-clauses has reduced the proposed short form wording to allow for morepractical enforcement. It is important to note that the inclusion of these two sub-clauses does notchange the scope or intent of the originally submitted by-law.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 158 Attachment 1 provides clarification of each of the proposed offences, in addition to revised set fines that more closely match the current set fines issued in the boundaries of the former City ofToronto. Set fines have remained at $105.00 in instances where the public or environment is atrisk or where maintaining a clean streetscape will be severely compromised. Set fines for lessserious infractions (i.e., failure to use Regulation Containers) have been lowered to $55.00.Attachment 2 provides the revised short wording, including any adjustments to individual setfines, and is intended to replace the original short form wording included with the proposedby-law that is presented in a separate Works Committee report on this agenda. Following approval by Council of the proposed by-law, the Legal Services Division is required to forward the short form wording to the Ministry of the Attorney General for approval.Changes may be made at this level. During the time the wording is with the Ministry,enforcement officers will continue to apply the existing financial penalties in each of theboundaries of the former municipalities for any serious contravention of the by-law. In addition to applying set fines to infractions, the City has the ability, through Section 326 of the Municipal Act, to clean-up the right of way abutting a residential property and recover thosecosts in a like manner as taxes. This policy was practised in the former cities of Scarboroughand Etobicoke and allows the City to add the cost of clean-up to individual property taxes. Inaddition to using this as a punitive measure, this ensures that the City recoups all costs for anyinspection and clean-up. This option is very important in cases where the resident has ignoredrepeated warnings, including fines, to clean up excess waste left at the curb for extended periods of time. In the case of a rented dwelling, the owner will ultimately be responsible for their tenants' actions. Previous practice has shown that this is a deterrent for those that abuse thecollection services and are in constant contravention of the by-law, in addition to ensuring thatoffensive material is removed from the street allowance. It is proposed that if the By-law Enforcement Officer inspects a site where a violation of the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law is observed and the material is deemed offensive tothe public or attractive to animals, then the officer will issue a notice to the location providing24 hours in which the property owner is to resolve the violation. If the violation still exists afterthe prescribed period of time, the City will collect the material and the property owner will becharged, in a like manner as taxes, the following: (a) $50.00 inspection fee; (b) $25.00 administration fee;(c) cost of collecting and disposing of the material based on the current hourly rate of the vehicle and staff; and (d) all appropriate taxes. Conclusions: As is evident by the amount and types of calls received by staff from residents due to the media coverage of the proposed harmonized Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law before theWorks Committee in July 2000, the majority of residents in the City are not aware that by-lawsgoverning the set out of material and enforcement procedures currently exist in each of theircommunities. As such, these residents have probably not contravened serious aspects of theirToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 159 community by-law. Therefore, the implementation of the harmonized set fines and clean-up orders in the proposed by-law will likely not create a significant rise in infractions, asenforcement activity will continue to focus only on the most serious infractions.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 160 Contact: Catharine Daniels Senior Analyst, Policy DevelopmentSolid Waste Management ServicesWorks and Emergency ServicesMetro Hall, 19 th Floor Phone: (416) 392-4632Fax: (416) 392-4754E-mail:daniels@city.toronto.on.caToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 161 Attachment 1 Clarification of Proposed Short Form Wording Proposed Short Form Wording (Section of By-law)Clarification and Typical Enforcement Trigger (1)Proposed Fine* 1 Setting out Prohibited Waste (for collection) (7.1)Prohibited waste may be hazardous to the public or the environment and is not eligible for municipal collection.

Financial Implications and Impact statement: It is projected that sales of tag for garbage items over the set out limit will generate as estimated $1.28 million in revenue per year, beginning in 2002. The four item set out limit recommendedfor 2003 is projected to increase waste diversion by 10,000 tonnes per year, representing anincrease in our residential waste diversion rate of 1 percent annually.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 167 Recommendations: It is recommended that: (1) Section 8.1 of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law be deleted and eplaced with the following Section 8.1: \"No owner who receives Curbside Collection shall set out for collection any combination of Garbage Containers and/or Bulky Items which exceeds six (6) in number\"; (2) residents be directed to continue to use the existing options available to them to deal with garbage in excess of the collection item limit; (3) effective January 1, 2002, residents receiving curbside waste collection who wish to have extra items collected may purchase tags from the City at a cost of $3.00 each, which mustbe affixed to each item in excess of the set out limit; (4) staff report back before the end of 2001 on the production, promotion and distribution of the special tags, including all associated costs; (5) an item limit per household and fee schedule be implemented as follows: (i) 2001 - No more than six (6) garbage items shall be collected weekly; (ii) January 1, 2002 - No more than five (5) garbage items shall be collected weekly unless tags, provided at a cost of $3.00 each, are affixed to each item above thelimit; (iii) January 1, 2003 - No more than four (4) garbage items shall be collected weekly unless tags, provided at a cost of $3.00 each, are affixed to each item above thelimit; (iv) beginning in 2001, grace periods will be provided whereby the item limit will be increased by 2 bags per household per week in the last two weeks of December ofeach year, in the week following the Thanksgiving long weekend and the weekfollowing the Victoria Day long weekend; and (v) item limits, cost of tags and provision of grace periods for 2004 and beyond will be reviewed in 2003; (6) staff be authorized to amend the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law to include the requirement to purchase tags for items over the set out limit and the item limitimplementation schedule; (7) staff review the charge of $3.00 per collection item following the first 12 months of implementation and from time to time following that, to determine the actual use of theToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 168 service and adjust the charge, up or down, with the approval of Council, to ensure that all associated costs related to the service are recovered; and (8) upon approval of the Solid Waste Collection By-law, clean-up orders will be issued at locations that choose not to use any of the approved options. Background: At its meeting of May 23, 2000, Scarborough Community Council requested the General Manager, Solid Waste Management Services, to submit a report for consideration at the July 18,2000 meeting, respecting a policy to accommodate exceptional circumstances, such as housecleaning or moving house situations, which may result in more than the maximum number ofitems being placed at the curb for collection. A preliminary report dated June 30, 2000, for theinformation of Community Council was provided. This report outlined options available thatwould create equity among residents and encourage reduction, reuse and recycling. Comments: Currently, each Community Council Area in the City of Toronto has a different collection item limit for household garbage, ranging from six containers per collection to an unlimited number.A collection item limit sets a reasonable level of service that is provided by the tax base andemphasizes that the collection service is not limitless. Based on field studies, the majority ofresidents strongly believe and actively practice the 3Rs and consistently put out less than three containers per week. These residents should not be penalized for their commitment by providing an unlimited service to residents who choose not to participate in the many diversion programsavailable to them, or who abuse the residential collection system by placing commercial orindustrial waste out for collection. The proposed by-law, presented in a separate Works Committee report on this agenda, contains a provision for the municipal collection of a maximum of six regulation containers each collectionday. In an effort to facilitate the reduction of reusable items placed at the curb for collection,staff are recommending that Section 8.1 that deals with the collection item limit be changedfrom: 8.1 \"No owner of a household residence shall set out more than 6 Garbage Containers for collection\". to 8.1 \"No owner who receives Curbside Collection shall set out for collection any combination of Garbage Containers and/or Bulky Items which exceeds 6 in number\". It is expected that this change will encourage residents to increase waste diversion activity without requiring major behaviour change. There have been concerns raised that residents will generate garbage above the six item limit during move outs/move ins or spring/fall clean-ups. Existing options, in addition to proposedoptions for residents who have additional household garbage, are discussed below.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 169Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 170 I. Existing Options: (a) Storage of Additional Garbage: Historical trends show that the heaviest months for residential garbage set out are in the spring and in the fall. During these periods, increased amounts of garbage are put out forcollection due to additional cleaning undertaken by residents. To avoid exceeding theitem limit, residents can choose to store their garbage over a number of collection daysand put out the maximum each week until their spring cleaning or moving waste is gone. (b) Reuse Options: Residents should be encouraged to arrange for the reuse of any appropriate item, either by donation to a non-profit organization or through consignment, garage sales, etc. Thereuse of appropriate items is of particular importance with the impending closure of theKeele Valley Landfill Site. At that point in time, disposal costs will increase significantlyand residents moving or doing special clean-ups should be strongly encouraged to reuseor recycle all appropriate items. (c) One Tonne Disposal Exemption: The City has in place an annual one tonne waste disposal exemption to assist residents with renovation waste and illegally dumped material that is not collected as part of the regular curbside collection program. In 1999, residents brought 4,974 loads of waste,amounting to approximately 1,650 tonnes, to City transfer stations. In an effort to furtheraccommodate the proposed collection item limit, staff have expanded the scope of thisservice to include housecleaning and moving waste. This option encourages residents to apply, through Solid Waste Management Services, for an annual disposal exemption when their waste exceeds the collection limits.Following approval of their application, residents have the opportunity to dispose of theirhousecleaning or moving waste, free of charge, at any City transfer station and at anytime during the year, up to the one tonne limit. (d) Collection and Disposal of the Additional Items by the Private Sector: There are many private companies and/or handy persons who advertise their disposal services across the City. These services include the clean-up and/or disposal of springcleaning or moving waste for a fee. Residents may choose this option in addition to, or inlieu of, the options presented in this report. II. Additional Recommended Options:(a) Increasing the Item Limit During Peak Seasons: Staff, in the past, have not encouraged or promoted the waiving of the item limit due to: (a) the anticipated abuse of the collection service; and (b) the fact that existing staff andToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 171 resources would be unable to accommodate the influx of the garbage, particularly during the peak generation periods. This would result in increased labour costs and significantlydelayed collections. In addition, the daily planning of staff and fleet requirements wouldbe problematic due to the extreme fluctuations of increased waste. By maintaining a setcollection item limit, the solid waste collection operation has been able to planappropriately and maintain a consistent level of service to all residents. Waiving the item limit does not encourage the 3Rs, encourages abuse of the service and increases the costs of the collection program in an effort to service a small portion ofresidents. However, staff are aware of increases in residential garbage generation during the spring, fall and during the holiday season. It is proposed that the item limit be increased bytwo items during the week following the Victoria Day weekend, during the weekfollowing the Thanksgiving weekend and during the last two weeks in December. Thesethree grace periods will provide residents with four collections whereby they can placetwo additional items out for collection without being required to use the alternativeoptions provided in Section I. Setting defined grace periods will allow staff toappropriately plan for increases in the tonnages collected, will continue to encouragewaste reduction and recycling and will discourage abuse. (b) Collection of Extra Items for a Service Fee: Section 208.6 of The Municipal Act allows a municipality, through the use of a by-law, to establish fees for the use of any part of a waste management system and/or toencourage the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste. As stated previously, waiving the item limit will significantly strain our resources and encourage abuse. However, staff are aware that residents may occasionally generateitems in excess of the limit and choose not to use the existing options available to them.It is proposed that the City provide additional collection services for this excess garbage,whereby the resident would purchase special tags that would have to be placed on theadditional items requiring collection. This service fee system will discourage residentsfrom abusing the collection service, provide an equitable base level of service to allresidents and provide a curbside collection option in addition to the existing optionsavailable. It is expected that the financial charge associated with extra items will encourage residents to review their consumption and disposal habits. It is also important to note thatwith the inclusion of polycoat cartons, aerosol cans and empty paint cans in the blue boxprogram as of March 2001, the volume of garbage generated by residents should decreaseif they are participating fully in the City's recycling program, as well as taking advantageof subsidized composters and utilizing the services of many reuse agencies. Experience from other jurisdictions shows that aggressive bag limits coupled with service fees above the bag limit result in a reduction in garbage generated and an increase inrecycling activity. The City of Barrie (two free collection item limit) and the City ofToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 172 Orillia (40 free tags per year) experienced decreases of up to 39 percent in the amount of waste going to landfill and increases of up to 34 percent in recycling rates. A sixcollection item limit will not have the same impact but will send a message to residentsthat the disposal of excessive amounts of waste must be paid directly by the generator. Asummary of experiences of other municipalities that have implemented bag limits and/orservice fees is included in Attachment A. Table 1 shows a breakdown of the estimated costs of providing the garbage collection and disposal service and the proposed cost to the resident. Table 1 - Summary of Proposed Cost per Additional Container Type of Cost Incurred Estimated CostEstimated Cost/ItemComments Collection $66.78/tonne $ 1.34 Based on 20 kgs per container Transfer $10.00/tonne $ 0.20 Based on 20 kgs per container Disposal $50.75/tonne $ 1.02 Based on 20 kgs per container Administration and Distribution$180,000/year $ 0.36 Assumes the sale of 500,000 tags annually* Annual Promotion $15,000.00/year $ 0.03 Assumes the sale of 500,000 tags annually* Cost per Tag $0.06 each $ 0.05 Total Estimated Costper AdditionalContainer- $ 3.00 - * Assumes each single family residential location will require one tag per year. Based on the breakdown of the actual costs to collect additional items above the limit, it is recommended that residents who need to set out items above the limit purchase tagsfrom the City for $3.00 each and affix one to each additional item they wish to havecollected. Tags will be available for purchase at Civic Centres and other City locations. Due to the time required to establish the tag system, it is proposed that this option be made available, in conjunction with the existing options, beginning January 1, 2002.Residents should be encouraged to use all existing options until the tag system isavailable. Although illegal dumping is always a concern when garbage service fees are introduced, most communities that have implemented such a program have noticed very littleincrease in this activity. In addition to the City providing a substantial service with thecollection of six collection items free of charge, the inclusion of polycoat containers,paint cans and aerosol containers in the blue box will minimize residual waste further. Itis anticipated that a fee for additional garbage will not affect the current potential forillegal dumping.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 173 In an effort to continue to encourage waste reduction and recycling, it is recommended that the item limit be lowered gradually over time. As such, the following is the proposedimplementation schedule for setting item limits in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Date Proposed Policy 2001 Garbage item limit set at 6 per household per collection with 3 grace periods per year. Residents be encouraged to use existing options for disposal ofitems in excess of 6. Clean-up orders may be issued for continued by-lawinfractions. January 1, 2002Garbage item limit set at 5 per household per collection with 3 grace periods per year. Residents may use existing options or affix tags, provided at a costof $3.00 each, to any item above 5. Clean-up orders may be issued forcontinued by-law infractions. January 1, 2003Garbage item limit set at 4 per household per collection with 3 grace periods per year. Residents may use existing options or affix tags, provided at a costof $3.00 each, to any item above 4. Clean-up orders may be issued forcontinued by-law infractions. (c) Clean-Up Orders Under the By-law: Staff are aware of the potential abuse of the item limit resulting from residents choosing to place unlimited amounts of garbage at the curb without purchasing appropriate tags.The Municipal Act allows the City, through the proposed Solid Waste Collection By-law,to issue clean-up orders for materials placed out inappropriately. Following writtennotices requesting the property owner or tenant to clean up the boulevard, the cost of anyCity clean-up as a result of abuse or contravention of the by-law is charged directly to thetaxes of the owner of the property. In most cases, the cost of the clean-up will exceed thecost of tags. As a result, there will be a financial incentive to the resident to utilizeexisting options or purchase tags rather than having a clean-up order issued against theirproperty. It is extremely important to note that, in an attempt to keep our neighbourhoods clean, the City must use a financial incentive to discourage residents from abusing the system.Currently, both the Scarborough and Etobicoke Community Council Areas issue clean-uporders following multiple warnings and charge it directly to the property taxes. Conclusions: With the impending closure of the Keele Valley Landfill Site, and the resulting media attention associated with the City's new disposal contract, residents are very conscious of the need toreduce, reuse and recycle. Placing a reasonable limit on the number of items a household mayplace out for municipal collection will encourage waste diversion activity. This reportrecommends the item limit be set at six per household per week in 2001 and reduced to five in2002 and four in 2003, and that three grace periods be established in the spring, fall and atyear-end to accommodate extra items. For disposal of items over the limit, households mayutilize the one tonne exemption policy at the City's transfer stations, procure the services of theToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 174 private sector for the removal and disposal of excess garbage or, starting in January 2002, purchase tags from the City for $3.00 and affix to them all items placed out for municipalcollection that are over the item limit.Contact: Catharine DanielsSenior Analyst, Policy DevelopmentSolid Waste Management ServicesWorks and Emergency ServicesMetro Hall, 19 th Floor Phone: (416) 392-4632Fax: (416) 392-4754E-mail:daniels@city.toronto.on.ca Attachment A Other Municipal Experience with Service Fees and Item Limits Municipality Current \"Free\" Container LimitCharge for Additional Containers Above the LimitComments Vancouver, BC 2 $1.50 or $145/year subscriptionfor 2 additionalcontainers and anadditional blue box Victoria, BC 1 $3.00 Los Angeles, CA 60 gallons US $5.00/month for each additional 30 gallons Philadelphia, PN 4 containers Private collection required Nanaimo, BC 1 container $2.00 St. Louis, MS N/A US $15.00 per cubic yard of clean-up/movinggarbage Austin, TX Fee for all supplied cartsUS $2.00 for bags not fitting in the carts Hamilton, ON 4 $1.00 (proposed) Anticipated to go to Council for approvalin January 2002 Langley, BC 2 $1.10 Orillia, ON 40 free tags/year $1.50 Town of Markham 3 Tags are free of charge but must be picked up ata central location City of Barrie 2 $1.00 Region of Peel 3 Tags free of charge but Anticipated to go toToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 175 Municipality Current \"Free\" Container LimitCharge for Additional Containers Above the LimitComments must be picked up at a central location(proposed)Council for approval in January 2002 Seattle, WA None Monthly fees for carts The Works Committee also submits the following report (January 23, 2001) from theCommissioner of Works and Emergency Services, entitled \"Mandatory Recycling atExisting Multiple Household Residential Locations where the City Provides CollectionServices\": Purpose: To highlight Section 2.3 of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law that will make recycling mandatory at all existing and new multiple household residential locations wherethe City provides collection services. This will assist the City in achieving its diversion targets. Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report.Recommendation: It is recommended that this report be received for information.Background: At its meeting held on October 3, 4 and 5, 2000, and its Special Meetings held on October 6, 2000, October 10 and 11, 2000, and October 12, 2000, Council requested the Commissioner ofWorks and Emergency Services to submit a report to the Works Committee on \"a by-law formandatory recycling for existing apartment buildings\". Comments: Section 2.3 of the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, presented in a separate Works Committee report on this agenda, deals with the ability of the City to withdraw wastemanagement services from any multiple household residence which does not participate fully inthe City's recycling program: \"2.3 The Commissioner may determine that Owners who do not participate fully in the City's collection of Recyclable Materials or who sell or otherwise transfer Recyclable Materialsto persons other than the City are not eligible to receive any Services.\" The purpose of this clause is two fold: (a) to encourage non-participating locations to participate in the City's recycling program; and (b) to encourage locations which consistently put outToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 176 contaminated materials for collection, to remove all contaminants prior to collection. The anticipated results will include an increase in multiple household recycling rates and an increasein revenues due to the additional materials generated combined with the absence ofcontaminants. This clause is currently enforced under existing by-laws in Scarborough and Etobicoke. Generally, existing multiple household residential locations that are informed of this provisionhave chosen to participate in the City's recycling program. Conclusions: In an attempt to improve diversion rates among multiple household residential locations, staff have included a mandatory recycling clause for all existing and new locations.

I would request that you consider some amendments to programs that are being proposed that affect residents of my ward. I would ask that you consider incorporating some changes that will save me having to hold these items at Council. Proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law Should you choose to adopt this by-law I would suggest some modifications. Item 3(C) sets out options for household waste containers above the collection limit. In clause (iv) there areincreased limits proposed for the last two weeks in December of each year, in the weekfollowing the Thanksgiving long weekend and the week following the Victoria Day longweekend. The reasons are obvious. I would ask that you add \"and in the two weeks duringPassover in designated areas of the City.\" Prior to Passover, Orthodox Jewish households rid thehouse of non-Passover foods. The specific designated areas of the City can be worked out withthe Commissioner on an individual ward basis.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 177 I would also suggest that you add a further amendment \"and the week following Ramadan in designated areas of the City.\"Councillor Sandra Bussin, Ward 32 - Beaches-East York, appeared before the Works Committeein connection with the foregoing matter. (City Council on March 6, 7 and 8, 2001, had before it, during consideration of the foregoing Clause, a communication (February 7, 2001) from Ms. Ann M. Nutter, expressing her concernswith respect to the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law.) (City Council at its regular meeting held on April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and its special meeting held on April 30, May 1 and 2, 2001, had before it, during consideration of the foregoing Clause, thefollowing communication (March 28, 2001) from the City Clerk: Recommendations: The Works Committee:(1) recommends the adoption of Recommendation No. (2) embodied in the report dated March 12, 2001, from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services entitled\"Improving Waste Diversion in Apartments\", viz: \"that section 2.3 of the Proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law be amended to include a requirement that apartment building owners post signs withspecific recycling instructions in various designated locations of their building\";and (2) reports, for the information of Council, having directed that the report dated March 15, 2001, from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services entitled \"Approved BagLimit Program in the Region of Peel\", be forwarded to Council for consideration withthe Proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law. The Works Committee further reports having:(1) requested the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services to: (i) review the success of the Onandoga County Program and its implications for Toronto's waste diversion efforts; (ii) review the recycling pilot project at 35 Shoreham Drive, North York, and report back on its findings to the Committee; and (iii) report to the Waste Diversion Task Force 2010 on the resources required to undertake a waste audit of all apartments; and (2) referred the communication (March 27, 2001) from the Greater Toronto Apartment Association to the Waste Diversion Task Force 2010.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 178Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 179 Background: The Works Committee at its meeting on March 28, 2001 had before it a report (March 12, 2001) from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services, entitled \"Improving Waste Diversionin Apartments\", providing an update on the results of a pilot project that tested methods ofincreasing participation in two apartment dwellings in the Etobicoke Community Council area;and recommending that: (1) this report be forwarded to the April 24, 25 and 26, 2001 Council meeting to be considered at the same time as the report entitled \"Proposed Residential Solid WasteCollection By-law\"; and (2) by the approval of this report, section 2.3 of the Proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law be amended to include a requirement that apartment building ownerspost signs with specific recycling instructions in various designated locations of theirbuilding. The Committee also had before it a report (March 15, 2001) from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services, entitled \"Approved Bag Limit Program in the Region of Peel\",providing an overview of the phased-in three waste bag/container limit and user fee programapproved by the Region of Peel; advising that the three-bag limit will come into effect on June 1,2001, and will be voluntary for all residents until February 2002, when staff will enforce the bag limit and any extra bags will require an appropriate tag; noting that as the Region of Peel has begun an aggressive campaign to reduce waste, the City may wish, as its neighbour, to review itsopportunities to reduce waste with an item limit below the current proposed limit of six; andrecommending that this report be received for information. The Committee also had before it a communication (March 27, 2001) from Mr. Brad Butt, Executive Director, Greater Toronto Apartment Association, expressing interest in initiatives toincrease waste diversion in high-rise multi-family buildings.) (Report dated March 12, 2001, entitled \"Improving Waste Diversion in Apartments\", from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services) Purpose: The purpose of this report is to identify means of increasing recycling in apartments, and to provide an update on the results of a pilot project that tested methods of increasing participationin two apartment dwellings in the Etobicoke Community Council Area. Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications resulting from the report.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 180 Recommendations: It is recommended that: (1) this report be forwarded to the April 24, 25 and 26, 2001 Council meeting to be considered at the same time as the report entitled \"Proposed Residential Solid WasteCollection By-law\"; and (2) by the approval of this report, section 2.3 of the Proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law be amended to include a requirement that apartment building ownerspost signs with specific recycling instructions in various designated locations of theirbuilding. Background: At its meeting of February 7, 2001, the Works Committee requested the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services to \"submit a report to the Works Committee on means of encouragingsource separation in each multi-unit residential building.\" Previously, at its meeting ofSeptember 13, 2000, the Works Committee directed the Commissioner of Works and EmergencyServices to report on \"the implementation of a grant program for source separation devices forapartment buildings, for the 2001 budget, in the context of the pilot project\" and \"the request byMs. Chung in her deputation with respect to taking buildings off the grid.\" Comments: In an attempt to increase recovery of recyclable materials in apartments, a pilot project involving two buildings in the Etobicoke community was conducted in 1999/2000. The projectwas sponsored by the Ontario Waste Diversion Organization, the Canadian Soft DrinkAssociation, and the Clorox Company of Canada. The purpose of the project was to investigatewhether residents would find it easier and more convenient to use plastic bags to store anddeposit their recyclables and thus increase participation rates. Existing apartment recyclingprograms require residents to separate recyclables into two separate streams (fibre andcontainer materials) and place them into separate recycling bins or carts without plastic bags.Garbage is generally taken to a garbage room on each floor and put down a chute. The two buildings participating in the pilot were of similar size and demographics. The bag- based recycling pilot project started the week of November 22, 1999, and finished at the end ofMay 2000. The residents of one of the buildings, 2 Triburnham Place, were provided with athree-month supply of blue, see-through recycling bags and were instructed to mix all theirrecyclable containers and fibre together in the bag and then put the bag down the garbage chute.Material sent down the chute system was taken to a special facility to separate the recyclables inblue bags from the rest of the garbage. Residents were told that in order to continue toparticipate in the recycling program once their supply of bags ran out, they would be required topurchase additional bags which were made available at three small retailers located in closeproximity to the building. Residents of this building received intensive, personal door-to-doorcommunication about how to participate in the project. It was thought that allowing residents tocommingle fibre and container materials together in plastic bags and allowing them to depositToronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 181 recyclables down the chute would maximize the convenience of recycling and thereby would increase the participation and recycling rate. Residents in the second building, located at 210 Markland Drive, were informed that they could use any plastic bag (i.e., grocery bags) to mix all their recyclable containers and fibre together.They were still required to bring their recyclables down to the central recycling bin; however,they were allowed to place the bagged recyclables into one bin instead of being required toseparate into a paper and container stream as is currently required. The building's recyclingcarts were replaced with larger bulk lift containers. Residents of this building received aminimal level of written communication materials without the personal door-to-doorcommunication. The results of the pilot were somewhat surprising. The overall diversion rate at 2 Triburnham Place, which had received a high level of intensive communication, along with the maximumconvenience of being able to put their recyclables in special bags down the chute with theirregular garbage, saw a decrease of seven percent. The building at 210 Markland Drive whichhad received minimal communication and where residents were allowed to commingle their fibreand container materials using their choice of bags, while still having to bring their materialsdown to a central container, saw an increase to their overall diversion rate of 30.8 percent. The results of the project at 2 Triburnham along with the survey responses indicate that the residents rejected the idea of purchasing bags to be able to recycle. The results of the project at 210 Markland are encouraging. Allowing residents to commingle materials and use bags of their choice appears to have had a positive effect. Another finding was that adding recyclingcapacity by increasing the size of the recycling containers also boosted recovery. The positiveresults at 210 Markland were achieved with minimal communication and education support. More detailed findings are available in the full report written by Enviros RIS and McConnell Weaver. The executive summary is attached to this report.

Recovery rates in apartments can also potentially be increased by making the system more convenient, without the use of bags, for example retrofitting an apartment building with anautomated chute system on each floor as opposed to requiring individuals to bring all theirrecyclables to bins located outside or in the basement. Subject to budget approval, an apartmentpilot will be conducted in three multi-unit residential high-rise buildings to test the feasibility ofan automated chute system in two buildings and a \"designated day\" system in another building. The \"designated day\" system would test the impact on recycling of allowing residents to deposit down the chute, fibre and container materials on designated days and garbage the remainder ofthe time. For example: garbage on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays,container materials on Mondays, and fibre materials on Thursdays. The automated chute project will test the impact on recycling levels by giving residents the convenience of depositing garbage, recyclable materials and organic materials down thebuilding's chute at any time.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 182 With respect to a grant program for source separation devices for apartment buildings, such as the automated chute systems, we recommend that such a program not be initiated at this timedue to budget constraints. The cost of an automated chute system is approximately $40,000 perbuilding, and grants of any significant amount made available to all apartment owners wouldimpact our budget. Promotion and public education is also an effective tool to increase recovery rates in apartment buildings. Currently, we produce special promotional materials for apartment buildings such as\"We Recycle\" reminder cards, stickers for the recycling bins, and posters. \"Waste Watch\" isdelivered to apartment buildings twice a year; however, it is not delivered directly to individualapartment units. In order to improve communication efforts to apartments, we are planning,subject to budget approval, on hiring casual staff in 2001 for outreach to targeted buildings, toreview recycling performance, meet with building superintendents, distribute communicationmaterials, install improved signage, and recommend system improvements. Building management co-operation is critical to the success of existing programs and the implementation of programs in apartments not currently serviced by Blue Box collection.Findings from a previous pilot project undertaken by the Works Department show thatapartment buildings that achieved diversion rates of 20 percent or more had co-operativebuilding managers and/or superintendents and residents who owned or shared ownership suchas in condominiums and housing co-ops (i.e., residents were longer term dwellers). In many cases, the buildings' residents are keen to recycle, but run into a barrier with an unwilling building superintendent. A mandatory recycling by-law would act as an incentive forbuilding managers who were previously reluctant to implement recycling programs. At itsmeeting on February 7, 2001, the Works Committee approved the Residential Solid WasteCollection By-law, which includes mandatory recycling. The by-law will be going to Council forfinal approval on April 24, 25, and 26, 2001. If passed, it will allow the City to increaseparticipation rates, particularly in the multi-family household residential sector. Provincial 3Rsregulations require owners of apartment buildings with more than six units to provide recyclingservices; however, these regulations are not enforced. We have also investigated New York City's \"Superintendent's Recycling Handbook\" as suggested by the Works Committee. The Handbook\" is distributed to assist buildings in settingup and maintaining recycling programs. The estimated cost to develop and produce a similarhandbook for Toronto would be $10,000, which has not been budgeted for. Not only is recycling mandatory in New York, it is also mandatory for the building's owner/landlord to post signs with specific recycling instructions in various designated locationswithin the building. The Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law, within which Section 2.3includes mandatory recycling, is before Council at its meeting in April. By way of this report, itis requested that the Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law be amended to include arequirement that signs be posted in each building listing the materials accepted in the recyclingprogram, and providing instructions on how to prepare the materials and where to place themfor collection.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 183 In addition to adding convenience and increasing communications, another element in increasing waste diversion from apartments is mixed waste processing. The Mixed WasteRecycling and Organics Processing Facility at Dufferin Transfer Station will test mixed wasteprocessing with feedstock from apartment buildings. The test will occur in conjunction with theexisting Blue Box program. The mixed waste will be made up of items that end up in the garbageafter recycling, including organic waste and recyclable material that is not put into the BlueBox. Consequently, added diversion will be achieved by capturing the organic material andsome of the remaining Blue Box material. With respect to taking apartment buildings off the grid, we feel that the City's proposed new garbage by-law which recommends that multi-unit residential buildings with City garbagecollection be required to operate a recycling program is preferable to discontinuing wastecollection from all apartment buildings. Should a property owner or manager not implement asuitable recycling program, the by-law would give staff the authority to discontinue wastecollection from that building. Conclusions: The results of the bag based pilot project were surprising and unexpected. It was anticipated that 2 Triburnham with its program of maximum convenience and maximum communicationswould see an increase in the diversion rate instead of a decrease. The results show that theresidents were resistant to purchasing bags for recycling, being accustomed as they are to reusing their grocery bags for garbage at no additional cost. The results from 210 Markland show that by allowing residents to commingle fibre and container materials into one stream, to use whatever bag they wish and increasing the recyclingcontainer capacity may boost recovery. These improvements did not require intensivecommunication and were available with a simple cost-effective education program. Thus, theresults indicate that we should investigate the possible benefits of a single stream, fullycommingled recycling program for apartment buildings and the associated processingimplications. Subject to budget approval, we will also be testing automated chute and \"designated day\" recycling systems. However, due to budget constraints we recommend against a grant programfor source separation devices for apartment buildings. Promotion and education is also effective in increasing recovery rates, and we are planning to hire casual staff to undertake outreach to targeted buildings, subject to budget approval. A regulation such as mandatory recycling is also critical to successful implementation of recycling in all apartment buildings. Making the posting of promotional communicationmaterials in designated areas in apartment buildings mandatory is also an option, as seen in theNew York \"Superintendent's Recycling Handbook.\" Additionally, mixed waste processing will be tested as a method to increase waste diversion from apartment buildings, once the Mixed Waste Recycling and Organics Processing Facility isoperational at our Dufferin Transfer Station.Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 184Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 185 Contact: Renee Dello Coordinator, Waste Diversion PlanningSolid Waste Management ServicesMetro HallPhone: (416) 392-5806Fax: (416) 392-4754E-mail: rdello@city.toronto.on.ca) (A copy of the Executive Summary referred to in the foregoing report has been forwarded to all Members of Council with the agenda for the Works Committee meeting of March 28, 2001, and acopy thereof is on file in the office of the City Clerk.) (Report dated March 15, 2001, entitled \"Approved Bag Limit in the Region of Peel\" from the Commissioner of Works and Emergency Services) Purpose: To provide the Works Committee and Council with an overview of the three-phase bag limit program in the Region of Peel. Financial Implications and Impact Statement: There are no financial implications as a result of this report. Recommendation: It is recommended that this report be received for information.Background: At its February 7, 2001 meeting, the Works Committee had before it the proposed Residential Solid Waste Collection By-law that included a six waste item limit clause for residences thatreceive collection at the curb. There has been some debate over the item limit and user fees inthe City of Toronto and whether residents would be able to accommodate a lower limit. Staff feltit prudent to provide the Committee and Council with bag limit and user fee developments insurrounding communities. Comments: The Council of the Region of Peel, at its March 8, 2001 meeting, approved a phased-in three waste bag/container limit and user fee program. The bag limit and user fee program will beimplemented in three phases to allow residents the opportunity to familiarize themselves with theprogram. The following is a summary of the 3 phases:Toronto City Council Works Committee April 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and May 1 and 2, 2001 Report No. 4, Clause No. 186 Phase 1 (June 1, 2001 - February 1, 2002): The three-bag limit will come into effect on June 1, 2001 and will be voluntary for all residents in the Region. Additional bags will be collected during this period. However, an intensivecommunications and education program outlining the phased-in program will be held duringthis period. Phase 2 (February 2, 2002 - September 1, 2002):Staff will enforce the bag limit during this period, and in order to receive collection, any extra bags will require an appropriate tag. These tags will be made available at all municipalfacilities at no cost. Regional staff believe that the inconvenience of having to travel significantdistances to get free tags will be incentive for residents to reduce their waste. The Town ofMarkham currently has this type of program in place. Phase 3 (September 1, 2002):Beginning September 1, 2002, tags will be made available at retail outlets throughout the Region at a cost of approximately $1.00 each. All untagged bags above the limit will not be collected.The $1.00 charge is not based on full cost recovery. It is important to note that the Region of Peel three-bag limit will only deal with waste in bags or containers. The City of Toronto six-item limit encompasses both waste in bags/containers butalso bulky items (mattresses, sofas, chairs, etc.). However, bulky items make up a negligibleamount of the tonnages collected at curbside in the City. That, combined with an average wastebag/container set out rate of 2.86 items weekly, would not result in the majority of residentsputting out more than three-four items weekly. In addition, residents should be encouraged toutilize reuse options for bulky items in good condition. Conclusions: The Region of Peel has begun an aggressive campaign to reduce waste, and as its neighbour, the City may wish to review its opportunities to reduce waste with an item limit below the currentproposed limit of six.
