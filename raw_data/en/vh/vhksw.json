THE MEANING OF THE NAME 120 WELLNESS Many people ask me about the meaning of my business name. As a Biblical Health Coach and Energy Kinesiologist, It's all about the scriptures for me. The number 120 in the Bible is pretty significant. It's known throughout scripture as meaning a divine appointment. So I consider our sessions together \"Divine Appointments.\" Here are some examples of the number 120 in the Bible: 120 disciples where present when the Holy Spirit came to the Upper Room. Acts: 1:15 120 disciples choose Mathias, the new Apostle to replace Judas after Jesus' ascension. So it symbolizes unity and authority. Moses was 120 years old when God revealed to him that Joshua would be leading the Nation of Israel into the promise land, meaning freedom and deliverance. Duet: 31:2 In the book of Ezra there were 120 Sanhedrin established in every city (government officials) so its symbolizes order Also in the book of Ezra, 120 Jewish Men were gathered together to restore and gather together all the scriptures and scrolls. So it is associated with the divine word of God. 120 priests were chosen to do the rituals in the Holy Temple and care of the Ark of the Covenant, representing Holiness. 2 Chron: 5:12 The 12 tribes of Judah and the 12,000 mentioned in revelation represents salvation. The most famous reference to Genesis 6:3. says, God gave man 120 years to change their ways before the flood came. It was a warning of the disaster to come from the enemies plans. This scripture is God giving an opportunity for repentance and a time of deliverance allowing man to be rescued from the demonic tragedy to come so it symbolizes deliverance. 120 Wellness is a place to find freedom and salvation. It's a place of God's deliverance and healing. We help you let go of the past, release trapped emotions and re-establish or strengthen your relationship with Almighty God preventing the flood waters from drowning you in your own circumstance or health concern.
