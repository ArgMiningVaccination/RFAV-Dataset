However, there are numerous treatment parameters that are not conducive to clinical translation applications. This study aims to summarize the stimulation parameters commonly used in electroacupuncture treating cancer pain by data mining and visualization techniques to provide a basis for the future acupuncture technology transformation and selection of optimal stimulation parameters\u0000 Methods: Nine databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, OVID, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, China Biology Medicine disc, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wanfang Database, were searched for clinical studies on electroacupuncture treatment cancer pain published between January 2012 and September 2022. A database was established using Microsoft Excel 2020 and analyzed with SPSS Modeler 18.1 software and SPSS statistics 26.0 software. Results: Twenty-four articles were included according to the established criteria. The most used electroacupuncture stimulation parameters were a dilatational wave, the current frequency of 2/100 Hz, stimulation duration of 30 min per treatment, and frequency of treatment once a day. Fifty-eight acupoints were mentioned, and the total frequency of acupoints involved was 156 times. The most used those most generally used acupoints that are closely arranged on the Stomach Channel of Foot Yangming and the Spleen Channel of Foot Taiyin. The association analysis of acupoints revealed that the most supported acupoint pair was Sanyinjiao (SP06) and Zusanli (ST36). Cluster analysis demonstrated three groups, one for obligatory acupoints, one for Ashi point, and the third for Jiaji point. Conclusions A dilatational wave, the current frequency of 2/100 Hz, 30-min stimulation, and acupoints of the Stomach Channel of Foot Yangming and the Spleen Channel of Foot Taiyin selection are frequently used in electroacupuncture for treating cancer pain. Due to the limitations of this study, further research and more standardized, multi-center, large-sample clinical trials can be carried out to guide optimizing acupuncture treatment schemes and promote the formation of TCM-characteristic technologies for cancer pain. Introduction Pain is one of the most common, disabling, and frightening symptom of patients with cancer, with an incidence rate close to 70%(1, 2). Pain management is one of the key parts of comprehensive therapy forPage 3/19cancer as it affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients(3). Modern medicine adopts \"three-step\" analgesic drug therapy to treat cancer-related pain(4). However, due to its inevitable adverse effects and potential to promote tumor growth, as well as the subjective resistance of patients to analgesics, the use of conventional analgesics is limited. For these reasons, it is desirable to develop complementary and alternative methods with increased e\u0000cacy and safety for relieving cancer pain. Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is important in treating cancer pain(5). In TCM theory, cancer pain refers to \"Pain Syndrome,\" and the major etiology and pathogenesis are caused by two factors: one is the cold evil that stagnates qi and blood, blocking the channel circulation; the other is the de\u0000ciency of qi and blood and the loss of channel nourishment. Acupuncture can unblock the channel and relieve pain. Studies have depicted that acupuncture can relieve cancer pain and reduce the dose and side effects of analgesics(2, 6). Moreover, acupuncture is more accepted by patients, which improves their compliance(7). Electroacupuncture (EA) is a modi\u0000ed method of traditional acupuncture, combining needles and electrical stimulation(8). EA has the characteristics of precise stimulation amount, simple operation, standardized treatment, improved e\u0000cacy, and labor cost saving. EA can also improve the pain threshold of patients and reduce their sensitivity(9). Wita Saraswati et al.(10) found that medical therapy combined with EA decreased the pain scale, increased plasma -endorphin levels, and improved the QoL of patients with stage III cervical cancer. Therefore, it is signi\u0000cant to actively explore treating cancer pain with EA. EA has the characteristic of parameter objecti\u0000cation. However, in clinical applications, there are many EA parameters to choose from in treating cancer pain, lack of uniform speci\u0000cation, and few relevant studies. Therefore, we evaluated the literature of the last decade to analyze the EA stimulation parameters by data mining and co-occurrence analysis techniques to provide evidence for the optimal parameter selection for EA treatment of cancer pain. Methods Retrieval strategy We searched nine databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, OVID, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, China Biology Medicine disc, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wanfang Database from January 2012 to September 2022. Search keywords were as follows and modi\u0000ed Pain.\" Further relevant studies were manually searched. There was no language limitation. Inclusion CriteriaPage 4/19(1) Randomized controlled trials regarding patients with pathologically or cytologically diagnosed with malignant tumors, with pain caused by tumor factors and not related to treatment modalities such as radiotherapy or surgery. (2) Studies that apply EA as the major intervention or with additive treatments. (3) EA has de\u0000nite e\u0000cacy in treating cancer pain. (4) Clinical trials on EA treatment with explicitly selected points and parameters. (5) Studies with the same data and results were regarded as one article. Exclusion Criteria (1) Pain caused by non-tumor factors. (2) Nonclinical studies such as animal experiments, reviews, meta-analyses, or erratum. (3) Studies that do not apply EA as the major intervention. (4) Studies that do not list any parameters observed in this study or only describe the general information without any detail. (5) Studies for which the full text is not available. Literature quality management Three levels of quality control were strictly used for literature management. First, all the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were screened by two independent reviewers (QY Li and WX Yang), and those which did not meet the criteria were excluded according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The second screening was performed by reading the full text of the remaining articles, mainly for the clearly stated parameters (i.e., current frequency, wave, and stimulation duration) and statistical signi\u0000cance of the difference in e\u0000cacy between the treatment and control groups. Finally, two researchers (LJ Jiao and H Liu) were responsible for the complete examination and data extraction with a prede\u0000ned form. Any disagreement in the process was resolved by discussion between the two reviewers or after consultation with a third reviewer (J Shi). Data Extraction Microsoft Excel 2020 was used to establish the database. Eight items, including the title, the name of the authors, year of publication, stimulation duration, current frequency, wave, frequency of treatment, and acupoints selection, were recorded in the database. After entering the data, proofreading was carried out to ensure the accuracy of the data.Page 5/19Data analysis Excel was used for the descriptive statistics of the stimulation time, current frequency, waveform frequency, and treatment frequency of EA acupoint frequency and channels in the included literature. SPSS Modeler 18.0 was used to perform the association analysis for EA parameters and acupoints and analyze their correlation. SPSS statistics 26.0 was used to perform the cluster analysis of acupoints. Results Retrieval of studies A total of 1992 articles were found in the nine databases and then imported into NoteExpress Version 3.6.0 for selection. Among these, 411 were removed for duplicates. Then 1488 articles were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts; 93 articles were eliminated through full-text assessment. Finally, 24 articles were included for further analysis. The exclusion criteria and selection \u0000ow are displayed in Fig. 1. Frequency Of Treatment Four frequencies of treatment were mentioned in the 24 studies. The top three were: once a day (66.67%), once every other day (16.67%), once a week (8.33%), twice a week (8.33%)as illustrated in Table 1. Table 1 Frequency of treatment.

A total of 8 association rules were obtained with the Apriori algorithm, as illustrated in Table 8. The visualization result is displayed in Fig. 3. The results indicated that Sanyinjiao (SP06) and Zusanli (ST36) had the strongest 80 3.05 Cluster Analysis Of Acupoints A cluster analysis was performed on acupoints used at least \u0000ve times. Three categories of effective clusters were obtained, one of which contained two groups of (Ouch point); and the third for Jiaji point (Fig. 4). Discussion Cancer pain takes pain as the main symptom, which belongs to the category of \"pain syndrome\" in the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. It is closely related to the theory of \"meridians, qi and blood, and viscera.\" Acupuncture can dredge the channels and harmonize qi and blood. Acupuncture combined with electrical stimulation can effectively play an analgesic role. Therefore, EA has a positive signi\u0000cance in treating cancer pain. However, in clinical practice, the choice of EA parameters is easy to ignore, among which the main parameters are stimulation duration, waveform, current frequency, and frequency of treatment. Our study indicated that the stimulation duration of EA for cancer pain varied from 20 to 30 min, with 30 min being the most common duration. Wang et al. (11) found that the duration of clinical EA stimulation was 25 to 45 min, and the most commonly used treatment was 30 min, which achieved better e\u0000cacy and was consistent with the course of acupuncture. Ye et al.(12) also reported that 30 min of EAPage 11/19stimulation for analgesia was appropriate because the amount of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the telencephalon of rats was signi\u0000cantly reduced and slightly increased in the brainstem, while the pain thresholds were signi\u0000cantly increased during this process. Ye et al.(13) also found that 30 min was the best analgesic time for EA, which can signi\u0000cantly reduce the content of guanine riboside-3 '5' -cyclic phosphate lipid in rat telencephalon and increase the pain threshold. EA is mainly used to treat pain because opioid peptides and other related factors in the body can regulate the endogenous physiological mechanism, inhibit the transmission and expression of pain information, and play an analgesic role(14). However, the release of opioid peptides induced by EA is dependent on the frequency and intensity(9); that is, the types of neurotransmitters released by EA at different frequencies are different. A frequency of 2 Hz can cause the release of neuropeptides such as endorphins and enkephalins, whereas 100 Hz can cause the release of dynorphin. On the other hand, the density wave used at 2 and 100 Hz produces a synergistic effect and plays a strong analgesic role. In our study, frequency analysis of the current revealed that 2/100 Hz was the most frequently applied. Also, the analysis of waveforms depicted that dilatational wave was the most used for cancer pain, and both results were consistent. Jie et al.(15) found that 2/100 Hz revealed superior clinical e\u0000cacy in treating migraine compared with 2 and 100 Hz. Clinical studies have depicted that 2/100 Hz signi\u0000cantly reduces the dose of fentanyl requirements in patients after lung surgery compared with the application of 2 or 100 Hz EA stimulation(16). In clinical research, the dilatational wave is more effective than the continuous wave in releasing the pain caused by cervical spondylosis and could shorten the course of treatment of cervical spondylosis(17).. Three waveforms were used to intervene rats with spinal cord injury in an experimental study. Compared with sparse and dense waves, the dilatational wave was not easy to adapt to the body. Dilatational waves could effectively maintain the amount of stimulation, promote nerve regeneration, repair the injury in rats, reduce secondary spinal cord injury, accelerate blood circulation, and promote the recovery of motor function(18). Currently, there is a lack of universal clinical guidelines for the frequency of acupuncture treatment(8). Zhao et al.(19) explored the analgesic effects of EA in rats and concluded that EA had no analgesic effect at 3 or 6 h intervals but at 12 h or 24 h, with 24 h being the most effective treatment. Wang et al.(20) also found that at different intervals, the 24 h group was signi\u0000cantly more effective in reducing pain levels and increasing pain thresholds in rats with in\u0000ammatory pain and in promoting POMC mRNA and PENK mRNA expression were more effective. The analysis of channels revealed that clinical EA treatment for cancer pain attached importance to point selection among the Stomach Channel of Foot Yangming and the Spleen Channel of Foot Taiyin. The spleen and stomach channels have a close relationship between the external and internal channels. The spleen and stomach are the sources of qi and blood biochemistry. As a channel with su\u0000cient qi and blood, the Yangming channel has multiple qi and blood. Combined with the Spleen channel, it can not only stimulate qi and blood but also achieve the therapeutic purpose by connecting the Large Intestine,Page 12/19Stomach, and Spleen channels in sequence, which can pass through the whole body and also regulate the qi of the channel to unblock the qi and blood of the channel(21). The acupuncture points with a frequency greater Point. The acupuncture points are mainly used to regulate the spleen and stomach and unblock qi and blood, which are mentioned in other studies(22). Zusanli (ST36) belongs to the stomach channel of Foot Yangming, which can regulate the spleen and stomach and dissipate phlegm for resuscitation. Lee HJ, et al.(23) found that EA stimulation of Zusanli (ST36) signi\u0000cantly decreased substance P and increased the concentration of beta-endorphin in blood and brain samples in a cancer pain mouse model. Sanyinjiao (SP06) belongs to the spleen channel of Foot Taiyin, which can regulate the function of the liver, spleen, and kidney and also strengthen a healthy qi. In the association rules of acupoints, Zusanli (ST36) and Sanyinjiao (SP06) have the most closely related acupoints, which coincides with the frequency analysis results of acupoints. Therefore, these two acupoints can be used as the most commonly used acupoints for cancer pain treatment. Hegu (LI04) is the source point of the Large Intestine channel of Hand yangming and one of the siguan point, which is an important point for treating pain. Quchi (LI11) also belongs to the large Intestine channel of Hand yangming, which can harmonize qi and blood and unlock the channel to relieve pain. Studies have demonstrated that Ashi point is closely related to the level of pain threshold, disease state, and mood of patients(24), and as the location of pain points caused by different tumors is different, the selected acupoints are also different(21). Therefore, the acupoints and stimulation methods differ when EA acts on the Ashi point to treat pain in different tumor states. In addition, in 1997, Melzack found a good correspondence between myofascial trigger points and acupuncture points(25). With the deepening of research, it was con\u0000rmed that acupuncture points and myofascial trigger points had a good correlation(26) and a high degree of consistency (99.5%), especially in the treatment of painful diseases(27). As the reaction point of disease, the Ashi point is also a special point for the treatment of pain(28). Wang JF et al.(29) depicted that stimulation of the Ashi point could downregulate the expression of in\u0000ammatory mediators in the area of pain, inhibit the expression of neurons in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, and inhibit osteoclast and osteoblast cell activity, thus increasing the local pain threshold. Taichong (LR03) belongs to the liver channel of foot Jueyin, which can adjust qi and regulate the liver, soften tendons, and relieve pain. Acupuncture points are used to activate blood and relieve pain by loosening muscle ligaments. Cluster analysis indicated three major categories among the acupoints used at least \u0000ve times. One was two Jiaji point. Zusanlii (ST36), Hegu (LI04), and Quchi (LI11) are Yang Ming meridian points; the combination of the three points mainly regulates qi and blood so that qi can rise and fall and blood can \u0000ow. Neiguan (PC06) is one of the eight con\u0000uence points, and Sanyinjiao (SP06) is an intersecting point of the Spleen, Liver,Page 13/19and Kidney Meridians; the combination of the two points can dredge channels and collaterals. Tai Chong dredges qi to relieve pain. Combined with clinical experience (i.e., the frequency of use of the above points), the \u0000rst and second categories of the cluster analysis represent the core acupoints of acupuncture for cancer pain and can be used as the basic prescription of acupuncture for cancer pain. The third category can be used as a supporting acupuncture point, such as the inaccessible cancer type of cancer pain can be added to the jiaji point. In summary, acupuncture for cancer pain should be based on invigorating qi and blood and draining the meridians, with point is the basic acupuncture point prescription. Conclusions There is an interaction between EA parameters. Most scholars have explored more effective frequencies, waveforms, and stimulation times of the same acupoint, which provides data support for guiding standardized treatment of cancer pain. In our analysis, dilatational wave, a current frequency of 2/100 Hz, 30 min stimulation, acupoints of the Stomach Channel of Foot Yangming and the Spleen Channel of Foot Taiyin selection are the most frequently used EA treatment for cancer pain. However, in addition to favorable parameters and speci\u0000c acupoints, many other factors, such as individual pathophysiological state, psychological state, treatment goals, and patient compliance, will also directly affect the e\u0000cacy of cancer pain treatment. Therefore, the exploration of EA parameters should be combined with standardization and individuation to improve the clinical treatment effect. Due to the limitations of this study, further research and more standardized, multi-center, large-sample clinical trials should be carried out to guide optimizing acupuncture treatment schemes and promote the formation of TCM-characteristic technologies for cancer pain.
