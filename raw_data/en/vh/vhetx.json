We will create an alchemical dynamic flow of Yin and Yang energy to balance mind and body. (Think virtual Yin Vibrations!!!) Since being back to in person sessions, I thought how nice it would be to christen my new office/body work studio with a beautiful ceremony that allows you to learn and create a winter ritual around raising vibrations with yang water salutations and nesting yin poses. We will seal it with a beautiful water meditation and sound vibration, nourishing the kidneys through their sense doors, the ears. ALL ARE WELCOME! Can't make the live class, we will send everyone who joins a copy of the class to view for the month! Sliding scale fee - $20/$25/$30 You will get a link to the class and instructions on what props to have nearby 24-hours prior. Contact me through the link below to pay and join. "}
