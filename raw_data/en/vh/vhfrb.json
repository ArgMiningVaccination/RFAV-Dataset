Founded in community -based legacies of compassionate healing, we provide the highest quality comprehensive continuum of integrated health care, supportive housing and community services, especially for the needy and vulnerable. The School of Nursing Mission The mission of the Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing is to prepare students for entry into the profession of nursing as competent, caring practitioners. History The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing was founded in 1898, only 25 years after the establishment of the nation's first nursing school. In 1902, the School of Nursing graduated its first class of 10 students. To date, more than 2,500 students have graduated. The school was chartered in 1903 by the State University of New York to \"instruct for the successful practice of nursing\". Today, over a century later, the mission and philosophy of the school and faculty continue to reflect the intent of the original charter while progressively advancing program offerings to meet the unprecedented demands in the profession. Quality education for s tudents has always been the school's primary focus. In 1989, the Samaritan Hospital Board of Directors received authority to grant a two - year associate in science degree for the registered nurse program. In January 1995, the school expanded its offering w ith the addition of the practical nursing (LPN) certificate program. The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing is registered by the New York State Education Department. The curricul a for the nursing program s adhere to the National League for Nursing's edu cational outcomes for nursing programs 1. Samaritan Hospital is certified by the New York State Department of Health. 1 National League for Nursing. (2010). Outcomes and competencies for graduates of practical/vocational, diploma, associate degree, baccalaureate, master's, practice doctorate, and research doctorate programs in nursi ng. New York, NY: The National League for Nursing . 7 PHILOSOPHY WE BELIEVE The practice of nursing is... An art and science Dedicated to promoting, maintaining, restoring and supporting health and well-being of individuals living and dying Holistic Caring Accountable: legally, ethically and morally The application of theoretical knowledge, reasoning, and technical competence Accepting and respecting individuals regardless of religion, race, creed, color, age, gender, culture, ability, mental status, or socioeconomic status, or political affiliation Partnership with: o Individuals and significant others with actual or potential health needs and o Health care team mem bers Education... Is a partnership involving shared accountability between faculty and students. Requires open, honest and timely communication by faculty and students. Recognizes students' unique abilities, life experiences, and learning preferences. Is committed to providing a variety of resources and active learning experiences to support individual learning preferences and rates. Builds from simple to complex. A minimum level of competency is critical before progressing in a sequential curriculum. Given additional time and resources, students establish a stronger foundation from which to build. In consultation with faculty, students identify corrective measures necessary to move to a higher level of competence and negotiate the time needed. Flourishes in an environment in which there is freedom of expression, creativity, and innovation. Is a lifelong endeavor. DEFINITION OF SCHOLARSHIP The faculty of the School of Nursing have defined scholarship as: \"Professional endeavors which advance the art & science of nursing and nursing education.\" 8 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The nursing community of St. Peter's Health Partners has adopted Jean Watson's human caring theory as our theoretical framework. As a member of this community, the School subscribes to this theory. Watson's Refined Carative Processes1 include: Practic self/other Being authentically present; enabling belief system and subjective world of self/other Cultivating own spiritual practices; beyond ego -self to authentic transpersonal presence Sustaining a loving, trusting, and caring relationship Allowing for the expression of feelings' authentically listening and \"holding another person's story for them\" Creative solution seeking through caring processes, full use of self; all ways of knowing/ doing/being; engage in artistry of human caring- healing practices and modalities Authentic teaching- learning within context of caring relationship; stay within other's frame of reference; shift toward health -healing- wellness coaching model. Creating healing environment at all levels; physical/nonphysical, subtle environment of energy, consciousness, wholeness, beauty, dignity, and peace are potentiated Reverentially and respectfully assisting with basic needs, holding an intentional, caring consciousness of touching the embodied spirit of another as sacred practice, working with life force/life energy/life mystery of another Opening and attending to spiritual, mysterious, unknown, and existential dimensions of all the vicissitudes of life, death, suffering, pain, joy, transitions life change; \"allowing for a miracle\" All of this is presupposed by a knowledge base and clinical competence Furthermore, the theoretical framework is informed by our understanding of the work of Patricia Benner. Benner theorized that nurses must have a strong foundation of knowledge and develop expertise through repeated practice and breadth of experience. It is our intent that students attain a sound theoretical basis and have ample opportunity to develop competence in nursing practice sufficient to prepare them for entry into practice. Finally, all faculty members are encouraged to reflect on the work of many nursing theorists and are supported in their incorporation of relevant components of these theori es 9 OVERVIEW of PRACTICAL NURSE PROGRAM CURRICULUM GOALS The curriculum is prepared by the faculty with the following goals in mind: Graduate a caring, accountable nurse, adaptable to a variety of settings and changing environments.

The bridge workshop is held at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing prior to, or during orientation week and is designed to refresh skill s and knowledge. There is a charge of $120 for this workshop. ADVISORS All students are assigned an academic advisor. Student/Advisor lists are posted each semester. Students are required to meet with their advisors prior to registration for the next semester. The academic advisor is also available by appointment and email to provide advice and support throughout the semester. REGISTRATION All course registrations are conducted at the School of Nursing. Registration for all Hudson Valley Community College courses must be done through the School of Nursing. Specific registration instructions will be posted on MESA each semester. It is each student 's responsibility to access the information and meet with an advisor each semester prior to registration . If schedule changes are required after the registration process has been completed, the student is required to submit the change in writing to Student Services. A deadline date is set each semester for students to submit their registration forms. Registrations will be processed in a random order so that the process is fair to everyone. If a student submits the registration form late or is missing any requirements, their registration will be processed after all other registrations. Day, evening and weekend clinical assignments are offered in the School of Nursing Program and students are expected to be able to participate in any of the clinical, class or lab times offered. If schedule changes are required after the registration process has been completed, the student may request a change with Student Services. 28 SCHEDULES After schedules are confirmed, students will be notified via school email to go to https://www.cacloudservices.com/studentservices/7540S/crindex.cgi (Campus Anyware Online Services). Students will use their social security number, with no dashes, as their login ID and birthdate, with no slashes as their initial password. Occasionally, it is necessary for the School to rearrange clinical sites, resulting in a change to student schedules. Students will be notified via email if this happens. If a student does not complete the requirements for the semester (i.e CPR has lapsed, late PPD) , he/she may lose his/her spot in a class, clinical or lab. WAIT LIST FOR CHANGE IN CLINICAL OR LAB SCHEDULE After schedules have been determined, wait list requests will be taken. If a student did not get his/her first choice of a lab or clinical, he/she may request to be put on a wait list. All requests must be submitted in writing to Student Services . Send requests to Angela.cox@sphp.com . Changes from the wait list will be made a fter grades have been received and entered for the previous semester. If a schedule is changed, the student will be notified via email. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF STATUS All students are responsible for providing the School of Nursing with current address, telephone number and e -mail address. Students may change their information in one of the following ways: 1. Go to Campus Anyware Online Services at https://www.cacloudservices.com/studentservices/7540S/crindex.cgi 2. Submit a written request to Student Services. 29 STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES POLICY : Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with disabilities. PURPOSE: To assure that students with disabilities receive reasonable accommodations. The purpose of providing accommodations is not to create a competitive advantage for disabled students, but to eliminate any competitive disadvantages that may exist. RESPON SIBILITY: Dean, Dean of Student Services, Faculty PROCEDURE: A. Newly accepted students will be sent a form on which they may state the need for accommodations for disabilities. The form and supporting documentation is submitted to the Dean . B. Any student requesting accommodations must provide recent documentation concerning his or her disability. For those students entering immediately following graduation from high school, the documentation should be no more than three years old. For those who have been tested with adult scales, the documentation s hould be no more than five years old. C. In the absence of documentation, or in the instance of a newly identified disability, the Dean will use best judgment as to the provision of accommodations. D. The Dean will inform faculty of the accommodations to be made, but will not disclose confidential information as to the nature of the disability. E. The D ean will work with faculty to arrange details of the accommodations (e.g. scheduling an adjunct faculty as a reader). F. Every course overview will contain the following statement: \"Students with disabilities who wish to have special accommodations are expected to inform the faculty of any special needs in a timely manner. If the student has previously identified him or herself to the Dean , accommodations will be made as agreed upon between the student and the Dean . If this is a newly identified disability, plans for accommodation will be made on a case- by-case basis.\" G. Each course chair will review the above statement with students at the time of co urse orientation. It is the student's option to request accommodations. 30 ACADEMIC INFORMATION PROGRESSION Nursing courses build from simple to complex and are taken in order. Prerequisite courses must be completed prior to the next nursing course in the sequence as described in the program of studies. A student may not withdraw from a co- requisite course while maintaining enrollment in the nursing course. Cur rent registration in the nursing course MUST be accompanied by current registration in all co- requisite courses, unless those courses have already been successfully completed in a prior semester. If a student is enrolled in a nursing class and chooses to withdraw from a required co- requisite course for that nursing class, the student must also withdraw from the nursing class. GRADING An accepted minimum level of competency is required for progression in the program of studies and has been defined as a gr ade of C or better in the support courses and B or better in the nursing courses. Midterm grade reports are generated for each student. Students who are experiencing academic difficulty are encouraged to meet with their academic advisors to formulate a plan for successful completion. GRADING SCALE Grading Scale for Nursing Courses Letter Grade Description Grade Points Excellent A 90-100% 4.0 Very Good B+ 85-89% Unsatisfactory D 60-64% 1.0 F failure I incomplete W withdrawal on or before the last date to withdraw ** Z failure due to absence without withdrawal CC Course Cancelled*** * Any grade below a B is equivalent to course failure. Stude nts who earn less than a B are not eligible to progress to the next N ursing course. **The last date to withdraw from a course is published each semester. Please note, the last day to withdraw fro m a N ursing course may differ from the last day to withdraw from an HVCC course . ***This grade was introduced Spring 2020 as a result of COVID -19. It does not count towards attempted credits and is not calculated in GPA. 31 ACADEMIC INFORMATION Hudson Valley Community College Grading Scale GRADES NUMERICAL EQUIVALENT QUALITY POINTS PER CREDIT HOUR A Excellent 90 - 100 4.0 B Very Good 80-89 3.0 C Average 70-79 2.0 D Passing 60-69 1.0 F Failure Below 60 0 I Incomplete IP Course in Progress P Pass S Satisfactory W Withdraw NGS No Grade Submitted Z Absent Without Withdrawal EXM Excused Medical (Physical Education courses only) HONOR ROLL Honor roll status is determined by a semester GPA of 3.75 or higher and is noted on the student's transcript. GRADUATE HONORS Graduates with a cumulative GPA of 3.75 -3.94 are listed in the graduation program as Magna Cum Laude. The honor also appears on the graduate's final transcript Graduates with a cumulative GPA of 3.9 5 or higher are listed in the graduation program as Summa Cum Laude. The honor also appears on the graduate's final transcript. 32 ACADEMIC INFORMATION ACADEMIC/ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES Listed below are excerpts taken from Academic Policy statements. Complete policy statements are available in the school's Main Office, in the Health Sciences Library , and on the MESA portal . ACADEMIC PROBATION A student is placed on academic probation when he/she: earns less than a B (C, D, F or Z) in any nursing course earns less than a C - (D, F or Z) in any support course withdraw s from a second nursing course (semester) or support course.* * If a student has previously withdrawn from any course, a withdrawal from a subsequent course in that same category will at least result in academic probation or may result in academic dismissa l, if the student has previously failed or withdrawn from any course in that same category . Course categories are: Nursing courses Science courses: Anatomy & Physiology I & II, Microbiology Non-science support courses : General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, English Composition I, a social science course, an English elective, and the directed elective. PROCEDURE AFTER NURSING COURSE FAILURE The student who failed must submit a Request to Repeat a Nursing Course Form , along with a letter requesting permission to repeat the course. The letter should explain what the student believes was the reason for the failure, and if permitted to return, what the student would do differently to ensure success. The A&P committ ee will render a decision. The committee's decision is final and will be communicated in writing. If permitted to repeat, the student must repeat the course in its entirety, both the theory and clinical portions of the course. The repeating student will be placed on academic probation until successful completion of the course. If the repeating student is unsuccessful in a second attempt, the student will be academically dismissed. If the repeating student is successful he/she will be listed in good academic standing. Failure of a subsequent nursing course or semester will result in academic dismissal. 33 ACADEMIC INFORMATION ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student may only attempt any given course twice. After two unsuccessful attempts at the same course, the student will be dismissed. A grade of less than B is considered to be failure of a nursing course. A grade of less than C is considered to be failure of a non- nursing course. A student who is not approved to repeat a failed nursing course is academically dismissed. Failure of a second course in any nursing, science or non- science support course category will result in academic dismissal . See examples below: 1. If a student fails A&P I and subsequently fails Micro, then he/she will be dismissed. 2. If a student fails PSY 100 and then fails the English elective, he or she will be dismissed . 3. If a student fails NSG 1 and subsequently fails NSG V, then he/she will be dismissed. Dismissal will result for those students who have failed a nursing course at any other school of nursing, including our sister school, if they fail ONE nursing course at this school. Dismissed students are not eligible for readmission. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL WAIVER An academic dismissal waiver will be consi dered if personal circumstances, unexpected crisis , or hardship is encountered by the student leading to the failure. The faculty advisor or student services representative MUST have been informed of these circumstances prior to the end of the course. WITHDRAWAL Withdrawal is designed for students who are unable to continue with a course(s) in any given semester. Students may withdraw from one course or course category only once without penalty. A subsequent withdrawal will at least result in Academic Pr obation and may result in dismissal. A third withdrawal will result in dismissal. Each semester a last date for withdrawal without penalty is published. The nursing course withdrawal deadline wil l be different from the HVCC withdrawal deadline. If a student withdraws on or before the \"last day to withdraw\" date published by the School of Nursing, the student will receive a W. The effective date of the withdrawal will be the date the form is submit ted to Student Services with all required signatures. Withdrawals will not be allowed after the published withdrawal deadline. Please refer to Refund Schedule for the financial consequences of withdrawing from a course. It is also best practice to speak with the Financial Aid Director . 34 ACADEMIC INFORMATION WITHDRAWAL FROM NURSING COURSES Students who wish to withdraw from a nursing course must completer a Nursing Course Withdrawal form and meet with the Dean of Student Services, the Bursar, and the Financial Aid Director . It is also recommended that the student discuss withdrawal with his/her course chair and academic advisor. Students who wish to withdraw from a course or courses, at the beginning of the semester, must withdraw from the nursing course and may withdraw from the co- requisite course(s). Students who wish to withdraw from a course or courses, at the end of the semester, may be permitted to continue in the nursing course and withdraw from t he co -requisite course(s). In this instance, the decision will be made by the Dean on a case- by-case basis. WITHDRAWAL FROM HUDSON VALLEY COURSES Withdrawal policies of Hudson Valley Community College are applied to courses taken at that school. Please review the Hudson Valley Community College Catalog regarding their Grading Policy and other implications of withdrawing from a course. Students must refer to the Hudson Valley Community College catalogue and calendar each semester for specific information regarding policies on registration, registration changes, tuition and grading. Students must complete a HVCC withdrawal form available from Student Services. The form must be completed and signed by the Director of Student Services and the student must take the form directly to the Registrar's Office at HVCC for the change to be processed. PLEASE NOTE: All withdrawals from HVCC courses MUST be approved by Student Services at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing. INCOMPLETE GRADE At the completion of a nursing course, a student may be granted an \"incomplete\" letter grade when course requirements have not been met . A learning plan must be established and agreed upon with course faculty. The \"incomplete\" letter grade must be redeemed within TWO WEEKS following the end of the semester or the grade converts to an F. In exceptional circumstances, the student may apply for an extension through the Dean. Incomplete grades in support courses are subject to the policy of Hudson Valley Community College or the institution at which the support course is taken. LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA): The LOA policy allows students to interrupt continuous enrollment for not more than one semester without having to re -apply for enrollment and without changing conditions of their academic program. The leave of absence policy covers both involuntary and voluntary inter ruptions (personal, financial, medical, military) and is meant to ensure program completion within a 3 year time period Exceptions to the time limit may be granted by the Dean of the School or Dean of Student Services under extenuating circumstances. 35 ACADEMIC INFORMATION Students who wish to obtain a LOA must complete a LOA form with Student Services. Student Services notifies the Bursar and the Financial Aid Director . Students will be contacted to register by Student Services during the advisement period of the semester prior to their re- enrollment. REPEATING A NURSING COURSE AT OUR SISTER SCHOOL Students who have failed a nursing course and who have been approved to repeat a nursing course in our school may be required to do so at the campus of St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. The decision of where the student repeats the course rests solely with the school administration. All relevant policies from Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing will apply to a course taken at St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. The student who repeats a nursing course at St. Peter's Hospital College of Nur sing will continue to be matriculate d at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing. All billing, financial aid and other student services will be provided by Samaritan. Failure of a subsequent nursing semester will result in academic dismissal, whether the repeated course is taken at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing or at St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. The student's transcript will show the course taken at the host school, with the actual grade recorded and computed into the student's GPA. ACADEMIC RECORD Students receive a grade report at the end of each semester. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by adding the quality points achieved by the student in each course and dividing the sum by the total number of credit hours for those co urses. If a failed course is repeated, the original grade will always appear on the transcript. The new grade will be used to calculate the GPA, and will be shown as repeated. Any non- nursing grades below a C - are not accepted for transfer credit and do not earn the credits or quality points awarded by Hudson Valley Community College. Transferred courses are not assigned quality points and are not calculated in cumulative averages. 36 ACADEMIC INFORMATION MASTERY LEAR NING This is a process designed to assist students in attaining the highest level of competency by recognizing learning style preferences and variations in time to acquire a deeper understanding. The curriculum builds from simple to complex. To support a stronger foundation, all students are required to attain a minimum of 80% or better in all nursing courses. If a student does not meet the minimum standard on a nursing exam, he/she must complete corrective measures, as discussed with that student's faculty. ATTENDANCE Scheduled learning experiences are designed to enhance each student's success and support deeper understanding. Attendance at classroom/lecture, all clinical, lab and observational learning experiences is required. Students are responsible for reporting late arrival or any planned or unplanned absence. Students are required to notify the course chair, clinical site and the clinical instructor when they will be late or absent from class, lab or clinical . Additional information about notification of absences will be provided in each individual course orientation by the course chair. (See Attendance Policy) When a student is absent for three or more days as a result of an extended illness or has undergone childbirth or surgery of any kind, a written release from the student's health care provider must be provided to indicate the student's readiness to return to scheduled classroom and/or clinical experiences. Excessive absences or multiple failures to report absences or lateness may result in course failure and/or termination from the program (see Dismissal Policy). Students at risk will be advised accordingly and informed in writing of actions that may be taken. CLINICAL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES In addition to course work at the School of Nursing, students will be assigned to clinical learning experiences at other health care agencies in the Capital District. These agencies may include, but are not limited to the following: Samaritan Hospital, The Eddy Cohoes Rehabilitation Center, St. Peter's Hospital, St. Margaret's Hospital , Heritage House, or other agencies. These assignments will be scheduled during day and/or evening hours , on weekdays and/or weekends. PREPAREDNESS FOR CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES Students are responsible for coming to clinical learning experiences prepared to partic ipate in those experiences. Inadequate preparation may result in a faculty member denying an unprepared student the opportunity to participate in the learning experience (dismissed from the clinical setting for that day). Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. 37 ACADEMIC INFORMATION EVALUATION OF CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES Data or information used to formulate the student's clinical evaluation may include, and may not be limited to, the following sources: direct observations by the student's clinical faculty, patient statements, the student's written care plans and assignmen ts, the student's demonstration/performance of psychomotor skills, the student's ability to discuss human illness or conditions, the student's ability to plan and provide organized, safe, efficient nursing care for same, the student's ability to provide patient teaching, the student's participation in clinical conferences, review of the student's documentation in the medical record, the student's professional behavior and appearance, and statements from other members of the health care team and preceptors' (if any) evaluations, School of Nursing administration and faculty and/or members of the heath care team. CLINICAL LEARNING M AKE -UP Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. Make- ups will be scheduled at the convenience of the faculty, but are not guaranteed. Students who miss more than one clinical experience will be required to make up the clinical experience at the end of the semester after the final exam. In that case, s tudents will be assessed additional fees to augment expenses related to make up experiences beyond routine scheduling or semester calendars. The fees will be billed by the Bursar and payment must be made within 10 business days. Due to the uniqueness of some learning experiences, certain clinical make -ups may not be possible. After an absence, arrangements for make- ups of any type of missed experiences should be done in a timely manner with the faculty. Excessive absence or lateness may result in an administrative termination from the program and/or may be reason for course failure. Some clinical experiences begin at 6:30 or 7:00 a.m., or during evening hours or on weekends. If a clinical learning experience is cancelled, it may be rescheduled at a later date. 38 ACADEMIC INFORMATION GENERAL CRITERIA FOR MEETING OUTCOMES IN THE CLINICAL PORTION OF A NURSING COURSE A student who successfully meets outcomes...

We strive to provide students with the knowledge, skills, judgment, and wisdom they need to function in society as educated adults. By accepting admission into the School of Nursing, the student affirms the commitment to uphold the values of the School's Honor Code and the standards of the nursing profession. Academic integrity at the Schools of Nursing and SPHP is based on a respect for individual achievement that lies at the heart of academic culture. Every faculty member and student belongs to a community of professionals where academic integrity is a fundamental commitment. DEFINITIONS Academic Integrity is defin ed in terms of a commitment to five fundamental values and to the principles that flow from those values. At the School of Nursing, five values are fundamental to the academic process: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Academic integr ity is the commitment to stand up for these five values, even in the face of adversity. Academic Dishonesty is defined as any action or practice that provides the potential for an unfair advantage to one individual or one group. Academic dishonesty inc ludes misrepresenting facts, fabricating or doctoring data or results, representing another's work or knowledge as one's own, disrupting or destroying the work of others, or abetting anyone who engages in such practices. Academic dishonesty is not absolute because the expectations for collaboration vary. In some courses, for example, students are assigned to work on team projects. In others, students are given permission to collaborate on homework projects or to have wri tten materials present during an examination. Unless otherwise specified, however, the School of Nursing requires all work to be the result of individual effort, performed without the help of other individuals or outside sources. If a question arises about the use of external materials that may be used or the amount of collaboration that is permitted for a given task, each individual involved is responsible for verifying the rules with the appropriate faculty before engaging in collaborative activities, u sing external materials or accepting help from others. 42 Actions constituting violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, the following: Plagiarism : The use of another's work, ideas, data, or product without appropriate acknowledgment, such as copying another's work, presenting someone else's opinions and theories as one's own, or working jointly on a project and then submitting it as one's own. Cheating: The use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, or study aids; or an act of deceit by which a student attempts to misrepresent academic skills or knowledge; unauthorized copying or collaboration. Fabrication: Intentional misrepr esentation or invention of any information, such as falsifying research, inventing or exaggerating data, or listing incorrect or fictitious references. Collusion: Assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty, such as paying or bribing someone to acquire a test or assignment, taking a test or doing an assignment for someone else, or allowing someone to do these things for one's own benefit. Academic Misconduct : The intentional violation of school policies, such as tampering with grades, misr epresenting one's identity, or taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of a test or any information about the test. SANCTIONS All proven cases of academic dishonesty will be penalized as appropriate under the circumstances. Sanctions other than a reduced or failing grade may be imposed by the chair of the course. The imposition of any sanction other than a private reprimand will include a statement of reasons supporting its severity. A student may appeal any finding or sanction. Sanctions may include but are not limited to: Reduced or failing grade, on an assignment, test or course. A letter of reprimand A defined period of probation, with or without the attachment of conditions Withdrawal of School of Nursing funding A defined period of suspension, with or without the attachment of conditions Expulsion (or dismissal) from the School of Nursing Notation on the official record Revocation of an awarded degree Any combination of the sanctions above The administrators of the School of Nursing will be responsible for tracking any occurrences of academic dishonesty and meeting with any student who fails to follow the honor code. 43 PROGRAM DISMISSAL/TERMINATION A student may be dismissed from the school when there is sufficient evidence to show: violations of The School of Nursing code of Conduct (see Academic Integrity policy) violations of The School of Nursing Social Networking Policy (see Social Networking policy) academic failure (see Academic Progress and Grading policy)* unsafe clinical practice a failure to comply with School/Hospital/Agency policies and procedures excessive absences with failure to initiate a plan for make- up experiences, or absences beyond the school's ability to ac commodate the make- up experiences behavior which is unprofessional/inappropriate conduct that jeopardizes the safety of self, students, patients or others failure to meet financial obligations or health requirements violation of the drug/alcohol policy behavior that violates one or more policies, such as Conduct on Campus or Sexual Harassment/Sexual Assault policies Faculty staff or students who recklessly or intentionally endanger the mental or physical health of others at the School of Nursing will be subject to corrective action up to and including termination or dismissal. Any communication (statement or photo) which may cause actual or potential harm or injury to another or to the School may be grounds for termination or dismissal. *If a student is unsuccessful in a nursing course due to mental or physical illness, a plan of treatment and written proof of completion, by an appropriate authority, must be submitted before the student will be considered for readmission. 44 APPEALS STUDENT APPEAL PROCESS The Student Appeal Process is designed to facilitate conflict resolution. Students have a right to appeal decisions that impact their educational experiences or create conflict with their program objectives. Remedy is sought through the following steps: Solve the problem at the source. Meet with the individual or persons involved in the conflict to attempt to resolve issue(s). Take the problem to next level. When a conflict remains unresolved, seek assistance through an advisor, or curriculum team member . When all avenues have been exhausted, a written statement of appeal may be submitted to the Admission and Academic Progression Committee within eight (8) business days of the issue being disputed. A student who is appealing a clinical failure which is determined prior to the end of the semester may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal is pending. A student who is appealing a dismissal may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal i s pending. An ad-hoc subcommittee of the Admission and Academic Progress Committee will be convened, comprised of the Dean of Student Services or designee, two faculty representatives, and two students. Every attempt will be made to review the written appeal within five working days from the time the written appeal is received. The student will be invited to appear before the appeals committee to state his/her case. The faculty member of the course the student was unsuccessful in will also be invited to present any information to support the grade being appealed. The committee will vote to either uphold the grade, or reverse it. The appeals process does not guar antee that a decision will be reversed. It does ensure that issues brought before the committee are mediated and that all considerations on behalf of the student are given. The purpose of the appeals committee is to formulate resolutions and make recommendations to the Dean. The Dean may uphold the decision or override it. The decision of the Dean is final. If the Dean is the subject of the appeal, the final decision rests with the Admissions and Progression Committee. Please refer to Policy #203. No action will be taken against any student who chooses to file an appeal. Written assurance to this effect will be provided to any student who has filed an appeal. Any student who appeals a decision will be provided with written assurance that no action will be taken against a student for filing the complai nt. Section 494(C)j of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, provides that a student, faculty member, or any other person who believes he or she has been aggrieved by an institution of higher ed ucation has the right to file a written complaint. In New York State, a complaint may be filed by any person with reason to believe that an 45 institution has acted contrary to its published standards or that conditions at the institution appear to jeopardiz e the quality of the institution's instructional programs or the general welfare of its students. Any person who believes he or she has been aggrieved by an institution on or after May 4, 1994, may file a written complaint within three years of the alleged incident. Information regarding this complaint process can be obtained in the Main Office of the School of Nursing. Additionally, the person can contact opprogs@nysed.gov and request a complaint form. The s tudent must be the complainant. Additional information may be obtained at the following link: http://www.highered.nysed.gov/ocue/spr/COMPLAINTFORMINFO.html 46 CAMPUS SAFETY/SECURITY PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the policy of the School of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide a learning environment that is safe and free of threat or harm. In addition, the policies and procedures of the School of Nursing provide protection of the rights and dignity of each student and employee. A safe and healthy learning environment will assure that the student has the best possible opportunity for success in their studies. Safety and S ecurity is the responsibility of every student and employee. It is expected that each member of the School of Nursing community work to make our campus a safe and productive learning environment. PREVENTION Prevention is the best strategy for providing a safe environment. To that end, the School of Nursing has policies and procedures regarding safety and security issues and practices. These policies are covered in student orientations. Personal safety and violence prevention education is also provided to students annually. Published materials regarding personal safety and security and treatment options are available from the Student Services office. The School of Nursing is in compliance with all government regulations and recommendations. Annual fire and safety inspections of the facility are conducted. In the event of an imminent threat against the safety of the community, it is the policy of the School of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide students with warning of potential th reats to security. COMPLAINT PROCEDURE The School of Nursing believes that the reporting of crime is an effective measure in preventing future crimes. Issues of safety or security should be brought to the attention of the hospital's security office and the Dean. Students, faculty, staff, and guests are encouraged to report all crimes and public safety related incidents to the appropriate authorities in a timely manner. Crimes committed on campus should be reported to security as well as the local police department. The complaint should include details of the incident(s), names of individuals involved, and the names of witnesses. Should an accident or incident involving yourself or another occur, please contact the Dean or a faculty or staff member for an i ncident report form , instructions for completing and filing the report, and possible referral for treatment. Sexual assault is a crime and victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the emergency department for medical and forensic evaluation. Sexual assault should also be reported to the Dean or campus security authority. Reports of sexual harassment or assault are confidential and should be reported even if legal action is not being pursued. In addition to the School of Nursing's internal complaint procedure, students have the right to pursue investigation and prosecution of sexual harassment by filing complaints with the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR). Students must file complaints within 365 days of the last incident. Whatever action is taken against the harasser will be communicated to the NYSDHR complainant. 47 CAMPUS SAFETY/SECURIT Y SPECIFIC POLICIES Bias Related Crime Prevention It is the policy of the School of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide a learning environment free from bias. The learning environment should be one that is fair and that allows students to progress solely on the basis of ability and academic performance. Bias adversely affects the learning environment and the student's ability to learn. Bias perpetrated by the student faculty, or staff will not be tolerated.

The law is designated to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system by standardizing electr onic transmission of certain healthcare transactions. The goal of HIPAA is to protect the privacy and security of all health care information, including transmitted information. Protected health information may be used or disclosed only to the individual or personal representative; for treatment, payment or health care operations; for special purposes set forth in HIPAA regulations; for any other purpose, with the individual's authorization. MEDITECH PATIENT CARE DATABASE AND CONFIDENTIALITY The Meditech patient care database is a confidential clinical information system. It is the policy of this institution and the school that ALL patient information is confidential and that access to that information is a privilege which carries with it ethical and legal responsibilities and sanctions. Student Access Students are eligi ble to access the Meditech system on a \"need- to-know\" basis. The purpose of this access is to obtain patients' information directly related to clinical objectives in nursing courses, as well as to utilize the word processing and internal e- mail capabilities of the system. This is a privilege that facilitates clinical learning. Student Employees Some of the students of the school are also employees of the hospital. If you hold this dual status, as an employee, while working in your employed status, you ar e eligible to use the computer system in whatever capacity your employer deems appropriate for your job position. You will have separate USER ID and PASSWORDS for your work and student access. You must not access the system outside of your work time with your work password. Printed Material Students may NOT remove any printed information with patient identification on it from the building - this is removing a patient chart. Patient lab reports and medication lists may be taken out of the hospital on ly if all patient identifiers have first been removed from these documents. Students may not photocopy any part of a patient's chart. 66 REGULATORY Passwords No one may allow anyone else access to the Meditech system on her/his password. If the person asking for use of the system is an eligible user, they must access the system through their own password. Do not \"buddy up\" while using the computer. Students who share their password may be dismissed. Do not allow anyone who does not have a password int o the system to \"show them what it can do\". This is not a reference library system - it is confidential information. Sanctions Please be mindful of the sanctions that apply to breach of confidentiality. These are listed in the Personnel Policies of the hospital. The final sanction for any behavior that violates these rules is termination of employment/dismissal from the school. In addition, violation of HIPAA regulations is a felony and may prohibit applicants from licensure as a nurse, or loss of licen se for those who already hold a license. FAMILY RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. An eligible student under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution. In addition, parents are afforded the same rights as students, as long as the student is claimed as a dependent on either of their parent's Federal Income Tax Return, and there is proper presentation of the dependency condition. These rights include: 1 . The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing (SHSON) receives a request for access. A student should submit to the Dean or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2.The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading. A student who wishes to ask SHSON to amend a record should write the school official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If SHSON decid es not to amend the record as requested, SHSON will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the s tudent when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent before SHSON discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. 67 SHSON discloses education records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by SHSON in an administrative, s upervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance com mittee . A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of SHSON who performs an institutional service or function for which SHSON would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of SHSON with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the offic ial needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the SHSON . Upon request, SHSON may also disclose education records without consent to offi cials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. SHSON has designated the following information as \"directory information\": student's name, address, telephone listing, participation in officially recognized activities, major, dates of attendance, date of birth , enrollment status, and degrees and awards received, and digitized image/photograph/video. The school may disclose any of this information without prior consent, unless notified in writing to the contrary within 30 days of the beginning of the term. 4.The right to file a complaint wi th the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by SHSON to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Aven ue, SW Washington, DC 20202 68 BILLING AND FINANCIAL AID BURSAR'S OFFICE ( 518-268-5028 ) All billing inquiries, payments, refunds, scholarships, etc. are handled through the Bursar's Office of the School of Nursing.

Students may divide their payments by signing up for a payment plan ($50 fee and payments are divided into 4 installments for the fall and spring semesters; $25 fee and 2 payments for the summer). If a student signs up for a payment plan and fails to make on-time payments, it will be at the discretion of the Bursar to deny this student from future payment plans. Students may pay their bill in person, by mail or online at www.sphp.com/son. The Bursar will not process or store credit card information for students or their parents. Refund of a payment made with a personal check is subject to a St. Peter's Health Partners' Finance Department mandated hold of 14 business days after the Bursar has deposited the check. The Bursar will notify the student when the refund is available. Students are welcome to call with any questions or concerns regarding their bill.

It is important that students adhere to deadlines set by the F inancial Aid Director and are diligent in returning all requested forms and paperwork. Refunds will be issued only when a student's account has a credit balance. Refunds due to the student will be made available w ithin fourteen (14) days from the time the loan is received by the school. Refunds will be in the form of a check made out to the student unless the student requests these funds be applied to the next semester's bill (a special form must be signed). Stud ents are notified of their refund check by e- mail to their school email account . Students who fail to meet all of their financial obligations to the school in any given semester will not be permitted to attend the next semester and will be unable to obta in any records (i.e. grades, transcripts, schedules) until their bill is paid in full. After the required notifications, their account will be turned over to a collection agency. 69 Any student payment returned/rejected for insufficient funds must be replaced within 5 business days after being notified by the Bursar. The student will also be charged a $20 service fee. Checks will no longer be accepted for the remainder of their educ ation at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing and all future payments must be in the form of cash, money order or valid credit card. TEXTBOOK VOUCHERS What is a Textbook Voucher? A Textbook Voucher allows eligible students to purchase all or a portion of their required books and school related supplies from the Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC) Bookstore (https://www.hvcc.edu/bookstore/index.html Viking's Cove Campus Bookstore) using their excess financial aid funds. Textbook Vouchers will be valid during the week of nursing school orientation and the first two weeks of the nursing school semester. Spending limits each semester will be $950 for Nursing 1 students if their refund will be more than this amount (or $500 if their refund amount is at least this high), $500 for Nursing 2 - 5 students, Behavioral Health and HVCC students. The amount of the book voucher spent is then charged to the student's tuition account to be paid when their financial aid is disbursed to the account. Any unused portion will be credited back to the student's account after the Textbook Voucher has expired. This program is designed to help you achieve academic success by having the required textbooks and school related supplies at the beginning of the semester. Students who receive financial aid are eligible to choose to participate in the Textbook Voucher program. If your Federal S tafford Student Loans, Private Student Loans and/or Pell Grants exceed the cost of your tuition and fees by $950 for Nursing 1 students and $500 for all other students, you may sign up for this program. TAP money may not be used to purchase books or schoo l related supplies . Money spent on textbooks or school related supplies will come out of the financial aid that is over the amount needed to cover the semester's tuition and fees (the amount that otherwise would be refunded to you during the semester) . Students eligible for a book voucher will receive forms along with their fall and spring bills. You must return the signed book voucher to the Bursar by the specified due date. The Bursar will give the names of participating students to the Hudson Valley Community College Bookstore before the student orientation week. Voucher money may only be spent on required and recommended new and/or used textbooks and supplies for the courses you are taking. If your financial aid award is reduced and the cost of tex tbooks and supplies is no longer covered, you are responsible for the bill. Should your schedule change after the return period for textbooks, you remain responsible for what you purchased. How do I use my Voucher? When you go to Hudson Valley to purc hase your textbooks and supplies , please notify the Customer Service desk at the Viking's Cove Campus Bookstore that you are being sponsored by Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing and use register 7 to check out. They will help you with the process and will directly bill the nursing school for the textbooks you purchased. If the cost of your textbooks and supplies exceeds your voucher allotment, you will need to pay that additional amount directly to the bookstore. If you spend less than the voucher amount, you will receive what was not spent in the refund check that is generated after your loans and grants for the semester have been processed. It is recommende d that you keep track of how much of your voucher you have spent and you may visit the 70 bookstore and purchase textbooks and supplies anytime during the voucher period . It is your responsibility to keep receipts. Returns and exchanges of textbooks will be subject to the policies of the Hudson Valley Community College Bookstore . Textbooks and supplies purchased with a voucher may not be returned for cash. If you have questions about the Textbook Voucher program, please contact the Bursar at 518-268-5028. 71 FINANCIAL AID Students seeking consideration for any of the financial aid programs administered through the School of Nursing must complete the \"Free Application for Federal Student Aid\" (FAFSA) and the electronic application process for New York State's Tuition Assista nce Program (TAP).

DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY: There are two types of financial aid at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing: Grants and Scholarships: These programs are forms of gift aid and do not have to be repaid. Educational Student Loans: Loans are available through the federal government and must be repaid. Eligibility Requirements : In order to qualify for federal, state or institutional financial aid, there are some basic eligibility requirements which must be met. Enrollment at least on a half-time basis (6 credits per semester) as a matriculated student working toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program. Please Note: Federal and NY State financial aid reg ulations require that the courses must be a part of the School of Nursing's required curriculum which includes the Nursing courses, the co- requisite courses and the directed elective courses. Confirmation of US citizenship or eligible non -citizen status. Satisfactory academic progress must be maintained. Regist ration with Selective Service, if required... Establishment of financial need for need based programs. 74 Not be in default on a student loan, or owe a repayment on a previous financial aid award recei ved at any institution. Valid Social Security number. Reporting Requirements: Any student enrolled for the Fall and/or Spring semesters must be reported to the National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS) whether or not they plan to take out loans for that semester, if they have previously taken out loans from same school or anoth er school in the past and are in repayment or deferment. Reporting involves notifying NSLDS of the status of the student including current semester begin and end dates, enrollment status (less than half time, half time, \u00be time, full time, approved leave of absence, withdrawn, graduated), length of the program (RN - 2 years) etc. Students who take a leave of absence or enroll less than half time (under 6 credit hours) during the Fall and/or Spring semester , will be required to complete an exit interview through studentloans.gov and may go into grace or repayment. For the summer semester, enrollment only needs to be reported for students who are at least half time status. If they are taking less than half time (under 6 credits) or nothing at all for the su mmer, then their status does not need to be reported for that semester. They will not need to complete an exit interview for summer. FINANCIAL NEED Financial Aid for Title IV (federal student aid) funds are awarded on the basis of \"need. \" College expens es (known as Cost of Attendance) include actual tuition and fees, the average cost for books, and the estimated cost for transportation , living expenses and other miscellaneous personal expenses . The student's ability to pay is calculated from family income , the size of the family, the number of family members in college , and family assets . The difference between Cost of Attendance and the student's ability to pay is the student's \"need\". Cost of Attendance : The table below illustrates the es timated expenses for a first year, full time RN student of different status: All numbers are U. S. Dollars. COMMUTER OUT OF STATE Tuition and Fees $9641 $11440 Living Expenses $11000 $80 75 VERIFICATION PROCESS The Department of Education uses a system of edits to select student financial aid applications (FAFSAs) for verification. This process involves the collection of additional supporting documentation to compare and correct inaccurate information that may have been supplied on the financial aid application. Students whose applications are selected for verif ication will be notified by the Financial Aid Office and informed of any additional documentation/forms that must be completed. Once the verification process is completed, any necessary changes will be made and the student's expected contribution will be recalculated. The Financial Aid Office will make the corrections and send notification to the student. In addition to the verification process, all student financial aid applications are compared with other databases to ensure accurate information and to flag potential problems. The matches include the Selective Service Agency files, Immigration and Naturalizations files, Social Security Administration files and National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS). Errors or problems are indicated on the st udent 's Student Aid Report OR ISIR and must be resolved prior to the disbursement of any federal funds. The Financial Aid Office will notify students of any database match problems and the process to resolve the issues. DEPENDENCY OVERRIDE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID This is for students classified as \"dependent\" by the U.S. Department of Education's definition of a dependent student. The college recognizes that the awarding of federal student aid is based on the assumption that the primary responsibility of meeting college expenses rests with the student and the student's parents. Using a nationwide need analysis formula, the federal government r equires both student and parent income and resources information in determining aid eligibility. The family's ability to pay for college is based on the information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Occasionally, due to \"unusual circumstances\", students should not be considered dependent. The federal government has given financial aid professionals authority to use their \"professional judgment' in determining if a dependency override is warranted in unusual circumstances. The dependent student can request a waiver of federal regulations requiring parental information if he/she can document why they should be considered independent. The student should contact the Financial Aid Direct or what required documentation will be requested for a Dependency Override as well as the policy and procedures guidelines. 76 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT The Privacy Act exists to protect your rights to confidentiality. All records and conversations between an aid applicant, his/h er family and the Financial Aid Office are strictly confidential and are entitled to the protection ordinarily given to a counseling relationship. NO information concerning a student's financial aid record may be released to anyone outside the Financial A id Office without written consent from the student and/or parent(s) except as circumstances/requirements may dictate (e.g. Reports of and to federal financial aid programs agencies, reports to Administrative Staff, which would normally have access to priv ileged information.) Please Note: You must submit a written request if you need information about your financial aid released to an outside agency or to another person. Federal Education Rights of Privacy Act (FERPA) The Federal Education Rights of Privacy Act (FERPA) protects your rights to confidentiality.

Please Note: Misre presentation, misreported information and/or altered documentation for the purpose of increasing your eligibility of fraudulently obtaining Federal or any other financial aid funds will result in the student being reported to the Office of Inspector General or the local law enforcement agency. 78 STANDARD OF SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP ) The definitions for Federal and State Financial Aid SAP are different. In addition, make sure you are familiar with the School's Academic Progress and Grading policy which is defined in the School of Nursing catalog. It i s different from the Financial Aid SAP policy. In order to remain a student in good academic standing and be eligible for most types of financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress. Students requesting Title IV federal financial aid must : Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0. GPAs are reviewed at the end of each semester. Students who fail to maintain the minimum GPA will be given ONE semester of \"Aid Probation\" in which they must achieve a 2.0 cumulative GPA. Make progress toward their degree as follows: Full Time: 24 credits per academic year \u00be Time: 18 credits per academic year \u00bd Time: 12 credits per academic year Fewer than 6 credits: complete all attempted c redits within two semesters. Repeated classes are not eligible to be counted as credits earned toward academic progress since each class can only be counted once. Students requesting/receiving financial aid are expected to complete their academic program w ithin a reasonable time frame as follows: Full Time : 3 academic years Part Time : 4 academic years Students dismissed from the school and later readmitted, are academically eligible for Title IV funds immediately . 79 150% Direct Subsidi zed Loan Limit ***NOTE: If you are a first time borrower or have paid off your prior loans and are now borrowing again after July 1, 2013, this Federal regulation applies to you.*** You will no longer be eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans once you have received Direct Subsidized Loans for the period of 150% of the published length of the borrower's current educational program. For the RN program, 150% is 3 years. If you lose eligibility of subsidized loans, you will also lose interest subsidy on subsid ized loans received on or after July 1 st, 2013 during all periods if you do not complete the program and continue enrollmen t in the same program OR enroll in another program of the same or shorter length. The only exception is if you complete the program and then go on to another one in longer length, you would not lose the subsidy. Loss of interest subsidy cannot be regained. The calculation of determining when 150% limit met is: Maximum eligibility period less total of subsidized usage periods equals r emaining eligibility period. The amount of subsidized is not based on the dollar amount - it is based on the amount of time you receive it. If your enrollment status is less than full -time, the calculated subsidized usage period is prorated for less than f ull-time enrollment. If you leave our program and go to another institution, the subsidized limit does not start over at 0% borrowed. If you do not borrow the full amount of subsidized offered to you, you will not be eligible for any unsubsidized loans. There will be a message on the FAFSA when you complete it to notify you and the school of any issues in regards to the 150% limit regulation. 80 APPEALS OF SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS STANDARDS Students have the right to appeal Satisfactory Academic Progr ess standards. However, the submission of an appeal is only a request and does not imply that a financial aid hold will be removed or that approval of the appeal is forthcoming. The appeal must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office in writing and shou ld demonstrate unusual circumstances beyond the student's control. Appeals must include the following information: Student's name, address, telephone number , and Social Security Number. Date of the appeal A signed letter from the student requesting a waiver of Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards.

The Federal Pell grant and/or TAP awards, if the student is eligible, are certified approximately five weeks into the semester and are credited to the student's account when the funding arrives. If the financial aid award is less than the account balance, the student will be billed for the remaining amount due on the account. If the financial aid award is more than the account balance, a refund check will be generated and disbursed to the student within fourteen days from the time the funds arrive. Students will be notified by email when the refund check is available. 82 SUMMER FINANCIAL AID Application Guideline/Deadline : March 1st.

In order to qualify for financial aid loan, the student must be registered for a total of at least six credits during the entire summer.

If the first Summer School session is less than half -time, the loan funds will be requested from the federal government no more than seven days prior to the start of enrollment for the second Summer School session. Students must be enrolled in the number of hours for which their financial aid is calculated and will be disbursed after confirmation that half -time enrollment has occurred. Students who fail to enroll for the minimum required hours will have their awards canceled and will become responsible for any outstanding charges. REFUNDS/REPAYMENT POLICY Adjustment of tuition and fees when a student withdraws from a course or from the program is determined beginning on the date on which the Dean of the School of Nursing receives the student's written notification. Please Note: A student who leaves the school unofficially (without formally submitting a written letter of resignation to the Dean of the School of Nursing) forfeits all rights to a refund or reduction of charges . Transcripts will not be released when the student has left the school unofficially if a balance due remains on the student's account. These regulations do not affect refunds the school makes to a student who withdraws from some classes but continues to be enrolled in the school. Students, who submit a formal letter of withdrawal to the School of Nursing, will receive a refund of tui tion, less non-refundable fees according to the following schedules below.

Earned Title IV Aid: Students earn their federal financial aid by attending classes. Federal regulations, according to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, require the School of Nursing to recalculate a student's financial aid eligibility if the student withdraws from or stops attending his/her classes before completing at least 60% of the semester. After the 60% point of the semester, 100% of the Tit le IV aid is considered \"earned\" by the student. The earned percentage is applied to the total amount of the Title IV grant and loan assistance that was disbursed (or could have been disbursed) to the student. Unearned Percentage : Any amount in excess of the allowed percentage must be returned to the appropriate Title IV program by the school, the student , or both. The school must return the lesser of the unearned Title IV assistance or an amount equal to the total liability incurred by the student multiplied by the unearned percentage. Tuition Liabilit y: If a student officially or unofficially withdraws after the end of the school's refund period, the student is liable for all his or her tuition and fees, even if the student's financial aid is decreased. If the student's financial aid previously covered his or her bill, but no longer covers it after the Return of Title IV Aid calculation, the student will be expected to pay for his or her outstanding tuition and fees. In addition, if the student receives a disbursement of financial aid, and the Return of Title IV Aid calculation shows that the student was not entitled to the funds, the student will be billed for the funds, and the overpayment information will be forwarded to the U. S. Department of Education. It will be the student's responsibility to repay the funds before he or she is eligible to receive any further federal student aid, even if the st udent attends another colleg e. This overpayment will appear on the Student Aid Report until the overpayment is repaid. 85 Definitions for Title IV Program; The following is an explanation of the difference between a refund and a repayment: Refund: The difference between moneys originally paid for institutional charges by financial aid and or cash payments and the amount retained by the institution after withdrawal. If a student received federal financial aid, a portion of the refund must be returned to those programs. Repayment: The amount that a student must pay back to the school if federal financial funds were received, in excess of institutional charges. The school will return the Student Financial Aid (SFA) program portion of the refund/repayment to the source of funding in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan Subsidized Federal Direct Loan Federal Plus Loan Federal Pell Grant Other sources Student The refund/repayment disbursal will be 100% to the SFA programs in order of the priority listed until the funds are exhausted. Determination of Date of Withdrawal Official Withdrawal: The date the student began the withdrawal process or the date the student officially notifies Student Services in writing that he/she is withdrawing from the program. The percentage of eligibility for federal financial aid will be directly related to the percentage of the semester completed. For example: if a student completes 10% of the semester, he/she will be eligible for 10% of his/her federal financial aid. If he/she completes 30% of the semester, he/she will receive 30% of his/her financial aid etc. Unofficial Withdrawal : If the student leaves school without giving notice, the student's last recorded day of attendance as documented by the school will be used. In the absence of attendance records, the midpoint of the semester will be used. Process for Determining Refunds/Repayments Student's date of withdrawal will be calculated using the federal withdrawal record. For both Federal Financial Aid Recipients and Non- Federal Financial Aid Recipients the Refund policy of the school will be applied for tuition, fees and other charges Repayment/refunds will be determined by using the federal software provided by the U. S. Department of Education governing the money involved. Allocation of a refund/repayment to the SFA program sources will be within 45 days of the withdrawal date to the federal programs, within 60 days to the lender and within 30 days to the student. If a repayment is required by the student, he/she will be notified of the need to repay the Federal Student Aid programs. 86 Verification of Process When a student withdraws from the school, the calculati on work sheet will be completed and filed in the student's Financial aid folder/billing records as a record of this policy's application and the record of returned refund/repayment as required. All students will have the following documentation attached to their final bill: Withdrawal Record - with copy of change of status/written note or attendance sheet. Refund calculation sheet If necessary - refund/repayment/prorata sheets per federal policy Samples of all forms are available upon request. Once a refund/repayment is determined, t he Bursar will attach all paper work to the bill, and process through accounting so that distribution is made within 30 days of the refund/ repayment calculation date.
