Or swallow your sunscreen? Or smear your mascara on your gluten-free toast? Heck no! So why do you put these toxic chemicals on your skin? Our skin is our largest organ. In many ways, it's incredibly strong and resilient. But what most people don't realize is this: whatever you put on your skin gets absorbed straight into your bloodstream. Yep, your skin is literally 'eating' all those lotions and potions you're lathering on. Working in TV and as a dancer, I would get bags of toxic crap given to me, which I used for many years. I had creams, oils, and potions for just about everything \u2014 my beauty cupboard looked like a pharmacy! I fully believed that by loading my skin up with as many fancy products as I could, I was doing the best thing to keep it clear and healthy. (Ha!) When I began to fuel my body with the most natural, high-quality food I could find \u2014 and saw the massive difference that made to my health \u2014 it dawned on me that maybe I should try a similar approach with my skin: if processed crap was no good for my insides, maybe it was no good for my outsides either. You see, when you use toxic products, not only are they bad for you but your body has to work extra hard to try and get rid of all those chemicals. It puts loads of unnecessary stress on your system and means you're wasting your precious resources on detoxification rather than other more important things. In fact, if your body wasn't being overwhelmed by all those chemical nasties, that energy could be put to better use: making your hair, skin and nails beautiful and strong from the inside out. Once I made the shift towards natural, toxin-free beauty products, I never looked back. My skin has never been better, and my hair and nails are stronger and shinier than they've ever been. And now that I am aware of this issue, I know I have a choice \u2014 I can choose to waste my money on toxic products that do nothing but over-promise and pollute my body and the environment, or I can vote with my dollar and use products that are going to nourish and support my body. I know what I choose. And you have the power to choose too. So if most of the stuff on the shelves is total crapola, then what products could you be using? I get asked all the time what makeup and beauty products I use, so today I'm going to be sharing all my go-to faves. I've also lined up some of my expert friends \u2014 industry leaders who really understand what works and what doesn't \u2014 to share their favourite toxic-free beauty products. Before we dive in check out this podcast on [How To Live A Low Tox Life](https://melissaambrosini.com/podcast/how-to-live-a-low-tox-life-alexx-stuart/) or this one [Going Toxic Free](https://melissaambrosini.com/podcast/going-toxic-free-zero-waste-with-tracey-bailey/). And check out the app [Think Dirty](https://thinkdirtyapp.com/) to find out just how toxic your products truly are. Now let's dive in... My Top Holistic Beauty Tips Makeup I have a less is more approach when it comes to beauty and beauty products. I like to keep things really simple. So here are a few of my current faves. Foundation: and gloss: [HAN](https://cleanbeautymarket.com.au/collections/han-skincare-cosmetics/products/lip-gloss-3) Hair Care You can read all about my Toxic Free Healthy Hair Tips [here](https://melissaambrosini.com/low-tox/toxic-free-healthy-hair-tips/). I don't colour my hair and wash it once a week. I let my hair dry naturally and try not to blow dry or use any heating tools on my hair unless I really need to for a photoshoot or event. I am currently using [Everescents shampoo and conditioner.](https://www.everescents.com.au/products/organic-lavender-shampoo-conditioner/) I have used this for years now and love it. Body Abhyanga: Rosebrook cleanser](https://joshrosebrook.com/#), [exfoliator](https://joshrosebrook.com/collections/skin/products/active-enzyme-exfoliator), and [cream](https://joshrosebrook.com/collections/skin/products/nutrient-day-cream-tinted-with-spf-30-non-nano-zinc-oxide), and I love adding a drop of [Frankincense essential oil](https://doterra.myvoffice.com/nickandmelissa/#/). I use [organic coconut oil](https://amzn.to/2ZNx7vz) and a cloth to take off my mascara. I use [Tea Tree essential oil](https://doterra.myvoffice.com/nickandmelissa/#/) on spots and the next day they are gone. I love this [Primal Life Organics Exfoliator](https://www.primallifeorganics.com/products/dirtyex-sweet-revenge). Teeth Amber Vizzaccaro: Alternative Medicine Practitioner Makeup [EVXO Organic Mineral Foundation](https://amzn.to/386laUw) - This foundation is the best combination of natural/clean ingredients and effectiveness that I've ever seen. It provides great coverage, feels lightweight, and smells like vanilla! EVXO is also a vegan cosmetics company, which I love. [100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Lengthening Mascara](https://amzn.to/3a9o5hb) - I adore this mascara because it is one of the few that are truly non-toxic, and it works! [Cocokind Macabeet Tinted Moisture Stick](https://amzn.to/3a9w3qq) - This is great to use as a chapstick that will give you a bit of subtle and natural-looking color pop. You can also use it as a cheek tint. Hair Care I don't use any products for my hair other than shampoo and conditioner. Hair health is a reflection of the state of the liver and the adrenals, so caring for these organs is number one. The best supplement for hair health is [living silica.](https://amzn.to/2FMWXq7) 100% PURE Honey & Coconut [Shampoo](https://amzn.to/35OQiGN) and [Conditioner](https://amzn.to/35VvbCu) - You can actually pronounce and recognize every single ingredient in these products. They are TRULY clean, which is so hard to find, even in the world of natural beauty! Body [Dr. Bronner Soap](https://amzn.to/35UISS8) - These are the best all-natural body soaps, hands down! [Periobrite Toothpaste](https://amzn.to/36UjFc0) - This toothpaste is a game-changer. It's fluoride-free, tastes great, and is highly effective. [Dry Brush](https://amzn.to/2TmaD3p) - My forever favourite tool for body exfoliation, promoting lymphatic circulation, and enhancing detoxification. [Cliganic Organic Jojoba Body Oil](https://amzn.to/35TetDU) - I've found jojoba to be the best-feeling oil on my skin. It's deeply hydrating but lightweight enough to not leave any oily residue. I especially love applying some all over, letting it absorb into my skin for a few monies, and then hopping in the shower - the water rinses off any excess oil, and then you leave the shower with perfectly hydrated, non-oily skin. Face [Sovereign Silver Gel](https://amzn.to/38a8zj5) - Antibacterial and therefore helps prevent breakouts. I use this like a serum on clean skin before applying anything else. [Annmarie Skin Care Aloe-Herb Facial Cleanser](https://amzn.to/30jnsNm) - I've been using this cleanser for years, and I'm still just as much in love with it. All Annmarie products feel like you're putting nature directly on your face. [Josh Rosenbrook Hydrating Accelerator](https://amzn.to/36U6M1t) - This is a pure herbal tonic for your face - so refreshing to spritz on! [Pure Pomegranate Seed Oil](https://amzn.to/2QTyDJz) - I use this as a make up remover and moisturizer, and it is heavenly. The oil's texture is thicker than jojoba and provides a deeper level of hydration, healing, and protection for the face - which is under a lot more stress than other areas of the skin. The shells/skins of fruits like bananas, papayas, and mangoes - these are the BEST masks you could ever use on your face for a vitamin, mineral, enzyme, and nutrient infusion. Our skin absorbs everything we put on it and the average woman wears 515 chemicals a day. Jenna Zoe: Human Design Expert Makeup I don't really wear much makeup every day. I curl my eyelashes, and for a more made-up look I'll use [Ilia's colour sticks](https://iliabeauty.com/collections/multi-stick) on my lips and cheeks. I like 'Cheek to Cheek' for a subtle red that looks like you're either blushing or just done a workout, and 'At Last' for a soft pink. [Lawless](https://lawlessbeauty.com) is an AMAZING brand that does the best eye palettes which I love, lip glosses, lipsticks, the whole gamut. I love what they're about. Hair Care I love [Acure's](https://amzn.to/3eIoERp) clean hair products so much because they actually work and they smell great! They have a divine Argan Oil and Pumpkin seed shampoo and conditioner that I use most often, but they have different kinds for different hair types and all are divine. The scent is so important to me because it really sets a mood. Also, I colour my hair and their shampoo doesn't wash the colour out or make it too brassy. Body Coconut Oil doesn't really moisturise my skin enough, so I need something a little thicker. I love [Simply Divine Botanicals Body Butters](https://amzn.to/2VvPG6U) - they have them in all kinds of scents like Lemongrass, Lavender, Nectarine, etc - each made of avocado butter, shea butter, and a blend of different layered scents. They are divine! My favourite is the How Now Brown Cacao and the [lavender](https://amzn.to/2Y9SMPV). Face I'm super simple when it comes to my face. I had chronic acne in my teens and twenties and a nutritionist explained to me that everything we put on our skin has to be processed by our liver, which if you have acne, your liver is already overburdened with toxins so you want to make its job easy! I wash my face with a damp facecloth morning and night and then follow it with an oil. Right now I'm using the [Leahlani Siren Serum](https://www.leahlaniskincare.com/collections/serums/products/siren-serum), but I also sometimes use Olive Oil, Pomegranate Oil, or Argan Oil. I rotate depending on my mood or if I pick something up that has lovely essential oils in it. Tamara Dickson: The Little Switch Makeup The clean beauty scene has exploded with so many wonderful choices and it's hard to narrow down all my favourites. [RMS](https://amzn.to/3axMKuE) does clean beauty so well. Their entire range is used and loved by many a green makeup artist and low toxic living beings. The range is non-nano, soy-free and outstanding for performance. [Prisma Palette](https://prismapalette.com/) are and volume-enhancing mascara, [Sappho](https://cleanbeautymarket.com.au/product/mascara-regular-black/) provides luscious lashes without the usual mica, talc, silicones, DEA, TEA and are low mineral making this an excellent choice for the delicate eye area. It also removes with water and does not smudge. Hair Care [Tabitha James Kraan hair oil](https://www.tabithajameskraan.com/organic-haircare/scented-hair-oil/)is a great multi-use product for dry and damaged hair. It gives hair a super shine, increases manageability when heat styling and is a great treatment. Body When I feel like being lazy and want to combine a delicious smelling bath and body oil I always reach for [Solitude bath cookies](https://solitudebodymind.com/). The surrender blend is full of skin-loving moisture and smells so great I don't need to apply any fragrance afterwards. Search for products free from phthalates and silicones. For a clean, all nasties free body wash I love [Two Winged Fruit](https://www.twowingedfruit.com.au/). This liquid is made using traditional soap making methods and gives a beautiful soft, yet bubbly wash. It's also non-drying and doubles as hand wash so great value. For those special occasions /date nights, I love [Nancy Evans Body oil](https://www.rosehipskincare.com/product/organic-rosehip-body-oil-125ml/) - put simply it's sex in a bottle! The number of comments I receive from men and women when I wear this blows my mind. Make sure you look for products without mineral oil, PEGs and fragrance to help limit your toxic load. Face For a great clean range you can't go past [KORA Organics](https://koraorganics.com/) for clean and effective skincare. As a treat for your problem areas, I love [Osea Hylauronic Sea serum](https://cleanbeautymarket.com.au/brand/osea/) which literally changes your skin! I also love [Reset Beauty Barrier Balm](https://www.resetbeautyaustralia.com/shop) for any super dry or irritated areas. Choose products that are vegan or cruelty-free, contain no SLS, SLES or triclosan to help with any irritated skin Jacquier-Parr: Flora Organica Makeup [La Mav Organic BB Cream](https://lamav.com/products/organic-bb-creme?variant=52326877515).This wonder cream is essential all-rounder. It's a primer, tinted moisturiser, concealer and SPF that will nourish and protect your skin from premature ageing. It's also the first organic BB cream in Australia certified by the Australian Government! [100% Pure Lip and Cheek Stain](https://amzn.to/3bvJUrD). Coloured from rich red cherry pigments, this is a 2-in-1 lip and cheek tint that gives the most gorgeous natural colour and is even sweat resistant, so will survive a gym session or really long days at the office. Hair care [Acure Organics Moroccan Argan + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo & Conditioner](https://amzn.to/2S0uK61).This is daily hair repair on another level! Organic Argan and Sea Buckthorn oil deliver a triple moisture system. I love that the shampoo also gets a good foam going as it makes my hair feel clean (but without the chemicals!) [Rahua Omega 9 Hair Mask](https://rahua.com/products/omega-9-hair-mask). My hair SOS go-to product! A good hair treatment actually repairs your hair, rather than pretending to and coating it with silicon! This mask has Ungurahua Oil, which is rich in omega-9 and is made up of tiny molecules that penetrate into the core of each strand to heal and fortify the hair. Body [100% Pure Vanilla Bean Shower Gel](https://amzn.to/2S0v9p3). This smells so good I almost want to eat it. It has Tahitian vanilla, skin hydrating honey and organic, antioxidant-rich Green Coffee that helps increase circulation, which is especially good in winter! [Lavanila The Healthy Deodorant](https://amzn.to/34X8yil).I have tried just about every natural deodorant under the sun and this one I am absolutely obsessed with (sounds weird, I know, but it's true!). It comes in a solid stick formula that feels so silky to use and keeps me not only smelling good, but dry as well. Face [100% Pure Brightening Scrub + Mask](https://amzn.to/2VwdMP6). Winter is the time to nourish and repair your skin, so using a great exfoliator and mask is a must, and I love that this does both. It has vitamin C, lemon juice and strawberries to brighten your skin, which will help treat any sun spots or pigmentation you may have developed over summer and give your skin a lovely glow. [Dr Alkaitis Organic Day Cream](https://amzn.to/2VugKTU). This is such a unique product as it uses a blend of organically grown cold-pressed shea butter, St Johns Wort, pure vitamin E, Echinacea, horsetail and marigold blossoms that all work together to make this an incredibly effective moisturiser. Irene Falcone: Nourished life Makeup I actually don't wear much makeup at all, just BB cream, mascara and a lip balm! [100% Pure black tea mascara](https://amzn.to/3eJQm05) - This is one of my best selling products and a personal favourite! It's 100% natural (not very many mascaras can claim this), with pigment from black tea leaves and blueberries. It's super lengthening plus because it's all-natural, it nourishes your eyelashes instead of drying them out! Also from 100% Pure, they have an amazing [BB Cream](https://amzn.to/3ar3S5f) which provides great coverage and a really natural, dewy finish that is perfect for everyday wear \u2014 and it's packed with vitamins and antioxidants. I do love a little pop of colour on my lips, my everyday lip balm is the [Hurraw](https://amzn.to/3eLGHpB)! Cherry tinted lip balm (this is the first organic product I found, the first one I ever stocked and 9 years later it is still what I wear every day!) Haircare I am obsessed with the brand Ethique, they are 100% zero waste and one small bar of shampoo replaces a whole 1-litre plastic bottle and they work just as well as any salon brand shampoo & condition! I live near the beach and my hair easily goes brassy so I use \"Tone It Down\" [natural purple Shampoo bar](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/natural-hair-products/2774423/ethique-tone-it-down-purple-solid.html) and [matching conditioner](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/organic-shampoo/2774431/ethique-tone-it-down-purple-solid.html). They even have these plastic-free bar holders so they don't go mushy how cute is this [Aqua one](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/natural-soap-body-wash/1937685/ethique-in-shower-container-aqua.html). Body For the body I use the [Kora Organics Body Wash](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/natural-soap-body-wash/1888880/kora-organics-essential-body-wash.html) and [matching lotion.](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/body-moisturiser/468794/kora-organics-enriched-body-lotion.html) I have recently discovered [this new certified organic fake tan](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/organic-fake-tan/2774862/three-warriors-self-tan-mousse.html) and it is unreal, the best colour I have ever found (and I've tried them all). Face I keep skincare really basic, I use this [Madara Organic Milk Cleanser](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/natural-facial-cleanser/687772/madara-organic-skincare-cleansing-milk.html). It is so good, so many milk or cream cleansers make my skin feel congested, and I cant use foam because my skin is super dry so this is perfect as it really cleans without stripping my skin. And it smells of mild jasmine (my fav scent). I then just use the [Biologi Hydration Face & Body Serum](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/skincare-moisturiser/1785621/biologi-bf-hydration-face-body-serum.html) as a toner, serum, night cream and day cream! And then at night after this dries I put the [Kora Noni Oil](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/organic-facial-serums/924842/kora-organics-noni-glow-face-oil.html) on top and I think I look better now at 44 than I did at 34! I also take the [WelleCo The Super Elixir Alkalising Greens](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/green-powders/542622/welleco-super-elixir-alkalising-greens.html) every single day which gives me a wonderful burst of energy. Emmily Banks: Organic Makeup Artist Makeup [Inika Foundation](https://amzn.to/2Kt3w3O) is the best I have tried by far! The formula is beautiful and lightweight but can also be built to provide good coverage if needed. It smells divine, lets your skin breathe and is certified organic \u2014 so no nasties! A flawless, glowing complexion is number one in my books! [Ere Perez natural Bronzer \"blush\"](https://amzn.to/3eFRVvY) made with rice powder is another favourite. It comes with two shades in one compact, has great pigment and keeps your skin looking naturally sun-kissed! Ere Perez also has an amazing natural mascara made with almond oil, it has great staying power and doesn't irritate the eyes like most mainstream toxic mascara ingredients do. Hair Care [Mukti](http://www.muktiorganics.com/) Shampoo & Conditioner are my current favourites for hair care \u2014 all Natural, organic and herbal-infused. Mukti has helped to keep my hair naturally clean, strong and smelling delicious!

Not only can it be ingested for health, but also used as an all-over body moisturiser, hair treatment, makeup remover and more! Focusing on skin nourishment, it has amazing deep moisturising properties due to the similarity of molecular structure to the skin's own bio-support network. It rapidly hydrates, conditions and shields your skin to prevent moisture loss and even protects against UV rays! Plus it smells sooooo goooood! [Perfect Potions natural Perfumes](http://www.perfectpotion.com.au/shop/Products/SearchResults?searchText=perfume), body sprays and oils are a must in my day-to-day beauty regime. Chakra Balancing mist is my all time favourite scent, infused with lavender, geranium, rose, lime, patchouli and more, it's a winning combination and also very calming and balancing for your chakras. Face [Organic Rosehip Oil ](https://amzn.to/2RXSUy0)\u2014 I use this daily as a face moisturiser, highlighter or mixed in with foundation for a radiant dewy glow. Rich in fatty acids, vitamins and antioxidants, it's like a multivitamin for your skin. It helps combat wrinkles, scars and fine lines and helps to heal skin conditions. Plus, it's usually only $20 per bottle and lasts for several months! THE BEST. [Hurraw Lip Balms & Tints](https://amzn.to/3eLGHpB)\u2014 I lather these balms on my lips several times per day. They contain premium organic, raw and vegan ingredients including jojoba, coconut oil, cocoa butter, almond oil and more. So creamy, smooth and nourishing for dry lips. The 'cherry' flavor also has a great tint to keep lips looking rosy! There you have it, beautiful. It's super easy to find amazing products that are good for you, and Mother Earth and that do the job. And remember to always read the ingredients list on everything you pick up.
