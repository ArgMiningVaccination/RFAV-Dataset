Our goal is to create a platform to explore the frontiers in imaging technologies, discuss common challenges, and strategize how the global imaging community can build a common network to tackle the era of \"big data\" as well as rapid technological advances in microscopy. Presentations will cover topics such as emerging microscopy tools, probe and biosensor development, data management and analyses, outreach strategies, and global collaborative partnership. We will also include breakout sessions for smaller group discussions and hands-on demonstrations of the latest imaging tools at Janelia's Advanced Imaging Center. Attendees are expected to either give a short talk or present a poster. Due to limited space, applicants will be selected based on their statement of interest. In lieu of submitting a formal research \"abstract\" in the online registration system, please include a statement describing what you could contribute to conference discussions, and if/why you regard networking of imaging centers (inter)nationally to be important / less important. We specifically seek applicants who can share (i) technical know-how in imaging technologies/methods, (ii) experience in data-handling infrastructure and/or image analysis, (iii) organizational skills in building unique imaging center, (iv) experience in assembling regional/national/international imaging consortia/communities, (v) unique branding and outreach strategy to attract (external) users, (vi) innovative strategies in disseminating novel technologies to their user base, or (vii) other topics the imaging center community may be interested in learning about. IMPORTANT: Please submit only one application per imaging center. Janelia conferences are small and highly interactive. In order to limit the size and still be as inclusive as possible, we can accept only one person per group.
