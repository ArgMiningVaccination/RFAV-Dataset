Posted August 10, 2021 | [ Reviewed by Abigail Fagan ](/nz/docs/editorial-process) Key points - An international study on anti-vaccination attitudes prior to COVID-19 shows that four sources can contribute to vaccine resistence. - Contributors to vaccine resistance include conspiratorial beliefs, disgust, reactance, and individualism. - Aligning oneself with beliefs of anti-vaxxers and then sharing newly relevant arguments may help shift their mindset. Let's say you've been vaccinated against [COVID-19](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/coronavirus-disease-2019), as has every eligible individual in your family, except one. Try as you might, you cannot [guilt](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/guilt)-trip, provide evidence to, or simply plead with this person to get on board with the rest of your clan. It upsets you that at family gatherings, this person (who refuses to wear a mask) continues to pose a risk to everyone, but especially children. Indeed, this person has young children, and still won't take what seems to you to be an obvious expression of parental love and concern. At the last family celebration, a major milestone for an older relative (and held outdoors despite bad weather), you tried to reason with this person. This isn't the first time you've done so, but it was definitely the most upsetting. This relative starts screaming at you and insulting your attitudes, from political to social. As you try, objectively, to provide data showing the importance of vaccinations to stem the pandemic, this person becomes even more infuriated, throwing back in your face some pretty ridiculous statistics, comparing the risk of COVID and homicides for young children. Despite all this, you have what might be a perverse desire to continue to maintain a relationship with this person, if for no other reason than that you know they'll be at future family gatherings. You think there must be some kind of inroad into that person's belief system, if only you could find the right argument. Or, might it be possible that this person is just so self-centered and sure of their own mental superiority that this will never come to pass? What Won't Work to Change Someone's Mind The area of research on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is still, given the recency of the phenomenon, in its [early stages](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/blog/fulfillment-any-age/202105/3-ways-change-the-mind-your-vaccine-hesitant-loved-one). However, anti-vaccine attitudes are more than a 2021 problem. In a 2018 research paper, University of Queensland's Matthew Hornsey and colleagues noted the rise in incidence of some communicable diseases such as measles, mumps, and pertussis as associated with a rise in anti-immunization activism. Their study provides an object lesson in how to understand why, in 2021, anti-immunization attitudes have taken hold in the face of a larger, and clearly more lethal, global situation. The Australian authors begin their investigation by immediately dismissing the idea that you can change an anti-vaccine person's attitudes or behavior by providing scientific evidence. Although it is \"tempting\" to \"keep repeating the evidence, and to do so as clearly and deftly as possible,\" the problem is not that these people lack the evidence or even the [education](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/education) to understand the evidence. Furthermore, continuing to repeat the risk of not being vaccinated can have a \"boomerang\" effect and actually increase vaccine resistance. The reason that this approach, known as explication, doesn't work, according to Hornsey et al., is because the vaccine resistant are engaging in a form of [motivated reasoning](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/motivated-reasoning) that leads them to selectively interpret data and other information. Hauling out reams of statistics, then, is an approach destined to fail. You'll need, then, to get to the source of a person's motivated reasoning if you have any hope of changing their mind. 4 Possible Sources of Vaccine Resistance The Queensland authors, in reviewing the body of anti-vaccination research prior to COVID-19, suggest that the motivated reasoning that maintains this resistance comes from four sources. As you read each one, see whether it applies to your family member, or perhaps others in your social circle who pose this challenge (or, maybe, you?). Conspiratorial Beliefs There's a great deal in the news about conspiracy theories, and no shortage of them when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccines. Defining a conspiracy theory as the worldview that \"it is common for shadowy networks of people with malevolent intentions to execute mass hoaxes on the public in near-perfect secrecy,\" Hornsey et al. point out that these worldviews are highly related to [mistrust](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/trust) of science. Disgust As hard as the anti-vaccination people may try to pretend this isn't a factor, it's possible that they just don't like needles. They then build their attitudes in such a way as to receive \"permission to avoid the triggers for their disgust.\" All of that bluster about the evils of science could be a cover-up for this admission of what they perceive as psychological weakness. [Career](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/career)Essential Reads Reactance Some people just like to stand out from the crowd. When it comes to the vaccine, these non-conformists want to go against the trend because it's part of their [identity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/identity). Their \"anti-science\" beliefs establish them as someone who \"is skeptical of consensus views and intolerant of people telling them how to think.\" Individualism/Egalitarianism Much of the vaccine efforts in the media focus on the need for everyone to do their part to stop the pandemic and if not for themselves, then for those they love. However, for people who fight against the vaccine, this won't work. According to Hornsey and his colleagues, moving beyond non-conformism, the individualistic attitudes held by these people lead them to \"think it is preferable for individuals to make decisions for themselves,\" even if others suffer as a result. Testing the Four-Source Model Each one, several, or perhaps all of these sources may seem to hold value as an explanation of the anti-vaccine people in your life. From the study, you can learn not only how to see which ones come closest to the mark in your personal life, but also in society at large. The online sample of 5,323 participants was drawn from 24 countries plus Hong Kong. The survey questionnaires were translated into the language of the participant's country and various demographics were obtained as potential correlates. Below are sample items from each scale: Conspiratorial beliefs: Rate these statements on a 1-5 scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) - A powerful and secretive group known as the New World Order is planning to eventually rule the world through an autonomous world government, which would replace sovereign governments. - Princess Diana's death was not an accident but rather an organized assassination by members of the British royal family, who disliked her. Disgust: Rate the degree of disgust you would feel on a 1-4 scale if exposed to: - Having blood drawn from your arm - Handling a hypodermic needle - Receiving an injection in the arm Reactance: Rate yourself on these items from 1-5 (strongly disagree to strongly agree): - I become angry when my freedom of choice is restricted. - I resist the attempts of others to influence me. - When someone forces me to do something, I feel like doing the opposite. Individualism-Egalitarianism: The two components of this factor are reflected in the following items which you can rate on a 1-6 scale (strongly disagree-strongly agree): - The government interferes far too much in our daily lives. - It's a mistake to ask society to help every person in need. - We have gone too far in pushing equal rights in this country. How Do the Four Sources of Anti-Vaccine Attitudes Measure Up? The main outcome measure in the study was a measure of anti-vaccination beliefs with items such as \"Children get more vaccinations than are good for them.\" The researchers also assessed whether participants were concerned that a vaccine might not protect them or their children. Putting all these components into a statistical model and combining data from all countries, the individualism/egalitarianism factor only added a slight amount to the predictive equation. Political ideology also served as a significant predictor, with people holding more conservative beliefs being less acceptant of vaccines, much as is being seen now with COVID-19. The strongest predictor of all was conspiratorial beliefs; as the authors note, this finding \"helps contextualize why corrective information and myth-busting about vaccinations has tended to be either ineffective or counterproductive.\" You may still feel that [personality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/personality) and social attitudes remain important, and perhaps can explain some of the strong [anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/anger) and outrage you hear when you try to convince the anti-vaccine people you know. However, Hornsey et al. suggest that, first, you have to get past this conspiratorial mindset. Rather than fight it, join it, and make the argument that \"vested interests can conspire to obscure the benefits of vaccination and exaggerate the dangers.\" Then you can move on to those other two factors. Point out that it's conformist to go along with the anti-vaccination movement which in itself is high-pressure and seeks allegiance. This can work against the reactance factor. Unpeeling these layers, then get to the [fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/fear) of needles and all things medical. Now you can ask them whether they'd rather get a shot or two, or be hospitalized for days or weeks, possibly requiring a ventilator. Reminders of the results of [ non-vaccination by people ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/node/1165008/preview)who make their deathbed confessions about regretting their decision can become a part of this approach. The idea that you \"tailor interventions that are congenial to those underlying motivations\" is known as the jiu-jitsu approach, as the authors note, meaning that you align with your opponents rather than fight them. By identifying which of these factors is most prominent in the people you know, go in and move in the same direction. This approach, as in actual jiu-jitsu, takes the person off guard and can also help lower the temperature of your interactions around this tough topic. To sum up, you may feel frustrated, angry, and even defeated after an argument with the anti-vaccine people you know. You may believe that nothing will change their mind other than actually getting the disease themselves. The Australian study can help provide you with clues to a strategy that can help turn the vaccine-resistant to the vaccine-acceptant. References Hornsey, M., Harris, E. A., & Fielding, K. (2018).
