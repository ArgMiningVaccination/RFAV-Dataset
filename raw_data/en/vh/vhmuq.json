EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective for sales occurring on or after July 1, 1999. STATUTORY AUTHORITY: Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a712-412(48), as amended by 1999 Conn. Pub. Acts 173, \u00a718. BACKGROUND: The 1999 General Assembly expanded Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a712-412(48) by adding a number of categories of nonprescription drugs and medicines to the exemption. (Prescription drugs and medicines, diabetic supplies and certain medical equipment are exempt under separate provisions.) Previous exemption. Before July 1, 1999, the nonprescription drug and medicine exemption included: - vitamin concentrates; - products intended to be taken for coughs and colds; - laxatives; - aspirin and other drugs or medicines having pharmacological effects similar to those of aspirin and generally classified as internal analgesics; - antacids; and - any medication prepared as an ointment or solution to be used in a person's eyes for the care and treatment of any disease of the eyes. New additions to the exemption. The amendment to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a712-412(48) in 1999 Conn. Pub. Acts 173, \u00a718 adds the following items to the exemption: mineral concentrates; dietary supplements; natural or herbal medicines; asthma or nose medications. The amendment specifically excludes from the exemption cosmetics, dentifrices, mouthwash, shaving and hair care products, soaps and deodorants. The new amendment specifies that the exemption applies to drugs and medicines for use in or on the human body. Previously, most of the items in the exemption were exempt only if sold for internal use, but not for topical or external use.

Internal drugs and medicines include but are not limited to pills, tablets, capsules, creams, ointments, drops, liquids, lozenges, powders, syrups, elixirs, solutions, sprays and suppositories.

TAXABLE ITEMS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE EXEMPTION: The 1999 legislative amendment to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a712-412(48) specifically excludes several categories of items from the exemption.

Products that are marketed as items in these categories remain subject to sales and use taxes, even if they contain drugs or medicines that are listed in the exemption.
