There is an emphasis on manual treatments including manipulation or adjustment1. By restoring normal function to the musculoskeletal system ch iropractors can play a major part in relieving disorders and any accompanying pain or discomfort arising from accidents, stress, lack of exercise, poor posture, illness and everyday wear and tear. Chiropractors take a biopsychosocial approach to health an d wellbeing; this means that they consider the phy sical, psychological and social aspects of health . This approach is consistent with the World Health Organization 's definition of health2. Chiropractic has existed as a health profession in Europe since th e early part of the twentieth century. For over 80 years it has been represented in Europe on a supra - national level by the European Chiropractors' Union. Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union3 demands that 'a high level of h uman health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities '. It further states that ' Union action...shall be directed towards 1 World Federation of Chiropractic definition of chiropractic , 2001 2 The World Health Organization defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the abse nce of disease or infirmity . Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19 -22 June, 1946, signed on the 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of th e World Health Organization, no 2, page 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948. The Definition has not been amended since 1948. 3 Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (1957). Official Journal of the European Unio n C115/50 4 improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health .' Significantly, the Treaty goes on to state, ' The Union shall encourage co -operation between the Member States in the areas referred to in this Article and, if necessary, lend support to thei r action. It shall in particular encourage co -operation between the Member States to improve the complementarity of their services in cross border areas '. In 2007, the EU adopted a comprehensive Health Strategy4. This set out three strategic objectives in order to meet the major challenges facing health in the EU: 1. Fostering good health in an ageing Europe; 2. Protecting citizens from health threats; 3. Supporting dynamic health systems and new technologies. One of the key themes of the Health Strategy is to cr eate systems to support dynamic and sustainable health systems. This necessitates actions to promote health and prevent disease throughout life. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010)5 is the largest ever study to describe the global distribut ion and causes of a wide array of major disease, injuries and health risk factors. Musculoskeletal conditions were shown to be the second greatest cause of disability globally. They affect over 1.7 billion people worldwide and have the fourth greatest impa ct on the overall health of the world population, considering both death and disability. GBD 2010 showed that that low back pain is the leading cause of disability and that osteoarthritis is one of the fastest growing conditions. There are calls around th e world for policy changes to address the growing burden of musculoskeletal conditions in general and spinal pain in particular. With the burden having 4 Together for Heath: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013. COM 2007 630 final, Brussels.

The Lancet 2012 December 15; 380 (9859): 2163 -2196 5 grown by over 45% in the past 20 years, it is critical that emerging health professions such as chiropra ctic are included as part of a solution to what is an endemic health concern. The provision of chiropractic care varies widely throughout Europe. While in some nations chiropractic is established and the public has access to state -reimbursed services from chiropractors, in others chiropractic is unrecognised, unregulated and marginalised. With in excess of 5000 chiropractors practising in Europe to internationally accepted standards of education, the profession is well placed to contribute to the health of European citizens and the promotion of musculoskeletal health. This paper sets out the status of chiropractic in Europe. It is designed to be a living document, which will be updated as new developments in health policy, research, legislative frameworks and chiropractic education are introduced. 6 Foreword Chiropractic is represented in over 90 countries throughout the world. From relatively primitive beginnings, it has evolved as a profession such that there are now in excess of 100,00 0 chiropractors worldwide. The European Chiropractors' Union (ECU) is a federation of 20 member national associations. As its President, I am proud to lead an organisation that represents the chiropractic profession on a supranational level and is committ ed to its development in Europe. With a focus on legislation, regulation, education and research , the ECU seeks to promote access to safe and effective chiropractic services throughout Europe. It is my vision for chiropractic to be available to all Europe an citizens, regardless of their ability to pay. Its emergence as a profession committed to high standards of education, research and cost -effective healthcare means that in a society where musculoskeletal conditions and associated disability contribute so massively to the burden of disease, chiropractic should be included in the health systems of every European country. I hope that this position paper will help inform policy -makers and assisting them in recognising the contribution that chiropractic can and does make to the health of Europeans. \u00d8ystein Ogre DC ECU President May 2013 7 European Chiropractors' Union The European Chiropractors' Union (ECU) is a federation of 20 member national associations (see Table 1). The ECU was established in 1932 by Belgium, Denmark, Great Britain and Switzerland with the aims of promoting and expanding chiropractic in Europe and the welfare of practising chiropractors. It currently represents the interests of approximately 5000 chiropractors across Europe . The General Council of the ECU is made up of one representative from each of the Union members. It elects an Executive Co uncil, which currently consists of a President, two Vice-Presidents, a Secretary and a Treasurer6. The ECU is registered in the Netherlands. It maintains offices in London, where it employs the 6 Pictured is the 2012 -2013 ECU Executive Counci l.

Mission statement The ECU is established to promote the development of chiropractic in Europe as well as to pursue the interests of chiropractic as a science and a profession by research, teachi ng, publications and research activities. It represents the chiropractic profession on a supranational level. Objectives 1. To secure legislation in European countries that do not currently have it ; 2. To harmonise legislation across Europe that conforms to an d embraces the ECU's professional and educational standards; 3. To promote patient safety and the quality and accessibility of chiropractic healthcare in Europe; 4. To support the establishment of full time, university based education programmes to Masters level that conform to the European Council on Chiropractic Education (ECCE) standards. 5. To represent and defend the principles of the chiropractic profession throughout Europe; 6. To be the political representative body of the chiropractic profession within the European Union; 7. To support and develop a high quality programme of research within Europe. 9 Undergraduate chiropractic education in Europe There are currently eight educational institutions providing chiropractic education in Europe. These are set out below in Table 2. The European Council on Chiropractic Education (ECCE)7 is an autonomous organisation established by the chiropractic profession in Europe to accredit and re -accredit institutions providing undergraduate education and training. The princi pal goal of the ECCE is to assure the quality of chiropractic undergraduate education and training against a set of educational standards. Its current President is Tim Raven (pictured below) . The Standards are intended for use by chiropractic institution s, both in the public university and private sectors, predominately (but not exclusively) in Europe, as part of institutional self -evaluation, by the ECCE for external review of institutions and by international committees and bodies involved in the recogn ition and accreditation of chiropractic institutions worldwide. Once an institution has demonstrated that it is in substantial compliance with the Standards and has graduated its first cohort of students, the institution is accredited for up to five year s. Prior to full accreditation an institution may apply for candidate (for accredited) status; the maximum period an institution can hold candidate status is five years. The ECCE is , together with the US, Canadian and Australasian Councils on Chiropractic Education (CCEs) , a founding member of the Councils on Chiropractic Education International (CCEI)8. It is the only external quality assurance agency for chiropractic education and training in Europe that is a member of CCEI and recogni sed by the 7 European Council on Chiropractic Education (ECCE). Accessed at www.cce -europe.com 8 International accreditation standards published by CCEI can be accessed at http ://www.cceintl.org/uploads/2010 -04- 26_CCEI_International_Chiropractic_Accreditation_Standards_vfd_5_09.pdf 10 chiropra ctic profession and other CCEs world -wide, and that adheres to the CCEI International Chiropractic Accreditation Standards. The ECCE is a member of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA) and adheres to the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area9 (ESG).

The World Health Organization has published Guidelines on Basic Training and Safety in Chiropractic10. Part I of the guidelines covers basic requirements for different training programmes, each one designed for trainees with various educational backgrou nds, including non -medics, physicians wishing to use chiropractic and primary health care workers. This part provides a reference for the establishment of various training programmes, particularly where no formal education degree has been established. Part II of the guidelines deals with the safety of spinal manipulative therapy and the contraindications to its use. 9 ENQA.

This event is a highlight in the European academic calendar and brings together chiropractors from each of the ECU's 20 member nations. The ECU actively promotes postgraduate chiropractic education (Graduate Education Progra mmes and continuing professional development) in Europe through the European Academy of Chiropractic (EAC). It aims to expose chiropractors to current best practice, by stimulating reflective learning and by acting as a conduit for research activity. In do ing so, the EAC contributes to the facilitation of safe, evidence -based and optimum standards of care. The EAC hosts post -graduate seminars throughout Europe as well as an annual Graduate Education Programme seminar. The Dean of the EAC is Martin Wangl er (pictured) . He heads a Governing Council comprising a Dean, Registrar, Director of Academic Affairs, Secretary General, Chair of the ECU Research Council, ECU Convention Academic Organiser and ECU President. The objects of the EAC are as follows: 1. To develop key professional competencies through lifelong learning; 2. To provide and co -ordinate access to high quality sources of knowledge and skills; 3. To encourage and actively support the acquisition by chiropractors of higher level postgraduate qualificatio ns and EAC Fellowship awards; 12 4. To facilitate the formation and development of Graduate Education Programmes (GEP) by national associations ; 5. To provide a platform to bring together parties with a diversity of experience and expertise to enable the sharing of best practice; 6. To raise quality standards across the profession and enhance chiropractic's contribution to a healthier society by facilitating a collaboration of European national chiropractic associations, educational institutions, researchers and postgr aduate educational providers. With the Chiropractic and Osteopathic College of Australasia and the Royal College of Chiropractors, the EAC co -owns the online peer -reviewed journal Chiropractic and Manual Therapies . This high quality online journal aims to provide chiropractors, manual therapists and related health professionals with clinically - relevant, evidence -based information. All articles pub lished by Chiropractic and Manual Therapies are made freely and permanently accessible immediately upon pub lication without subscription charges or registration barriers. There are also a number of other post graduate educational organisations in Europe. These include the Royal College of Chiropractors (UK), the National Institute for Chiropractic and Clinica l Biomechanics (Denmark) and the Swiss Chiropractic Academy. 13 Standardisation of Chiropractic Services A European Standard (EN) is a standard that has been adopted by one of the three recognised European Standardisation Organisations: CEN, CENELEC and ETSI. It is produced by all interested parties through an open, transparent and consensus based process. European Standards are one of the key components of the Single European Market. A standard represents a model specification, a technical solutio n against which a market can trade. It codifies best practice and the state of the art. Chiropractic was the first health profession to be subject to a European Standard. In 2012, following three years of preparation and the consensus of the chiropractic profession in Europe, the Standard for Healthcare Provision by Chiropractors was published. The reference for this Standard is EN 16224:2012 . This CEN Standard is a landmark document. It sets out what the public should expect from a chiropractor: educat ionally, professionally and ethically. Importantly, it acts as a guide to those countries seeking statutory recognition and acts as a model template for legislators. The ECU has adopted the CEN Standard for Healthcare Provision by Chiropractors and has in corporated its Code of Ethics as a dedicated ECU Code of Good Practice11. The ECU encourages formal adoption of the Standard by each of its member national associations. It is particularly important that this is the case in countries without chiropractic l egislation, so that the Standard can become the default guideline for healthcare provision by chiropractors. 11 ECU Code of Good Practice. Accessed at http://www.chiropractic - ecu.org/userfiles/files/ECU%20Documents/Code%20of%20Good%20Practice -ECU.pdf 14 ECU Research Support and Promotion The promotion of research is a core objective of the ECU. Of each per capita fee that is received b y the EC U, a proportion is ring -fenced to fund research. The Chair of the ECU Research Council is Dr Sidney Rubinstein PhD (pictured) . He sits as a permanent observer at meetings of the ECU General Council and holds a position as a member of the Governing Council of the European Academy of Chiropractic. The purpose of the European Chiropractors' Union Research Council is to promote and support scientific research which will improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of chiropractic. Pursuant to a directive ratified by the ECU General Council, the Research Fund is administer ed by the ECU Research Council. It ensures that correctly submitted applications for research funding have been properly scrutin ised and considered prior to formally communicating any reco mmendations to the ECU General Council. Each year at its Convention, the ECU hosts a Researchers' Day. This unique event brings together chiropractic researchers from across Europe to discuss ongoing projects, identify areas for future research and to shar e best practice. The ECU supports a wide range of projects, granting in excess of \u20ac100,000 per year. These include multi -centre trials, PhD projects, systematic reviews and other innovative research. Table 3 below shows examples of ongoing projects being s upported by the ECU Research Fund: 15 Table 3: Projects currently supported by the ECU Research Fund Project title Researcher(s) Object of study Morphology and age -related osteoarthritic changes in cervical spine Uhrenholt L To investigate characteristics of lower cervical facet joints in subjects aged 20 -79 Descriptive study on maintenance chiropractic care on persistent and recurrent LBP patients Jensen I, Axen I To describe long term course of patients who have been defined by chiropractors to be suita ble for maintenance care.

Establishing a research agenda for chiropractic in Europe. Rubinstein S, Hartvigsen J, Bolton J, Webb A, van Tulder M To establish a research agenda for the chiropractic profession in Europe thro ugh consensus involving a Delphi process. In 2012, the General Council approved a proposal from the Executive Council to financially support the establishment of national chiropractic research foundations in the form of a start -up grant . Financial suppor t has already been granted to the member national chiropractic associations of Norway, France, Sweden and Great Britain. This will both stimulate the growth of research activity and develop the body of knowledge, thus benefiting patients, the public and so ciety. 16 Public Health The ECU is committed to contributing to public health in Europe. It recognises the value of healthy populations in determining the economic prosperity of nations, labour supply and public spending. It fully supports the European Commi ssion's commitment to investing in health to contribute towards the Europe 2020 objective of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The ECU recognises that in the field of musculoskeletal health there remain inequalities across Europe in terms of access to effective care. Poor and disadvantaged people die younger and suffer more from disability and disease. The ECU is committed to expanding the availability and accessibility to chiropractors throughout EU and EEA member nations. With spending on health outstripping GDP growth, to the extent where it is estimated that it will have risen by a third by 2060, there is a need to transform health systems12. The ECU maintains that the chiropractic profession should be part of this transformation. It has a dedi cated Public Health Committee (PHC), whose terms of reference are as follows: a. To be responsible for advising the General Council on public health matters as they relate to chiropractic in general and spine care in particular. b. To be responsible for advis ing the General Council on ways in which the ECU can (i) work on public health projects and (ii) forge alliances with other organis ations in support of common health objectives . c. To be responsible for the development, maintenance, review and dissemination of an ECU public health toolkit, which outlines a strategic course for chiropractic's active involvement in programmes , including the 12 Brown RA.

To collaborate with other committees of the ECU as appropriate for the furtherance of the ECU's objects . The ECU Public He alth Committee is chaired by Baiju Khanchandani (pictured). He is supported by committee members from across Euro pe. There are a number of current areas of interest, including ensuring that there is recognition for chiropractors in a European classification of occupations (ESCO). The ECU is a member of the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA)13, the leading European non -governmental organisation (NGO) advocating for better health. EPHA is a non-profit organisation which is based in Belgium and includes public health NGOs, patient groups, health professionals and disease groups working to improve health and strengthen the voice of public health in Europe. EPHA monitors the policy -making process within the EU institutions and supports the flow of information on health promotion and public health policy developments. The ECU is an associate body of SOLVIT14, a Department of the European Commission. SOLVIT is an online problem -solving network in which EU Member States work together to solve issues relating to misapplication of Internal Market law within the EU and EEA. One example of a successful European public health initi ative has been the Straighten Up campaign. The Straighten Up program is a bold and innovative health promotion initiative designed to empower the people everywhere toward better spinal health and an improved quality of life. 13 European Public Health Alliance. Accessed at http://www.epha.org 14 SOLVIT. Accessed at http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/site/about/index_en.htm 18 Consisting of a set of simple e xercises and taking just minutes to complete, Straighten Up helps improve posture, stabilis e core muscle groups, enhance health and prevent spinal disability. It can be completed quite briefly as a regular day -to-day practice. The 2 -3 minute routine can co unter poor posture, which is a common trigger for general back pain and can be undertaken by all ages. Studies undertaken have shown that after adopting the routine each day over a five week period , the posture of participants (who ranged in age from teen agers to those in their eighties ) improved in eighty per cent of cases . Another 78% reported that they had strengthened their core muscles, whilst 80% reported that t hey sat and stood more upright whilst saying that their backs felt more comfortable. The ECU contributes to a number of Europe -wide public health consultations. These are summarised in Table 4 below.

This inequality creates issues for both patients and practising chiropractors. Table 5 (below) shows the current status of chiropractic within Europe15, while Figure 1 displays the status on a geographical level. What is clear is that chiropractic can be practised legally in many EU member nations, either pursuant to specific legislation or pursuant to general law. In countries that benefit from dedicated legislation, there is statutory registration and protection of title. This serves to protect patients and assure the public that those using the title chiropractor satisfy set standards of competency and education. It is one of the ECU's primary objectives to promote the statutory regulation of chiropractors throughout Europe. The successful completion of the CEN Standard for Healthcare Provision by Chiropractors sets in place a template for those countries seeking legislation. The existence of Masters level programmes of study, offered by educational institutions accredited by the European Council on Chiropractic Education, itself a member of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA )16, should assure government representatives that chiropractic as a distinct healthcare profession is both structured and of high quality. European citizens seeking effective musculoskeletal healthcare in the form of chiropractic have the right to protect ion by statutory legislation. Such legislation should provide provision for the establishing of a register, protection of title, fitness to practise procedures, educational standards, and standards of conduct and proficiency. 15 Source: World Federation of Chiropractic.

Belgi um was instrumental in the formation of the European Chiropractors' Union in 1932, when it also established its national association . Despite opposition from the medical profession, the Belgian Chiropractors Union was successful in obtaining a framework f or legislation in 1999. The Chamber of Chiropractic was established based on the Colla L aw17 in 1999 , which recognised what were considered the four main complementary health professions. A Royal Decree was passed in the Belgian Parliament on 12 September 2011 to establish the Chamber of Chiropractic. A Paritary Commission has also been established by Royal Decree on 27 March 2012 to whom recommendations are passed by the Chamber for onward approval by the Minister of Health. 17 The Colla Law was named after the then Health Minister in Belgium, Marcel Colla . 23 Pending Ministerial approval , several Royal Decrees in relation to the legal practice of chiropractic (registration, minimum standards of education, practice guidelines, code of ethics) will follow in due course . Cyprus National Association: History and legal status Chiropractic in Cyprus was establishe d in 1967 courtesy of Dinos Ramon, a graduate of Palmer College of Chiropractic. The Cyprus Chiropractic Association was founded in 1984. As a result of a Court case involving the successful prosecution of the current Vice - President of the Cyprus Chiroprac tic Association, Phylactis Ierides, for practising medicine without a license, moves to gain statutory recognition were started. Despite only having three chiropractors at the time when the push for legislation was commenced, Cyprus saw a law passed in 1991, when the Chiropractors' Registration Bill was passed into law . To legally practise in Cyprus, chiropractors must hold a recognised qualification. It is a criminal offence to practise chiropractic in Cyprus , without being registered. The Basic Chiroprac tic Law of 1991 has recently been amended by the Chiropracti c (Amendment) Law (62)(12), 2012 , which came into effect on 23 October 2012. 24 The Chiropractic (Amendment) Law establishes a regulatory framework, developing the Basic Chiropractic Law of 1991. Thi s framework comprises the following elements: 1. A statutory regulatory body , to be known as the Chiropractic Council comprising up to five members: three registered Chiropractors and two Ministerial representatives (one of whom shall be from M inistry of Heal th). Members of the Chiropractic Council shall be appointed by the Council of Ministers . 2. Protection of Title, with illegal use subjected to a fine of up to \u20ac 1000 and/or up to six months' imprisonment. 3. Mandatory recording of p atient records to be held in one of the official languages of the Republic of Cyprus ( Greek or Turkish ). 4. Fitness to Practise procedures. The Law creates a Disciplinary Council, comprising two lay members appointed by the Attorney General and three chiropractic members appointed by the national chiropractic association . 5. Compulsory membership of the Cyprus Chiropractic Association. The Law permits only a single national chiropractic association. The Cyprus Organization for Standards (CYS) has adopted the English language version of the CEN Standard (EN 16224 Health Provision by Chiropractors) approved on 10 May 2012. Finland National Association: Suomen Kiropraktikkoliitto Mannerheimintie 57 -Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 5,266,114 No. chiropractors 48 Ratio 1:109,711 25 History and legal status: The first chiropractor in Finland commenced practice in the late 1920s, but it was not until 1977 that the Finnish Chiropractors' Union was established. Although covered by the Nordic agreement, which came into effect in the 1980s, chiropractic in Finland became formally subjected to statutory regulation in 1994. Although the title of chiropractor is not protected, trained chiropractors are able to reclaim VAT on their services. The World Health Organisation comments as follows in relation to the regulatory framework in Finland18: \"Act 559 of 28 June 1994 ( 176) regulates the licensing of medical practitione rs. By Article 4, the right to practise as an independent allopathic medical doctor can be granted to practitioners who have completed basic medical training and who have additional training in primary health care or special training in an allopathic medic al speciality. Professional allopathic medical providers who fulfil the required conditions have a number of rights, including the right to use a protected occupational title. Only allopathic doctors and, by Decree 564/1994 ( 172), registered chiropractors , naprapaths, and osteopaths are recognised health practitioners and allowed to practise medicine - specifically, to diagnose patients and charge fees. However, according to Act 559, other medical practitioners may treat patients if they do not practise wi thin public services and do not pretend to be health care professionals. As a result, only allopathic doctors and registered chiropractors, naprapaths, and osteopaths are supervised by the medical authorities in practising complementary/alternative medicin e. Other medical practitioners are not supervised, nor is their licensing regulated. While anyone can use an unqualified title, such as \"Chiropractor\", by Act 559 only registered chiropractors, naprapaths, and osteopaths may use the descriptor \"Trained\" i n describing themselves. Act 559 also confers title protection to allopathic physicians.

The law grants the right to permit the title of \"chiropracteur \" to be used under specific conditions by health car e profession als (medical practitioner , midwife, physiotherapist , nurse) and non health care profession als .The title is protected and gives the right to treat patients without requiring a medical referral. 19 Droit de Malades (2002) .

Under the law chiropractors are permitted to perform medical manipulation, make a differential diagnosis and determine whether or not they accept or reject a patient for treatment . In Sept ember 2011 , a new Parliamentary Bill on Chiropractic and O steopathy was introduced with the aim of establishing a High Council of Chiropractic and O steopathy.

Germany National Association Deutsche Chiropraktoren Gesellschaft chiropractors Ratio: 1:765,540 History and legal status The first chiropractors in Germany ap peared in the 1920s. Early attempts to establish an educational institution for chiropractors were unsuccessful, with the result that techniques were shared with medical practitioners interested in manual medicine. In 1978 chiropractors in Germany met in H amburg and, with the assistance of then ECU President, Arne Christensen, t he German Chiropractors' Association was established in 1980. 28 Two laws regulate the registration and licensing of primary healthcare practitioners in Germany: one for traditional me dical practitioners and one for lay medical practitioners (Heilpraktiker). In 2003, t he German Medical Assembly (German \u00c3rztetag) introduced the term \"Chiropractic\" in addition to that of \"Manual M edicine\" and launched a trainin g programme (Muster -Kursbu ch - Manuelle M edizin/chirotherapie ) for medical practitioners . The term s manual medicine and chiropractic therapy are used interchangeably by medical practitioners in Germany . A second law regulates the practise of first-degree trained c hiropractors . 'Heilpraktikergesetz20'. ECCE/CCEI -accredited chiropractic programmes of study are unrecognised in Germany . Consequently, c hiropractors in Germany work under this law. In Germany , there is therefore the rather confusing situation of three titles : 1. Chiropractor ( primarily trained with a degree in chiropractic); 2. Chirotherapeut (academically trained as a medical practitioner with additional programmes of study in manual treatment meth ods); and 3. Chiropraktiker ( non-medical healthcare professionals with limited education in manua l treatment techniques) .

The first association to represent chiropractors in Greece was the Hellenic Chiropractic, Naturopathic and Osteopathic Physicians Association, which was established in 1977. In 1988 , two chiropractors were denied licences to practise chiropractic by the Ministry of Health on the grounds of a lack of formal legislation . However, this decision was overturned by the High Court of Appeal, which stated that the practise of chiropractic was non -medical and therefore leg al. In making its ruling, the High Court urged the Ministry to introduce a relevant law . A second case, charging chiropractors with practising medicine without a licence, resulted in a not guilty verdict. However, under Greek law, chiropractors, as non -medical professionals, are still prohibited from carrying out the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The Hellenic Chiropractors Association was founded as a separate organisation in 1994. There is currently no dedicated legislation governing the practise o f chiropractic in Greece. Chiropractors practise as non-medical healthcare professionals. Preliminary dialogue has taken place with the Ministry of Health and discussions regarding formal recognition are ongoing. Hungary National Association Hungarian C hiropractic Association 1024 Budapest Kis Rokus 30 No. of chiropractors 6 Ratio 1:1,656,578 History and legal status Chiropractic is recognised, but not regulated , in Hungary. Althou gh allopathic physicians are the most common providers of complementary/alternative medicine, non -allopathic physicians and non -allopathic practitioners may provide specific complementary/alternative treatments. In February 1997, the Hungarian legislature passed two pieces of comprehensive legislation on natural medicine: Government Decree 40/1997 (IV 5) Korm. r. on natural medicine and the Decree of the Minister of W elfare 11/1997 (V 28) on some aspects of the practice of natural medicine . These two decrees clearly and officially integrate allopathic and non - allopathic physicians who practise complementary/alternative medicine into the national health care system. The Decrees came into force on 1 July 1997. The Decrees outline precise rules regarding the curriculum of complementary/alternative medical training as well as its practice. Each complementary/alternative discipline has its own training requirements and State exam. Within a legal framework, non -allopathic physicians are allowed to use complementary/alternative medicine once they have passed the exam. Articles 1 through 7 of the Decrees regulate conditions for practising complementary/alternative medicine. Anne xes 1 through 4 list the specific requirements for each form of complementary/alternative medicine. Article 1 identifies three categories of author ised medical practitioners: allopathic physicians, practitioners with a non -academic higher medical qualifica tion, and other non - allopathic practitioners. Natural doctors are author ised practitioners who have passed the required exams and are permitted to use complementary/alternative medicine. Article 1 also contains restrictions on the use of complementary/alte rnative medicine. Allopathic physicians and medical practitioners with a non -academic higher health qualification may provide manual therapies. Practitioners who do not hold a higher health 31 qualification may provide acupressure, massage therapy, lifestyle counselling, reflexotherapy, bio -energy, phytotherapy, and auriculotherapy. Article 2 clarifies the legal framework in which natural doctors are allowed to practise. Paragraph 1 of Article 2 states that allopathic physicians are in charge of diagnosis, therapy planning, and patient follow -up. Other practitioners who have the necessary qualifications may participate in patient care at the request of the patient or through an allopathic physician's referral. Natural doctors who are non -allopathic physicians a re allowed either to practise under the supervision of an allopathic physician or, more independently, to provide care after an allopathic physician has made a diagnosis. Consulting allopathic physicians may not oppose a patient's choice to seek treatment from a natural doctor. By Article 3, natural doctors must submit to the same directives as other medical practitioners, such as respecting obligations, abiding by ethical rules, and keeping patient records. Article 5 gives the Institute of Health, under th e authority of the Ministry of Social Welfare, the responsibility of regulating the training and examination of natural doctors. Under Article 7, allopathic physicians with an academic degree in medicine may ask for a licence to practise as natural doctors without being required to take another exam. They are also allowed to use the title of \"Natural Doctor\", but to use the title of specialists in particular therapies, they must take the exam. Allopathic physicians are the only practitioners who do not have to pass the exams to practice complementary/alternative medicine. Natural doctors are registered and supervised by a special commission. Annex 1 contains a complete list of author ised complementary/alternative treatments and of the medical practitioners w ho are allowed to provide them. Annex 2 outlines the information that natural doctors must record, such as patient histories and a description of the current treatment. Chiropractic is regulated, but not defined, by law. The Ministry of Education recognize s the Doctor of Chiropractic degree ( 65). 32 There have been instances , most recently in 2012, of chiropractors being subject ed to criminal proceedings in Hungary for practicing medicine without a license .

In 1980, the Healthy Ministry formed a co mmission to examine chiropractic and concluded that it was both safe and effective. It recommended that chiropractic be accepted as a legitimate healthcare occupation. In common with a number of other European nations, the medical profession opposed the pr ofession and alleged that chiropractors were pract ising medicine without a license. However, despite this opposition, a 1998 judgement by the Constitutional Court ruled that chiropractic is an autonomous profession and that chiroprac tors can not be consider ed to be practicing medicine without a license until such time that Parliament regulates the profession. Following surveys demonstrating that over 9 million Italians were utilizing alternative medicine, t he Italian \"National Federation of the Orders of Doc tors and Dentists\" 35 (FNOMCeO) 2002 and various rulings of the Italian Courts declared the practice of chiropractic as being the responsibility of a medical doctor . Formal provision for a statutory Register of Chiropractic D octors has been made within the Italian Labour, Health and Social Policy Ministry (Article 2, comma 355, of Law N \u00b0 244/2007) , but has not yet been opened. The 2002 FNOMCeO G uidelines were superseded in 2009 by revised G uidelines having no legal or regulatory status. They excluded chiropractic and osteopathy from the list of professions considered by them to be medical acts . In Italy, Court rulings regarding chiropractic have been ambiguous . While some rulings have made a clear distinction betwee n a medical act and a chiropractic intervention, they have failed to rule that a n internationally recogni sed chiropractic degree must be a prerequisite to practis ing chiropractic in Italy . This remains impossible until chiropractic is regulated and the a Register of chiropractors is opened, but all non-EU candidates seeking a work permit are obliged to have graduated from accredited institutions. Under the Guidelines for training in Medicine and Practice of Non -Conventional Medicine, December 12, 200 9 the first paragraph may be translated : \"Law n.244 of 2007, art.2, paragraph 355 has defined a chiropractor as having earned a Laurea Magistrale, (five year degree) in Doctor of Chiropractic to qualify as an autonomous primary health care practitioner.

In the mid-1920s, through the work of one chiropractor, Arthur Lundh, chiropractic developed and by the 1930s there were around twenty chiropractors in Norway. As a consequence of aggressive criticism from the medic al profession and unsuccessful attempts to have chiropractors convicted of practis ing medicine without a license, the Norwegian Chiropractors Association was founded in 1935. In 1974, legislation was passed that allowed for reimbursement of chiropractors' fees on medical referral. In 1988, legislation to create statutory regulation of the chiropractic profession was passed. Since 1990, chiropractors have been officially recognised as health care professionals . Only licensed chiropractors are permitted to u se the title of chiropractor. To be licensed, a candidate must have completed a training programme and passed examinations at an approved institution; undertaken additional training in Norwegian health law and chiropractic disciplines; completed one year o f practical training; and not be in a position that would lead to withdrawal of the authorization - for instance, the candidate must not be found unsuitable for practising chiropractic due to old age, illness, alcohol/drug abuse, or other circumstances. Further developments included a highly successful trial to determine the effectiveness of chiropractors prescribing sick leave and referring patients to hospital specialists, including physiotherapy. As a consequence of this trial, which showed high levels of patient satisfaction and both fewer and shorter episodes of sick leave, in 2005 the Norwegian Parliament voted to extend the rights of chiropractors. 40 Chiropractic is therefore recognised in Norway as a highly structured and mainstream health professio n. Its success has been down to the foresight and persistence of key individuals who set out and achieved key goals in terms of legislation and regulation.

Numbers grew and drew the attention of the medical profession, which through newspaper articles made accusations of improper practice. As a consequence, the Diplomerade Chiropraktorers F\u00f6rening , the forerunner of the Swedish Chiropractors Association, was formed in 1936. Attitudes towards chiropractors became more accepting over time, to the extent that there was an acceptance of their effect iveness for disorders of the spine. Following formal proposals by the Committee of Alternative Medicine, in 1989 a law was passed that author ised chiropractors as regulated health professionals. As a consequence, they were listed as health professionals u nder the Patient Safety Act24, Chapter 4, \u00a71 and \u00a75. This legislation enabled patients to obtain partial reimbursement in some regions. One of the bigger challenges facing the chiropractic profession in Sweden is the rise of chiropractic/naprapathic sch ools. In 2004, their quality of education was criticised by the National Agency of Higher Education.

As a consequence of fierce criticism from the medical profession, resulting in fines and imprisonment, the Swiss Federation of Chiropractors wa s founded in 1932. Its members were instrumental in the formation of the European Chiropractors' Union. In the late 1930s chiropractic became accepted as a health profession in the Cantons of Lucerne and Zurich . The laws that were passed were the first in Europe to statutorily regulate chiropractic as an independent profession. By 1963, over 70% of the Swiss population were covered by established chiropractic legislation. As a consequence of strong lobbying by the Swiss Pro -Chiropractic Association (inclu ding a 400,000 strong petition to the Government) c hiropractors became regulated as a conventional health profession by the Federal Law on Medical Professions (MedBG). This allowed chiropractors to practis e independently without the need for medical referr al for the purposes of insurance reimbursement. Revision of the Law on Health and Accident Insurance in 1964 meant that chiropractic was covered by mandatory social insurance in cases of sickness and accident. Coverage was later extende d to also include Military and Disability I nsurance. 44 Chiropractors have the right to diagnose and treat patients and have also been granted privileges similar to medical practitioner, including limited prescribing rights, referral for laboratory tests and the ability to pr escribe sickness absence. As a consequence of strong legislation governing the practice of chiropractic in Switzerland, chiropractors must undertake a two year assistantship programme before entering independent practice. Post graduate education is well developed in Switzerland and mandatory postgraduate education has existed since 1960. The Swiss Chiropractic Institute was established in 1985. Legislation passed in 2007 now affords Swiss chiropractors recognition as medical professionals (alongside medi cine, dentistry, veterinary science and pharmacy). Education for chiropractors in Switzerland is a six -year programme provided at the University of Z\u00fcrich25.

By 1922, the Chiropractors' Association of the British Isles held its first meeting in Belfast, but this organization did not last, being replaced by the British Chiropractic Association in 1925. Despite having fewer than 20 members, it established an insurance scheme for its members and drew up a code of ethics. In 1931, following a dinner at the BCA Annual Conference, talk of a pan -European organization led to the establishment of the ECU. With practical difficulties prohibiting aspiring British students from travelling to the USA to train, the numbers of chiropractors practising in Great Britain decreased to around 35 after the Se cond World War. The first chiropractic educational institution in Europe, the Anglo -European College of Chiropractic (AECC), opened in Bournemouth, England in September 1965. In 1997, the first University -based programme s for chiropractors were establishe d at the Universities of Surrey26 and Glamorgan. Chiropractors are also trained at the McTimoney College of Chiropractic, based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire27. As a consequence, the number of chiropractors practising in the UK has grown dramatically such that it now boasts the largest national association in Europe. In 1990, the profile of chiropractic rose following the publication of a study in the British Medical Journal which favourably compared chiropractic with physiotherapy for the management of low back pain. Royal patronage and the publicity surrounding chiropractic treatment of high profile personalities further enhanced chiropractic's reputation. 26 The Masters programme in chiropractic at the European Institute of Health and Medical Science, University of Surrey, ran from 1997 to 2002. The programme gained full accreditation by the ECCE for the period 2003 -2006. This programme is no longer offered at Surrey. 27 Although graduates of the MCC are permitted to practise as registered chiropractors in the UK, the y do not enjoy the same portability of qualification as graduates of ECCE/CCEI accredited institutions. The full time Masters programme at MCC currently has candidate status with ECCE. 47 In 1991, the educational programme at AECC was awarded degree status by the Council for National Academic Awards. All chiropractic programmes of study in the UK now offer education to Masters level. The Chiropr actors Act of 199428 established a statutory regulator, the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) , and a Register was opened in 1999 . The Act gives protect ion of title and made it an offence for any person not registered with the GCC to call themselves a chiropractor. The Act also provided for mandatory standards of education and patient protection through a Code of Practise and Standard of Proficiency29. Most chiropractors in the UK operate in the private sector, but health legislation has led to chiropractic being utilised within the National Health Service.

Authorization to practice independently is issued by the National Board of Health after an addi tional one-year practical training (internship). 49 The Nordic Institute of Chiropractic and Clinical Biomechanics (NIKKB), is a research institute and centre of scientific information and post -graduate education facilitator. In close collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark and Spine Center South at Lilleb\u00e6lt Hospital , NIKKB produces and disseminates internationally renowned health care research pertaining to the chiropractic profession and clinical biomechanics. NIKKB was established in 1990 and is financed directly from Danish chiropractors30 and the Regions' Board for Wages and Tariffs . In Denmark there are currently 15 chiropractic PhDs with a further 10 chiropractic PhD candidates. Two chiropractors are currently employed as professors at the University of Southern Denmark. Denmark has an active chiropractic patients association, Kiropraktik og Sundhed . The association is responsible for disseminating information about chiropractic in Denmark.

In 1986 he began work to found a national chiropractic association. This became a reality in 19 99 and in 2000 a patients association, Pro -Quiro, was also formed. Four legal actions took place between 1993 and 2000, each of which was unsuccessful. IN delivering their verdicts, a number of judges spoke favourably about the education and training of c hiropractors. Chiropractic was finally legalised in Portugal in 2003, yet chiropractic was part of a number of non -medical health professions that were included under the same legislation. In 2008, the ECU responded to a comprehensive questionnaire about chiropractic in Europe sent by the Directorate General of Higher Education and Technology (DGEST) . In November 2009, it published a resolution (No 1493/2009 ) granting recognition to various degrees including Doctor of Medicine (Medical), Doctor of Medicine in Dentistry (dentist) and other health professions and sciences which studies were conducted in the United States of America but which carry on their profession currently in Portugal. This included chiropractic. 51 Acknowledgements The product ion of a document of this nature calls upon the support and assistance of a great many individuals and organisations and I am grateful to everyone who has helped in its production.

This European Standard shall be given the status of a national standard, either by publication of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by December 2012, and conflicting national standards shall be withdrawn at the latest by Dec ember 2012. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. CEN [and/or CENELEC] shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. According to the CEN/CENELEC Internal Regulations, the national standards organizations of the following countries are bound to implement this European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Introduction The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines chiroprac tic as a primary contact healthcare profession concerned with disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system, particularly the spine, and the effect of these disorders on the function of the nervous system and on general health. Treatment encompasses a wide range of interventions, but emphasis is placed on manual methods of care. The chiropractic profession has evolved in Europe and occupies an important position in both primary and secondary healthcare provision. It is therefore imperative that chiropractic services are delivered at the highest attainable level. The principal objective of any standard for healthcare services ought to be that users of any given service can be confident of a level of care that assures reproducible quality throughout the profession. Clinical governance, the determination of monitoring healthcare provision and ensuring maintenance of standards therefore form one of the cornerstones of care. This standard is concerned with the provision of chiropractic services. It aspires to s et a standard that provides optimum levels of patient management, patient safety, clinical and cost effectiveness and ethical practice. It also defines a level of education consistent with producing chiropractors who are competent to comply with the standa rd. It is not intended to be a guideline, although information contained might inform the development of guidelines for individual nations and national organizations. Finally, this standard encourages that services provided by chiropractors be subjected t o regular review through an evidence -based approach and a commitment to supporting and acting upon clinical research. This European Standard does not supersede national legislation. Scope This European Standard specifies requirements and recommendations f or healthcare services provided by chiropractors.

Education Undergraduate chiropract ic education The chiropractor shall have a formal, comprehensive undergraduate chiropractic education of a minimum of five years full -time or equivalent. NOTE An example of a suitable framework for undergraduate chiropractic education is provided by the Eu ropean Council on Chiropractic Education (ECCE) [10]. (See also Annex B.) Graduate education programme The graduate education programme (GEP) normally follows immediately after successful completion of the undergraduate programme and is the period of trans ition from safe and competent practice to autonomous and independent professional practice. It shall be clinically based and last a minimum of 12 months. a) The graduate education programme shall prepare graduates to: 1) maintain and improve on best and safe chi ropractic care for lifelong, self -directed learning for continued professional development; 2) further professionalism (i.e., knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour expected by patients and society). b) During the graduate education programme the graduate sh ould: 1) demonstrate a defined body of knowledge, understanding, clinical and procedural skills, as well as professional attitudes for providing effective, patient -centred care; 2) show that they effectively facilitate the chiropractor -patient relationship and t he dynamic exchanges that occur before, during and after the chiropractic encounter; 3) show that they effectively work within a healthcare team to achieve optimal patient care; 4) demonstrate that they are an integral participant in the provision of healthcare; 5) show responsibility to use their expertise and influence to advance the health and wellbeing of individual patients, communities and populations; 6) demonstrate a lifelong commitment to reflective learning as well as the creation, dissemination, application and translation of chiropractic/medical knowledge; 7) show that they are committed to the health and wellbeing of individuals and society through ethical practice, profession led regulation and high personal standards of behaviour. c) The graduate education prog ramme should: 1) encompass integrated practical and theoretical instruction; 2) guarantee best and safe care by deliberate practice and valid feedback. Continuing professional development Continuing professional development (CPD) is a process of lifelong learnin g. As well as enabling chiropractors to provide better healthcare services to patients, it should also help chiropractors to fulfil their potential. The learning needs and interests which individuals identify should be in the context of their own developme nt and the practice/organization in which they work. The individual chiropractor shall: a) have a minimum of 30 hours learning activities a year, of which at least 15 hours is to be learning with others - colleagues or other professionals; The different forms which learning with others can take include, but are not limited to, courses, lectures, discussions, seminar groups and conferences; being coached or mentored by another healthcare professional and peer group reviews; b) maintain their own records of CPD; c) be responsible for reflecting on and identifying their own learning interests and needs and how these are met. Code of ethics The provision of healthcare shall be based on trust, assurance and safety. In society, chiropractors possess a position where they a re trusted; this trust is acquired by education and experience and with this trust comes the responsibility to conform to standards of conduct and behaviour. The Code of Ethics sets out the principles and values of chiropractors in their work as providers of professional healthcare. While the Code is written for chiropractors, the public has a right to know what can be expected of chiropractors and the boundaries of their professional practice. While it does not seek to define scope of practice, it may hav e this effect by virtue of the limitations it places on types of behaviour and practice. Chiropractors shall act in line with the principle that the wellbeing of the patient is paramount. It necessarily follows that the nature and delivery of chiropractic care shall be consistent with this value. The Code recognises that chiropractic is practised in a range of jurisdictions, each having different legislative frameworks and regulatory processes. Where a country is regulated by statute, this Code cannot super sede the Codes of Practice and Standard of Proficiency for that nation. In jurisdictions without statutory regulation, it is recommended that this Code be adopted for use to ensure a minimum consistent standard throughout European states. NOTE See Annex C for further details.

B.2 Curriculum model and educational methods The chiropractic institution should define a cur riculum model and educational (teaching and learning) methods consistent with the objectives of the curriculum. The curriculum and educational methods should ensure the students have responsibility for their learning, and prepare them for lifelong, self - directed learning throughout professional life. Curriculum models should include discipline, system, integrated, problem or case -based learning models, using organizing principles such as themes and domains. Instructional methods should encompass teaching an d learning methods that, while not neglecting the transmission of factual knowledge and skills, also stimulate enquiry, critical analysis and problem - solving abilities. The curriculum should encourage active participation through the principles of self - directed learning, and foster the concept that the curriculum is not only 'taught' based solely on didactic models. Teaching and learning methods should be diverse and include a variety of methods, e.g. prosection (or dissection), computer assisted methods, a nd large and small group classes. The curriculum and educational methods should foster life -long learning skills and an appreciation of the need to undertake CPD. The chiropractic institution should describe the content of courses that guide both staff and students on the learning outcomes expected at each stage of the programme, and the level of integration between the basic sciences and clinical sciences and include: 31) Based on ECCE Standards, version 4, 2011 [10]. the theory of chiropractic and the scientific method; the theory and principles of chirop ractic practice, other forms of research inquiry and evidence -based practice, including analytical and critical thinking. The curriculum should include elements for training students in scientific thinking and research methods. Theory of chiropractic shoul d include concepts and principles of practice, and the role of empirical evidence in informing chiropractic knowledge. Training in scientific thinking and research methods should include the use of research projects (or equivalents) to be conducted by chir opractic students. The curriculum and educational methods should foster the ability to participate in the scientific development of chiropractic as professionals and future colleagues, and to keep up to date with evolving knowledge through an appreciation of research inquiry and the skills to identify, find and critically evaluate information including research evidence. B.3 Basic biomedical sciences The chiropractic institution should identify and include in the curriculum those contributions of the basic biom edical sciences that enable a knowledge and understanding of the basic sciences applicable to the practice of chiropractic. The basic biomedical sciences should include anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, biophysics, molecular biology, cell biology, genetic s, microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, pathology and biomechanics. As basic science teaching is relevant to the overall objectives of the chiropractic curriculum; its relevance should be apparent to students. Sufficient integration of the biomedical sc iences with the clinical elements of the programme should be ensured, highlighting the relevance of the basic sciences to clinical practice. Basic science and clinical tutors should collaborate in combined teaching sessions based around clinical problems. B.4 Behavioural and social sciences, ethics and jurisprudence The chiropractic institution should identify and include in the curriculum those contributions of the behavioural sciences, social sciences, ethics, scope of practice and legal requirements that ena ble effective communication, clinical decision -making and ethical practice. Behavioural and social sciences should include: 1) psychology, sociology, and the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain and non -specific neuromusculoskeletal pain conditions; 2) aspects of patient -centred care models, practitioner -patient encounters and oral and written communications skills, and the transferable skills including IT and reflective practice skills; 3) all aspects regulating professional practice including legal requirements, requirements of local national regulatory bodies and codes of ethical practice; 4) other areas of professional practice including management and administration issues and current practice models in a multidisciplinary healthcare setting; 5) ethical practice incl uding the principles of clinical governance, clinical audit, clinical guidelines, and risk assessment and management. B.5 Clinical sciences and skills The chiropractic institution should identify and include in the curriculum those contributions of the clinica l sciences that ensure students have acquired sufficient clinical knowledge and skills to apply to chiropractic practice in a primary contact setting. The clinical sciences should include general diagnosis, diagnostic imaging, physical, clinical and labora tory diagnostic procedures, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, geriatrics, dermatology, pathological anatomy, neurology, spinal analysis including motion palpation, manipulative -, mobilization - and supportive - techniques, and rehabilitation. To reflect the most common conditions treated by chiropractors, the curriculum should emphasize pain management, particularly as it relates to neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Clinical skills should include diagnostic imaging, history taki ng, physical examination, procedures and investigations, communication skills, treatment procedures, patient care and management, patient advice and education, disease prevention and health promotion. Clinical skills should include competency in general di agnosis and referral procedures consistent with scope of practice in a primary contact setting. B.6 Clinical training The chiropractic institution should identify and include a period of supervised clinical training to ensure the clinical knowledge and skills, communication skills and ethical appreciation accrued by the student can be applied in practice, and so enable the student to assume appropriate clinical responsibility upon graduation. Every student should have early patient contact leading to participat ion in patient care. As an essential component, the curriculum should offer a significant period of time devoted to the students' one -to-one contact with patients. This should be a minimum of one academic year spent primarily in contact with patients. The clinical training period provides the opportunity to undertake the role of primary contact practitioner within a supervised outpatient clinic, and develop clinical competency and clinical judgment. A minimum of forty (40) complete new patient assessments, of which no more than five (5) may be direct clinical observation, plus a minimum of four hundred (400) treatment (patient) visits and a case-mix of patients should be sufficient to achieve the outcomes of the curriculum, and prepare the student for safe a nd competent practice as a primary contact practitioner. Above all, this period should develop a level of clinical sophistication to enter practice and a period of postgraduate training. This period of training should reinforce issues of good record keepin g, teamwork, communication with other healthcare practitioners, responsibilities of clinic management, ethics and jurisprudence. This period of training should reinforce issues of self -evaluation through reflective practice, self - directed learning principl es and an appetite for life -long learning. The importance of tutor role models and the influence of standards in chiropractic practice set at this stage should be recognized in the clinical training facility offered to students. Close supervision of studen ts, which is of paramount importance at this stage, should include formative and summative feedback mechanisms. A clinic observation programme should be in place to provide opportunities for students throughout the curriculum to observe clinical procedures in practice, to learn from more experienced colleagues, and to maintain the motivation for becoming a chiropractor. B.7 Assessment methods and regulations The chiropractic institution should define and document the methods used for assessment, including the criteria for progression and appeals procedures. Assessment methods should be regularly evaluated, and new assessment methods developed as appropriate. The definition of methods used for assessment should include consideration of the balance between format ive and summative assessment, the number of examinations and other tests, the balance between written and oral examinations, the use of normative and criterion referenced judgements, and the use of special types of examinations, e.g. objective structured c linical examinations (OSCE), and the role of external examiners. Evaluation of assessment methods should include an evaluation of how they promote learning. Evaluation of assessment methods should include the quantity and quality (reliability and validity) of assessment methods, in particular the reliability and validity of assessments in clinical skills and competencies. The assessment principles, methods and practices should be appropriate to the educational aims and objectives, and promote appropriate l earning practices. Assessment methods and assessment criteria should be made known to students at the outset of the programme, or course component, and clearly reflect the course objectives. The number of assessments should not require excessive amounts of learning of detailed information to the detriment of time to reflect and assimilate the material. The type of assessments should encourage an integrated approach to learning, and encourage material delivered earlier in the programme to be revisited at lat er stages. All students should carry out an undergraduate research project appropriate to the level at which the degree is being awarded. This research project should consist of a research enquiry in a specified topic area using either a qualitative and/or quantitative approach. Irrespective of the design of the project, it should show clear evidence of critical thinking and appraisal of the current research evidence and of the findings from the research project. B.8 Curriculum level, structure and composition The chiropractic institution should describe the content, duration and sequencing of courses that guide both staff and students on the learning outcomes expected at each stage of the programme, and the level of integration between the basic sciences and c linical sciences. Chiropractic programmes may be diverse in points of entry reflecting prior learning achievements. The length of the undergraduate programme however, should be a minimum of five (5) full -time (study) academic years. In terms of academic cr edits, this is equivalent to 300 credits where 60 credits equals one academic year. The clinical training period should also be delivered on a full -time basis. The duration and modes of delivery of the programme should satisfy national requirements for graduates to practise as a chiropractor. The integration of disciplines should include both horizontal (concurrent) and vertical (sequential) integration of curricular components. The process of integration can enhance student learning by demonstrating the re lationship between programme material and future chiropractic practice. There should also be opportunities to revisit and further develop material covered earlier in the programme. The curriculum should develop as well as educate and train students through models of self -directed learning, and by presenting them with opportunities to develop in particular areas of interest, e.g. in the research project (or equivalent). All courses within the curriculum should have explicit learning outcomes in terms of the level of knowledge and understanding, skills and attitudes expected on completion of the course.

This is particularly relevant in the case of children and young people, where another person (who may be a parent or guardi an) should be present unless express consent is given for the child or young person to be seen in the absence of a chaperone. C.1.12 Vulnerable adults a) The chiropractor should consider whether a patient is vulnerable by virtue of their health and circumstances and take steps to ensure that their wellbeing is safeguarded during the provision of assessment and care. They should also consider the capacity of patients to understand information provided to them and the validity of consent in relation to this. b) The chirop ractor working with vulnerable adults should consider whether it is appropriate for another person to be present when providing assessment and care. c) The chiropractor should not exploit the vulnerability of patients by expressing their personal beliefs, or their religious or political views in any way that might cause them distress or make them feel uncomfortable.

C.2.2 Maintaining trust in the profession The chiropractor should not abuse their professional position to pursue a sexual or improper relationshi p with a patient or someone close to the patient. Improper behaviour may include words and gestures of a sexual nature. Where a chiropractor finds they are sexually attracted to a patient or the patient is sexually attracted to them, they should immediatel y seek alternative care for the patient. C.2.3 Consent Consent is an ongoing process, not a one -off event. The chiropractor should ensure that they communicate with patients throughout the clinical encounter and should ensure that privacy is provided to facilit ate this process. The chiropractor should ensure that the patient receives information about the assessment and care that is available to them and that it is presented in a way that is easy for them to follow and use. This allows the patient to be involved in their care and make decisions that are appropriate for them. Consent may not be valid if the patient does not understand the nature of the information given to them about the proposed assessment or care. The chiropractor should be satisfied they have t he valid consent of the patient (or someone able to act on their behalf) before they proceed with: examination; investigation; treatment; involving the patient in teaching or research. The chiropractor should not use their professional position to persuade a patient to consent against their will. Information to be provided to the patient to allow them to make informed decisions about their assessment and care should include: a) purpose of and need for any assessment or investigation; b) diagnosis; c) proposed treatm ent or management of the condition; d) options for care that are available to them; e) likely outcomes with or without care; f) any foreseeable risks and likely benefits; g) who will be involved in and responsible for the assessment and care; h) any reasons for referring the patient to another health professional; i) any reasons why another healthcare professional may need to be involved in assessment or care; j) whether the care is linked to a research programme; k) financial implications of the recommended care. The chiropractor should assume that the patient has the capacity and is competent and capable of making decisions unless there is clear evidence to suggest that they are not. The chiropractor should consider any factors that may affect a patient's ability to give informed consent. These may include language issues and physical or learning disabilities. Unexpected decisions do not prove that a patient is incompetent or lacks the required capacity to provide consent. It may, however, indicate that further information needs to be given to the patient. Capacity is also 'decision -specific'. This means that patients may be capable of making some decisions but not others. If there is any doubt as to whether a patient has the capacity to consent, advice should be sought from a sui tably-qualified health professional. The chiropractor should exercise their professional judgement in assessing the capacity of children and young people to give consent to assessment and care. The chiropractor should understand and comply with the legisl ation in their jurisdiction in relation to issues surrounding consent and young people. C.2.4 Providing access to patient health records When a patient requests access to their personal health records, it should not be unreasonably withheld. NOTE Patient health records are subject to European data protection [9]. Where statutes include provisions for access to medical records, the chiropractor should ensure that they are familiar with relevant legislation and comply promptly with any requests for access. C.2.5 Confide ntiality The chiropractor should respect patient confidentiality at all times. This includes their personal details, information about their health and healthcare needs, their management and any information disclosed to the chiropractor during the course o f their assessment and care. The chiropractor should not employ any style of practice that may compromise the duty of confidentiality. Where circumstances exist in which confidentiality cannot be assured (for example, on the sports field) the chiropractor should confirm with the patient that they are content to undergo assessment or care. The chiropractor should ensure that information contained on paper or electronically is kept secure and that access by non -authorized personnel is prevented. NOTE There ar e exceptions to the rule of confidentiality. These include: a) where disclosure is required by statute; b) where disclosure to the appropriate authority is clearly within the public interest; c) where the patient or others are at risk of death or serious harm; d) wher e an official with power to order disclosure makes an order. Where disclosure takes place, the reasons for the disclosure should be recorded, as well as the nature and extent of the disclosure. C.2.6 Discharging patients The chiropractor should not treat the pa tient unnecessarily and should be able to clinically justify decisions to continue care. When care can no longer be justified on the basis of clinical need, the chiropractor should discharge the patient without delay. When the chiropractor discharges the p atient, they should explain the reason for them discontinuing care. The chiropractor should not discharge the patient purely on the grounds that they have raised issues about their care or have complained about their chiropractor; however, in some circumst ances such complaints may render the ongoing chiropractor -patient relationship unworkable. Unless a programme of care has ended and the patient is being discharged on clinical grounds, the chiropractor should ensure that, where it is practicable, informati on is provided to the patient about where care may be continued. This may involve referral to another healthcare professional (who may be a chiropractor). The chiropractor should document their reasons for discharging the patient.

Where no regulatory body exists, concerns should be addressed to the relevant national association. C.3.3 Respect for colleagues a) The chiropractor should treat colleagues fairly and with respect. They should not unfairly criticize them or discriminate against them. In particular, t he chiropractor should not engage in behaviour that undermines patients' trust in the care they receive or in the judgement of those treating them. b) The chiropractor should not allow their personal beliefs to affect their professional relationships with colleagues. C.3.4 Sharing information with colleagues a) Where appropriate, information should be shared with other health professionals. This is important for safe and effective patient care. b) When a patient is referred to another health professional, the chiropractor should ensure that all relevant information is provided to the health professional receiving the referral. c) Consent should be sought from the patient to provide this information. C.3.5 Delegation and referral If responsibility is delegated, the chiropractor will remain responsible for the overall management of the care of the patient. The chiropractor should ensure that the person to whom care is delegated possesses the qualifications, experience, knowledge and skills necessary to provide the care. Information sh ould be provided by the delegating chiropractor to facilitate effective delegation. Any person to whom a chiropractor makes a referral should be accountable to a regulatory body. C.3.6 Honesty and trustworthiness a) The chiropractor should never abuse the trust of a patient. b) A chiropractor who has been the subject of criminal convictions or who has received a caution or has been refused membership of any other professional body should report these facts to their national association and statutory regulator where one exists. C.3.7 Providing and publishing information about chiropractic services a) If the chiropractor publicises their practice, or asks another person to do so on their behalf, they should ensure that the materials that are used are honest, decent, legal, factual and verifiable. b) The chiropractor should not market their practice in a manner that undermines public trust and confidence in the profession. c) No claims about treatment or outcomes should be made that are unjustifiable. There should be no guarantees of a cu re. d) No pressure should be placed on people to use chiropractic services, for example by arousing ill -founded fears about their current or future health. e) The chiropractor should not use any title in a way that might mislead the public as to its meaning or significance. C.3.8 Writing reports and giving evidence a) The chiropractor should respond promptly and courteously to requests for information from other health professionals and third parties. They should seek the consent of the patient for the information being p rovided. b) Where the chiropractor has been asked to give evidence or produce statements they should be honest in all spoken and written testimony. Where matters are outside the scope of practice or competence of the chiropractor, they should declare this. c) In writing reports, the chiropractor should mention all relevant facts and only provide their opinion on matters that are within their expertise. C.3.9 Research a) The chiropractor who is involved in research should always prioritize the interests of the research participants (who may or may not be patients of the chiropractor). b) Research design should be consistent with accepted scientific and ethical principles. c) In conducting research, the chiropractor should act with honesty and integrity and should not misreprese nt the findings of research. The chiropractor and their staff should carefully comply with procedures detailed in the research protocol. d) The chiropractor should keep the identity of research subjects confidential and should at the outset of research obtain their informed consent to be part of any trial or experiment. e) A patient should be informed of their right to withdraw from the research at any time.
