Healthcare providers should consider the benefit-risk for an individual patient. Dosage For Intravenous Infusion - Casirivimab and imdevimab solution co-formulated in a vial and in individual vials, including dose pack, must be diluted prior to intravenous administration. - Administer 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab together as a single intravenous infusion via pump or gravity (see Table 1 Table 2and ). - Clinically monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least 1 hour after infusion is complete. For Subcutaneous Injection - Administer 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab using the co-formulated vial or using the individual vials by subcutaneous injection (see Table 3). - Clinically monitor patients after injections and observe patients for at least 1 hour. Casirivimab and imdevimab should be given together as soon as possible after a positive viral test for SARS-CoV-2 and within 10 days of symptom onset. Dose Adjustment In Specific Populations Pregnancy Or Lactation No dosage adjustment is recommended in pregnant or lactating women [see Use In Specific Populations]. Pediatric Use No dosage adjustment is recommended in pediatric patients who weigh at least 40 kg and are older than 12 years of age. REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) is not recommended for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg or those less than 12 years of age [see Use In Specific Populations]. Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment [see Use In Specific Populations]. Dose Preparation And Administration There are TWO different formulations of REGEN-COV: - Casirivimab and imdevimab co-formulated solution is available as two antibodies in a 1:1 ratio in a vial. - Casirivimab and imdevimab available as individual antibody solutions in separate vials: - supplied in individual vials, and - dose pack. The dose pack contains individual vials of casirivimab and imdevimab, configurations that may vary in vial size, strength and appearance and are available in dose pack configurations that include 2, 5, and 8 cartons [see Full EUA Prescribing Information, HOW SUPPLIED/Storage And Handling]. Intravenous infusion is strongly recommended. Subcutaneous injection is an alternative route of administration when intravenous infusion is not feasible and would lead to delay in treatment. - If either casirivimab or imdevimab in an 11.1 mL vial is available, you may prepare two doses of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab simultaneously, either in intravenous bags or in syringes for subcutaneous injection. Discard any product remaining in the vial. - Keep any unopened vials of casirivimab and imdevimab in their original carton in the refrigerator. - Unopened vials may be used to prepare an additional dose. There are differences in the way the two formulations are prepared. Carefully follow the preparation procedures below. Preparation For Intravenous Infusion The preferred route of administration for casirivimab and imdevimab is by intravenous infusion after dilution. Casirivimab and imdevimab solution for intravenous infusion should be prepared by a qualified healthcare professional using [aseptic](https://www.rxlist.com/aseptic/definition.htm) technique: - Remove the casirivimab and imdevimab vials from refrigerated storage and allow to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 20 minutes before preparation. Do not expose to direct heat. Do not shake the vials. - Inspect casirivimab and imdevimab vials visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Should either be observed, the vial must be discarded and replaced with a new vial. - The solution for each vial should be clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow. - Obtain a prefilled intravenous infusion bag containing either 50 mL, 100 mL, 150 mL, or 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. - Withdraw the appropriate amount of casirivimab and imdevimab from each respective vial(s) and inject into a prefilled infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (see Table 1). - Gently [invert](https://www.rxlist.com/invert/definition.htm)infusion bag by hand approximately 10 times to mix. Do not shake. - This product is preservative-free and therefore, the diluted infusion solution should be administered immediately (see Table 2). If immediate administration is not possible, store the diluted casirivimab and imdevimab infusion solution in the refrigerator between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no more than 36 hours or at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for no more than 4 hours. If refrigerated, allow the infusion solution to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes prior to administration.

DRUG INTERACTIONS REGEN-COV consists of 2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), casirivimab and imdevimab, or metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely. WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS There are limited clinical data available for REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab). Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with REGEN-COV use. Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis And Infusion-Related Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including [anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm), have been reported with administration of REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab). If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or [supportive care](https://www.rxlist.com/supportive_care/definition.htm). Infusion-related reactions, occurring during the infusion and up to 24 hours after the infusion, have been observed with administration of REGEN-COV. These reactions may be severe or life threatening. Signs and symptoms of infusion related reactions may include: - fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen saturation, chills, nausea, arrythmia (e.g., [atrial fibrillation](https://www.rxlist.com/atrial_fibrillation/definition.htm), [tachycardia](https://www.rxlist.com/tachycardia/definition.htm), [bradycardia](https://www.rxlist.com/bradycardia/definition.htm)), chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, headache, bronchospasm, [hypotension](https://www.rxlist.com/hypotension/definition.htm), hypertension, [angioedema](https://www.rxlist.com/angioedema/definition.htm), throat irritation, rash pre- diaphoresis [see Overall Safety Summary]. If an infusion-related reaction occurs, consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care. Hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than 24 hours after the infusion have also been reported with the use of REGEN-COV under Emergency Use Authorization. Clinical Worsening After REGEN-COV Administration Clinical worsening of COVID-19 after administration of REGEN-COV has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, [hypoxia](https://www.rxlist.com/hypoxia/definition.htm) or increased respiratory difficulty, arrythmia (e.g., [atrial](https://www.rxlist.com/atrial/definition.htm) [fibrillation](https://www.rxlist.com/fibrillation/definition.htm), tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to REGEN-COV use or were due to progression of COVID-19. Limitations Of Benefit And Potential For Risk In Patients With Severe COVID-19 Benefit of treatment with REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical [ventilation](https://www.rxlist.com/ventilation/definition.htm). Therefore, REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients [see Limitations of Authorized Use]: - who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR - who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR - who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity. Overall Safety Summary Clinical Trials Experience Overall, more than 9,000 subjects have been exposed to intravenous REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) in clinical trials in hospitalized and non-hospitalized subjects. The safety of REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) is based on analyses from, COV-2067, a Phase 1/2/3 trial of 6,311 ambulatory (non-hospitalized) subjects with COVID-19. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19 who had a sample collected for the first positive SARS-CoV-2 [viral infection](https://www.rxlist.com/viral_infection/definition.htm) determination within 3 days prior to the start of the infusion. In the phase 3 portion of the trial, subjects were treated with a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab (n=827), or 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab (n=1,849), or 4,000 mg of casirivimab and 4,000 mg of imdevimab (n=1,012), or placebo (n=1,843). REGEN-COV is not authorized at the 4,000 mg of casirivimab and 4,000 mg of imdevimab dose. The 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab is no longer authorized under this EUA [see Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18)]. In pooled phase 1/2/3 analysis, infusion-related reactions (adverse event assessed as causally related by the investigator) of grade 2 or higher severity have been observed in 10/4,206 (0.2%) of those who received REGEN-COV at the authorized dose or a higher dose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Overall, in Phase 1/2/3, three subjects receiving the 8,000 mg dose of REGEN-COV, and one subject receiving the 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab infusion-related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, rash) which resulted in permanent discontinuation of the infusion. All events resolved [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in the clinical program in subjects receiving REGEN-COV. The events began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and in at least one case required treatment including [epinephrine](https://www.rxlist.com/epinephrine/definition.htm). The events resolved. The safety with subcutaneous administration is based on analysis from HV-2093, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic profile in healthy volunteer adult subjects. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to REGEN-COV (n=729) or placebo (n=240). Injection site reactions were observed in 12% and 4% of subjects following single dose administration in the casirivimab and imdevimab, and placebo arms respectively; the remaining safety findings with subcutaneous administration in the casirivimab and imdevimab arm were similar to the safety findings observed with intravenous administration in COV-2067. Patient Monitoring Recommendations Clinically monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least 1 hour after intravenous infusion or subcutaneous dosing is complete [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Clinical Trials Experience]. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, [miscarriage](https://www.rxlist.com/miscarriage/definition.htm), or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus. Nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with casirivimab and imdevimab. In a tissue cross-reactivity study with casirivimab and imdevimab using human fetal tissues, no binding of clinical concern was detected. Human [immunoglobulin](https://www.rxlist.com/immunoglobulin/definition.htm) G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, casirivimab and imdevimab have the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing fetus. It is unknown whether the potential transfer of casirivimab and imdevimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of casirivimab and/or imdevimab in human milk or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Maternal [IgG](https://www.rxlist.com/igg/definition.htm) is known to be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u00e2\u20acs clinical need for REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from REGEN-COV or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19. Pediatric Use REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. The safety and effectiveness of casirivimab and imdevimab are being assessed in pediatric and adolescent patients in an ongoing clinical trial. The recommended dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of casirivimab and imdevimab in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in adults, since adults with similar body weight have been included in Trials COV-2067 and HV-2093. Geriatric Use Of the 4,567 subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection randomized in Trial COV-2067, 14% were 65 years or older, and 4% were 75 years of age or older. Of the 974 subjects randomized in Trial HV-2093, 13% were 65 years or older and 2% were 75 years of age or older. The difference in pharmacokinetics (PK) of casirivimab and imdevimab in geriatric patients compared to younger patients is unknown [see Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA]. Renal Impairment Casirivimab and imdevimab are not eliminated intact in the urine, thus renal impairment is not expected to affect the exposure of casirivimab and imdevimab. Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on PK of casirivimab and imdevimab is unknown. Other Specific Populations The effect of other covariates (e.g., sex, race, body weight, disease severity) on PK of casirivimab and imdevimab is unknown. OVERDOSE Doses up to 8,000 mg (4,000 mg each of casirivimab and imdevimab, greater than 3 times the recommended dose) have been administered in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. Treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific [antidote](https://www.rxlist.com/antidote/definition.htm) for overdose with REGEN-COV (casirivimab and (IgG1) and imdevimab (IgG1) are two recombinant human mAbs are unmodified in the Fc regions. Casirivimab and imdevimab bind to epitopes with [dissociation](https://www.rxlist.com/dissociation/definition.htm) imdevimab and casirivimab and imdevimab together blocked RBD binding to the human [ACE2](https://www.rxlist.com/ace2_angiotensin_converting_enzyme_2/definition.htm) receptor with IC50 values of 56.4 pM, 165 pM 81.8 with doses of up to 6.66 times the recommended dose (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab; 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab; 4,000 mg of casirivimab and 4,000 mg of imdevimab) in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. A flat dose-response relationship for efficacy was identified for REGEN-COV at all doses, based on viral load and clinical outcomes. Similar reductions in viral load (log10 copies/mL) were observed in subjects for the (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab) intravenous and (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab) subcutaneous doses; however, only limited clinical outcome data are available for the subcutaneous route of administration for the treatment of symptomatic patients. Pharmacokinetics Both casirivimab and imdevimab exhibited linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (PK) between (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab) to (4,000 mg of casirivimab and 4,000 mg of imdevimab) doses of REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) following intravenous administration of single dose. A summary of PK parameters after a single (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab) intravenous dose, for each antibody is provided in Table 4. Table 4: Summary of PK Parameters for Casirivimab and Imdevimab After a Single 600 mg of Casirivimab and 600 mg of Imdevimab Intravenous 2 concentration at end of 1-hour infusion 3 observed concentration 28 days after dosing, i.e., on day 29, as defined in the protocol A summary of PK parameters after a single 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab subcutaneous dose is shown in Table 5. Table 5: Summary of PK Parameters for Casirivimab and Imdevimab After a Single 600 mg of Casirivimab and 600 mg of | 2 Median (range) 3 Value reported for subjects with %AUCinf extrapolated <20% 4 Observed concentration 28 days after dosing, i.e., on day 29 5 Mean (SD) concentration at 24 hours (C24) of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum with 22.5 (11.0) mg/L and 25.0 (16.4) mg/L, respectively Specific Populations The effect of different covariates (e.g., age, sex, race, body weight, disease severity, hepatic impairment) on the PK of casirivimab and imdevimab is unknown. Renal impairment is not expected to impact the PK of casirivimab and imdevimab, since mAbs with molecular weight >69 kDa are known not to undergo renal elimination. Similarly, dialysis is not expected to impact the PK of casirivimab and imdevimab. Drug-Drug Interactions excreted or metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors P450 enzymes are unlikely [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Microbiology/Resistance Information Antiviral Activity In a Vero Casirivimab, imdevimab and casirivimab and effector Casirivimab, imdevimab Casirivimab, complement-dependent cytotoxicity in cell-based assays. Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) Of Infection The potential of casirivimab and of imdevimab to mediate viral entry was assessed in immune cell lines co-incubated with recombinant vesicular protein at concentrations of mAb(s) down to approximately 10-fold below the respective neutralization EC50 values. Casirivimab and imdevimab together and imdevimab alone, but not casirivimab alone, mediated of pseudotyped VLP into FcR2+ Raji and FcR1+/FcR2+ THP1 cells (maximum infection in total cells of 1.34% and 0.24%, respectively, for imdevimab; 0.69% and 0.06%, respectively for casirivimab and imdevimab together), but not any other cell lines tested (IM9, K562, Ramos and U937 cells). Antiviral Resistance There is a potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are resistant to casirivimab and imdevimab administered together. Prescribing healthcare providers should consider the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in their area, where data are available, when considering treatment options. Escape variants were identified following two passages in cell culture of recombinant VSV encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the presence of casirivimab or imdevimab individually, but not following two passages in the presence of casirivimab and imdevimab together. Variants which showed reduced susceptibility to casirivimab alone included those with spike variants circulating SARS-CoV-2, variants with reduced susceptibility to casirivimab and imdevimab together. Casirivimab and imdevimab individually and together retained neutralization activity against pseudotyped VLP expressing all spike protein substitutions found in the B.1.1.7 lineage (UK origin) and against pseudotyped VLP expressing only N501Y found in B.1.1.7 and other circulating lineages (Table 6). Casirivimab and imdevimab together retained neutralization activity against pseudotyped VLP all protein substitutions, or E484K or N501Y, found in the B.1.1351 lineage (South Africa origin), and all spike protein substitutions or key substitutions K417T+E484K, found in the P.1 lineage (Brazil origin), although casirivimab alone, but not imdevimab, had reduced activity against pseudotyped VLP expressing K417N or E484K, as indicated above. The E484K substitution is also found in the B.1.526 lineage (New York origin). Casirivimab and imdevimab, individually and together, retained neutralization activity against the L452R substitution found in the B.1.427/B.1.429 lineages (California origin). Casirivimab and imdevimab, individually and together, retained neutralization activity against pseudotyped VLP expressing L452R+K478T substitutions found in the B.1.617.2 lineage (India origin). Casirivimab and imdevimab together retained neutralization activity against pseudotyped VLP expressing L452R+E484Q substitutions, found in the B.1.617.1/B.1.617.3 lineages (India origin), although casirivimab alone, but not imdevimab, had reduced activity against pseudotyped VLP expressing E484Q, as indicated above. Table 6: Pseudotyped Particle Neutralization Data for SARS-CoV-2 entire variant spike protein was tested. The following changes from wild-type spike protein are the entire variant spike protein was tested. The following changes from wild-type spike protein are entire variant spike protein was tested. The following changes from wild-type spike protein are reduction in susceptibility. e Not all isolates of the New York lineage harbor the E484K substitution (as of February 2021). It is not known how pseudotyped VLP data correlate with clinical outcomes. In clinical trial COV-2067, interim data indicated only one variant (G446V) occurring at an allele fraction 15%, which was detected in 3/66 subjects who had nucleotide sequencing data, each at a single time point (two at baseline in subjects from placebo and 2,400 mg casirivimab and imdevimab groups, and one at Day 25 in a subject from the 8,000 mg casirivimab and imdevimab group). The G446V variant had reduced susceptibility to imdevimab of 135-fold compared to wild-type in a pseudotyped VSV VLP neutralization assay but retained susceptibility to casirivimab alone and casirivimab and imdevimab together. It is possible that resistance-associated variants to casirivimab and imdevimab together could have cross-resistance to other mAbs targeting the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The clinical impact is not known. Immune Response Attenuation There is a theoretical risk that antibody administration may attenuate the endogenous immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and make patients more susceptible to re-infection. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with casirivimab and imdevimab. In a toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, casirivimab and imdevimab had no adverse effects when administered intravenously. Non-adverse liver findings (minor transient increases in AST and ALT) were observed. In tissue cross-reactivity studies with casirivimab and imdevimab using human adult and fetal tissues, no binding of clinical concern was detected. Animal Pharmacologic And Efficacy Data Casirivimab and imdevimab administered together has been assessed in rhesus macaque and Syrian golden hamster treatment models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therapeutic administration of casirivimab and imdevimab together at 25 mg/kg or 150 rhesus macaques (n=4 for each group) 1-day infection in approximately 1-2 log10 reductions in genomic and sub-genomic viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs and oral swabs at Day 4 post-challenge in most animals, and reduced lung pathology relative to placebo-treated animals. Therapeutic administration of casirivimab and imdevimab together at 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses to hamsters 1-day post infection resulted in reduced weight loss relative to placebo treated animals, but had no clear effects on viral load in lung tissue. The applicability of these findings to a clinical setting is not known. Clinical Trial Results And Supporting Data For Eua Mild To Moderate COVID-19 (COV-2067) The data supporting this EUA are based on the analysis of Phase 1/2/3 from trial, COV-2067 (NCT04425629). This is a clinical trial evaluating REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) for the treatment of subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19 (subjects with COVID-19 symptoms who are not hospitalized). Cohort 1 enrolled adult subjects who were not hospitalized and had 1 or more COVID-19 symptoms that were at least mild in severity. Treatment was initiated within 3 days of obtaining a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral infection determination. Subjects in the Phase 3 primary efficacy analysis met the criteria for high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, as shown in Section 2. In the Phase 3 trial, 4,567 subjects with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 were randomized to a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab (n=838), 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab (n=1,529), 4,000 mg of casirivimab and 4,000 mg of imdevimab (n=700), or placebo (n=1,500) groups. The two REGEN-COV doses at the start of Phase 3 were 4,000 mg and 1,200 mg of each component; however, based on Phase 1/2 efficacy analyses showing that the 4,000 mg and 1,200 mg doses of each component were similar, the Phase 3 portion of the protocol was amended to compare 1,200 mg dose of each component vs. placebo and 600 mg dose of each component vs. placebo. Comparisons were between subjects randomized to the specific REGEN-COV dose and subjects who were concurrently randomized to placebo. At baseline, in all randomized subjects with at least one risk factor, the median age was 50 years (with 13% of subjects ages 65 years or older), 52% of the subjects were female, 84% were White, 36% were Hispanic or Latino, and 5% were Black or African American. In subjects with available baseline symptom data, 15% had mild symptoms, 42% had moderate, 42% had severe symptoms, and 2% reported no symptoms at baseline; the median duration of symptoms was 3 days; mean viral load was 6.2 log10 copies/mL at baseline. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with 1 COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death through Day 29, in subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab at randomization, and with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, i.e., the modified full analysis set (mFAS). In the mFAS, events (COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death through Day 29) occurred in 7 (1.0%) subjects treated with 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab compared to 24 (3%) subjects concurrently randomized to placebo, demonstrating a 70% reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death compared to placebo (p=0.0024). Events occurred in 18 (1.3%) subjects treated with 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab compared to 62 (5%) subjects concurrently randomized to placebo, demonstrating a 71% reduction compared to placebo (REGEN-COV 1% vs placebo 5%, p<0.0001). In the 1,200 mg analysis, there was 1 death each in the REGEN-COV and placebo arm (p=1.0); and in 2,400 mg analysis, there were 1 and 3 deaths, respectively, in the REGEN-COV and placebo arms (p=0.3721). Overall, similar effects were observed for 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab and 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab doses, indicating the absence of a dose effect; therefore the 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab dose is authorized and the 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab dose is no longer authorized under this EUA (See Table 7). Results were consistent across subgroups of patients defined by nasopharyngeal viral load >106 copies/mL at baseline or serologic status. Table 7: Proportion of subjects with 1 COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death through day 29 |600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab n=736 |Placebo | n=748 | n=1,355 |Placebo | n=1,341 |# of subjects resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the LS mean viral load (log10 copies/mL) from baseline to Day 7 compared to placebo (-0.71 log10 copies/mL for 600 mg dose of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab and -0.86 log10 copies/mL for 2,400 mg; p<0.0001). Reductions were observed in the overall mFAS population and in other subgroups, including those with baseline viral load >106 copies/mL or who were seronegative at baseline. Consistent effects were observed for the individual doses, indicating the absence of a dose effect. shows the mean change from baseline in SARS-COV-2 viral load to Day 15. Figure 1: Change from Baseline in SARS-COV-2 Viral Load (log10 copies/mL) to Day 15 The median time to symptom [resolution](https://www.rxlist.com/resolution/definition.htm), as recorded in a trial-specific daily symptom diary, was 10 days for REGEN-COV-treated subjects, as compared with 14 days for placebo-treated subjects (p=0.0001 for 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab vs. placebo; p<0.0001 for 1,200 mg of casirivimab and 1,200 mg of imdevimab vs. placebo). Symptoms assessed were fever, chills, [sore throat](https://www.rxlist.com/sore_throat/definition.htm), cough, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, red/watery eyes, body aches, loss of taste/ [smell](https://www.rxlist.com/smell/definition.htm), fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion, dizziness, pressure/tight chest, chest pain, stomachache, rash, sneezing, sputum/phlegm, [runny nose](https://www.rxlist.com/runny_nose/definition.htm).
