Logan is well-known for its prestigious chiropractic program. Grounded in four core techniques, Logan's DC program offers instruction in 15 evidence-based techniques, more than any other U.S. program. Right from the start, 40% of your first year will be spent in hands-on clinical skills courses to find out early if the chiropractic profession is right for you. Also, chiropractic students can learn from experts in public health during their time in the DC program. Our Chiro Connection Mentor Program allows prospective students the ability to speak with a practicing chiropractor via phone, zoom, or in-person shadowing. What are some of the required courses for a DC degree? To earn your Doctor of Chiropractic degree, you must take all the required courses and complete elective credit hours as outlined in the DC Academic Degree Plan. What are the admission requirements for this degree program? (Info is all from current website page) As one of the nation's top integrated health universities, Logan offers several ways for future leaders to enter our Doctor of Chiropractic program. Don't hesitate to reach out to our Admissions Team with any questions you may have at [admissions@logan.edu](mailto:admissions@logan.edu). Path One: I have completed a bachelor's degree If you've completed a bachelor's degree with a minimum of 24 semester hours of life and/or physical science, have a cumulative GPA above 3.0 and half of your science courses including a lab, you are eligible to apply for Logan's Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) program. Path Two: I have completed the prerequisite coursework to begin the DC program If you've completed at least 90 semester hours (or 135 quarter hours), including 24 semester hours of life and/or physical science and have a cumulative GPA above a 3.0, you may apply for the DC program. Path Three: My current college participates in the 3+3 program Save time and tuition. Through agreements with dozens of universities across the U.S., Logan University allows students to begin their undergraduate degree at a partner school, then transfer to Logan's DC program after earning 90 semester hours of college credits with a minimum of 24 semester hours of life and/or physical science. Cumulative GPA must be greater than 3.0 with at least half of your science hours containing a lab component. On completion of your first year in the DC program, the hours transfer back to the partner school, where you will receive your bachelor's degree. You may then continue your DC coursework at Logan. Path Four: I haven't started a degree program, but I may have some college credit First-time freshmen or transfer students can save time and tuition with Logan's 3+3 option. Students admitted to our DC program apply toward your BSLS degree, so that you can complete your bachelor's and your Doctor of Chiropractic in about six years. Path Five: I am a high school student Logan's Early College Credit Program (ECCP) allows qualified high school juniors and seniors to earn college credit while still in high school, giving you an early start on your college education. On completion of high school, students may apply for Logan's BSLS program and ultimately our DC program. Path Six: I don't fit into any of the above boxes, but I know chiropractic is the right career for me Contact a Logan Admissions Coordinator for help in determining your eligibility for the Alternative Admissions Track Program (AATP). If you are passionate about serving people through natural health care but took a less traditional path in entering the chiropractic profession, the AATP can help you earn credits toward your DC degree.
