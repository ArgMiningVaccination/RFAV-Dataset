Home - and Community -Based Service Waivers Medicai d home - and community -based se rvices (HCBS) are federally approved waiver programs available to individ uals who meet the required Medicaid -covered level of care p rovided in a nursing facility, skilled nursing facility, and intermediate care facility for in dividual s with an intellectual disability, or hospital . The amount, scope , and duration of the waiver p rograms are limited to what has been approved by the federa l government . Members may receive services through fee -for-service or through a Medicaid enrol led Mana ged Care Organization (MCO). Individuals must have a need for assistance with activities of dai ly living or need assistance due to their inability to func tion independently in their home - or community -related to their disability or age . Once the ap plicant is approved for the HCBS waiver, an interdisciplinary team is assembled to assist in assessing the needs of the member , identify what services can meet th e memb er's needs, identify who can provide the services, and the amount of services, and cost of services. If a member selects home - and community -based services, the provision of these services m ust be based on the assessed service needs of the member an d services must be available to meet their needs . The Department requires advance approval for fee-for-service payment under the waiver s. The services must also be cost - effective and least costly t o meet the needs of the member . Fee-for-service payment wil l only be made to eligible and enrolled Medicaid HCBS waiver providers .

Legal Basis Section 2176 of OBRA amended the Social Security Act to create the waiver program. The purpose and intent of a Medicaid waiver is stated in Section 1902(c) of the Social Security Act. Provider and Ch apter Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) Chapter II I. Provider -Specific Policies Page 2 Date Revised June 24, 2022 The legal basis for Medicaid home - and community -based s ervice waivers is found in Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act . Public Law 97 -35, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981, contained provisions allowing states to request waivers to provide cost -effective home - and community -based servi ces to eligible people so they can avoid or leave institutionalization. The OBRA of 1987 established that people residing in nursing homes who meet assessment criteria for specialized services can access waiver programs. The portions of the Code of Federa l Regulations specifically dealing with home - and community -based services are in Title 42, 441 .310. These regulations spec ify the requirements that the state must meet to be eligible for federal financia l participation and, in addition to the Social Security Act, serve as the basis for state law and administrative rules. All waivers are administere d by the designated state Me dicaid agency that is Iowa Medicaid . Iowa Medicaid has the authority for the oper ation of the waiver programs including prior authorization of waiver services . There are currently seven HCBS waivers that inclu de: AIDS/HIV Brain injury (BI) Children's menta l health (CMH) Elderly ( EW) Health and disability (HD) Intellectual disability (I D) Physical disability (PD) 2.

Standards for Providers of Service Providers are e ligible to participate in the Medicaid program as approv ed waiver service providers based on the standards pertaining to the individual servi ce. In order to provide quality services to memb ers, organizations need to ha ve sound administrative and organizati onal practices. Providers should have a core set of policies and procedures based on t he services for which they are enrolled to provide. The policies and procedures are the foundation of a provider's performance and g uide them on the provision of services . The organization must have written policies and procedures that outline the organiz ation's day -to-day operations, ensure compliance with l aws and regulations, and give guidance for staff. At a minimum, HCBS Waiver Providers must have writte n policies a nd procedures according to state and federal laws for intake, admission, service coordination, discharge , and referral . \"Service coordination\" means activities designed to help individuals and families locate, access, a nd coordinate a network o f supports a nd services that will allow them to live a full life in the community . This is specific to certified services . Providers must al so have writt en policies and procedures and a staff trainin g program for the identificatio n and reporting of child and dependen t adult abuse to the Department. Providers and their staff must complete child abuse, dependent adult abuse, and criminal backgro und screening s pursuant to Iowa Code section 249A.29 before the provision of direct care s ervices to members of any waiver prog ram. Providers and contracting entities are required to check the program exclusion status of individuals and entities before entering into em ployment or contractual relationships . To dete rmine whether an individual or entity is excluded , searc h the HHS-OIG website at : http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov/ . An excluded individual or an entity employing or contracting with an excluded individual or en tity that submits a claim for reimbursement to a federal health c are program, or causes such a claim to be submitted, may be subject to civil money penalties and other damages for each item or service furnished during the period that the person or entity w as excluded (section 1128A (a)(1)(D) of the Social Security Act) . Provider and Chapter Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) Chapter II I. Provider -Specific Policies Page 115 Date Revised June 24, 2022 Providers should search the HHS -OIG website monthly to capture exclusions a nd reinstatements that have oc curred since the last search . Claims paid by the Medicaid program for services render ed by an excluded individu al or entity are subject to r epayment . Providers may also be subject to penalties by the OIG . Providers can search the HHS-OIG website by the nam e of any individual or entity . An additional listing of parties excluded from any fed eral payment is the System for Award Management (SAM) a t: https://www.sam.gov . It is recommended that this listing be checked as well. Enrollment carries no assurance that the approved provider will receive funding . Payment for services will be made to a provider only upon Department approval of the provider and of the service the prov ider is authorized to p rovide on an individual member basis. Iowa Medicaid shall review compliance with standards for initial enro llment . Review of a provider may occur a t any time. The Departm ent may request any information from the prospective service provider that is pertinent to a rriving at an enrollment decision . This information may include: Current accreditations. Evaluations. Inspection reports. Reviews by regulato ry and lice nsing agenci es and associati ons. Evidence of financial sustainability. All Medicaid providers are expect ed to adhere to the stat e and federal rules applicable to each service and business operation includi ng the Department of Labor, Fair Labor S tandards Act. 1. Home - and Communit y-Based Services (HCBS) Pr ovider Quality Manageme nt Self-Assessment The Home - and Community -Based Servi ces (HCBS) Provider Quality Management Self -Assessment proces s was develop ed as a way for the state to gather data to support the quality fr amework perfo rmance measures as required by the Centers for Me dicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) . The provider self -assessment process mirrors a CMS review process by requiring HCBS waiver providers to develop a quality improvement system of monitoring the ir own performance and then \"showing\" the state how it provides quality oversight. Provider and Chapter Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) Chapter II I. Provider -Specific Policies Page 116 Date Revised June 24, 2022 The first step in the provider self -assessment process is to ident ify a core set of policies and p rocedure s for all waiver providers b ased on the services they provide . The policies and proc edures are the foundation of a provider's perform ance and guide them on the provisi on of HCBS waiver services . The state has identif ied a minimal set of policies and pro cedures based on the CMS assura nces, Iowa Administrative Code requirements, laws found in th e Iowa Code, federal regulations , and best practi ces identified through previo us quality oversight activities of HCBS providers . The provider self -assessment requi res a provider to identify the applicable policies and procedures that have been established by the agency upon enrollment to ensure complian ce with laws, rules, regulati ons, and best practices . A provider may also iden tify any of the standards in the self - assessment that are not applic able to the services for which they are enrolled . Once the core policies and proc edures have been established through the self-assessment, the HCBS Quality Oversight staff u ses four metho ds of discovery to verify the implementation of a provider 's quality performance activities: Annual self -assessment , Targeted review, Focused review, and Periodic or Certification review. These reviews may b e complet ed via a desk or on -site review. The Pro vider Quality Mana gement Self -Assessment reflects this process as well as information obtained from provider input . The focus of the Provider Quality Management Self -Assessment and subsequent review activiti es are to assist providers in regulatory complian ce and quality imp rovement . This system of provi der oversight is req uired for all Medicaid providers enrolled to provide the following HCBS waiver services : AIDS/HIV waiver. Agency consumer -directed attenda nt care (CDAC), respite, adult da y care, and counseling. Brain injury wa iver.

Resource Sharing for Employment Services People are mo re likely to succeed in empl oyment when funding and services available through bot h IVRS and Medicaid are shared . Each program has limitations but togethe r they can provide holistic suppo rt for someone with a disability who wants to find and keep community -integrated employment. The following Resource Sharing document was developed betw een IVRS a nd the DHS/Iow a Medicaid Enterprise in January of 2015 . This \" cheat sheet\" is the result of a c ollaborative effort by both agencies to satisfy the requirement each had to explore \"comparable b enefits and services\" and address the \"payer of last r esort\" iss ue. By establishing thi s Resource Sharing document, IVRS and DHS, Iowa Medicaid have outli ned their respective f unding obligations when paying for Suppo rted Employm ent Services (SES) for a mutual client served by both agencies . The document has been u pdated to reflect the new (2014) IVRS policy to fund the necessary employment services (includi ng Supported Employmen t Services when needed) to help an eligi ble individu al with a disability under the age of 24 to get a community -integrated job pa ying at least minimum wage. The Resource Sharing document also outlines procedural inf ormation for individuals on a DHS , Iowa Medicaid waiver waiting list who are eligible to be served by IVRS, including options for long -term follow -up services if wa iver services are not immediately available. Some additional item s to be aware of: Individuals can rece ive state plan habilitation or wa iver funded services (including employment serv ices) during the same time period that IVRS is also providing services to them as l ong as the services provided through state plan habilit ation or waiver do not duplicate the s ervices provided by IVRS. Provider and Chapter Home - and Community -Based Servic es (HCBS) Chapter II I. Provider -Specific Policies Page 176 Date Revised June 24, 2022 When IVRS closes a case for someone enrolled in state plan habilitation or a waiver , the person may have a need for ongoing sup ports to m aintain their competit ive integrated employment . The IV RS counselor is expected to inform you in advance of the case closure date so that you can submit a timely request for prior authorization for the services that may be needed . There should be no gap in the availability of s upports . A gap could jeopardize t he person's ability to maintain the pe rson's job; therefore, this should be av oided at all costs. 2. Resource Sharing Between DHS and IVRS for Supported Employment Services This section explains how S upported Employment Se rvices (SES) are funded for mutua l job candidates who are eligible for both IVRS services and DHS state plan habilitation or wa iver s ervices .
