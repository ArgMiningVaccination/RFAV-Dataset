China CDC Primers and probes for detection 2019 -nCoV (posted on 24 January 2020) Specific primers and probes for detection 2019 novel coronavirus 2020 -01-21 1. RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 Institut Pasteur, Paris This protocol describes procedures for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 for two RdRp targets (IP2 and IP4). Based on the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2 made available on the GISAID database on January 11, 2020, primers and probes (nCoV_IP2 and nCoV_IP4) were designed to target the RdRp gene spanning nt 12621-12727 and 14010-14116 (positions according SARS-CoV, NC_004718). As a confirmatory assay, we used the E gene assay from the Charit\u00e9 protocol1 Material size Ref.

Testing in the United States is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263a, to perform high complexity tests. Results are for the identification of 2019- nCoV RNA. The 2019 -nCoV RNA is generally detectable in upper and lower respiratory specimens during infection. Positive results are indicative of active infection with 2019- nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co -infection with other v iruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities. Negative results do not preclude 2019 -nCoV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological informatio n. Testing with the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use by trained laboratory personnel who are proficient in performing real -time RT -PCR assays. The CDC 2019 -Novel Coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Pane l is only for use under a Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization. Summary and Explanation An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China was initially reported to WHO on December 31, 2019. Chinese au thorities identified a novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV), which has resulted in thousands of confirmed human infections in multiple provinces throughout China and many countries including the United States. Cases of asymptomatic infection, mild illness, severe illness , and some deaths have been reported. The CDC 2019- nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel i s a molecular in vitro diagnostic test that aids in the detection and diagnosis 2019 -nCoV and is based on widely used nucleic acid amplification technology. The product contains oligonucleotide primers and dual -labeled hydrolysis probes (TaqMan\u00ae) and control material used in rR T-PCR for the in vitro qualitative detection of 2019 -nCoV RNA in respiratory specimens. The term \"qualified laboratories\" refers to laboratories in which all users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to us e. 3 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Principles of the Procedure The oligonucleotide primers and probes for detection of 2019 -nCoV were selected from regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene. The panel is designed for specific detection of the 2019 -nCoV (two primer/probe sets). An additional primer/probe set to detect the human RNase P gene (RP) in control samples and clinical specimens is also included in the panel. RNA isolated and purified from upper and lower respiratory specimens is reverse transcribed to cDNA and subsequentl y amplified in the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real -Time PCR Instrument with SDS version 1.4 software. In the process, the probe anneals to a specific target sequence located between the forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the P CR cycle, the 5' nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades the probe, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective prob es, increasing the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real -Time PCR System with SDS version 1.4 software. Detection of viral RNA not only aids in the diagnosis of illness but also provides epidemiological and surveillance information. 4 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Summary of Preparation and Testing Process Resuspend primer/probe aliquot and store at -20\u00b0C Resuspend and aliquot nCoVPC, store at - 70\u00b0C Extract sample RNA and HSC RNA Prepare master mix (15 \u00b5L) Prepare rRT -PCR plate (5 \u00b5L RNA) Run assay on ABI 7500Fast Dx Analyze data Report results Upon receipt of rRT-PCR Panel reagents Upon obtaining sample 5 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Materials Required (Provided) Note: CDC will maintain on its website a list of commercially available lots of primer and probe sets and/or positive control materials that are acceptable alternatives to the CDC primer and probe set and/or positive control included in the Diagnostic Panel.

Refer to Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with 2019 -nCoV https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -nCoV/lab -biosafety -guidelines.html . Specimen processing should be performed in accordance with national biological safety regulations. If infection with 2019 -nCoV is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions. Performance characteristics have been determined with human upper respiratory specimens and lower respiratory tract specimens from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Perform all manipulations of live virus samples within a Class II (or higher) biological safety cabinet (BSC). Use personal protective equipment such as (but not limited to) gloves, eye protectio n, and lab coats when handling kit reagents while performing this assay and handling materials including samples, reagents, pipettes, and other equipment and reagents. 9 CDC-006-00019, CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Amplification technologies such as PCR are sensitive to accidental introduction of PCR p roduct from previous amplifications reactions. Incorrect results could occur if either the clinical specimen or the real- time reagents used in the amplification step become contaminated by accidental introduction of amplification product (amplicon). Workfl ow in the laboratory should proceed in a unidirectional manner. Maintain separate areas for assay setup and handling of nucleic acids. Always check the expiration date prior to use. Do not use expired reagent. Do not substitute or mix reagent from differe nt kit lots or from other manufacturers. Change aerosol barrier pipette tips between all manual liquid transfers. During preparation of samples, compliance with good laboratory techniques is essential to minimize the risk of cross -contamination between sam ples, and the inadvertent introduction of nucleases into samples during and after the extraction procedure. Proper aseptic technique should always be used when working with nucleic acids. Maintain separate, dedicated equipment (e.g., pipettes, microcentrif uges) and supplies (e.g., microcentrifuge tubes, pipette tips) for assay setup and handling of extracted nucleic acids. Wear a clean lab coat and powder- free disposable gloves (not previously worn) when setting up assays. Change gloves between samples and whenever contamination is suspected. Keep reagent and reaction tubes capped or covered as much as possible. Primers, probes (including aliquots), and enzyme master mix must be thawed and maintained on cold block at all times during preparation and use. Work surfaces, pipettes, and centrifuges should be cleaned and decontaminated with cleaning products such as 10% bleach, \"DNA Zap\" or \"RNase AWAY\u00ae\" to minimize risk of nucleic acid contamination. Residual bleach should be remov ed using 70% ethanol. RNA should be maintained on cold block or on ice during preparation and use to ensure stability. Dispose of unused kit reagents and human specimens according to local, state, and federal regulations. Reagent Storage, Handling, and St ability Store all dried primers and probes and the positive control, nCoVPC, at 2 -8\u00b0C until re -hydrated for use. Store liquid HSC control materials at -20\u00b0C. Note: Storage information is for CDC primer and probe materials obtained through the Internatio nal Reagent Re source . If using commercial primers and probes, please refer to the manufacturer's instructions for storage and handling. Always check the expiration date prior to use. Do not use expired reagents. Protect fluorogenic probes from light. Primers, probes (including aliquots), and enzyme master mix must be thawed and kept on a cold block at all times during preparation and use. Do not refreeze probes. Controls and aliquots of controls must be thawed and kept on ice at all times during preparation and use. 10 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Specimen Collection, Handling, and Storage Inadequate or inappropriate specimen collection, storage, and transport are likely to yield false test results.

The NTC reactions for all primer and probe sets should not exhibit fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line. If any of the NTC reactions exhibit a growth curve that crosses the cycle threshold, sample contamination may have occurred. Invalidate the run and repeat the assay with strict adherence to the guidelines. 2019 -nCoV Positive Control (nCoVPC) The nCoVPC consists of in vitro transcribed RNA. The nCoVPC will yield a positive result with the following primer and probe sets: N1, N2 and RP. Human Specimen Control (HSC) (Extraction Control) When HSC is run with the CDC 2019 -nCoV rRT -PCR Diagnostic Panel (se e previous section on Assay Set Up), the HSC is used as an RNA extraction procedural control to demonstrate successful recovery of RNA as well as extraction reagent integrity. The HSC control consists of noninfectious cultured human cell (A549) material. P urified nucleic acid from the HSC should yield a positive result with the RP primer and probe set and negative results with all 2019 -nCoV markers. Expected Performance of Controls Included in the CDC 2019- nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel Control Type External Control Name Used to Monitor 2019 nCoV_N1 2019 nCoV_N2 RP Expected Ct Values Positive nCoVPC Substantial reagent failure including primer and probe integrity + + + < 40.00 Ct Negative NTC Reagent and/or environmental contamination - - - None detected Extraction HSC Failure in lysis and extraction procedure, potential contamination during extraction - - + < 40.00 Ct If any of the above controls do not exhibit the expected performance as described, the assay may have been set up and/or executed improperly, or reagent or equipment malfunction could have occurred. Invalidate the run and re -test. 31 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 RNase P (Extraction Control) All clinical samples should exhibit fluorescence growth curves in the RNase P reaction that cross the threshold line within 40.00 cycles (< 40.00 Ct), thus indicating the presence of the human RNase P gene. Failure to detect RNase P in any clinical specime ns may indicate: Improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials resulting in loss of RNA and/or RNA degradation. Absence of sufficient human cellular material due to poor collection or loss of specimen integrity. Improper assay set up and ex ecution. Reagent or equipment malfunction. If the RP assay does not produce a positive result for human clinical specimens, interpret as follows: If the 2019- nCoV N1 and N2are positive even in the absence of a positive RP, the result should be considered valid. It is possible, that some samples may fail to exhibit RNase P growth curves due to low cell numbers in the original clinical sample. A negative RP signal does not preclude the presence of 2019 -nCoV virus RNA in a clinical specimen. If all 2019 -nCoV markers AND RNase P are negative for the specimen, the result should be considered invalid for the specimen. If residual specimen is available, repeat the extraction procedure and repeat the test. If all markers remain negative after re -test, re port the results as invalid and a new specimen should be collected if possible . 2019 -nCoV Markers (N1 and N2) When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered negative if all 2019 - nCoV marker (N1, N2) cycle threshold growth curves DO NOT cross the threshold line within 40.00 cycles (< 40.00 Ct) AND the RNase P growth curve DOES cross th e threshold line within 40.00 cycles (< 40.00 Ct) . When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered positive for 2019 -nCoV if all 2019- nCoV marker (N1, N2) cycle threshold growth curve s cross the threshold line within 40.00 cycles (< 40.00 Ct) . The RNase P may or may not be positive as described above, but the 2019 -nCoV result is still valid. When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the growth curves for the 2019 -nCoV markers (N1, N2) AND the RNase P marker DO NOT cross the cycle threshold growth curve within 40.00 cycles (< 40.00 Ct) , the result is invalid. The extracted RNA from the specimen should be re - tested. If residual RNA is not available, re -extract RNA from residual specimen and re -test. If the re - tested s ample is negative for all markers and RNase P, the result is invalid and collection of a new specimen from the patient should be considered. When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the cycle threshold growth curve for any one marker (N1 or N2 but not both markers) crosses the threshold line within 40.00 cycles (< 40.00 Ct) the result is inconclusive. The extracted RNA should be retested. If residual RNA is not available, re - extract RNA from residual specimen and re -test. If the same result is obtained, the laboratory should coordinate transfer of the specimen to CDC for further analysis. If HSC is posi tive for N1 or N2, then contamination may have occurred during extraction or sample processing. Invalidate all results for specimens extracted alongside the HSC . Re-extract specimens and HSC and re -test. Diagnostic Panel Results Interp retation Guide The table below lists the expected results for the 2019 -nCoV rRT -PCR Diagnostic Panel. If a laboratory obtains unexpected results for assay controls or if inconclusive or invalid results are obtained and cannot be resolved through the recommended re -testing, please contact CDC for consultation and possible specimen referral.

If the repeated result remains invalid, consider collecting a new specimen from the patient. aLaboratories should report their diagnostic result as appropriate and in compliance with their specific reporting system. bOptimum specimen types and timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus. The possibility of a false negative result should especially be considered if the patient's recent exposures or clinical presentation suggest that 2019-nCoV infection is possible, and diagnostic tests for other causes of illness (e.g., other respiratory illness) are negative. If 2019-nCoV infection is st ill suspected, re-testing should be considered in consultation with public health authorities. 33 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Quality Control Quality control requirements must be performed in conformance with local, state, and federal regulations or accreditation requirements and the user's laboratory's standard quality control procedures. For further guidance on appropriate quality control practices, refer to 42 CFR 493.1256. Quality control procedures are intended to monitor reagent and assay performance. Test all positive controls prior to running diagnostic samples with each new kit lot to ensure all reagents and kit components are working properly. Good laboratory practice (cGLP) recommends including a positive extraction control in each nucleic acid iso lation batch. Although HSC is not included with the 2019 -nCov rRT -PCR Diagnostic Panel, the HSC extraction control must proceed through nucleic acid isolation per batch of specimens to be tested. Always include a negative control (NTC), and the appropriat e positive control (nCoVPC) in each amplification and detection run. All clinical samples should be tested for human RNAse P gene to control for specimen quality and extraction. Limitations All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results should be trained to perform this procedure by a competent instructor. They should demonstrate their ability to perform the test and interpret the results prior to performing the assay independently. Performance of the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diag nostic Panel has only been established in upper and lower respiratory specimens (such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate). Negative results do not preclude 2019 -nCoV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Optimum specimen types and timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019 -nCoV have not been determine d. Collection of multiple specimens (types and time points) from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus. A false negative result may occur if a specimen is improperly collected, transported or handled. False negative results may also occur i f amplification inhibitors are present in the specimen or if inadequate numbers of organisms are present in the specimen. Positive and negative predictive values are highly dependent on prevalence. False negative test results are more likely when prevalen ce of disease is high. False positive test results are more likely when prevalence is moderate to low. Do not use any reagent past the expiration date. If the virus mutates in the rRT -PCR target region, 2019 -nCoV may not be detected or may be detected less predictably. Inhibitors or other types of interference may produce a false negative result. An interference study evaluating the effect of common cold medications was not performed. Test performance can be affected because the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of infection caused by 2019- nCoV is not fully known. For example, clinicians and laboratories may not know the optimum types of specimens to collect, and, during the course of infection, when these specimens are most likely to contain levels of viral RNA that can be readily detected. Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019 -nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms. 34 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019 -nCoV infection. The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019 -nCoV.

Performance Characteristics Analytical Performance: Limit of Detection (LoD): LoD studies determine the lowest detectable concentration of 2019 -nCoV at which approximately 95% of all (true positive) replicates test positive. The LoD was determined by limiting dilution studies using characterized samples. The analytical sensitivity of the rRT -PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies. Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019 -nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019 -nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/\u00b5L) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real- Time RT -PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific RT -qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real- Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel instruct ions for use. A preliminary LoD for each assay was determined testing triplicate samples of RNA purified using each extraction method. The approximate LoD was identified by extracting and testing 10 -fold serial dilutions of characterized stocks of in vitr o transcribed full- length RNA. A confirmation of the LoD was determined using 3-fold serial dilution RNA samples with 20 extracted replicates. The LoD was determined as the lowest concentration where 95% (19/20) of the replicates were positive. 36 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Table 4 .

In Silico Analysis of Primer and Probe Se quences: An alignment was performed with the oligonucleotide primer and probe sequences of the CDC 2019 nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel with all publicly available nucleic acid sequences for 2019 -nCoV in GenBank as of February 1, 2020 to demonstrat e the predicted inclusivity of the CDC 2019 nCoV Real -Time RT-PCR Diagnostic panel. All the alignments show 100% identity of the CDC panel to the available 2019 -nCoV sequences with the exception of one nucleotide mismatch with the N1 forward primer in one deposited sequence. The risk of a single mismatch resulting in a significant loss in reactivity, and false negative result, is 37 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 low due to the design of the primers and probes with melting temperatures > 60\u00b0C and run conditions of the assay with annealing t emperature at 55\u00b0C to tolerate two mismatches. Specificity/Exclusivity Testing: In Silico Analysis -nCoV rRT -PCR assays primers and probes were performed against public domain nucleotide sequences. The database search parameters were as follows: 1) The nucleotide collection consists of GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB+RefSeq sequences, but excludes EST, STS, GSS, WGS, TSA, patent sequences as well as phase 0, 1, and 2 HTGS sequences and sequences longer than 100Mb; 2) The database is non -redundant. Identical sequences have been merged into one entry, while preserving the accession, GI, title and taxonomy information for each entry; 3) Database was updated on 10/03/2019; 4) The search parameters automatically adjust for short input sequences and the expect threshold is 1000; 5) The match and mismatch scores are 1 and -3, respectively; 6) The penalty to create and extend a gap in an alignment is 5 and 2 respectively. 2019 -nCoV_N1 Assay: Probe sequence of 2019 -nCoV rRT high and Bat SARS- like coronavirus genome. However, forward and reverse primers showed no sequence homology with SARS coronavirus and Bat SARS- like coronavirus geno me. Combining primers and probe, there is no significant homologies with human genome, other coronaviruses or human microflora that would predict potential false positive rRT -PCR results. 2019 -nCoV_N2 Assay: The -nCoV rRT assay N2 showed high sequence homology to SARS- like coronaviruses. The reverse primer and probe sequences showed no significant homology with human genome, other coronaviruses or human microflora. Combining primers and probe, there is no prediction of potential false positive rRT -PCR results. In summary, the 2019 -nCoV rRT -PCR assay N1 and N2, designed for the specific detection of 2019 -nCoV, showed no significant combined homologies with human genome, other coronaviruses, or human microflora that wo uld predict potential false positive rRT -PCR results. In addition to the in silico analysis, several organisms were extracted and tested with the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel to demonstrate analytical specificity and exclusivity. Stud ies were performed with nucleic acids extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit. Nucleic acids were extracted from high titer preparations (typically 105 PFU/mL or 106 CFU/mL). Testing was performed using the ThemoFish er Scientific TaqPath 1 -Step RT -qPCR Master Mix, CG on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real- Time PCR instrument. The data demonstrate that the expected results are obtained for each organism when tested with the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnos tic Panel. 38 02 Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 7.

Specime n Stability and Fresh- frozen Testing: To increase the likelihood of detecting infection, CDC recommends collection of lower respiratory and upper respiratory specimens for testing. If possible, additional specimen types (e.g., stool, urine) should be collected and should be stored initially until decision is made by CDC whether additional specimen sources should be tested. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of symptom onset. Maintain proper infection cont rol when collecting specimens. Store specimens at 2 -8\u00b0C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. Label each specimen container with the patient's ID number (e.g., medical record number), unique specimen ID (e.g., laboratory requisition number), specimen type (e.g., nasal swabs) and the date the sample was collected. Complete a CDC Form 50.34 for each specimen submitted. 39 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Division of Viral Diseases Effective: 3/15/2020 Clinical Performance: As of February 22 , 2020, CDC has tested 2071 respiratory specimens from persons under investigation (PUI) in the U.S. using the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel.

Two thousand twenty -one (2021) respiratory specimens of the 2071 respiratory specimens tested negative by the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel. Forty -nine (49) of the 2071 respiratory s pecimens tested positive by the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel. Only one specimen (oropharyngeal (throat) swab) was invalid . Of the 49 respiratory specimens that tested positive by the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel , seven teen (17) were confirmed by genetic sequencing and/or virus culture (positive percent agreement = 17/17, 95% CI: 81.6 %-100%) During the early phase of the testing, a total of 117 respiratory specimens collected from 46 PUI subjects were also tested with two analytically validated real- time RT -PCR assays that target separate and independent regions of the nucleocapsid protein gene of the 2019 -nCoV, N4 and N5 assays. The nucleocapsid protein gene targets for the N4 and N5 assays are different and independent from the nucleocapsid protein gene targets for the two RT -PCR assays included in the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -40 CDC-006-00019, Revision: 02 CDC/DDID/NCIRD/ Effective: 3/15/2020 PCR Diagnostic Panel, N1 and N2. Any positive result from the N4 and/or the N5 assay was further investigated by genetic sequencing. Performance of the CDC 2019 -nCoV Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panel testing these 117 respiratory specimens was estimated against a composite comparator. A specimen was considered comparator negative if both the N4 and the N5 assays were negative. A specimen was considered comparator positive when the N4 and/or the N5 assay generated a positive result, and the c omparator positive result(s) were further investigated and confirmed to be 2019 -nCoV RNA positive by genetic sequencing.

Detection of second case of 2019-nCoV infection in Japan (corrected version) Viral Respiratory Infections and Cytokines, Department of Virology III, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, 208-0011 Tokyo, Japan: 2Department of Pathology, of Infectious Diseases, 1-23-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo 164-8640, Japan Method & Results 1) Nested RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from pharyngeal swab using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) following manufacture's instruction. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Super Script IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo) with random primer (Thermo) and oligodT primer (Thermo). PCR reaction was performed using Quick Taq HS Dyemix (TOYOBO, Japan) using two 2019-nCoV specific primers (Table 1). The PCR condition was as follows: 94\u00b0C for 1 min; 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 56\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 68\u00b0C for 1 min. After 1st PCR, nested PCR was performed using 2nd PCR primers and 1\u00b5L of 1st PCR product under the same condition as 1st PCR. The primer concentrations were 400nM for all. DDW was used as negative control. The amplicons were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). As the result, both primer sets detected desired size of bands. The rest of PCR products were purified with AMpure XP, and then direct sequencing analysis was performed using seq primers. The analyzed sequences showed 100% match with the sequence of WH-human1 (MN908947). Figure 1. Three specimens were tested this time. Agarose gel electrophoresis of 1st (A) and 2nd (B) PCR reaction. DNA marker (Gene Ladder Wide 1, Nippon gene) was used as a reference for fragment size. Lane 1 and 3 were negative clinical samples, lane 2 was positive clinical sample, and lane 4 was negative control. Table 1. Primer used for 2019-nCoV. 2) Real-time RT-PCR Real-time one step RT-PCR QuantiTect RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) on LightCycler96 system (Roche). A 20\u00b5L of reaction contains 10 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7Master Mix, 0.2 \u00b5L of RT mix, 3.8 \u00b5L of DDW, 1 \u00b5L of pre-diluted 20 \u00d7primer and probe mix, and 5\u00b5L of extracted RNA. The PCR condition was as follows: 50\u00b0C for 30 min; and 95\u00b0C for 15 min; and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The synthesized RNA, which contained artificial sequences that could distinguish the laboratory contamination, was used as positive control. DDW was used as negative control. The reaction was performed in duplicate, and both positives within 40 cycles were considered as positive. As the result, the average Cq value of specimen was 36.7, and that of positive control No. Name direction sequence (5' to 3') Expected size (bp) ORF1a set 1 Sense 413 Antisense WuhanCoV-spk2-r Antisense (500 copies) was 35.0. Negative controls showed no signals. Therefore, the specimen could be considered as positive. Table 2.

We acknowledge Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China for release of another sequence (MN908947). We use the term \"SARS-related Coronavirus\" to include the SARS virus as well as the clade of betacoronaviruses known to be associated with (mainly) rhinolophid bats across the Palearctic. The latest taxonomy classifies these viruses in a subgenus termed Sarbecovirus. Berlin, Jan 17th, 2020 Background We used known SARS- and SARS-related coronaviruses (bat viruses from our own studies as well as literature sources) to generate a non-redundant alignment (excerpts shown in Annex). We designed candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assays before release of the first sequence of 2019-nCoV. Upon sequence release, the following assays were selected based on their matching to 2019-nCoV as per inspection of the sequence alignment and initial evaluation (Figures 1 and 2). All assays can use SARS-CoV genomic RNA as positive control. Synthetic control RNA for 2019-nCoV E gene assay is available via EVAg. Synthetic control for 2019-nCoV RdRp is expected to be available via EVAg from Jan 21st onward. First line screening assay: E gene assay Confirmatory assay: RdRp gene assay Figure 2019-nCoV genome. ORF: amplicon are genome positions according to SARS-CoV, NC_004718. Materials and assay formulation Clinical samples and CoV cell culture supernatants Respiratory samples were obtained during 2019 from patients hospitalized at Charit\u00e9 medical center and tested by the NxTAG\u00ae Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex) or in cases of MERS-CoV by the MERS-CoV upE assay as published before (1). Cell culture supernatants from typed coronaviruses were available at our research and clinical laboratories. The typed avian influenza virus RNA (H5N1) was obtained from the German Society for Promotion of Quality Assurance in Medical Laboratories (INSTAND) proficiency testing panels. RNA was extracted from clinical samples by using the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche) and from cell culture supernatants by the viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Assay design For oligonucleotide design and in-silico evaluation we downloaded all complete and partial (if >400 nucleotides) SARS-related virus sequences available at GenBank by January 1st, 2020. The list (n=729 entries) was manually checked and artificial sequences (lab-derived, synthetic etc.), as well as sequence duplicates removed, resulting in a final list of 375 Berlin, Jan 17th, 2020 sequences. These sequences were aligned and the alignment used for assay design. The alignment was later complemented by sequences released from the Wuhan cluster. All presently release sequences match the amplicons (Figure 2). An overview of oligonucleotide binding sites in all unique sequences of bat-associated SARS-related viruses is shown in the appendix. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction All assays used the same conditions. Primer and probe sequences, as well as optimized concentrations are shown in Table 1. A 25-l reaction was set up containing 5 l of RNA, 12.5 l of 2 X reaction buffer provided with the Superscript III one step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen; containing 0.4 mM of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) and 3.2 mM magnesium sulfate), 1 l of reverse transcriptase/Taq mixture from the kit, 0.4 l of a 50 mM magnesium sulfate solution (Invitrogen - not provided with the kit), and 1 g of nonacetylated bovine serum albumin (Roche). All oligonucleotides were synthesised and provided by Tib-Molbiol, Berlin. Thermal cycling was performed at 55\u00b0C for 10 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95\u00b0C for 3 min and then 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s. Figure 2 Partial alignments of oligonucleotide binding regions. Panels show six available sequences of 2019-nCoV, aligned to the corresponding partial sequences of SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt 1, which can be used as a positive control for all three RT-PCR assays. The alignment also contains the most closely-related (Bat SARS-related CoV isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45, GenBank Acc.No. MG772933.1) as well as most distant member within the SARS-related bat CoV clade, detected in Bulgaria (GenBank Acc.

Primers and probes Optimized concentrations are mol per liter of final reaction mix. (e.g., 1.5 microliters of a 10 micromolar (uM) primer stock solution per 25 microliter (ul) total reaction volume yields a final concentration of 600 nanomol per liter (nM) as indicated in the table) -note that standard, non-optimized reaction conditions as indicated by suppliers of one-step RT-PCR kits will generally yield sufficient sensitivity- Assay/ ID Sequence (5'-3') Comment nM per reaction FAM-CAGGTGGAACCTCATCAGGAGATGC- BBQ for 2019-nCoV, will not detect SARS-CoV use 100 nM per reaction and mix with P1 RdRP_SARSr-P1 FAM-CCAGGTGGWACRTCATCMGGTGATGC- Sarbeco-Probe, use 100 nM per reaction and mix with P2 E gene E_Sarbeco_F1 ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT use 400 nM per per reaction E_Sarbeco_P1 FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG- BBQ use 200 nM per reaction W is A/C ; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; BBQ, blackberry quencher Technical sensitivity testing Preliminary assessment of analytical sensitivity for RdRp assay.

First line assay: E gene Technical limit of detection (LOD) = 5.2 RNA copies/reaction, at rate; 95% CI: 2.7-7.6 RNA copies/reaction. A B Berlin, Jan 17th, 2020 Breadth of detection To show that the assays will detect other bat-associated SARS-related viruses, we tested bat-derived fecal samples available from Drexler et al., (3) und Muth et al., (4) All samples were successfully tested positive by the E gene assay. Detection of these relatively distant members of the SARS-related CoV clade suggests that all Asian viruses are likely to be detected. Specificity testing 1. Chemical stability To exclude non-specific reactivity of oligonucleotides among each other, both assays were tested 40 times in parallel with water and no other nucleic acid except the provided oligonucleotides. In none of these reactions was any positive signal detected. 2. Cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses Cell culture supernatants containing human -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 as well as MERS-CoV were tested in all three assays (Table 2). For the non-cultivable HCoV-HKU1, supernatant from human airway culture was used. Virus RNA concentration in all samples was determined by specific real-time RT-PCRs and in-vitro transcribed RNA standards designed for absolute viral load quantification.

The two monoplex assays described here are reactive with coronaviruses under and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The rationales for using this detection approach are: 1) the genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in humans and animals is yet to be fully determined and 2) many laboratories lack positive controls for 2019-nCoV. Viral RNA extracted from SARS-CoV can be used a positive control in the assays below. As SARS was eliminated in humans, suspected cases that are positive in these RT-PCR assays should be considered to be infected by the 2019-nCoV. The N gene RT-PCR is recommended as a screening assay and the Orf1b assay as a confirmatory one. In the event of a positive PCR result, sequence analyses of the amplicons will further help to confirm the result and to distinguish between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. An N gene positive/Orf1b negative result should be regarded as indeterminate and the case is recommended to be referred to a WHO reference lab for further testing. These assays have been evaluated using a panel of controls and only the positive control (SARS- CoV RNA) is tested positive in these assays. NB. Synthetic oligonucleotide positive controls or equivalents for 2019-nCoV is not available at present but will be available shortly. Suitable biosafety precautions should be taken for handling human clinical specimens suspected to be 2019-nCoV infections ( https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/laboratory- diagnostics-for-novel-coronavirus ).

Evaluation: Positive controls : The tests were evaluated using serially diluted RNA samples extracted from SARS-CoV infected cells. These assays are confirmed to have a wide dynamic range (2-4-2000 TCID50/reaction, an amplification plot is shown an example). Upper respiratory and sputum samples spiked with SARS-CoV are shown to be positive in the test. Figure. Amplification plot of the RT-PCR assay specific for N gene. The viral titre (TCID50) used in each reaction is shown as indicated. Exclusivity: RNA extracted from respiratory cultured viruses and clinical samples (as described below) were included in the exclusivity panel. The assay yielded negative results against all of these preparations: RNA extracted from cultured viruses: human coronaviruses (229E, OC43 and MERS), H9 influenza B viruses (Yamagata and Victoria lineages), and adenovirus. RNA from retrospective human clinical specimens previously tested positive for other infections: coronavirus (229E, viruses (Yamagata and adenovirus, parainfluenza virus syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and human bocavirus. RNA from control human clinical specimens: Upper respiratory and sputum samples. Remarks : The protocol is prepared by School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong (Leo Poon, Daniel Chu and Malik Peiris). For enquiry, please contact Poon (llmpoon@hku.hk ) or Malik Peiris ( malik@hku.hk ). Positive controls for the above assays may be available upon request. The amplicon sizes of Assay 1 and Assay 2 are 132 bp and 110 bp, respectively. A manual pan-coronavirus nested RT-PCR can detect a wide range of coronaviruses (J Virol. 85:12815-20). The identity of amplified DNA product can be confirmed by DNA sequencing. Primer-probe sets that are specific for 2019-nCoV are currently under evaluation.
