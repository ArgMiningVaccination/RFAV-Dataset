E-mail: Moua.teng@mayo.edu ABSTRACT Hypersensitivity pneumonitis lung disease characterised by the inhalation of environmental antigens leading to acute and chronic lung injury. Alongwith suggestive clinical and radiological findings, history and timing of suspected antigen exposure areimportant elements for diagnostic confidence. Unfortunately, many diagnoses remain tentative and basedon vague and imprecise environmental or material exposure histories. To date, there has not been acomprehensive report highlighting the frequency and type of environmental exposure that might lead to orsupport a more systematic approach to antigen identification. We performed a comprehensive literaturereview to identify and classify causative antigens and their associated environmental contexts or sourcematerials, with emphasis on the extent of the supportive literature for each exposure type. Eligiblepublications were those that reported unique inciting antigens and their respective environments orcontexts. A clinical questionnaire was then proposed based on this review to better support diagnosis ofhypersensitivity pneumonitis when antigen testing or other clinical and radiological variables areinconclusive or incomplete. @ERSpublications Exposure history in hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be thought of in terms of an incitingantigen or its exposure setting or source. An approach reflecting a comprehensive assessment of the published literature may improve diagnosis and management. https://bit.ly/2AJp5vr Cite this article as: Petnak T, Moua T.

Multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) of relevant exposure history, suggestive radiological findingsand histopathology, when available, may be helpful in making a confident diagnosis, though there remains significant equipoise even among MDD-discussed cases [1, 2]. This may be due to overlapping findings as well as unclear and difficult to attain exposure history. For example, some occupational exposures that mayincrease risk of HP, including farming or hairdressing, have also been reported as epidemiologicallyassociated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [3]. Regarding radiological on computed tomography of IPF in theabsence of diagnosable secondary aetiologies, but a similar pattern may be found in approximately 10% ofpatients with biopsy-proven fibrotic HP [4]. Moreover, 40% of with IPF may have features of airtrapping or mosaicism on CT imaging, which may also overlap with HP [5]. Serum-precipitatingantibodies against specific antigens are often obtained and may suggest HP. However, sensitivity andspecificity vary widely among screening studies and have not been established in terms of clinical utility.Positive precipitating antibodies have ranged between 39 -78% of patients with interstitial findings [6 -10], but have also been found in those without clinical or radiological disease. Among sausage industryworkers for example, 37% may have positive precipitating antibodies, but no evidence of lung disease [11]. Given clinical overlap with other interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and nonspecific findings on presentation, exposure history remains an important element for supporting HP diagnosis. Unfortunately, inadequatereview of exposures or possible settings and materials may be a cause of frequent HP misdiagnosis [12].There are currently more than 200 antigens reported as possible causative exposures. To the best of ourknowledge, there have been few comprehensive assessments of the recent literature highlighting the specificarray or frequency of environmental or occupational exposures and their inciting antigens, with the intent ofgenerating a more concise or evidence-based review of systems or questionnaire for history-taking. Herein,we performed a literature review using Embase and Ovid/MEDLINE databases to identify and classifycausative antigens and highlight the frequency and extent of supporting evidence for each exposure type. Search strategy and literature review We searched for publications in Embase and Ovid/MEDLINE database from November 1, 1999 toOctober 31, 2019, using the search terms \"hypersensitivity pneumonitis \"and \"extrinsic allergic alveolitis \". Eligible articles included clinical studies or case reports that described specific causative organisms orantigens through species-specific precipitating antibodies, positive inhalation provocation testing orlymphocyte proliferation testing. These were then reviewed for a description of the relevant or suspectedenvironmental or occupational exposure history. Non-English-language articles, basic science orexperimental animal studies and paediatric articles (age <18 years old) were excluded. References ofincluded articles were also reviewed. The search terms \"extrinsic allergic alveolitis \"yielded 5084 and 2062 articles, respectively. After exclusion based on language, article type and removal of duplicates, 1574articles were screened. Of these, 1397 publications were excluded due to nonreporting or missingdescriptions of suspected species-specific causative organisms or antigens. Final publications included 57clinical studies and 120 case reports (figure 1). Type of exposure The included articles from this literature review identified 1596 cases with referenced antigen-positivetesting (some patients were positive for more than one antigen). Negative antibody testing was reported in427 patients but those with suspected exposures were still considered relevant HP diagnoses. Avian, fungal,bacterial, mycobacterial and other organic/inorganic exposures were identified, as described in tables 1 and 2. Animal protein exposure Bird or avian protein exposure was the most commonly reported form of HP, namely \"bird fancier 's\"or \"pigeon breeder 's\"disease. Repeated inhalation of avian proteins through bird droppings or feathers precipitated the majority of lung injury. We identified 31 publications providing specific antibody orprecipitation testing against avian antigens. Most reported cases were exposed through keeping birds aspets in the home or breeding them as hobbies or professions. Goose or duck feather and down-containingduvets, pillows, coats or jackets were also a significant source of environmental exposure when there wasno reported history of live bird exposure [13 -19]. Notably, suspected HP cases related directly to domestic chicken or turkey exposure have not been reported or published, despite their relative ubiquity. https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00230-2020 2HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS | T. PETNAK AND T. MOUAIndirect exposure to avian antigens has also been reported. Three patients developed lung disease despite never having had direct bird exposure as a result of existing antigens in their homes from previous birdowners [20 -22]. In another case, a mushroom worker developed suspected bird-related HP due to exposure to work-related poultry manure [23]. Given the high number of published HP cases and possibleexposure settings, enquiring about direct and indirect exposure to bird protein through bird ownership orbreeding, down or feather-containing items and droppings or faeces, is of high relevance and yield. HP has been reported with protein exposure to two other animal species, chinchillas and flour mites. Recurrent episodes of HP in a French farmer were confirmed by positive testing for precipitatingantibodies to chinchilla fur [24]. Removal of the chinchilla resulted in clinical improvement. Flour miteantigens were believed to have precipitated HP in a French baker [25]. Fungal exposure Fungi are found in nearly every environment and are a second leading reported cause of HP.Environments or materials with water damage or moisture often support increased fungal growth and TABLE 1 Specific antigens by type Type of antigens Specific antigens 1.

PETNAK AND T. MOUAtherefore increased risk of antigen exposure. We identified 82 publications with 568 antigen-positive tests. Approximately 30 species of fungi have been reported as causative agents, described in tables 1 and 2.Trichosporon asahii is the most common in terms of number of reported cases, presenting as summer-type HP in Japan, followed by cases involving Aspergillus ,Penicillium ,Wallemia sebi and Eurotium amstelodami , in descending order, respectively. T. asahii was found in the homes of affected patients with prior water damage and wood decay or in the trapped moisture of straw mats. T. asahii spores are often released more intensely in the summer months, causing seasonal outbreaks and the descriptive diagnosis of \"summer-type HP \". Outside of Japan, a variety of other fungal species have been reported in contaminated homes, including more commonly Aspergillus and Fusarium from Europe and North contamination may also occur through a variety of moisture containing or trapping domestic items,including humidifiers, air purifiers, heating units, air conditioners and ventilation ducts [33 -37]. The farm environment is a commonly reported setting for both fungal and bacterial antigen exposure, resulting in so-called \"farmer 's lung \". Both types of organism may be found in moist hay or straw, grain bins, animal feed, silage and manure, as well as on contaminated crops such as onion, potato and corn[38-41]. Reported causative fungal organisms 42 -48]. Sites of food production have also been reported as sources of fungal antigen exposure, particularly in Europe. Aspergillus andPenicillium were reported as fungal contaminants in salami and dry sausage dust, leading to HP. Additional reported species include Rhizopus, Mucor and Cladosporium from salami production [49, 50]. Other work environments that reported potential fungal contaminants include corkfactories, mushroom farms and sawmills. Cork material has been reported as contaminated withTABLE 2 Continued Specific antigens Number of patientsNumber of unique publicationsSetting Selected references 42.

Mushroom farms have also been the setting for HP, with reported precipitating antigens related toPenicillium ,Cladosporium, Scopulariopsis andA. alternata [46, 47, 53]. Wind and brass musical instruments have recently been reported as associated with inciting fungal antigens. Identified species, taken specifically from a bagpipe, bassoon, and tenor with clinical infection may also induce HP. Y OSHIMOTO et al. [58] reported a case of HP precipitated by Aspergillus from an infectious aspergilloma, while S CHREIBER et al. [59] described a case of HP caused by endogenous Candida albicans . nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) as inciting agents of HP have been reported lesscommonly compared to fungal antigens. We identified 46 publications reporting 353 antigen-positive tests.The most commonly reported environmental exposure was farm or grain dust, with two thermophilicfilamentous and spore-forming bacteria Thermoactinomyces vulgaris and Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula being the most common. Although both have been found in multiple locations on farms, they have alsobeen isolated from esparto grass or esparto fibre, a type of material used in the production of ropes andcanvas [60, 61]. Water reservoirs have been reported as contaminated with bacteria believed to be associated with HP. Bacillus ,Pseudomonas ,Stenotrophomonas and Sphingobacterium spiritivorum species have been isolated from mist fountains and steam irons as possible HP antigens [33, 62]. Moreover, bacterial endotoxin itself,as detected in high levels of used wastewater, has also been proposed as possibly leading tohypersensitivity lung injury [33]. NTM mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) have been reported as inciting antigens in a particular type of inflammatory lung disease known as \"hot-tub lung \", which some have proposed is a form of HP [63 -65]. MAC isolated from either sputum or the bronchoalveolar lavage of those affected were the same genotypic species isolated from culprit hot tubs or showers [63, 66, 67]. Other NTMspecies, including M. fortuitum and M. have reported in hot-tub lung [68, 69]. Mycobacterium in metalwork fluid, used in machine operation for automobile and aircraft manufacturing have been reported as culprit antigens for HP. M. immunogenum has been widely found and believed to cause a specific type of HP known as \"machine operator 'sl u n g \"[70, 71]. Organic and inorganic material exposure Organic and inorganic chemical compounds have been reported as causative antigens in HP, including isocyanates, acid anhydrides, chloroethylenes and acrylate compounds [72 -77]. We identified 39 reports with 123 antigen-positive tests. Again, reported methods used to identify specific antigens included directmeasurement of precipitating circulating antibodies, inhalational challenge and lymphocyte stimulation,using samples taken directly from suspected environmental sources (mushroom, hay, corn and metalworkfluid) [78 -80]. Other rare or uncommon sources of exposure leading to HP are further highlighted. Mushroom spores were the most commonly reported organic antigen causing HP outside of other fungal and bacterial species[47, 79, 80]. Precipitating antibodies against hay have also been reported [44]. Isocyanates are the only citedchemical compound with positive IgG testing supporting an HP-like response [75 -77, 81]. Diisocyanate, the most common form of isocyanate, is found in plastic or foam material often exposed toduring manufacturing. Commercial paint and varnishes, which often involve the use of sprayers foraerosolised exposure, also contain diisocyanates and are commonly found in manufacturing andrepair garages [82]. Intravesicular Bacilli Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy for bladder cancer was reported as precipitating HP in one case study, with specific IgG against BCG confirmed by precipitating antibodytesting [83]. Antibodies against extracted hay antigen, sausage dust and cork have also been reported inpatients with HP. However, for these specific antigens, it may be difficult to exclude other undetectedcontaminating organisms (mould or bacteria) as the more clinically relevant antigen [44, 50, 52]. Other rarebut reported organic and inorganic compounds include corn, oat, argan tree plant oil found in manycosmetic products, catechin phenol compounds found in green tea, pine sawdust and proteolytic enzymesused in the cleaning of surgical instruments. Tiger nut from horchata factories, Konjak flour from aKonnyaku factory, phytase used in cattle feed and shrimp shell powder found in seafood processing areadditional rare but reported inciting antigens (see table 2). https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00230-2020 7HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS | T. PETNAK AND T. MOUAHypersensitivity pneumonitis according to region Epidemiology of HP may vary depending on climate, geographic conditions, availability of culpritenvironments and occupational or industrial practices (see supplemental tables 1 -3). We classified reports into four main geographical groups according to the frequency of publication. These were Europe, EastAsia (dominated by Japan), North America and a conglomerate of \"others \". Sixty-eight publications represented European locations followed by 59 reports from Japan, North America (40 publications) andother combined regions (10 publications). Publications from those designated as combined or \"other \" regions included reports from India, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand. Highlighting specificexposures according to geography may be helpful in delineating patterns of presentation, thoughpublication bias is likely based on the availability of local academic or clinical institutions able to trackthem. In that regard, a lack of specific reports for a region does not necessarily reflect the absence of thattype of exposure or disease but perhaps more the absence of review and reporting. Bird-related HP was the most common type of published HP in Europe and North America. Although summer-type HP was the most common type in Japan, bird-related HP was also commonly reported.However, the type of exposure or setting appeared to differ according to the described region. Bird antigenexposure with the use of down or feather-containing products appeared to be less reported in Europecompared to Japan and North America, as described in supplemental tables 1 -3. In Europe, the farm environment, metalwork fluid exposure, cork manufacturing, salami and sausage production, esparto grass and musical instruments were frequently reported as occupation orhobby-related exposure types. Although home-related HP cases were noted, they were reported lessfrequently than occupation-related sources of exposure. In Japan, domestic antigen exposure was the most commonly published type of HP (summer-type HP), followed by bird-related and other occupational exposures. Japan also had the highest number ofpublications regarding mushroom worker 's lung disease, including several specific species bunashimeji, shimeji, shitake, enoki and eryngi [46, 53, 79, 80, 84]. Unique industries in Japan, such as green tea and Konnyaku manufacturing, might suggest geographically specific work exposures for HP [85, 86]. In North America, hot-tub lung diseases associated with NTM was the most commonly reported type of HP. HP related to metalwork fluid was also common. Home-related HP associated with water damage ormould-contaminated homes was the next most commonly reported subtype, followed by HP related to thefarm environment [87], with a lower number of identifiable causative antigens. A proposed screening questionnaire for HP exposure Previous reports suggest that HP may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to failure or inability toidentify causative exposures [1, 12, 29, 78]. A large report from the United States suggested that nearly40% of patients with suspected HP did not have an identifiable antigen or exposure setting [87]. Antigenidentification may also be associated with prognosis [88], where suspected exposure identification andremoval of the offending antigen may play a key role in management. Currently, there is no widelyaccepted review based on comprehensive or systemic reporting from the literature to guide screening forsuspected exposures in patients presenting with parenchymal lung disease. V ASAKOVA et al. [1] recently proposed a questionnaire to screen for all causes of ILD, which included common HP exposures, but wasnot specific to HP. For general use, we proposed a comprehensive screening questionnaire to cover themajority of specific antigens and their culprit exposures as reported in our literature review (table 3). Discussion Antigen exposure history is important in the diagnosis and management of HP, as presenting clinical andradiological findings may be fleeting or overlap with other ILD and be challenging to diagnose. In theabsence of widely accepted diagnostic criteria, particularly for fibrotic HP cases, a balance of contributingfactors appears to increase diagnostic confidence. Relevant exposure history for many clinicians is a leading factor in suspected diagnosis, though may prove difficult to accurately assess, exclude or confirm. When present it may support HP diagnosis even whenclinical, radiological or serological findings are equivocal, but be absent when the latter is stronglysuggestive and cast doubt on the suspected diagnosis. The degree to which exposure history is convincingone way or another may also be dependent on the presenting stage or subtype of HP. For example, insome cases of acute or subacute HP with typical or suggestive radiological findings, a relevant and timelyexposure history may be sufficient to make a diagnosis without additional serological or histopathologicaltesting. In contrast, patients presenting with UIP-like radiological features (traction bronchiectasis withhoneycombing) might strongly suggest IPF unless a particularly strong and solicited exposure history isnoted [89]. Solicited exposure history may also be considered inconclusive or incidental if the overriding https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00230-2020 8HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS | T. PETNAK AND T. MOUAclinical concern for IPF and its poorer prognosis is high, particularly in the absence of other supportive findings like histopathology. Clinical improvement or stability after antigen avoidance might support anHP diagnosis, though fibrotic HP cases may still progress despite suspected antigen avoidance. In practice, exposure history may be thought of as comprising two related elements: the suspected and relevant inciting antigen ( e.g.avian, mould, bacterial, mushroom spore) and its source or environmental context ( e.g.occupation, farm environment, water damage, feather duvets or blankets, showerheads). Clinicians may equate the two as part of a working diagnosis; however, it is not uncommon to suspect aculprit environment or occupation without a specific antigen or vice versa (positive antibody testing forone or more antigens on screening but no identifiable exposure or occupational history). When only oneor the other is present, diagnostic confidence may remain low without the support of other suggestiveradiological or histopathological findings. Additionally, environmental exposure history may be insufficient to conclude an inciting culprit antigen as multiple antigens may be involved in various settings in the same patient. A variety of methods areavailable as screening or directed testing to confirm specific antigen sensitivity, including the measurementof precipitating antibodies, inhalational challenge and lymphocyte proliferation [78, 90]. Confirmation ofprecipitating antigens using a panel of more commonly encountered mould or avian antigens may be usefulwhen there is no apparent history of suspected exposure or more than one potential precipitating antigenTABLE 3 Evidence-based exposure screening questionnaire Number of published casesNumber of publications 1.

PETNAK AND T. MOUAmay be involved. Identification of suspected antigens may also be critical to management as antigen avoidance can reduce further lung injury. Although unidentified antigens were reported as an independentrisk factor for poorer outcome [88], the exact prognostic role of antigen identification remains controversial,with other reports suggesting opposing results, particularly in those with fibrotic disease [91 -93]. Soliciting a possible environmental setting or source of known exposure may be the only available step in avoiding antigen exposure. While serologic testing might support a specific organism or antigen, suchtesting may not be readily available or be unable to test all possible culprit antigens. Instead, a useful reviewof exposures to relevant environments or materials may better assist clinicians in the efficient use of specificserological studies. For example, living on a farm is a commonly solicited but nonspecific setting that mayinvolve exposure to avian, fungal and bacterial antigens. Additional testing to confirm hypersensitivity antigens such as T.vulgaris ,S.rectivirgula ,W.sebi,Aspergillus andE. amstelodami may be helpful for potentially excluding more commonly inciting antigens if negative [42 -45, 94]. Otherwise, a history of farm exposure on its own may be insufficient to confirm HP diagnosis or assist in antigen avoidance. Thedomestic or residential environment is another example of multiple sources of possible contamination andantigen exposure in one environment. Fungal exposure may involve trapped moisture in water-damagedstructures, heaters or air conditioners, with contamination of both bacteria and fungi in the water reservoirsof humidifiers and steam irons. Colonisation of mycobacteria in showerheads or hot tubs is a commonlysolicited source of potential antigen exposure in the United States [33, 65]. Patients working in commercialgarages might be exposed to metalwork fluid used in machine operation as well as diisocyanates found insome commercial paints [70, 76, 95, 96]. Proving antigen hypersensitivity may be nearly impossible in thesesettings, other than to empirically avoid exposure, which for some may mean potential loss of livelihoods orproperty when exposure does not necessarily mean related disease. Despite the abundance of available literature, there has been little agreement on the merit or significance of which exposures should be more specifically sought out during history-taking and which may be of lessrelevance. B ARNES et al. [97] recently completed a Delphi assessment of 36 international experts and found agreement on 18 items for clinical review of exposures in fibrotic or chronic HP. The five withhighest agreement (97%, with inclusion cut-off of 80%) included exposure to mouldy hay or silage,standing water, water damage or flooding, visible mould or a mouldy smell and bird or avian proteinexposure. An in-depth literature review was pursued prior to the Delphi process to provide acomprehensive list of exposure items, with final suggested exposure items more or less reflectingagreement between the extent of reported cases and expert clinical experience. This is an important firststep in unifying a history-taking approach, particularly in fibrotic HP, though the authors note that futurestudies are needed to support prospective utility. In summary, our review suggests that bird protein exposure was the most frequently reported setting or exposure type, followed by specific exposures in the farm environment, home or domestic fungal orbacterial contamination, occupational metalwork fluid exposure and mushroom spores, respectively.However, we included a majority of studies reporting both a specific antigen and its suspectedenvironmental setting or source, which may not be reflective of how real-world HP diagnoses are made asoften one or both of these components may be missing in typically diagnosed cases. Sensitivity of serumIgG antibodies to suspected antigens in fibrotic HP has been reported as often absent or lower than innonfibrotic or more acute cases, which might also lead to the inclusion of less fibrotic HP studies in ourreview [7]. In contrast, we also reviewed and included less commonly solicited or reported antigens thatmay be regionally or geographically differentiated or prove more incidental to specific occupations orhobbies. Rare or novel precipitating exposures, which have yet to be confirmed or supported byantigen-detecting studies such as precipitating serum antibodies or inhalational challenge testing, were notincluded in our review. Indeed, the use of such confirmatory or supportive antigen studies varies amonginstitutions and is hindered by lack of standardisation. Finally, while we proposed a comprehensivescreening questionnaire covering the majority of causative antigens and their culprit environments basedon a systematic review of the published literature, the actual epidemiology of particular organisms andclinical validation of this or any other questionnaire requires further study and may lead to additionalcustomisation based on institutional need, geography and population demographics. Conclusion In summary, identification of specific antigens and their exposure source in patients with suspected HPremains challenging. Not only is the identification of suspected antigens and their sources helpful in HPdiagnosis but may also play a role in antigen avoidance, which may affect prognosis and outcome. Birdantigen exposure was the most frequently reported cause of HP from the literature, followed by fungal,bacterial and organic or inorganic antigens.
