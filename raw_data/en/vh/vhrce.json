Providers and care teams have little time to address whole person issues. Patient and staff experience suffers. Quality of care is decreased. All of this results in patients seeking care elsewhere and provider burn out. Future: Integrative medicine (IM) can transform safety net clinics to become healing oriented medical homes that appeal to patients and staff. IM strengthens the relationship between provider and patient by embracing the whole person - mind, body, spirit, and community. IM serves the patient by bringing together conventional , alternative, and complementary therapies - such as acupuncture, manual medicine, mind body approaches, group visits, nutritional medicine, and motivational interviewing. Finally, IM informs the clinic design to be green, sustainable, and non toxic. All of the above elements increasingly resonate with patient, provider, and staff choice . Goal : To become the provider of choice and improve patient experience by implementing an integrative medicine model of care at Hayward Wellness. Project Description Problem Statement and Underlying Causes For more information, contact me: Steven Chen, MD, Medical Director stevenchen@alamedahealthsystem.org About My Organization Mission: Caring, Healing, Teaching, Serving All Vision: Alameda Health System will be recognized as a world-class patient and family centered system of care that promotes wellness, eliminates disparities and optimizes the health of our diverse communities. Outcomes Achieved Clinic transformation efforts rely on strong clinic management, staffing, and infrastructure support. Without this, time and energy are devoted to putting out daily operational fires instead of change work. More attention is needed on culture change to form and norm the desired state (integrative medicine philosophy of care). Structural change (e.g. staffing, design of space) is necessary but not sufficient. A high degree of organizational turnover with senior management, makes steady progress at the local site level difficult. Lessons Learned To transform Hayward Wellness Center by implementing an integrative medicine approach to the design, build, and services, which will demonstrate a model of care that is scalable and reproducible.
