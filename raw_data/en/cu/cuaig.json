The fact is that natural immunity or protection from COVID-19 is not preferable to getting vaccinated. While it's true that having COVID-19 may create some protection, known as natural immunity, to COVID-19, at this point we aren't sure how long this immunity will last. It's also not clear who will and who won't create effective antibodies. Since this is a new virus, our immune systems are not adapted to create effective natural immune responses to this virus. The risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 outweighs the benefit of natural immunity. Given the variability in immune response, a lot of people who get infected naturally can get reinfected again, in sometimes as short as a few months. Even for those who don't have specific risk factors for COVID-19 such as chronic illness or older age, there's no way to predict that they will avoid serious illness. If an individual does develop a mild case of COVID-19, they can still spread the virus to others who may not be as fortunate. Also, scientists are still learning about the long-term effects of COVID-19, but some people continue to have some longer-term effects from their illness. Vaccines in use in Oregon have been tested in large clinical trials and the FDA has determined that they are [safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html) and [effective](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html). Millions of people in the U.S. have been vaccinated and even more worldwide. The vaccine is safe, effective and the best way to avoid severe illness from COVID-19.
