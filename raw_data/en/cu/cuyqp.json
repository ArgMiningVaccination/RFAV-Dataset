BW-1010 is a nanoemulsion adjuvanted recombinant protein (rPA) that would protect against fatal outcome resulting from exposure to anthrax. The vaccine will be administered intranasally (IN) to healthy adults, age 18 - 49. The study will be conducted in 84 volunteers in one center in the United States. The study will compare 2 different dose levels of rPA (50\u00b5g and 100\u00b5g rPA), and 2 different administration methods (a sprayer and dropper) with a negative control (saline) and a positive control (the injectable BioThrax licensed vaccine). The vaccines and negative controls will be administered in 2 IN doses (4 weeks apart). The positive control will be 3 subcutaneous doses, 2 weeks apart. All volunteers will be observed for 1 year after the last dose. Immunological outcome studied will be from the serum, blood cells and nasal washes. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| - pipette - IN - \u00b5g - pipette - IN Biological: Saline - sprayer - IN Biological: Saline (Placebo) - pipette - IN be randomized to receive BW-1010 in 2 different dose levels (50 \u00b5g or 100 \u00b5g rPA), using 2 different method of administration (Aptar sprayer or pipette dropper). Negative control participants (Placebo) will receive saline using the 2 different methods as well. The positive control participants will receive BioThrax subcutaneously. Since this is first in humans, a sentinel group, 4 participants with the smaller dose level (50 \u00b5g rPA) and 2 placebos, will be dosed first. The main group of the 50 \u00b5g rPA and the higher level rPA sentinels will dosed after day 8 safety clearance of the low dose rPA sentinel participants. |Masking:||Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)| |Masking Description:|| | The study participants and the study site personnel managing the participants will be blinded to the identity of the test article. The pharmacist and/or the pharmacy technician or non-study nurse at the study site will not be blinded and will be responsible for preparing, labeling, and administering the investigational product. During study drug administration, all the blinded personnel will be excluded from the vaccine administration site. In addition, participants will be asked to close their eyes or be offered the option of wearing a loose-fitting eye mask during the administration of the test article. Participants in the study arm that receive BioThrax SC and the clinical trial personnel that are managing them will not be blinded for this arm due to the different route of administration that makes blinding impossible. For laboratory and immunological testing, samples from participants receiving BioThrax will be of Intranasal Adjuvanted Anthrax Vaccine (BW-1010; rPA + 20%W805EC) in Healthy Adult Volunteers Administered by Nasal Sprayer and Pipette With an Additional Unblinded Positive Control Arm| |Actual Study Start Date :||January |Actual Primary Date :||September - IN | 20% Nanoemulsion and 50 \u00b5g recombinant protective antigen administered intranasally by Aptar Bidose Sprayer (400\u00b5L).

These are AEs beginning or worsening after the initiation of the first immunization. These including any clinical laboratory abnormalities. - Safety Objectives: Frequency of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) [ Time Frame: Up to Day 393 scheduled visit. ]An adverse event is considered \"serious\" if it results in death, or a life-threatening AE, or in hospitalization, or in a substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. - Primary Immunogenicity Objectives: Assess and compare the increase in rPA neutralizing antibodies following the different interventions in Cohort 2 subjects. [ Time Frame: Day 57 and Day 85 (co-primary end point). The two time points will be compared to identify the optimum timing of peak immuneresponse following nasal vaccination. ]Use serum Toxin Neutralizing Assay (TNA) to compare immune response in the rPA 100 \u00b5g dose between the two different methods of administration (Aptar Bidose sprayer and Eppendorf Electronic Repeater pipette) of BW-1010 and compare them with the positive control arm receiving BioThrax. - Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives: Assess and compare the increase in anti-rPA antibodies following the different interventions in Cohort 2 subjects. [ Time Frame: Day 57 and Day 85. ]Use serum anti-rPA (ELISA) to compare immune response in the rPA 100 \u00b5g dose between two different methods of administration (Aptar Bidose sprayer and Eppendorf Electronic Repeater pipette) of BW-1010 and compare them with the positive control arm receiving BioThrax. - Exploratory Immunogenicity Objectives: Assess and compare the increase in rPA neutralizing and anti-rPA antibodies following the different interventions in Cohort 2 subjects. [ Time Frame: Baseline, Days 39, 197 and 393. ]Use serum TNA and anti-rPA (ELISA) to compare immune response in the 100 \u00b5g dose between two different methods of administration (Aptar Bidose sprayer and Eppendorf Electronic Repeater pipette) of BW-1010 and compare them with the positive control arm receiving BioThrax. - Exploratory Immunogenicity Objectives: Assess and compare the increase in mucosal antibodies following different interventions in Cohort 2 subjects. [ Time Frame: Baseline and Day 39. ]Use nasal wash (NW) to assess mucosal antibody response (as measured by anti-rPA IgA, anti-rPA IgG and total mucosal IgA in NW) to compare mucosal immune response in the rPA 100 \u00b5g dose between the two different methods of administration (Aptar Bidose sprayer and Eppendorf Electronic Repeater pipette) of BW-1010 and compare them with the positive control arm receiving BioThrax. - Exploratory Immunogenicity Objectives: Assess and compare the increase in cell meditated immune responses in PBMCs following different interventions in Cohort 2 subjects.
