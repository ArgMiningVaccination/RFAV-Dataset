Our past year together has seen tremendous accomplishments that are due entirely to the love and passion of our wonderful faculty, staff, students and alumni. Among the highlights were record enrollments and the graduation of our inaugural class of naturopathic doctors in California. Bastyr University Research Institute continues to lead the world in natural medical research, having completed major clinical trials and publications on Parkinson's disease, and achieved primary authorship status in the distinguished Cochrane Review for the health topic of IBS. The University's teaching clinics remain significant community assets, achieving recognition from our patients and external measures of quality and patient satisfaction. We have also laid the foundation for the future with the development of Bastyr 2021, the strategic plan that will guide the University over the next five years. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of our community, the University's focus remains on the core mission and vision upon which we are built: world class faculty, students, research and patient-care. I look forward to continuing to work to transform the health and well-being of the human community. Yours in health, Charles, \"Mac\" Powell, PhD Bastyr University President A Look Forward FC FOUNDERS' CORNER FALL 2016 by Leah Mitchell, ND ('05) Dr. William Mitchell has often been called the \"heart of Bastyr University.\" Perhaps this is because of his tremendous gift to inspire people. As co-founder of Bastyr, he was the first dean of admissions. In a time when naturopathic medicine was still largely unknown, he was able to inspire 30 individuals to make a huge change in their life paths, and enroll in this fledgling school. Co-founder Sheila Quinn said the following when recalling the founding of the school: \"I think Bill brought a strong sense of spirit to the fledgling enterprise. More than the rest of us, he was concerned with the soul of the medicine and the souls of those who practice it. He found spirit in botanicals with healing properties, in the food we eat, in yoga and meditation (how we treat our minds and bodies), and in mountain climbing with Dr. Joe Boucher and Bastyr students. He made us laugh, he made us think, and he made us feel. His own inner struggles gave him great compassion for others; his ability to be present created a kind of healing energy. In an odd way, his connection to spirit kept the rest of us grounded in an awareness of what was most important. While we were building curriculums, hiring faculty and staff, raising and managing money, helping to build the profession, juggling politics, and creating a clinic, Bill was in touch with something profound that gave added meaning to everything we did. In his early work as Dean of Admissions, he drew to Bastyr amazing people whose knowledge, skills, and dedication have served the profession well across more than 30 years. We miss him still.\" His ability to inspire spanned decades. From students, to colleagues, to patients, he touched thousands of lives. Even today students who never met him in person speak about how they have been influenced by audio and video recordings of his teachings, which are still available in the Bastyr University library. Four of the buildings in the student village were named in honor of the founders. This past year, our family worked with staff and students to place a bench and plant a native garden next to the residence hall named for our Dad. I like to think that he would enjoy sitting there, looking out at the botanical garden and the school. He would be very proud.FOUNDERS' CORNERRemembering Co-Founder William A. Mitchell, Jr., ND Founders' Awards Dinner Saturday November 5, 2016 For further details, please see the back cover. HHEALTH FEA TURE FALL 2016 Seattle native Brenden Smith, ND ('09), saw firsthand the effects that diabetes and cardiovascular disease had on patients when he was an undergraduate working at Northwest Hospital as a physical therapy aide at Easy Street, a rehabilitation clinic. It was here that he observed the positive effects of integrating the mind, body and spirit into rehabilitation. Witnessing this inspired him to go on to become a naturopathic physician, the first chief resident of Naturopathic Medicine at Bastyr Center for Natural Health and ultimately to help open the Diabetes and Cardiovascular Wellness Clinic at Bastyr Center. The Diabetes and Cardiovascular Wellness Clinic at Bastyr Center for Natural Health offers patients a comprehensive and holistic approach to these conditions and holds patients and their wellness at the center of its care. Consistent with the mission of Bastyr Center, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Wellness concentrates on evidence-based medicine and shared decision-making with patients. This ensures that each patient can feel confident that their care evolves around their preferences and values, the best evidence available, and the clinical naturopathic expertise of our physicians and holistic team. Patients come to Diabetes and Cardiovascular Wellness at all stages of health, from those who have pre-diabetes and are seeking a holistic preventive approach, to those with heart failure who want to discuss \"health\" in the face of disease. Patients come for both primary management as well as adjunctive care, and providers work with each patient's greater health care team - from referrals to local cardiologists to massage therapy and acupuncture. Drawing on naturopathic principles of strengthening the foundations of health and doing the least harm, patients find themselves receiving intensive counseling on diet and exercise, prevention, discussion and prescription of natural products, prescription medications and management, and comprehensive team care with specialists. When more time is spent understanding our patients, answering their questions and walking them through decisions about their own health, patients feel more confident and in control of their diabetes or cardiovascular disease care. Diabetes and Cardiovascular Wellness is just one arm of the Center for Diabetes and Cardiovascular Wellness. The Center also provides continuing education events for physicians to improve the care outside of Bastyr's walls, engages with local and national organizations to improve the health of patients outside of office visits, and pushes research forward to identify the most effective care and management of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Diabetes and Cardiovascular Wellness is run by Brendan Smith, ND, and Marisa Pellegrini, ND, along with student clinicians training for expertise in these areas. The integrative team also includes collaboration with Kelly Morrow, MS, RDN, CD, aided by students in the and the Bastyr Nutrition program, as well as physical medicine and other services provided at Bastyr as may be needed by each individual patient.Expanded Services Support Diabetes and Cardiovascular W ellnessHEALTH FEATURE When more time is spent understanding our patients, answering their questions and walking them through decisions about their own health, patients feel more confident and in control of their diabetes or cardiovascular disease care.IMPACT Your donation empowers the University to transform the health of the human family.

With Bastyr working with Virginia Mason, I have an incredible medical team and my life has been changed. I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience at Bastyr University and have referred many friends and family members to the clinic. I believe you have to be a participant in your health care, no matter who you are. I wanted to have a multi-prong, integrated approach to my wellness, and I have found that at Bastyr.Surena Khatir Patient at Bastyr Center for Natural Health I first heard about Bastyr from my daughter who brought me to a free lecture on diabetes at Bastyr University with Brendan Smith, ND. During the lecture, Dr. Smith talked about how diabetes forms and the benefits that can come with diet and exercise. One thing he said that really resonated with me was that \"it's never too late to change, \" and advised going on a short 15-minute walk before each meal. That really stayed with me because other doctors in the past had told me that if I wanted to get off of my medication, I would have to exercise like the Seahawks and I knew there was no way I could do that! But 15 minutes a day made sense to me and I felt that amount was doable. Making a new habit is very hard and I wanted to set myself up for success, so my daughter and I modified things a little and started walking just five minutes a day in the morning for one week. Then we increased to 10 minutes, then 15 minutes each day for a week, and eventually moved to 25 minutes before every meal. Consequently, because of the way we did it, I have lost 30 pounds in the last 6-12 months. I have gotten off of my blood pressure medicine and cut my morning insulin in half. It was after this point that I made my first appointment with Dr. Smith and he was flabbergasted that I had made so much progress on my own. After meeting with Dr. Smith, I decided to keep him as one of my physicians and see him in addition to my primary diabetes care at Virginia Mason. I have a great medical team at Virginia Mason and through me, both my team there and Dr. Smith wanted to work together - both care teams provide techniques and care that, combined, have improved many aspects of my physical health. With Bastyr working with Virginia Mason, I have an incredible medical team and my life has been changed. GR ATEFUL PATIENTBBASTYR BUZZ FALL 2016 BASTYR BUZZ At the first-ever graduation ceremony for Bastyr University California on June 19, 2016, the University honored past President Daniel K. Church, PhD, for his loyalty, commitment and unwavering energy during his 10 years of service to Bastyr University, awarding him the title of President Emeritus. The University enjoyed many great successes during his presidency as well as saw the seeds sown for reaping in the future. In recognition of these contributions, the Board of Trustees and Officers of the University were proud to award Dr. Church this honor. At this graduation ceremony and the following one in Seattle on June 20, Bastyr University also acknowledged the manifold contributions of two distinguished individuals in the natural health arena - Tieraona Low Dog, MD and Tracy W. Gaudet, MD - by bestowing them each with an honorary Doctor of Natural Health Sciences. Dr. Low Dog was recognized for her tireless efforts in the exploration of natural medicine and advancing its role in modern health care. Through the breadth of her education and experience in medicine, herbal medicine, midwifery, and massage therapy; her service to the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine; and her appointment by former President Bill Clinton to the White House Commission President Emeritus Daniel Church with President Charles (Mac) Powell and Board Chair Sam Anderson. on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, her unflagging advocacy has lead to significant progress in protecting and engendering good health and collaborative practice. Dr. Gaudet was recognized for her leadership in the transformation of health care. Under her direction of the Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, Dr. Gaudet has made significant progress toward the creation of a new model of whole health care, one designed to help our nation's veterans achieve and maintain their best all-around health and well-being. www.Bastyr.edu Source: AANMC (http://aanmc.org/naturopathic/6principles/)TREAT THE WHOLE PERSON View the body as an integrated whole in all its physical and spiritual dimensions.IDENTIFY AND TREAT THE CAUSES Look beyond the symptoms to the underlying cause.

Both also suggest some great seasonal foods to help our bodies transition into fall as well as provide the body with the support and nutrients it needs for the rest of the year. Eastern Medicine Eastern medicine stems from an ancient medicine that teaches us to \"live along with nature, practice the nature, then live according to that nature, \" according to Bastyr University faculty member Benjamin Apichai, MD (China), MS, LAc. All of this is done to keep the yin and yang in our bodies in balance. Eating foods that are in season locally is a great way to find the freshest food, but it is also the best way to keep the body in balance. The fall season is one in which we are paying attention to our yin and are focused on supporting it. Throughout fall, we should eat to tonify yin, and the fruits and vegetables provided by Mother Nature will help us to create balance. Eastern medicine not only teaches us to eat for the current season, but teaches us to eat for future seasons as well. For example, in the fall Mother Nature provides us an abundance of pears, which are helpful in mitigating a cough by lubricating the throat, quenching thirst and dissolving mucus. Botanical Medicine Similar to Eastern medicine's philosophy of eating seasonally, botanical medicine teaches us to eat what nature provides when it provides it. Eating with the seasons from a botanical medicine viewpoint means eating what is available locally and when it is available fresh. If it's neither local nor fresh, it is likely that the produce is not in season. In the fall and winter, look for long-keeping foods like onions, squash, kale, leeks and parsnips, to name a few. According to faculty member Jenn Dazey, ND, plants have biologically active chemicals that help our bodies receive the food we eat and it is those natural chemicals that stimulate our immune function. These chemicals, known as polyphenols, impact our ability to adapt to the season depending on the type of foods we eat throughout the year. This process of adaptation, called xenohormesis, is the process by which the plants and foods we eat help our bodies adapt and anticipate the coming seasons. For example, flavonoid plants like nettles, which are in season in the spring, contain natural anti-histamine principals that prepare our bodies for spring allergies. Not sure what is in season? Visit your local farmers market to see what is in abundance. Some great fall foods to enjoy that will help your body adapt to seasonal changes? Mushrooms, various types of squashes, whole grains, root vegetables, cabbage, and fermented foods. Great way to get these foods? Check out the stew recipe! \u00bb NUTRITION FALL 2016 Yin-Yang Yin-Yang a Taoism philosophy describing two opposite energies, complementary interconnection, and interdependent in the natural world. For example, the nature provides brightness of daytime to work and darkness of nighttime to rest. Tonify (verb) Tonify comes from the noun, tonification, whichis a Chinese therapy that replenishes and nourishes the qi, blood, yin-yang and body fluid of the human body when the meridians or organs are deficient or weak. Looking for fall foods to tonify your yin? Eat plums, apples, pears, oysters and catfish. Try a clam chowder.

As a growing profession dedicated to mission-driven medicine, naturopathic doctors are uniquely qualified to provide continuous, comprehensive and patient-centered care as well as integrate with myriad other professions and modalities of care. Bastyr's Career and Alumni Services and the Center for Health Policy Leadership are working in collaboration with other regional academic institutions and professional associations toward increasing access to naturopathic care for underserved populations while also expanding workforce opportunities for ND graduates. Community health centers (CHCs) have been providing quality health care to those in need for over 50 years nationwide. At HealthPoint in Washington state, NDs have been successfully serving as PCP's for over 20 years. This success has currently crossed state lines as the Community Health Center in Lane County, Oregon, has hired the first ND, Dr. Bill Walter, who serves as a PCP for the Medicaid population. The ongoing integration will be highlighted in two upcoming events: As a historical first, the Fall Primary Care conference hosted by the regional CHC associations will include a strong naturopathic presence. The presentation led by Bill Make a gift in honor of a loved one who will be recognized on the Bastyr University Memorial Bench for a lasting tribute.

Cindy Breed, ND ('92), Wellness Programs Director at HealthPoint, and Gary Garcia, MD, Director of Graduate and Community Medicine at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, will co-present 21st Century Community Health Centers - The Role of Naturopathic Physicians in an Integrative and Collaborative Workforce at the CHAMPS/NWRPCA Fall Primary Care conference in Denver, CO. Walter, ND and Cindy Breed, ND will discuss the specific value of naturopathic physicians at CHCs to demonstrate the high quality of care, cost effectiveness, and capacity to meet patient demand and cultural preferences for integrative health and medicine services. To further support outreach and education about naturopathic medicine, the Institute for Natural Medicine will host an exhibitor's table with regional NDs in attendance to engage with CHC conference attendees. By bringing greater awareness of mutual benefits, possibilities for collaboration and partnerships can continue to develop for utilizing naturopathic physicians to address CHC workforce shortages.Dr. Bill Walter is the first naturopathic doctor (ND) to be hired by the Community Health Centers of Lane County in Oregon as a primary care provider (PCP). For the past three years, Dr. Walter has made huge strides helping patients in vulnerable populations and is dedicated to increasing the number of NDs as PCPs at other Federally-Qualified Health Centers. He believes very strongly that naturopathic physicians can be leaders in helping in the health care crisis at a national level. Dr. Walter's path to natural medicine and to his current position was forged by personal experiences that relied on his own self-discovery, advocacy and dedication to learning. After discovering natural medicine through his acupuncture mentor, Dr. Walter came to Bastyr to become a doctor with a mission to help people improve their health. At Bastyr, he joined an \"after-school club\" of sorts, created by previous Bastyr alumni who called themselves the \"Sombrero Club.\" The Sombrero Club's mission was to create a place where ND students who wanted to practice primary care could sharpen their skills, get connected to residencies, and have a space to continue learning. After graduation, Dr. Walter completed a residency at the Bastyr Center for Natural Health, where he focused on providing primary health care in addition to completing rotations at Bastyr's Immune Wellness Clinic serving patients with HIV/AIDS. After completion of his residency, Dr. Walter moved to Oregon and struggled to begin his own private practice. Wanting also to continue to serve HIV/AIDS patients, he reached out to the HIV Alliance in Oregon and began working with their mobile needle exchange as the doctor serving injection drug users. Through the relationships he built there, he was asked to chair a committee and create a comprehensive pain management protocol for the county that included acupuncture, chiropractic care, physical therapy and naturopathic medicine. It was through his work with this organization that started his path to his current position. Dr. Walter recalls his first year as a County Health Department employee as one of substantial professional growth and learning. His caseload of patients included many with complex medical histories and comorbidities such as severe mental illness, substance abuse, poverty and homelessness. He recalls a steep learning curve, often requiring regular case discussion with senior physicians and hitting the books every night to figure out ways to provide patients the health care they deserved. As he has settled into his role, he now feels confident in his process of helping patients though continues to appreciate what his patients teach him on a daily basis. Dr. Walter continues to be an advocate for increasing access to naturopathic health care services in communities of need, knowing that the benefits to the community and the rewards of service outweigh the frequent individual and systemic challenges that come with the work.CCONVERSA TION CORNER FALL 2016 Leading the Change in Oregon: Bill W alter, ND Dr. Walter's path to natural medicine and to his current position was forged by personal experiences that relied on his own self-discovery, advocacy, and dedication to learning. A Marie Barrera's personal journey to becoming a doctor is one that has, thus far, been greatly influenced by her experiences at Bastyr, traveling the globe and bringing naturopathic medicine to Nepal and Haiti. Marie is enrolled in Bastyr's Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program and hopes to one day own her own practice. On Marie's first trip abroad, she and eight colleagues arrived in Nepal shortly after the earthquake and in a country still in rubble, they found themselves amongst a culture full of heart, love, and perseverance. In a partnership with the University of Katmandu's Dhulikhel Hospital, she observed the allopathic doctors and shadowed many different shifts within the hospital, e.g., pediatrics, emergency and internal medicine. After their observational shifts, they had classes in the evenings and continued learning first-hand about medical care in a developing country. She and her colleagues also traveled to remote villages bringing naturopathic medicine to parts of the country not able to access traditional medicine. The next year, Marie traveled to Haiti with Naturopaths without Borders on a preceptorship. There, she and her colleagues practiced similarly to the model at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, holding mobile clinics throughout the country with first-year through fourth/fifth-year students being supervised by a licensed ND. With their moveable clinic, they traveled around the country to remote villages bringing naturopathic medicine and educating the local people about the medicine and ways to help each other. Watching the resident ND use acupuncture to lower a village woman's acute hypertension so that the team could get a better handle on the best naturopathic approach led Marie to apply for the dual-track Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine this fall at Bastyr. It was the relationships she developed with the patients and their communities that ignited her passion for global health. These experiences have inspired Marie to continue making global health part of her practice. She plans to carry on with this work and to travel abroad, sharing naturopathic medicine with the world.
