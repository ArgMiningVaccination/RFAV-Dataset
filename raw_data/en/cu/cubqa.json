Living a Medical Medium\u00ae lifestyle is not \"hard\" it's just different. With any type of change you make, if you want it to become a lifestyle, you need to make adjustments that help simplify your life. Diets can be so complicated, with so many rules to follow. Medical Medium does not talk rules, instead he gives you strategies to heal using food and supplements. It is not about deprivation ever!...this lifestyle is all about abundance, simplicity, and creating your own journey. As I reflect on my own journey, I want to share with you what I wish I had known when starting: - Baby steps In order to make lasting lifestyle changes, do not dive in head first. Try removing a few no foods at a time...I would start with eggs, dairy, and gluten. Find substitutions to some of your favorite foods so that when you have a craving you can satisfy it with a more healthy substitution. For example, instead of reaching for the bag of goldfish when you have a craving for something salty to snack on, grab a handful of Simple Mills sea salt crackers instead. - Educate yourself on reading labels and GMO's It is critical to understand how to read ingredient labels and know what some of those impossible to pronounce ingredients really are...what are companies trying to hide? A great place to start with this is my [GMO's and Chemtrails Masterclass](https://muneezaahmed.com/gmo-and-chemtrails-masterclass/). Understand all of the junk that is actually allowed in vegan and gluten-free items. When I first started, I had no idea how much I was being held back by things like: coffee, nutritional yeast, vinegars, citric acid, natural flavors, and fermented foods. - Increase your intake of leafy greens If I had known how critical minerals were to the adrenals when I first started, I would not have struggled so much with fatigue. While minerals are a critical component, it can be very difficult and overwhelming to get in the amount that we need. My strategy for leafy green intake became juicing and smoothies, as that was a quick and easy way to get more greens in my daily routine. - Eating every two hours is a MUST To keep your adrenals from crashing, it is imperative that you eat something every two hours. I am a bit of a work-aholic and I could go many hours without eating anything when I get into work mode. When I first started MM I thought eating every two hours was somewhat useless. Consequently, I struggled with immense adrenal fatigue after the birth of my first daughter. This was the wake up call I needed to put a laser focus on my adrenals. By the time I had my third daughter I didn't skip a beat - it was amazing! Because I realized the importance of keeping up adrenal snacks (glucose + mineral salts), I never suffered from post-delivery adrenal fatigue. Check out the Medical Medium\u00ae [10 Snacks for Adrenal Health](https://www.medicalmedium.com/blog/10-snacks-for-adrenal-health) to get some simple ideas. - Understanding how to work with supplements When starting a supplement routine it is always best to start small! I wanted to dive in head first with this. I knew my body was able to handle a decent amount of supplementation and once I learned what a key role supplements can play in speeding up the healing process, I wanted to take them all and at high quantities. However, I learned that was not the way to go. You will want to see how each supplement reacts in your body and gradually raise the dosage. - The same information that can heal me physically, can heal me emotionally and spiritually as well. This was an incredible revelation to me. I learned from MM that continuing to reflect on the past will only exacerbate it. In order to heal emotionally, the past needs to be left behind - stay present and focus on making your future what you want it to be. Along with my physical healing came such deep and intense emotional healing as well as heightened spiritual clarity and healing. One reason I am so passionate about the healing journey is so that others can experience this level of healing and clarity, which continues to grow deeper every day. Cleaning our vessels is profound on so many levels and I hope everybody has an opportunity to experience this...truly the gift that keeps on giving. - Sign up for my [FREE Starter Course](https://muneezaahmed.com/healing-chronic-mystery-and-autoimmune-illness/)and learn so many more tips about beginning your MM journey.

It is my greatest joy to help others who are suffering find the keys to true healing. I want you to learn from the mistakes I made in the beginning.
