There are many physical and emotional benefits of massage which can be further enhanced via your choice of oils. It can help to relieve fatigue, pain, tension, stress and anxiety, increase circulation, eliminate toxins, aid sleep, strengthen the immune system, encourage feelings of calm and relaxation and engender a general sense of wellbeing. Basic Massage Techniques - Effleurage is the move that should be used on the body first, and then repeated throughout the massage. It involves long, slow, stroking movements which progress from light to firm. These moves will help cover the body in oil, warm the muscles and encourage relaxation. Use both hands alongside each other keeping them flat with the fingers loosely together. - Petrissage is a kneading movement that is used to work the muscles. It should only be done on fleshy, muscular areas of the body - never over bone. It involves gentle, rhythmic lifting, stretching or squeezing of the muscles with the hands or fingertips - a bit like kneading dough! This is a deeper move that eases muscle tension and boosts circulation. - Friction is a firm, rubbing move that works deeper into tight, tense, knotted muscles. It should only ever be used after effleurage (and perhaps some petrissage) has warmed the area. The fingers and thumbs are used in either a circular or backwards and forwards direction. The move should start gently with pressure being gradually increased to avoid any pain or resistance. Friction should not be performed for too long, or on recently injured muscles, areas of inflammation or scar tissue. - Feathering is a lovely, calming way to finish the massage. The fingertips are used to very gently stroke in a slow rhythmic style (using only the lightest pressure) e.g. down the sides of the spine. Now we've covered the basic techniques it's time to get started. Follow our top 10 tips below to help you get the most from your aromatherapy massage. Top 10 Massage Tips - Safety first. Massage is generally considered a safe, non-invasive treatment for most people however there are a long list of contraindications which may mean you should not perform a massage at all or that is should be modified or avoided on certain areas of the body. You should make sure that you are familiar with all forms of contraindication and that appropriate medical consent has been given where applicable. - Create the right environment. The room should ideally be a few degrees warmer than usual as oiled skin can chill more quickly. You could even pop an electric blanket onto the massage couch underneath a clean towel for real warm and cosy feel. Ensure you have some spare towels (warmed ones are lovely) to cover parts of the body that are not being massaged. Have dimmed lighting and maybe light some candles to create a relaxed ambiance. You might also like to play some soft music and diffuse some essential oils to complement the treatment. - Good practice. Check your finger nails are cut short, rings and other jewellery are removed and long hair tied-back. - Prepare your massage oil. For body massage we generally use between 1.5% and 3% dilution. This means using 6-13 drops of essential oil per 15ml of carrier oil. Alternatively, you might like to use one of our [pre-blended aromatherapy massage oils](https://www.baseformula.com/aromatherapy/aromatherapy-blends/aromatherapy-massage-oils)or [waxes](https://www.baseformula.com/aromatherapy/aromatherapy-blends/aromatherapy-massage-waxes)that are expertly blended and ready to use. Skin hydration levels and the size of the person makes a difference as to how much oil you will need to mix but as a general rule you'll need 15-30ml for a full body massage. The quantities mentioned are guidelines only - you may wish to adjust the amounts up or down to a limited degree. As long as you spot test first and avoid oils that are contraindicated or known to be over stimulating for sensitive skins (i.e. citrus oils) you will be able to give an effective aromatherapy massage. If you like experimenting, always keep a note of what essential oils you have used and in what quantities. This way you will be able to identify the most effective essential oils for your future treatments. - Warm your hands. Being touched by cold hands causes muscles to contract and increases pain. Warm hands help to relax and soothe. - Keep your hands relaxed and flat. With wrists loose bring the thumbs up into line with the rest of the hand, which should be flat but relaxed. Skin contact should be maintained throughout the whole of the hands and fingers however the most important areas are the finger tips, the fleshy pad of the hands and the heels of the hands. Loosen up the hands before starting by conducting an imaginary orchestra or making waves with your hands. - Keep it slow. If the massage strokes resemble car-cleaning strokes then far from promoting relaxation the recipient will feel skin irritation and heightened awareness of pain. To help you slow down put on some slow music and encourage feedback or ask the recipient to take long deep breaths in and out and then match the speed of the massage to the speed of the breaths. - Always maintain contact with the skin. Hands that are taken off the skin in between strokes again heighten the senses and awareness of pain. There is always an element of surprise as the hands once again make contact with the skin. It is commonly described as \"setting nerves on edge\". Contact should always be maintained - just slide the hands gently into position without ever losing contact - even if it means stroking across clothes or hair. - Maintain good pressure. Stroking or tickling instead of massaging can have a hugely irritating effect. Encourage feedback so that you exert the correct degree of pressure for the recipient. Most masseurs are surprised to find that the pressure needed is considerably more than one would expect. To help prevent fatigue use your body weight where appropriate i.e. lean into the massage with a straight back. Standing to do a massage is often a lot easier because the body weight can be more easily controlled and used. - Do not apply too much oil. Too much oil or synthetic oils such as baby oil allow too much slippage i.e. the hands slip over the skin, which is irritating. Our advice is to use a good quality 100% natural carrier oil such as Sweet Almond or Grapeseed Oil. This absorbs easily into the skin \"carrying\" the therapeutic essential oils into the body. At the same time it still leaves a thin coat on the surface which prevents the hairs and skin being \"dragged\". For instance as you massage upwards in long strokes over the muscles you should be able to see the muscle rolling ahead of you like a small wave which shows that your pressure is such that you are helping the muscles relax. If there is too much slippage or not enough pressure then this will not occur and you will probably find that your subject is tense and uncomfortable. If after ten minutes they are very still, lost in a trance like daze and breathing slowly and deeply then don't say a word - just carry on confident in the knowledge that you have \"got the hands\" as we therapists say!
