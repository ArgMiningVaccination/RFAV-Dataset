The human rights of all persons are universal and indivisible. Everyone should enjoy the same fundamental human rights, regardless of their sexual orientation and their gender identity and expression. Article 1 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) declares that \"all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\" Article 2 declares, \"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration.\" All people, including LGBTQ2I individuals, are entitled to enjoy the protection provided by international human rights law, which is based on equality and non-discrimination. Nearly 30 countries, including Canada, recognize same-sex marriage. By contrast, more than [70 countries still criminalize consensual same-sex conduct](https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA_Sexual_Orientation_Laws_Map_2019.pdf). This includes 6 countries that effectively impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts. In 6 other countries, the death penalty is a possible punishment. Around the globe, people experience violence and discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. LGBTQ2I people experience discrimination and harassment in housing, the workplace and the classroom. LGBTQ2I people are also often victims of hate-motivated violence, including: - physical attacks - arbitrary arrest - torture - sexual assault - murder The \"2\" in \"LGBTQ2I' stands for \"2-spirit\" and refers to conceptions of sexual and gender identity in some Indigenous communities in Canada. Internationally, \"LGBTI\" is often used.

The program consists of $30 million in dedicated funding over 5 years and $10 million every year after. These funds promote human rights and improve socio-economic outcomes for LGBTQ2I people in developing countries. This funding complements and supports the efforts of partners and movements working with LGBTQ2I communities in developing countries. These new initiatives rely on consulting our partners and on their participation. This program responds to the needs, realities and priorities of LGBTQ2I persons and their representative organizations. The [human rights-based approach](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/priorities-priorites/human_rights-droits_personne.aspx?lang=eng) and recommendations of experts, partners and stakeholders provide direction to our delivery of LGBTQ2I-inclusive international assistance.
