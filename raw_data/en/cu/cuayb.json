As we grow older, we shouldn't expect our health to regress. Normal aging occurs when our older cells start to die faster than the new ones develop. This process should not impact our quality of life. Most age-related diseases and disabilities could be improved or prevented by modifying lifestyle factors. Adopting healthy habits will keep us feeling healthy and youthful at any age! How we treat our bodies when we are younger impacts the way we age. Developing harmful habits that weaken our cells at a younger age will accelerate the normal aging process. In our own environment, we are exposed to thousands of chemicals and toxicants that contribute to disease and cell damage. Many of these toxicants go unnoticed in our air, food, homes, and even drinking water. The build-up of cell-damaging substances also increases the number of free radicals in the body. A diet that lacks variety, nutrients, and fiber can lead to various deficiencies. When our body does not receive an adequate amount of nutrients, it will not function properly. A proper diet enhances our immune system and strengthens our body's natural processes. As we age, even if we are maintaining a \"perfect\" diet, we are still at an increased risk of developing deficiencies. With time, our body becomes less efficient at absorbing nutrients. It is imperative that we constantly supplement certain vitamins and minerals to ensure we are getting sufficient nutrients daily. Use it or lose it! Living a sedentary lifestyle increases our risk of almost every disease. Hormone balance is a major factor in healthy aging. A deficiency or elevation of certain hormones accelerates aging and causes the immune system to weaken. People who experience prolonged periods of intense stress are more likely to develop chronic disease. Stress (sympathetic state) weakens the body from all aspects. Lack of companionship can be a major source of stress for older people. Loneliness or loss of loved ones commonly leads to depression. Dr. Cutler's exclusive individualized wellness program is designed to analyze your exact body chemistry needs. The doctor will perform labs to find out what types of foods/herbs/spices work for you and what should be avoided. He'll also test vitamin/mineral levels, basic blood work, environmental toxicant exposures, neurotransmitters for emotional health, hormonal imbalances, genetic polymorphisms, gastrointestinal analysis, parasites, and yeast overgrowth. The Integrative Me \u2014 Body Coding system is a treatment plan that can transform into a lifelong commitment. Patients who work with Dr. Cutler on anti-aging concerns can expect to see a new fullness of life. By changing their overall lifestyle, patients can expect to feel younger and slow down the aging process. "}
