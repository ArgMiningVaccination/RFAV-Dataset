As required by the Food and Drug Admin - istration, vaccines are tested for safety before they enter the market, and their performance is continually evaluated to identify any risks that might appear over time. Vaccines are not free from side effects, or \"adverse effects,\" but most are very rare or very mild. Importantly, some adverse health problems following a vaccine may be due to coincidence and are not caused by the vaccine. As part of the evaluation of vaccines over time, researchers assess evidence to deter - mine if adverse events following vaccination are causally linked to a specific vaccine, and if so, they are referred to as adverse effects. Under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 , Congress established the National Vac - cine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to provide compensation to peo - ple injured by vaccines. Anyone who thinks they or a family member\u2014often a child\u2014has been injured can file a claim. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers VICP , can use evidence that demonstrates a causal link between an adverse event and a vaccine to streamline the claim process. As such, HRSA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to review a list of adverse events associated with vaccines covered by VICP and to evaluate the scientific evidence about the event\u2014vac - cine relationship. The vaccines covered by VICP include all vaccines recom - mended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine administration in children. Adults who experience an adverse event follow - ing one of these childhood vaccines also are covered by the program. HRSA As part of the evaluation of vaccines over time, researchers assess evidence to determine if adverse events following vaccination are causally linked to a specific vaccine, and if so, they are referred to as adverse effects. 2 vides an explanation of how the evidence influ - enced the causality conclusions. Based on the totality of the evidence, the com - mittee assigned each relationship to one of four categories of causation in which the evidence: convincingly supports a causal relationship; favors acceptance of a causal relationship; favors rejection of a causal relationship; or is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. The committee did not use a category to des - ignate evidence that convincingly supports no causal relationship, because it is virtually impos - sible to prove the absence of a very rare relation - ship with the same certainty that is possible to establish the presence of one. Evidence Convincingly Supports a Causal Relationship The committee concludes that the evidence con - vincingly supports a causal relationship between some vaccines and some adverse events. As a live vaccine, the varicella zoster vaccine is linked to four specific adverse events, all due to infection from the vaccine virus strain: Disseminated varicella infection (widespread chickenpox rash shortly after vaccination) Disseminated varicella infection with sub- sequent infection resulting in pneumonia, meningitis, or hepatitis in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies Vaccine strain viral reactivation (appear - ance of chickenpox rash months to years after vaccination) Vaccine strain viral reactivation with sub- sequent infection resulting in meningitis or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) The MMR vaccine is linked to a disease called measles inclusion body encephalitis, which in very rare cases can affect people whose immune asked the IOM to review 8 of the 12 covered vac - cines. These eight are the varicella zoster vaccine (used against chickenpox); the influenza vaccines (except for the H1N1 influenza vaccine distributed in 2009); the hepatitis B the meningococcal vaccines, and tetanus- containing vaccines that do not carry the whole- cell pertussis component. Examining the Evidence The adverse events selected by HRSA for IOM review are ones for which people have submitted claims\u2014successful or not\u2014to VICP . The commit - tee appointed to this study was not asked to assess the benefits or effectiveness of vaccines but only the risk of specific adverse events. Its conclusions reflect the best evidence available at the time. Some of the adverse events the committee examined already are accepted in the medical community, but they are minor or manageable\u2014for example, a sudden allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that can follow the administration of some vaccines. In its report, the committee explains its pro - cess for evaluating the list of adverse events and provides a set of 158 causality conclusions. The committee examined two types of evidence: epi - demiologic evidence, which derives from studies of populations, and mechanistic evidence, which draws from biological and clinical studies. The committee evaluated each scientific article for its strengths and weaknesses and then assigned a \"weight of evidence\" ranking to both the epide - miologic and mechanistic bodies of studies. The committee considered the weights of evidence and then reached a conclusion about the causal relationship between each vaccine and adverse health problem pairing. The commit - tee began from a position of neutrality, presum - ing neither causation nor lack of causation, and moved from that position only when the combi - nation of evidence suggested a more definitive assessment regarding causation. The figure pro -Examining the evidence3 systems are compromised and usually occurs within a year of acute measles infection or vacci - nation. The MMR vaccine also is linked to febrile seizures, which are a type of seizure that occurs in infants and young children in association with fever. Febrile seizures are generally benign and hold no long-term consequences. Six types of vaccines\u2014MMR, varicella zoster, influenza, hepatitis B, meningococcal, and tetanus- containing vaccines\u2014are linked to anaphylaxis. The committee also found convincing evi - dence of a causal relationship between injection of vaccine, independent of the antigen involved, and two types of adverse events, including syncope, or fainting, and deltoid bursitis, or frozen shoulder, characterized by shoulder pain and loss of motion. Evidence Favors Acceptance of a Causal Relationship The evidence favors acceptance of four vaccine- adverse event relationships. In these cases, the evidence is strong and generally suggestive, but not firm enough to be described as convincing. These relationships include: HPV vaccine and anaphylaxis; MMR vaccine and transient arthralgia (tem - porary joint pain) in female adults; MMR vaccine and transient in children; and certain trivalent inactivated influenza vac- cines used in Canada in some recent years and a mild and temporary oculorespiratory syndrome, which is characterized by con - junctivitis, facial swelling, and upper respi - ratory symptoms, including coughing and wheezing. Evidence Favors Rejection of a Causal Relationship The evidence favors rejection of five vaccine- adverse event relationships: MMR vaccine and autism MMR vaccine and type 1 diabetes DTaP (tetanus) vaccine and type 1 diabetes Inactivated influenza vaccine and Bell's palsy (weakness of the facial nerve) Inactivated influenza vaccine and exacer - bation of asthma or reactive airway disease episodes in children and adults Evidence Inadequate to Accept or Reject a Causal Relationship For the vast majority, (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. In many cases, the adverse event being examined is an extremely rare condi - tion, making it hard to study. In these cases, there was not adequate evidence to determine if the vac - cine was or was not causally associated. The committee began from a position of neutrality, presum - ing neither causation nor lack of causation, and moved from that position only when the combina - tion of evidence suggested a more definitive assessment regarding causation.The Institute of Medicine serves as adviser to the nation to improve health.

Individuals who have serious immunodeficiencies are clearly at increased risk for specific adverse reactions to live viral vaccines, such as MMR and varicella vaccines. Thus, the committee was able at times to reach more limited conclusions for sub - groups of the population. Conclusion In applying consistent standards across all the evi - dence, the committee found that some conclusions were easy to reach: the evidence was clear and con - sistent or, in the extreme, completely absent. Others required substantial discussion and debate. The committee was not charged with making recommendations, and it did not pinpoint any par - ticular areas for continued research. Much research already occurs to determine the safety of vaccines for the populations for whom they are recommended. However, there is much to learn about the human immune system, autoimmunity, and the effects of genetic variation, all of which may influence how people respond to vaccines. Vaccines offer the promise of protection against a variety of infectious diseases. Despite much media attention and strong opinions from many quarters, vaccines remain one of the greatest tools in the pub - lic health arsenal. Certainly, some vaccines result in adverse effects that must be acknowledged. But the latest evidence shows that few adverse effects are caused by the vaccines reviewed in this report.
