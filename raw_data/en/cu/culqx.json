On a metaphysical level, each of the seven chakras, or energy centers, is powerfully energized and activated by a specific color and energy focus. These seven chakras run vertically from the spine's base to the head's crown. We can start powerful healing and recharging of each chakra by placing crystals directly on these specific body points. When choosing a crystal, consider the color, as it is one of the most potent aspects of its healing power. Here we will explore the energy and meanings of crystal colors and their corresponding chakra. RED CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: COURAGE, DETERMINATION, ENERGY, MOTIVATION, PASSION The color of fire and blood, red crystals manifest strong and powerful masculine energy. They energize us, excite our emotions, and motivate us to take action. Red crystals are all about generating passion: passionate creativity, passionate sensuality, and passionate living. Red crystals activate our first energy center, the root chakra. Balancing the root chakra creates a solid foundation for opening the chakras above. The root chakra helps us remain securely grounded; therefore, red crystals foster stability, self-control, and self-confidence built on fearlessness. Red Jasper is an extremely stable stone that stabilizes and grounds one's own energies. Another grounding red crystal is Vanadinite. When in need of a boost of energy, motivation, and dedication, Vanadinite is the crystal to turn to. Some other popular red crystals include Carnelian, Ruby, and Garnet. ORANGE CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: COMMUNITY, JOY, LOYALTY, PLEASURE, SUPPORT Combining the physical energy and stimulation of red with the cheerfulness of yellow, the color orange brings us warmth, joy, and pleasure. Known as the \"community stones,\" orange crystals integrate the parts of our communal lives, bringing things and people together. Orange crystals are warm and inviting and are excellent for socializing and encouraging conversation. They encourage celebration, enjoyment, fulfillment, and merriment. Orange crystals activate our sacral chakra, improving sexual intimacy, increasing intuition, and enhancing creative expression. The primary function of our sacral chakra is pleasure and overall enjoyment of life. When this energy center is in balance, we can expect our relationship with ourselves and others to feel harmonious, pleasureful, and filled with joy. Some popular orange crystals include Sunstone, Orange Calcite, and Tiger's Eye. YELLOW CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: CREATIVITY, ENLIGHTENMENT, HAPPINESS, OPTIMISM, WARMTH Like a bright, beautiful ray of sunshine, yellow crystals bring you happiness, optimism, and warmth. Yellow crystals relate to the solar plexus chakra, as this chakra holds an immense tie to the power of the sun. Being the lightest hue of the color spectrum, the presence of yellow is highly uplifting, illuminating, cheerful, and enlightening. Yellow crystals encourage creativity and new ideas and inspire original thought and inquisitiveness. One of our favorite yellow stones is Bumblebee Jasper, also known as the manifesting stone, it awakens our willpower and our drive to create. It brings curiosity, creativity, and manifestation into your aura. In addition to their creative, warm, and optimistic energy, yellow crystals are wonderful for improving the organization of both your thoughts and surroundings. They foster the power of heightened awareness, improving our focus and allowing us to achieve higher consciousness. Add Citrine to your office or workspace to keep your ideas flowing brightly and abundantly with focus and clarity. Other popular yellow crystals include Yellow Fluorite, Pyrite, and Yellow Jasper. GREEN CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: ABUNDANCE, GROWTH, NEW BEGINNINGS, PROSPERITY, RENEWAL Green is the color of spring, symbolizing growth, renewal, and rebirth. It renews and restores depleted energy. A combination of yellow and blue, green encompasses the optimism of yellow with the peace and serenity of blue. Green represents the heart chakra and is connected with balance, harmony, and abundance. Green crystals activate the heart chakra, balancing the heart and emotions and creating equilibrium between the head and the heart. They are natural peacemakers, allowing us to restore our love and nurture ourselves and others unconditionally. For example, Emerald encourages one to live and act from the heart offering unconditional love and compassion in one's daily life and relationships. Green crystals can also manifest gifts of magnetic good fortune, abundance, and prosperity. Jade is a classic stone of abundance, wealth, luck, and success. Other popular green crystals include Malachite, Green Aventurine, and Moss Agate. We recommend adding green crystals to your collection if you are seeking personal growth, good health, and fortune in the new year. BLUE CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: CALMNESS, COMMUNICATION, FORGIVENESS, PEACE, TRUST Much like the ocean and the sky, blue crystals induce calmness, peace, and tranquility within us. They symbolize trust, honesty, and loyalty. In relationships, blue crystals give us strength and comfort when challenges arise and help us offer grace and forgiveness during difficult times. Blue crystals activate our throat chakra, enhancing our quality of communication with the people we love. They foster openness and honesty in conversation and help us develop patience, understanding, and empathy. Use blue crystals when you need help expressing your thoughts and feelings freely, confidently, and clearly. In addition to our throat chakra, blue crystals activate our third eye chakra, our center of perception and command. Our third eye chakra evokes intuition, perception, and inner wisdom when in balance. Some popular blue crystals include Angelite, Blue Calcite, Celestite, and Sodalite. Shop our Blue Crystal Color Collection PURPLE CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: DREAMS, IMAGINATION, INTUITION, SPIRITUALITY, WISDOM Purple crystals hold the energy and strength associated with red crystal energy and the spirituality and integrity of blue crystal energy, a union of body and soul, thus creating a balance between our physical and spiritual energies. Purple crystals help us connect with our mystical sides by strengthening our intuition and a higher sense of self. They signify magic, mystery, royalty, and good judgment. Consider Amethyst, a stone of transcendence that heightens psychic powers and strengthens our connection to all things mystical and magical. Purple crystals activate our third eye and crown chakras. They promote harmony of the mind and emotions, contributing to mental balance, stability, and peace of mind and, therefore, support the practice of meditation. Consider Lepidolite, a stone of balance and stability. Lepidolite is one of the best calming and stabilizing stones to utilize during meditation whenever life overwhelms you. PINK CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: COMPASSION, GENTLENESS, HOPE, NURTURING, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE Pink crystals represent gentle, loving energy and the giving and receiving of nurturing. In addition to green crystals, pink crystals represent the heart chakra. They help evaporate emotional traumas, heartbreak, and sadness and offer clarity to situations of the heart. Pink crystal energy can also assist in healing relationships, promote mutual understanding, and inspire an attitude of compassion and kindness. Pink crystals may enhance the power of your intentions, especially those related to love, romance, and compassion. When the days are gray, and you desire hope and love, turn to Rose Quartz, Pink Amethyst, or Morganite for a tender loving energy. Place pink crystals in your home to fill it with loving energy that offers compassion and encourages openness. Carry a pink pocket stone with you out and about to attract love and romance. Some other popular pink crystals to consider adding to your collection include Rhodonite, Pink Opal, and Rhodochrosite. Shop our Pink Crystal Color Collection WHITE CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: CLARITY, ILLUMINATION, INNER CLEANSING, PURIFICATION, REGENERATION White crystals symbolize endings and beginnings. They activate our crown chakra, represent clarity and regeneration, and illuminate us with light and guidance when we don't know where we are going. They can amplify our energies and efforts, making them powerful healers, energy transmitters, and our connection to higher consciousness. Additionally, white crystals are often famed for their powerful and wide-ranging cleansing abilities and are the ultimate crystals for inner cleansing and purification. Try working with Rainbow Moonstone or Quartz to experience and appreciate the cyclic nature of the universe. Consider Selenite to free and cleanse unwanted vibes or energies holding you back. BLACK CRYSTAL COLOR ENERGY: CONFIDENCE, MYSTERIOUS, POWER, PROTECTION, SECURITY Black crystals correspond to the root chakra, keeping us grounded and protected. Use them as protective amulets when traveling, as they are the ultimate crystals for protection and security. Consider Black Tourmaline whenever you feel untethered or unsafe. Place Black Tourmaline near the entrance to your home to keep all dark forces out. Tuck a small piece into your clothing or pocket for on-the-go protection. In addition to their protective properties, black crystals imbue confidence and power due to self-doubt and uncertainty. Furthermore, they absorb negative energy, thus helping you focus and amplify your ability to keep undesirable efforts out of your life. If you need a crystal that encompasses the masculine divine, strength, confidence, and protection, consider Black Onyx. Thank you for joining me here in this space.
