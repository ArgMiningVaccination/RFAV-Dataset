Getting vaccinated against COVID-19: how, why and when? Where and when can I get a COVID-19 vaccination? How will I know when it's my turn to be vaccinated? Wellbeing services counties organise vaccinations and will specify where and when you can get a vaccination. Wellbeing services counties inform residents when coronavirus vaccines are available to different groups. - Therefore, you should follow your wellbeing services county's website and other communications. The means by which information is provided and how residents can book an appointment for their coronavirus vaccination vary by wellbeing services county. - In questions concerning your own health, please be in touch with your own health centre or occupational health service. The COVID-19 vaccine is offered in Finland to all who are 12 years old and above and want to take the vaccine. Additionally, vaccinations are offered to children under the age of 12 based on individual consideration. The primary vaccination series for all includes two vaccine doses, except for children aged 6 months to 4 years and persons with severe immunodeficiency, whose vaccine series includes three doses. Boosters refer to vaccine doses given in addition to the primary vaccine series and previous coronavirus infections, which maintain protection against a serious disease and death. [Vaccine doses offered to different groups](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/getting-vaccinated-against-covid-19-how-why-and-when-/vaccine-doses-offered-to-different-groups) Why is the COVID-19 vaccine worth taking? Every decision to get vaccinated counts. A vaccine offers the best protection against severe coronavirus disease. The disease causes an acute respiratory tract infection, and its severity may vary from asymptomatic to a very severe state that requires intensive care. Some patients may suffer from long-term effects of COVID-19 disease, such as fatigue, breathing difficulties, cough, and pain in the joints or chest. [Efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/efficacy-of-vaccines-against-covid-19) What is the aim of coronavirus vaccinations in Finland? The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health updated the coronavirus vaccination strategy 22.6.2022. According to the strategy, the aim of vaccinations is to keep our society open, to safeguard the adequacy of health care capacity and, in particular, to reduce the incidence of severe coronavirus disease.

THL recommends a third vaccine dose for all persons aged 18 or over and risk group members aged 12 or over. A third vaccine dose may also be administered to other people aged 1217 if this is necessary for a specific reason, for example for a vaccination certificate. A previous coronavirus infection corresponds to a vaccine dose. Most persons aged 18-59 do not need a third dose for protection if they have had the disease and received two doses of vaccine.

[What is meant by a severely weakened immune defence?](#immunedefence) - For persons aged 60 and over and persons in at-risk groups and over 18 years of age, a third dose can be administered when 3-4 months have passed from the second dose.

To whom a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine is recommended? We recommend the fourth dose for healthy people aged 60-64. A person who has had a coronavirus infection and has received three vaccine doses does not need the fourth vaccine dose, as having the disease is equivalent to receiving one vaccine dose. Please note that we recommend the booster dose of late autumn 2022 for all those aged 65 or over, those aged 18 or over in medical risk groups and those aged 12 or over with severe immunodeficiency. Compared to the fourth dose, for the booster vaccine target groups, it no longer matters how many booster doses the person has received or how many times they may have had the coronavirus disease. I have not yet taken the booster dose of late autumn 2022. Can I still get it in 2023? Yes, you can. If you have not received the COVID-19 booster of late autumn 2022, you can take it in 2023 in accordance with the common practices of your wellbeing services county. The wellbeing services counties decide on the vaccination schedule and announce where and when the COVID-19 vaccination can be received. Enhancing vaccine protection maintains protection against serious diseases and deaths. We continue to recommend the booster dose of late autumn 2022: - all persons aged 65 and over - those in medical high-risk groups aged 18 and over at-risk groups for severe coronavirus disease [Risk groups for severe coronavirus disease](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/risk-groups-for-severe-coronavirus-disease?p_p_id=com_liferay_journal_content_web_portlet_JournalContentPortlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&refererPlid=5748252&_com_liferay_journal_content_web_portlet_JournalContentPortlet_articleId=5748293&_com_liferay_journal_content_web_portlet_JournalContentPortlet_templateId=BASIC-WEB-CONTENT&_com_liferay_journal_content_web_portlet_JournalContentPortlet_groupId=533989&_com_liferay_journal_content_web_portlet_JournalContentPortlet_viewMode=view&_com_liferay_journal_content_web_portlet_JournalContentPortlet_journalPreview=true&p_p_auth=qqw0kKtR) - persons with severe immunodeficiency aged 12 or over [What is meant by a severely weakened immune defence?](#immunedefence) For booster vaccine target groups, it no longer matters how many booster doses the person has received or how many times they may have had the coronavirus disease. However, the person must have received the primary vaccination series. The primary series includes two vaccine doses, or three doses for those with immunodeficiencies. You can take the vaccine when at least three months have passed since you had your previous vaccination or contracted the disease. Vaccines tailored to specific variants are primarily used as booster doses to broaden the range of the immunological response. Persons who have received one booster dose of variant vaccine, may not be given a new variant vaccine dose until next recommendations are made.

New booster doses following the booster of late autumn 2022 may be given to people with severe immunodeficiency based on an individual assessment by the attending physician. It is good to request this individual assessment in advance so that the attending physician's entry about the need for a booster dose is on the patient record before getting the vaccine. We are considering the next round of boosters for risk group members and older people in autumn 2023. We will provide more information about them in the summer at the latest. [For more information, see the working paper: Coronavirus vaccinations in 2023 (in Finnish)](https://www.julkari.fi/handle/10024/146281) Can I personally select which vaccine I want to get? What coronavirus vaccines are given to people of different ages? Coronavirus vaccinations are offered in Finland to persons aged 6 months and over. - The Biontech-Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine can be offered to anyone aged 12 or over without a maximum age limit. Children under 12 years will be offered a smaller dose of Comirnaty that is meant for their age group. - The Janssen vaccine is offered in Finland only to those aged 65 and over. - The Novavax's Nuvaxovid vaccine vaccine can be offered to anyone aged 12 or over as a first or second dose. As a booster dose variant tailored mRNA vaccines are recommended. Nuvaxovid vaccine is not offered to men and boys under 30 years old. - The Comirnaty variant vaccines are recommended to those aged 12 or over as a booster after the primary vaccination series. The BA.4-5 product may also be used in the basic series. - The Spikevax BA.1 variant vaccines are recommended to those aged 12 or over as a booster after the primary vaccination series. The Comirnaty variant vaccine is recommended to boys and men aged under 30. Coronavirus vaccines are given to different age groups as follows: 6 months to 4 year-olds: Children aged 6 months to 4 years will be offered a smaller dose of Biontech-Pfizer's Comirnaty that is meant for their age group. 511-year-olds: Children aged 5 to 11 will be offered a smaller dose of Biontech-Pfizer's Comirnaty that is meant for their age group. 1217-year-olds: - The Biontech-Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine can be offered to everyone aged 12 to 17. - For children aged 12 to 17, Biontech-Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccines are used for the third dose. For girls also Moderna's Spikevax BA.1 vaccine may be offered. Variant-tailored products are primarily used as the third dose, as they extend the immunological base of the protection. - Persons aged 12 to 17 in risk groups can be given Nuvaxovid as a booster if they cannot be vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine for a medical reason. Those aged 18 to 64 years: - A new vaccination series for a person under 65 years of age is started with either the Biontech-Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine or the Novavax's Nuvaxovid vaccine. An exception is men aged under 30 for whom the Nuvaxovid vaccine is not recommended. - For those under the age of 65, the primary option for a third dose is a variant mRNA vaccine. These are Biontech-Pfizer's Comirnaty variant vaccines or Moderna's Spikevax BA.1 vaccine. - For men under 30 years of age, only Biontech-Pfizer vaccine is recommended third dose, regardless of the products they have received as their previous doses. - For those aged 18-64 who cannot be given an mRNA vaccine because of factors such as a serious allergy, Novavax Nuvaxovid vaccine or as a secondary option the Janssen vaccine may be given instead. - A person under 65 years of age cannot choose the adenoviral vector vaccine themselves, as the use of the vaccine in this age group cannot normally be considered medically justified in the current epidemiological situation of coronavirus in Finland. - The vaccination series may also be supplemented with another coronavirus vaccine if there is no medical impediment to the use of the other product. It is also permitted to use three different vaccines products. - As boosters, Comirnaty or Spikevax variant vaccines are primarily administered as they expand the immunological base of the protection. Those aged 65 and over: - Persons over 65 years of age can be offered any of the adult coronavirus vaccine that are in use in Finland. These are the Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines, Janssen's adenoviral vector vaccine or the Nuvaxovid protein-based vaccine. - A person 65 years of age or over may choose the preparation that they prefer when starting their series of vaccines. - If a person aged 65 or over has received the AstraZeneca or Janssen vaccine as the first dose and does not want an adenoviral vector vaccine as their next vaccination, they may instead receive an mRNA vaccine or the Novavax vaccine. - A coronavirus vaccination series may also be supplemented with another coronavirus vaccine if there is no medical impediment to the use of the other product. It is also permitted to use three different vaccines products. - As boosters, Comirnaty or Spikevax variant vaccines are primarily administered as they expand the immunological base of the protection. Exceptions to the guidelines for age groups should only be made if there is a contraindication to the administration of a specific vaccine product. This can mean, for example, allergy to a vaccine ingredient or a severe allergic reaction after the first dose of vaccine. Taking a vaccine is always voluntary. If you do not wish to get a specific vaccine product, you should be offered another medically justified vaccine product if possible. If you wish to choose a specific vaccine, you should mention your preference when making your appointment. By doing this you can ensure that your preferred vaccine is available where the vaccines are administered. [Are the COVID-19 vaccines suitable for everyone?](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/suitability-of-covid-19-vaccines-for-various-groups) [Safety and possible adverse effects of Coronavirus vaccines](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/safety-of-covid-19-vaccines) [Coronavirus vaccinations for children and young people](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccinations-for-children-and-young-people) How is it determined who belongs to a specific age group for vaccinations? The vaccinations are based on how old each person is at the time of vaccination. The marketing authorisation for the vaccine determines the target age group of the vaccine. For example, according to the marketing authorisation, the Comirnaty 30 mikrog/dose vaccine can be administered to all those aged 12 or over. Therefore, the person to be vaccinated must have reached the age of 12 at the time of vaccination. Sometimes the age limit is determined according to the national guidelines. For example, the Janssen adenovirus vector vaccine is offered in Finland only to those aged 65 and over due to the precautionary principle. When are the different doses of the coronavirus vaccine series given? In Finland the interval for the first and second doses of both the mRNA vaccines and the AstraZeneca adenovirus vector vaccine is 6-12 weeks. In Finland, a second vaccine dose is recommended after 2 months for those who have received the Janssen vaccine. For those with serious immunodeficiencies, we recommend a third dose after at least 2 months have passed from the second dose. For those aged 60 years and over and those in at-risk groups, a third vaccine dose can be administered when 3-4 months have passed from the second vaccination. For those under the age of 60, who are not part of an at-risk group, a third vaccine dose can be offered 4-6 months from the second dose. Healthy 60-64-year-olds are recommended the fourth vaccine dose once at least three months have passed since the third dose. [Vaccine doses offered to different groups](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/getting-vaccinated-against-covid-19-how-why-and-when-/vaccine-doses-offered-to-different-groups) Why is the interval between the first and second vaccines longer than in many other countries? The protection provided by the vaccine is better with a longer interval between the two doses. This is because the immune response in the body matures and is more capable of producing antibodies that latch on to the virus as well as a sufficient number of memory T cells, or defender cells. Persons vaccinated with the help of memory T cells are better protected against severe disease the next time that they confront the virus. On the other hand, the longer interval between doses meant that the vaccine could be offered quickly to more people than before even when vaccine supplies were limited. This allowed to prevent as many severe coronavirus infection cases and deaths as possible. What is meant by a severely weakened immune defence? Persons with a severely weakened immune system include those with one or some of the following illnesses or conditions: - Organ transplant - Stem cell transplant - Severe or moderate congenital immune deficiency - Immunosuppressive cancer therapy - Treatment of autoimmune diseases with immunosuppressive biological medicines or JAK inhibitors - Dialysis and severe chronic renal failure - Advanced or untreated HIV - Other severe immunosuppressive condition diagnosed by a physician. If you have any questions concerning your own illness or health, contact your doctor. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine only in my own wellbeing service county of residence? As a rule, everyone receives the COVID-19 vaccine in their home wellbeing services county. However, at the moment corona vaccines are widely available throughout the country and therefore most wellbeing services counties also offer to non-residents the possibility to get a vaccination. Ultimately, each wellbeing services county decides whether to vaccinate non-residents as well. Can a person who does not have a municipality of residence in Finland receive a COVID-19 vaccine? In order to protect public health, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health recommends that wellbeing services counties provide COVID-19 vaccines to persons residing in Finland who do not have a municipality of residence or other right to preventive public health care services in Finland. These people may include students from outside the European Union, seconded employees and diplomats, adult asylum seekers and undocumented persons. In addition, Finnish citizens living abroad do not necessarily have a municipality of residence in Finland. However, it is not recommended to provide vaccines for tourists and other people visiting Finland for a short period of time. For example, it is not necessary to give vaccination to residents who are staying in Finland because of a short commute or who visit their holiday home. When the wellbeing services counties assess the prerequisites for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in Finland for a person with no home municipality, they take into account, among other things, the duration of the stay and whether their stay in Finland is long enough for them to have the opportunity to receive both doses of vaccine in accordance with the COVID-19 vaccination programme. If you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland and want to ask about COVID-19 vaccinations, you can contact the wellbeing service county in which area you are staying.
