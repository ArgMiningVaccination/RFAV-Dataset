Lan Yao received her Ph.D. in nursing from University of Michigan in 2004. Dr. Yaos program of research focuses on utilizing residual emotional and procedural learning reserves in the dementia patients to tailor physical exercise interventions that affect functional ability, fall risks, and quality of life in patients with Alzheimers disease and their caregivers. Physical activities and exercise intervention are particularly challenging when involving older adults with Alzheimers disease and other dementias. Inactivity exacerbates physical and cognitive deficits through the loss of motivation and efficiency in performing activities which leads to further deterioration and decline in function among these patients.

During her postdoctoral training, Dr. Mahmoud received training on the principals and tools of human metabolic research, exercise physiology, and vascular biology through joining the renowned leaders in this area in the School of Applied Health Sciences at UIC. Dr. Mahmoud's research and publications have included numerous peer-reviewed journals and presentations in national meetings such as the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association and the Experimental Biology. Recently, Dr. Mahmoud received an 'American Heart Association Award' to conduct studies that examine microvascular dysfunction in metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Also, the research project includes a clinical trial to study aerobic exercise as a rehabilitative interventions that restore microvascular function in patients with diabetes and obesity.
