For example, someone who is alcohol dependent or has a tolerance for drinking may experience tremors, seizures, and anxiety as a withdrawal symptom when they stop consuming alcohol. As a result, the individual may drink to try and relive those symptoms, possibly fostering a dependence. Acupuncture can aid in suppressing some substance abuse [withdrawal symptoms](https://www.rehabspot.com/alcohol/withdrawal/), with ongoing studies finding interesting results. Although much research is still being done, researchers have found that the benefits of acupuncture can help with alcohol withdrawal and addiction. In a study where some lab rats received acupuncture and others did not, symptoms like tremors, anxiety, and stress as a result of alcohol withdrawal were lower in the rats that received acupuncture than those that didn't. Additionally, rats who had acupuncture in the study showed higher endorphin levels, helping scientists deduce that this practice can help with alcohol withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
