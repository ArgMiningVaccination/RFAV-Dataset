Part of the comprehensive assessment work is to formally identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders helped to prioritize the unmet needs for further implementation strategy development. We are grateful to all the community members who joined us in this important work. During 2015 members of the community were as ked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University analyzed the survey data. Sanford further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs , and partnered with key community stakeholders to develop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritization exercise was also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further a ddress these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. Sanford Wheaton has set strategy to address the following community health needs: Mental Health Safety Children and Youth The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. The asset map/resource list is included in this document along with the actions that will be taken to address each identified need. At Sanford Wheaton patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not-for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of our communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work in our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, JoAnn Foltz Chief Executive Officer Sanford Wheaton Medical Center 3 Sanford Wheaton Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Sanford Wheaton Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital community benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and community health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational stra tegies and provides further evidence for retaining not -for-profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Fi ndings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a community benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Methodology 1. Non -Generalizable Survey An on -line non -generalizable survey was conducted through a partnersh ip between Sanford and Public Health across the enterprise . The CSR developed and maintained links to the on -line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collectio n occurred thro ughout the month of April 2015 and a total of 35 respondents participated in the on -line survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community leaders in the greater Wheaton area was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders reg arding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders, legislators, and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. 5 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the finding s from assessment research and to discuss the top health issues facing the community. Community stakeholders discussed the findings and helped to determine key priorities for the community. Those priorities will be addressed in the implementation strategies for 2017 -2019. 3. Community A sset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. A multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 4. Secondary Research The secondary data includes the 2015 Cou nty Health Rankings for Traverse County . Key Findings - Primary Research The key findings ar e based on the non -generalizable survey data. Key indicators were ranked on a 1-5 Likert scale, with 5 being the highest concern ranking. Survey results ranking 3.5 or higher are conside red to be high -ranking concerns. Aging : The top ranking concern among respondents overall is the cost of long term care (4.09 ). The availability of memory care (3.74) also rank s as a top concern for the aging.

The following needs were brou ght forward for prioritization: Children and Yo uth - availability of quality infant ca re, availability of activities for children and youth Aging - cost of long term care , availability of memory care Safety - the presence of street drugs and alcohol in the community, presence of drug dealers in the community Physical H ealth - cancer, inactivity , obesit y Mental Health - depression, stress, substance use and ab use (drugs and alcohol) Preventive Health - flu vacc ines Members of the collaborative determined that children and youth are a top unmet need. Community stakeholders also rated mental illness a top priority. Mental Health Safety Children and Youth Sanford has determined the 2017 -2019 implementation str ategies for the following needs: Priority 1: Mental Health Priority 2: Safety Priority 3: Children and Youth 8 Implementation Strategies Priority 1 : Mental Health/Behavioral Health Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well -being. It affects how people think, feel and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse Family history of mental health problems Mental health problems are common but people with mental health problems can get bet ter and many recover completely. Sanford Wheaton has made mental/behavioral health a significant priority and has developed strategies to improve access and availability of services f or mental and behavioral health needs. Priority 2: Safety The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports that 4.3 million Americans engaged in non -medical use of prescription painkillers in the last month. Approximately 1.9 million Americans met criteria for prescription painkillers use disorder based on their use of prescription painkillers in the past year. A number of opioids are prescribed by physicians to relieve pain. These include hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and codeine. While many people benefit from using these medications to manage pain, prescription drugs are frequently diverted for improper use. In the 2013 and 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 50.5% of people who misused prescription painkillers got them from a friend or relative for free, and 22.1% got them from a physician. As people use opioids repeatedly, their tolerance increases. Sanford has set strategy to reduce drug and narcotic use across the system by providing alternative pain management methods. Policies and procedures to address the prescription of narcotics will be standardized across the health care system as part of this strategy. Pain medication prescriptions will be tracked and studied to identify areas for improveme nt. Sanford Wheaton has se t strategy to work with law enforcement to increase the locations for drug take -back. Priority 3 : Children and Youth According to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 49 million people in the United States live in households struggling to find enough food to eat. Nearly 16 million are children, who are far more likely to have limited access to sufficient food than the general population. While 15.9% of Americans lived in food -insecure households, 21.6% of children h ad uncertain access to food . It is difficult for a child to learn when they are malnourished. 9 Sanford has made children and youth a significant priority and has developed strategies to imp rove the health of children. Sanford is working with community par tners to provide access to healthy food options to decrease hunger among children in the community. 10 Sanford Wheaton Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 11 Table of Contents Page Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment 12 Acknowledgements 12 Description of Sanford Wheaton Medical Center 14 Description of the Community Served 15 Study Design and Methodology 16 Limitations of the Study 17 Key Findings 19 Primary Research o Community Health Concerns o Personal Health Concerns o Demographics o Health Needs and Community Resources Identified o Prioritization How Sanford is Addressing the Needs 39 2016 Implementation Strategies 42 2013 Implementation Strategies Impact 47 Community Feedback from 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment 49 Appendix 50 Primary Research Asset Map Prioritization Worksheet Non-Generalizable Survey Secondary Research Definitions of Key Indicators County Health Rankings o Traverse County , Minnesota 12 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital community benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research.

Non -Generalizable Survey A non -generalizable survey was conducted of residents in Traverse County , Minnesota. The survey instrument was developed in partnership with Public Health, members of the Greater Fargo - Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment collaborative, Sioux Falls community collaborative, Bismarck community collaborative, public health leaders from across the enterprise, and researchers at the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University (NDSU). The CSR developed and maintained links to the on -line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occu rred throughout the month of April and a total of 35 respondents participated in the on-line survey. The purpose of the non -generalizable survey of residents in the greater Wheaton area (i.e., Traverse County) was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders and agency leaders representing public health, city government, law enforcement, Chamber of Commerce , tribes, chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine t he respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 17 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early finding from the generalizable survey and to discuss the top health issues or health related issues facing the community. The community stakeholders helped to determine key priorities for the community. 3. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern Un iversity. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The community stakeholder group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. A multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 4. Secondary Research The secondary data includes County Health Rankings for Traverse County . Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in Wheaton and Traverse County, Minneso ta. However, when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, income, minority status) with the current population estimates from the U.S. Census Bu reau, it was white, more highly educated, and higher income earners were overrepresented. O verrepresentation of this nature is typical in health needs assessments. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the communi ty. I nvitations were extended to county and community leaders, organizations and agencies representing d iverse populations and disparities. Additional data was reviewed through secondary research. The data for the secondary research was secured from the County Health Rankings. The Internal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broad interests of the commu nity served by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leade rs, representatives, or members of medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations. 18 Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cases there were surveys t hat were submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs assessment and the implem entations strategies are welcome on the Sanford website under \"About Sanford\" in the Community Health Needs Assessment section. 19 Key Findings 20 Primary Research Community Health Concerns The following concerns ranked highest of all the indi cators on the non-generalizable (community stakeholders) surveys. Aging Population: The cost and of long term care is the highest concern for the community stakehol ders . The availability of memory c are is also a high concern . Level of concern with s tatements about the community regarding the AGING POPULATION Sanford is working collaboratively with the area aging service providers to coordinate care for the aging population. Social workers, case managers, and discharge planners are working collabora tively with area service providers to assure safe discharge, and when appropriate, to assist in transitions from levels of care. 3.113.113.203.263.313.343.744.09 1 2 3 4 5Cost of activities for seniors (N=35)Availability of resources for grandparents caring for grandchildren (N=35)Availability of long term care (N=35)Availability of resources for family/friends caring for and making decisions for elders (N=35)Availability of resources to help the elderly stay safe in their homes (N=35)Availability of activities for seniors (N=35)Availability of memory care (N=35)Cost of long term care (N=35) Mean (1= Not at All; 5=A Great Deal)21 Children and Youth: The survey respondents have the highest concerns for the availability of quality infant care and the availability of activities for children and youth.

Mean (1= Not at All; 5=A Great Deal)23 Level of concern with statements about the community regar ding PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH The chronic disease self -management Better Choices, Better Health Program at Sanford is offered free of charge to community members. Better Choices, Better Health is modeled after the Stanford University's chronic disease self -management program. The works hops are 2 \u00bd hours long and meet weekly for 6 weeks. The program is facilitated by two trained lay leaders, and one or both of them have a chronic condition themselves. Research has found that after participating in the program individuals are better able to manage their symptoms, communicate more easily with their doctors, are less limited by the disease, and generally feel better. The Sanford Health fit initiative, http://sanfordfit.org/ a childhood obesity prevent ion initiative, continues to grow and mature as we work to refine the offerings and enable broad replication and meaningful use. Supported by the clinical experts of Sanford Health, fit educates, empowers and motivates families to live a healthy lifestyle through a comprehensive suite of resources for kids, parents, teachers and clinicians. fit is the only initiative focusing equally on the four key contributing factors to childhood obesity: Food (nutrition), Move (activity), Mood (behavioral health), and Recharge (sleep). Sanford's fit Initiative has come a long way since its inception in 2010. Through fit we are actively working to promote healthy lifestyles in homes, schools, daycares, our clinical settings, and 2.602.893.033.173.203.373.433.493.513.603.603.63 1 2 3 4 5Sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., AIDS, HIV, chlamydia) (N=35)Suicide (N=35)Other psychiatric diagnosis (N=34)Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (N=35)Infectious diseases such as the flu (N=35)Poor nutrition and eating habits (N=35)Chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis) (N=35)Stress (N=35)Obesity (N=35)Inactivity and lack of Not at All; 5= A Great Deal)24 throughout the community by way of technol ogy, engaging programs, and utilizing key role models in a child's life. The fit website for Juniors, Kids and Teens creates an entertaining and interactive on -line environment where they can play games, watch videos a nd take daily challenges. Parents benefit from their own set of resources where they can find tips and tools on becoming healthy role models and raising fit kids. To date, the chil dren's and parent's sites have received more than 7.5 million visitors. Over 700 pieces of content have been added to the sites, including videos, slideshows, games, articles, and even fit songs . In addition to the web, fit is developing meaningful school resources to bring value and fun into the primary education setting. We are doing this by integrating fit points into science and math components to provide health promotion , an avenue into the classroom without taking valuable time away from those critical subjects. fit 4 schools fit4schools@sanfordhealth.org is an on -line s chool resource with unique lessons integrated into daily classroom activities. fit4schools incorporates topics into math and science curriculum. The on -line resource for the classroom has 14 STEM (integrating science, technology, engineering and math) unit plans that can be downloaded for classroom use. Community o The fit friends, Denny, Abby, Sam, Alex and Marty, along with the fit team, have been making a variety of appearances at ev ents across the Sanford footprint. fit has been at over 2 dozen events interacting with more than 15,000 children and parents to spread the word about the fit platform and resources. o Smartphone Apps - Through a series of fun and engaging apps, fit will con tinue to activate kids at the touch of a fingertip to live a fit and healthy lifestyle related to Mood, Recharge, Food and Move. o MOVE2Draw is a simple and fun way for kids to move and create their own unique drawings. Once a drawing is completed, it can be stored on the MOVE2Draw website. o eMOODicam is a photo application that allows the user to enhance a photo and bring the mood to life and share with others. Looking Forward o fit is continuing to look to the future for ways to continue to make a meaningful impact on children and families both on -line and off -line. Other exciting expansions that are in the works include: Clinical Setting - Resources for the clinical setting to spur actionable and understandable discussions between health care providers and fa milies. Health Coaches - Exploring meaningful ways for health coaches to promote healthy choices with children and adults. Engage Key Role Models - Firefighters and youth sport coaches are role models and have a big influence on children so that's why fit is developing resources for them to teach the principles of fit along with sports fundamentals and other outreach efforts. 25 fitClub 4 Boys - 10-week after school program for boys, ages 8 -12, to develop knowledge of fit principles and healthy behavior choices. fit Parent/child - Class for parents and children to understand healthy choices and the benefits of living a healthy lifestyle. Mental Health /Behavioral Health: The top behavioral health concerns are underage drug use and abuse, drug use and abuse, and alcohol use and abuse. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE Personal Health Concerns Respondents' Personal Health Status The study results suggest possible discrepancies between respondents' perceived personal health and their actual health status as determined by objective measures. For example, using the Body Mass Index (BMI) which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height , the majority of respondents (72.7%) in the area are overweight or obese. However, the vast majority (91.4%) of community respondents rate their own health as excellent, very good or good. With good overall health habits in mind, it is important to no te that within the past year, 71 % of respondents visited a doctor or health care provider fo r a routine physical and over 82 % visited a dentist or dental clinic. 3.113.493.493.573.633.74 1 2 3 4 5Exposure to second-hand smoke (N=35)Underage drinking (N=35)Smoking and tobacco use (N=35)Alcohol use and abuse (N=35)Drug use and abuse (N=35)Underage drug use and abuse (N=35) Mean (1= Not at All; 5= A Great Deal)26 Respondents' rating of their health in general 91.4 % of the community stakeh olders (non -generalizable) rate their health as good or better .

Community results indicate that within the past year, the majority of respondents had a blood pressure scr eening, blood sugar screening, cholesterol screening, and dental screening. There are many screenings and tests that a majority of respondents did not receive (i.e., bone density test, cardio screening, hearing screening, immunizations, STD test, vascular screening, colorectal cancer screening, prostate cancer screening [males], and skin cancer screening) in the past year. Many tests and screenings may be conditional upon guidelines, which can be age sens itive/appropriate. 0.00.00.02.914.382.9 0.00.08.65.714.371.4 0 20 40 60 80 100NeverDon't know6 or more years3 to 5 years1 to 2 yearsWithin the past year Percent* Doctor or health care provider (N=35) Dentist or dental clinic (N=35)28 Whether or not respondents have had preventive screenings in the past year, by type of screening Type of screening Percent of respondents Yes No Total GENERAL SCREENINGS Blood pressure screening (N=35) 85.7 14.3 100.0 Blood sugar screening (N=35) 71.4 28.6 100.0 Bone density test (N=34) 20.6 79.4 100.0 Cardiovascular screening (N=34) 20.6 79.4 100.0 Cholesterol screening (N=35) 22.9 screening SCREENINGS Breast cancer screening (N=31 Females) 64.5 35.5 100.0 Cervical cancer screening (N=30 Females) 50.0 100.0 Colorectal screening (N=34) cancer screening (N=4 Males) 0.0 100.0 100.0 Skin cancer screening (N=35) 14.3 85.7 100.0 Of respondents who have not had preventive screenings in the past year, reasons why they have not, by type of screening Type of screening Percent of respondents* Not necessary Doctor hasn't suggested Cost Fear of procedure Fear of results Unable to access care Other reason GENERAL SCREENINGS Blood pressure screening (N=5) 60.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 40.0 Blood sugar screening (N=10) 50.0 30.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 20.0 Bone density test (N=27) 51.9 40.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 7.4 Cardiovascular screening (N=27) 44.4 44.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 7.4 Cholesterol screening (N=8) 37.5 37.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 25.0 Dental screening and X - rays (N=5) 0.0 0.0 40.0 20.0 0.0 20.0 40.0 29 Type of screening Percent of respondents* Not necessary Doctor hasn't suggested Cost Fear of procedure Fear of results Unable to access care Other reason Flu shot (N=9) 33.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 55.6 Glaucoma test (N=13) 23.1 53.8 7.7 0.0 0.0 7.7 7.7 Hearing screening (N=26) 42.3 46.2 3.8 0.0 0.0 3.8 7.7 Immunizations (N=28) 50.0 35.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 7.1 Pelvic exam (N=11 Females) 18.2 36.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 45.5 STD (N=31) 61.3 29.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.5 Vascular screening (N=33) 45.5 48.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.1 CANCER SCREENINGS Breast cancer screening (N=11 Females) 45.5 18.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 36.4 Cervical cancer screening (N=15 Females) 33.3 26.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 46.7 Colorectal cancer screening (N=28) 46.4 35.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 17.9 Prostate cancer screening (N=4 Males) 50.0 50.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Skin cancer screening (N=30) 36.7 50.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.3 13.3 For most types of screenings, the most common reasons for not getting the test or procedure are that it is not necessary and the doctor has not suggested one. For dental screening and x -rays, the most common reason for not being tested that it is not necessary followed by cost. For the flu shot screening, most respondents cite that it was not necessary or other reasons for not getting the shot. 51.4% of the survey respondents were under 45 years of age. Breast cancer screening: According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), a mammogram is an x-ray of the breast. Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be sure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to sta rt and how often to get a screening mammogram. Cervical cancer screening: Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and follow -up. Two screening tests can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early: The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. The Pap test is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. The HPV test looks for the human papillomavirus (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/ ) that can cause these cell changes. 30 Colorectal cancer screening: Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using high -sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Prostate cancer screening: The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties , risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have received this information. The discussion about screening should take place at: Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expe cted to live at least 10 more years. Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African Americans and men who have a first -degree relative (father, brother, or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first -degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, the screening decision can be made by the health care provider, who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between fu ture screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test: Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10 -year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit. Overall health status, and not age alone is important when makin g decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the discussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information about the benefits and risks of testing becomes available. Further discussions are also needed to take into account c hanges in the patient's health, values and preferences. Skin cancer screening: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: Be aware that fair -skinned men and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 moles, are at greater risk for melanoma. Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical ex aminations for other reasons. 31 Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that everyone six months and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the generalizable survey indicate t hat 37% of respondents did not have a flu shot last year. The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu and spread it to o thers. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. Sanford Health employees are required to have an annual flu vac cine as a protective measure for our patients as well as our staff. Sanford holds annual flu blitz events to increase the number of community members both pediatric and adult who receive the flu vaccine. Fruit and Vegetable Intake The study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet vegetable and fruit recommend ed dietary guidelines. Only 38 % of r espondents reported having 3 or more servings of vegetables the prior day . Only 31% of the group reported having 3 or more servings of fr uits the prior day. According to the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services, U .S. Department of Agriculture - Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of f ruit per day depending on age. A meal plan high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced -calorie meal plan can be beneficial for weight management. 32 Number of servings of vegetables, fruit, and fruit juice that respondents had yesterday Physical Activity Levels Study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet phy sical activity guidelines. 45.7 % of respondents engage in moderate activity 3 or more times per week and 22.9 % engage in vigorous activity 3 or more times per week. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that individuals participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week to help sustain and improve health.

Mental health influences our physical health, how we handle stress, how we make choices, and how we relate to others. Among Traverse County respondents, m ental health is a moderately high area of concern, particularly for depressio n and stress. More than 37% of respondents have been told or diagnosed by a doctor or health professional that they have depression. 22.9% have been diagnosed with anxiety or stress , and 63.7% of respondents self -report that in the last month, there were days when their mental health was not good. Number of days in the last month that respondents' mental health was not good Substance Abuse Responses Substance abuse is also a mental health disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition (DSM -IV), and can stem from mental health concerns. In the Traverse County, 82 % of the co mmunity stakeholders drank alcoholic beverages on at least one of the days in the last month. On days they drank, 35.7 % of respondents in the comm unity stakeholder group respondents drank an average of 3 or more drinks per day. In regards to binge d rinking, 31.5 % of community stakeholders report binge dr inking at least once per month. 15.23.00.045.536.4 0 10 20 30 40 5022 to 3015 to 218 to 141 to 7None Percent*Number of days35 Number of times during the past month that respondents consumed at least 4 or 5 alcoholic drinks (Binge drinking is defined by the CDC as 4 drinks for females, 5 dr inks for males) on the same occasion Whether respondents have ever had a problem with alcohol use or prescription or non -prescription drug abuse 68.614.38.65.72.9 0 20 40 60 80 100NeverOnce a monthOnce a week2 to 3 times a weekAlmost every day Percent* 100.093.1 0.06.9 0 20 40 60 80 100Prescription or non-prescription drug abuse (N=29)Alcohol use (N=29) Percent Yes No36 6.9% percent of respondents from the community stakeholder group reported having a problem with alcohol although earlier reporting indicated a higher level of binge drinking.

The unemployment rate in Traverse County, Minnesota is 4.7%. 37 Health Needs and Community Resources Identified One of the I nternal Revenue Service requirements for a community health needs assessment is to identify the resources that are available in the community to address unmet needs. Sanford Health conducted asset mapping by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources are available in the community to address the needs. Sanford Health and community partners developed the asset map. The grou p conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what to p priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. The asset map process includes ident ified needs from the following: The non -generalizable survey Concerns expressed by the key stakeholder group Secondary research data Community resources that are available to address the need(s) See the A sset Map in the Appendix. Prioritization The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Children and Youth - availability o f quality infant care, availability of activities for children and youth Aging - cost of long term care , availability of memory care Safety - the presence of street drugs and alcohol in the community, presence of drug dealers in the community Physical Health - cancer, inactivity , obesity Mental Health - depression, stress, substance use and abuse (drugs and alcohol) Preventive Health - flu vaccines Sanford is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. In some cases the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequately address the need. However, Sanford leaders will communicate these findings to community lea ders and experts who can best focus on a solution to the concern. 38 Members of the collaborative determined that safety/ children and youth and mental health are top unmet needs for further implementation strategies. Sanford has determined the 2016 -2019 i mplementation strategies for the following needs: Children and Youth /Safety Mental Health 39 How Sanford Wheaton is Addressing the Needs Health Indicator/Concern How Sanford Wheaton is Addressing the Needs Aging Cost of long term care Availability of memory care Local LTC facility is owned by the County; managed by Health Dimensions group.

It affects how people think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental healt h is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse Family history of mental health problems Mental health problems are common but people with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely. Sanford Wheaton has made mental /behavioral health a significant priority and has developed strategies to improve access and availability of services for mental and behavioral health needs. Priority 2: Safety The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) report s that 4.3 million Americans engaged in non -medical use of prescription painkillers in the last month. Approximately 1.9 million Americans met criteria for prescription painkillers use disorder based on their use of prescription painkillers in the past yea r. A number of opioids are prescribed by physicians to relieve pain. These include hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and codeine. While many people benefit from using these medications to manage pain, prescription drugs are frequently diverted for improper use. In the 2013 and 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 50.5% of people who misused prescription painkillers got them from a friend or relative for free, and 22.1% got them from a physician. As people use opioids repeatedly, their tolera nce increases. Sanford has set strategy to reduce drug and narcotic use across the system by providing alternative pain management methods. Policies and procedures to address the prescription of narcotics will be standardized across the health care system as part of this strategy. Pain medication prescriptions will be tracked and studied to identify areas for improvement . Sanford Wheaton has se t strategy to work with law enforcement to increase the locations for drug take -back. Priority 3 : Children and Y outh According to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 49 million people in the United States live in households struggling to find enough food to eat. Nearly 16 million are children, who are far more likely to have limited access to sufficient food than the general population. While 15.9% of Americans lived in food -insecure households, 21.6% of children had uncertain access to food . It is difficult for a child to learn when they are malnourished. 44 Sanford has made children and youth a significant priority and has developed strategies to imp rove the health of children. Sanford is working with community partners to provide access to healthy food options to decrease hunger among children in the community. 45 Community Health Needs Asses sment Implementation Strategy for Sanford Wheaton Medical Center FY 2017 -2019 Action Plan Priority 1 : Mental Health Projected Impact : Improve overall mental health in the community Goal 1 : Improve access/availability for mental health/behavioral health services Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Dedicated Resources Leadership Community partnerships /collaborations Work with Sanford Thief River Falls psychiatry team and Traverse County Mental Health providers to increase the number of available appointments for services and decrease ER visits Number of visits , New clientele access , ER visits Additional staff time JoAnn Foltz Chelsie Falk Chere Rikimoto Traverse County mental health providers Expand Medical Home to provide follow up for those patients who have PHQ -9 scores indicating depression Number of follow Chere Rikimoto Jordan Ottoson Chere Rikimoto Chelsie Falk First Link 211 Evidence -based guidelines for mental health are implemented Implementation of practice guidelines for mental health is complete Clinic/medical center providers Jordan Ottoson Chelsie Falk JoAnn Foltz Goal 2 : Promote early identification of mental health needs Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Resource s Leadership Community partnerships /collaborations Increase the number of wellness exams to improve health in early childhood Number of wellness exams Providers Jordan Ottoson JoAnn Foltz Horizon Public Health Implement screening tools during wellness exams to assess mental health diagnosis Screening tools are implemented and used at each wellness exam Sanford Ambulatory Standard .

The following strategies were implemented . 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment Wheaton Implementation Strategy Implementation Strategy: Transportation Identify series currently available within the community Develop directory with resources and outsource information Increase volunteer driver program and work with law enforcement and social services for mental health transport Implementation Strategy: Mental Health Services Participate in the enterprise implementation strategy to incorporate Sanford One Mind Define services currently available Develop directory of resources and information Distribute directory to various groups and entities Implementation Strategy: Recruitment of Physician Recruit another full -time family practice physician The 2013 strategies have served a broad reach across our community and region. The impact has been positive and the work will continue into the future through new or continued programming and services. Impact of the Strategy to Address Transportation The transportation r esources that are available in the community are include d in the Traverse County Resource Guide for all members of the community. Transportation did not rank as a high need in the 2016 CHNA. The number of county vol unteer drivers has increased . The DAV van has bee n added as a free service to all veterans for their VA appointment s in Fargo and St. Cloud. Veterans contact the local veterans ' office for travel reservations. Volunteer s cont inue to be recruited. Local law enforcement will provide transportation of mental health patients if they are \"On Hold\" with the County. Social Services and Productive Alternatives also p rovide drivers to transport parents and children with behavior health needs. Impact of the Strategy to Address Mental Health Services Traverse Cou nty Resource Guide has be en published with information about mental health resources, transportation resources, housing, disability and emergency resource s for the community. The Traverse County Resource Guide is available at Public Health, Social Services 49 and the medical facilities in the county. Sanford Wheaton has included the information at discharge planning meet ings with patients. A mental health support group meets monthly in Wheaton. Traverse County al so has a drop-in Center located in Wheaton for adult mental health clients for socialization activities. A psychologist from Life Center, Morris is available at the Wheaton Social Services office each Tuesday. Telehealth psychiatry is available twice a m onth at Sanford Wheaton Medical Center to enhance patient serv ices in this field. Impact of the Strategy to Access/Physician Recruitment A family practice physician was hired at Sanford Wheaton Medical Center in 2013. Sanford Wheaton has a recruitment p lan and continues to recruit for additional providers. Community Feedback from the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment Sanford Health is prepared to accept feedback on the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment and has provided on -line comment fields for ease of access on our website. There have been no comments to date aside from a question asked about the service area f or this report. A reader wanted to know if a separate report was developed for the Lisbon, North Dakota area. Since there is no hospital in Lisbon a community health needs assessment was not conducted solely for that community. 50 APPENDIX 51 Primary Research 52 Wheaton 2016 CHNA Asset Map Identified concern Key stakeholder survey specific concern and rating Key stakeholder Focus group Secondary data Community resources that are available to address the need Gap?
