And I think I won the Nobel' Using Twitter can bring joy one moment, anxiety the next, something Ardem Patapoutian experienced recently after he posted a tweet praising a new study on acupuncture. The Scripps Research scientist realized that some readers might mistakenly think he was endorsing the treatment in his new standing as a Nobel Prize winner. This story is for subscribers We offer subscribers exclusive access to our best journalism. Thank you for your support. \"I'll have to be a bit more careful about what I say,\" said Patapoutian, who is sharing this year's Nobel in physiology or medicine for helping [discover cells ](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01283-6)that enable people to sense temperature and touch. \"But I don't want to be so careful that I change the way that I act and think.\" Like other laureates before him, Patapoutian is sorting out what it means to win the most prestigious science award in the world, an honor that seems to cast a permanent glow. At least 27 scientists who do, or did, work here won the prize It comes with riches. He will split $1.14 million in prize money with co-recipient David Julius of the University of California San Francisco. The instant stardom does not come with a training manual. That much was evident on October 4 when Patapoutian and his wife, venture capitalist Nancy Hong, learned that he had [won the prize](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/science/story/2021-10-04/scripps-research-scientist-wins-nobel-prize-in-physiology-o). Patapoutian's 94 year-old father called him at his home in Del Mar at about 2 a.m. to say that people in Sweden were trying to reach him and that he should reply straight away. He briefly paused before tapping the keypad on his iPhone. \"There was this awkward interlude where it was, like, goodness are we really ready to get on this ride?\" Hong told the Union-Tribune. \"What does that even mean? It was a little bit scary, to be honest.\" The late laureate Seamus Heaney likened the \"Nobel moment\" to \"being struck by a more or less benign avalanche.\" Patapoutian \u2014 who sometimes holds \"faculty meetings\" while bobbing in the ocean with colleagues \u2014 leaned into the chaos. He even found time that day to bake an almond citrus Ottolenghi cake for his wife's birthday. But the gravity of winning the prize is setting in. He recently retweeted a message that appeared on a sign in a store window: \"Think once before you speak. Twice before you act. And three times before you post on Twitter.\" Patapoutian, an Armenian-American, is currently writing the lecture that all new Nobel laureates are expected to give, words that will be stored for posterity. His remarks will be broadcast during Nobel Week, which begins Dec. 6 and is partially virtual this year due to the pandemic. Nobel medals will be delivered in each winner's home country instead of in Stockholm and Oslo. Patapoutian is making sure the focus is on his research, rather than on things like growing up in Lebanon, which descended into civil war when he was young. At one point he was [ briefly detained](https://kavliprize.org/sites/default/files/TKP%202020%20Neuro%20autobiographies%20Ardem%20Patapoutian.pdf) by armed militants. \"I don't think the Nobel lecture is the place to talk about things like that,\" said Patapoutian who, at 54, is young for a new laureate. \"I try to incorporate (political and personal things) into the chats and interviews that I do.\" Those issues include a refusal by many Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and the political polarization found across social media. Patapoutian, who often walks six miles to work, usually speaks calmly and plainly about things like the anti-vax movement. \"When Jonas Salk developed the (polio) vaccine, everybody was excited and positive,\" said Patapoutian, a neuroscientist. \"In his day, people got their news from three or four sources of TV and a few in radio. Journalists told the news the way it was. In the modern era, there's so many sources of news, and many are not reputable. They're not fact-based. The COVID-era proves how problematic it is.\" \"I hope the majority of Americans celebrate the (COVID-19) vaccines as amazing progress in science that went from not knowing what this entity of the virus is to getting a vaccine in absolute record time, and has enabled us to at least partially exit from the shutdowns and the lockdowns.\" This is an explosive topic on Twitter, ground zero in the cancel culture. [Techjury.com says](https://techjury.net/blog/twitter-statistics/#gref) that one of every 13 tweets contains a curse word. He loves the platform nonetheless, and has nearly 18,000 followers. \"A lot of scientists are on LinkedIn, which is serious information,\" he said. \"Twitter has lots of interesting, serious science, too. But it's also a lot of fun. That's what life is like in our lab \u2014 fun. Science is fun. \"One of the things I want to project is that we're not stuffy people in lab coats.\" Many of his posts espouse humor and gratitude, something that colleagues say genuinely reflects his personality. \"Some people think of scientists who do really good work as being unrelatable because they've come up with a new way to see the world,\" said Scripps Research neuroscientist Lisa Stowers, who has known him for years. \"But Ardem is a regular guy. That's part of what makes him a good scientist. Others can relax and be creative when they're with him.\" It also helps that [the research](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211004-americans-david-julius-and-ardem-patapoutian-win-2021-nobel-prize-for-physiology-or-medicine) that won Patapoutian a Nobel is comparatively easy for the general public to grasp. He and Julius discovered receptors that enable people to sense temperature and touch, which could make it easier to develop drugs and therapies. \"Our ability to sense heat, cold and touch is essential for survival and underpins our interaction with the world around us,\" the Nobel Foundation said in announcing the prize. \"In our daily lives we take these sensations for granted, but how are nerve impulses initiated so that temperature and pressure can be perceived? \"This question has been solved by this year's Nobel Prize laureates.\" Patapoutian's \"Average Joe\" posts on Twitter include noting that his car got towed on the day he won the Nobel, and that he was not going to receive an NIH grant he was seeking. \"I am privileged, and I realize no-one wants to hear me complain,\" Patapoutian said in a tweet. \"Just sharing to make the point that everyone experiences this kind of (NIH) feedback, and that it never stops from stinging.\" He remained upbeat even when he learned that this year's Nobel Prize ceremony won't be held at the ornate Stockholm Concert Hall because of lingering concerns about the pandemic. Some of the new laureates, including Patapoutian, will get their medals in December at the modest Beckman Center in Irvine, the West Coast home of the National Academies. Irvine will be \"just as exciting as Stockholm!\" Patapoutian said. Not all of his posts are as frothy. In October, he tweeted that it was \"Ignorant and Irresponsible!\" of Fox News co-anchor John Roberts to simply say on Twitter, \"The fact that Colin Powell died from a breakthrough COVID infection raises new concerns about how effective vaccines are long-term.\" Patapoutian agreed with prominent San Diego cardiologist Eric Topol, who noted on Twitter that Powell had long suffered from a form a cancer that damaged his immune system, making him more vulnerable to the virus. That was left out of the post. Roberts deleted the tweet after a public outcry. A couple of weeks earlier, Patapoutian took on an equally sensitive issue, retweeting another person's message, which said, \"Abortion should only be permitted in cases of rape, incest, and when the woman chooses it.\" The controversy that often arises from such issues has led some prominent scientists to delete their Twitter accounts, including immunologist Kristian Andersen, one of Patapoutian's colleagues at Scripps Research. He [dropped off](https://www.newsweek.com/scientist-who-warned-fauci-covid-could-engineered-deletes-twitter-account-andersen-1598069) the platform earlier this year after a toxic dustup over his insights about the origins of COVID-19. The key to coping with such tension is suggested in an illustration that appears at the top of Patapoutian's Twitter page. It shows a woman wearing a blind fold while she tries to walk a tight rope. The image was created by renowned illustrator Jorge Colombo and was used make a point about research that Patapoutian [published in 2015](https://www.nature.com/neuro/volumes/18/issues/12) in the journal Nature Neuroscience. But it also speaks to his desire to say what's on his mind without causing an uproar. \"I do love the image of balance in life and this is very apt,\" Patapoutian said. "}
