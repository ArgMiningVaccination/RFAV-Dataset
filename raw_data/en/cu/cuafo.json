Homeopathy seeks to stimulate the body's ability to heal itself by giving very small doses of highly diluted substances. This therapeutic method was developed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann at the end of the 18th century. A remedy is carefully selected based on the symptom picture of the person, and then often it is dosed on sugar pellets or in liquid under the tongue. Homeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances that come from plants, minerals, or animals. They are generally safe for the entire family and when used correctly can provide a catalyst for profound healing. "}
