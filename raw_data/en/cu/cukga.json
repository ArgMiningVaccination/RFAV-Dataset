The study primarily aimed to describe the phenomena of the emergence of faith and spiritual healing practices in the society by investigating the influencing factors that motivated some patients to get treatment and cure from faith and spiritual healer, the methodology of the healer in treating various problems and afflictions, the mystical experiences of the participants during the healing process in reference to the marks of mystical experiences developed by William James in 1902, as well as the significant changes in the holistic stability of the patients after the healing process. Phenomenological-Descriptive design was utilized to describe the true meaning of the phenomena through the utilization of semi-structured interviews, collection of qualitative documents and qualitative observations. The participants comprised of 25 patients of the faith and spiritual healer commonly called as Mama Inday, who were chosen conveniently by the researcher which took place in General Santos City, Philippines. The results were interpreted through the use of Colaizzi's phenomenological method. The study revealed that there were significant influencing factors that motivated the patients to seek for efficacious remedy for various afflictions. The study showed the healer's broad methodology in treating various conditions of patients which encompassed beliefs, guides, and practices. Participants revealed mystical experiences during the process of faith and spiritual healing, and eventually gained holistic health after the healing process. The study primarily recommended that all aspects of one's well-being should be taken care of, and spirituality should also be incorporated in scholastic curricula as well as in the fields of psychology and medicine. Subtle Energies Energy Medicine, Volume 7, Number 3, 185-237. 1998 This ongoing research explores the psychological associated with the attempts of individuals who attempt to beneficially influence physiology of living organisms through such methods as wishing, laying-on of hands, prayer, and the purported transfer of subtle \"energy.\" Participants met specific criteria of social and/or scientific acceptability. A multiphasic research approach is explored in which the writings of a variety of healers were analyzed. A content analysis of the writings of 3 scholarly healer-researchers clarified and objectified healers' esoteric language, and an experiential inventory was developed. A systematic analysis was then performed using 10 books wrinen by well known healers in combination with 10 taped interviews of individuals who demonstrated healing (or biological influencing) under controlled conditions. Interviewees also ranked the importance of each major area of consciousness. Ranked averages indicate that the principal features of Transpersonal Healing (TH) are alterations in attention, cognitive processes and sense of self. Qualitative analysis reveals that TH involves self-regulation of attention, physiology, and cognition, the induction of altered awareness and reorganization of the healer's construction of cultural and personal realities. Attention is directed towards intrapsychic processes, resulting in (1) increased accessibility of subconscious materials, (2) enhanced empathy, (3) heightened emotional responses. (4) modified aHirudes. (5) altered meanings, and (6) distortions in time sense. Most significant among ontologic changes is a modification. or transcendence. of the healers' ordinary sense of self and absorption within functional beliefs. TH healer types appear to represent a range of contemporary subtypes of \"pure\" shamanic practice, the core process of TH being described as encompassing methodologies used to intentionally activate an endogenous healing potential. A taxonomic system is proposed and recommendations for future research are presented. This is an interpretive biography of physician and author Larry Dossey; a pioneer in alternative medicine. This study shows how Dossey, from simple beginnings as a sharecropper's son, became an allopathic physician who eventually developed the idea of Eras of Medicine. The importance of this study is in the telling of his lifestory to others in healthcare who are following or envisioning a similar future for medicine. This study also gives a literary glimpse with depth into the life of a popular author, and as such demonstrates the humanity of this successful public figure. Dossey's life, from his birth (1940) to the publication of his book Reinventing Medicine (1999), was investigated through personal interviews and his written work, and explored with a focus on character development. The research method used is the qualitative method of interpretive biography. Biographical study is a broad area of the interpretation of personal stories and archival documents. Specifically, the field of medicine prefers biography of its leaders posthumously; yet, a biography of a living figure can aid cultural and social changes based on living data. The data collection proceeded through interviews with Larry Dossey, Barbara Dossey, and Marilyn Schlitz, with written and verbal answers to iii questions posed by the researcher, individual meetings (informal discussions), and reviews of Dossey's published works and editorials. The data consisted of 19 interviews recorded with Larry Dossey. Additional data were retrieved from interviews with others, multiple written editorials, and nine books written during his early career. Photographs were provided by Larry Dossey in support of the data received. This study concluded that Dossey's lived life shows a physician trained in the traditional allopathic model can evolve his beliefs to a more transpersonal understanding of healing. His story, taken from him as a living subject, gives medicine the ability to learn and improve from the example of a living mentor rather than retrospectively gaining knowledge from its deceased mentors. This qualitative study was designed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the initial experience associated with the spiritual transformation process of inexperienced claimant mediums, commonly described as individuals who allegedly have regular communications with the deceased. Spiritually Transformative Experiences are commonly thought to be a type of transformation and expansion of consciousness. Often referred to as psychic openings, these experiences have occasionally been described as being startling or traumatic, sometimes creating a loss of contact with consensual reality that may possibly lead to psychiatric misdiagnosis in the individual's search for an understanding of the experience. Consequently, the desired outcome of this study was to establish a better understanding of the initial psychic opening and propose a more reasoned approach to its acknowledgement and development by the scientific community. A five-part review of the background literature in the field of study focused on a history of the practice of mediumship, the proposed psycho-spiritual emergence process, the child's perspective of his or her spiritual development process via an archival biographical analysis of the psychic opening, the subsequent development of the medium's purported abilities, and a review of recent processs-oriented mediumship studies. Six participants for this study were selected from a group of certified research mediums pre-screened for their abilities by the Windbridge Institute for Applied Research in Human Potential in Tucson, Arizona. A semi-structured questionnaire in compliance with Saybrook Institutional Review Board oral history specifications was utilized as the primary research instrument to provide biographical accountability. However, additional written documentation of the experience was included when appropriate to further clarify the psychological impact of the psychic opening. A thematic analysis of the data revealed that the participants' transformative experiences consist of a sequence of developmental experiences that include an encounter with a single or multiple spiritual entities that one may or may not consider as spirit guides. Depending upon the age of the participant and the existing social support system at the time of the initial experience, the spiritual encounter can be either fearfully traumatic or merely an anomalistic variation of the individual's concept of reality. 2 Shamans and artists have been perceived as similar across a variety of dimensions. Nonetheless, these similarities have not been systematically explored and are poorly understood. This study was designed to investigate these similarities. Stanley Krippner (personal communication, January 12, 2010) provided the initial definition of a shaman that, after minor modifications to more fully represent knowledge about shamans, became: A shaman is a socially designated spiritual practitioner who obtains information in ways not available to the shaman's community through the voluntary regulation of the shaman's own attention, which is used for the benefit of the shaman's community and its members. Defining constructs were operationalized and validated cross-culturally to support multidirectional comparisons between artists and shamans using archival data from psychology, archaeology, anthropology, philosophy, art history, and creativity studies. Previous publications about 24 well-known artists provided archival data for comparisons with shamans. The dimensions explored included familial influence, talent, neurological functions, calling to vocation, social support, personality, training, initiation, inspiration, positive disintegration, transliminality, imaginal realms, altered states, purported psi experiences, mental health issues, soul retrieval, spiritual emergence, transpersonal orientation, intent to benefit, and creativity. Tables, charts, and diagrams organized archival information that, supported by descriptive comparisons, explored the nature and extent of similarities between artists and shamans. The integration of visual art, poetry, and stories provided an emic artist's perspective and alternate ways of knowing for the reader. The study found that four artists from traditional cultures fulfilled all defining constructs of shaman, comprising a set of prototypical shamanic artists. In contrast, twenty artists fulfilled some, but not all, constructs defining shaman. These shamanlike artists were noncentral members in a fuzzy set where the shamanlike artists had family resemblances to traditional shamans and shamanic artists. The study identified and articulated gaps in knowledge as well as establishing a broad, well-grounded theoretical model that can serve as a foundation for future research on relationships between contemporary artists and shamans, and, potentially, contribute towards transformation of art experiences in artists, art audiences, and art institutions. Mental illness in Ethiopia has outranked HIV in being burdensome and yet it is overlooked as a major health priority. Research shows that family members and friends of the mentally disturbed prefer to have them treated first in religious places. Mental institutions, therefore, seem to be considered as final resorts. The apparent rift between religious centers and mental institutions needs to be bridged. This research sought to explore the understanding of mental disturbance among the Evangelical ministers in Addis Ababa by examining the approaches of eight ministers in two Evangelical denominations: Kale Heywet Church and Muluwongel Believers' Church in Addis Ababa. In the course of the study various relevant primary, secondary and web-based literatures were consulted, and semi-structured interview and an intensive observation by the researcher were used to collect data. The ministers were asked to define mental disturbance, explain its causes and treatment from their point of view and finally share their perceptions towards integral approach. The findings show that the definition offered by vocational ministers has similarity to what is offered by clinicians. Secondly, what the ministers listed as causes to and treatments for mental disturbance are not completely exclusive to clinical approaches and finally, on the part of the ministers, there seems to be a reasonable openness towards integral approach which needs to be further explored and effectively utilized. This dissertation research study employed a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to explore the researcher's lived experience of using the shamanic plant medicines ayahuasca and Willka. Ayahuasca and Willka are classified as entheogens, chemical substances ingested for spiritual or healing purposes, and are used as central components of shamanic healing rituals in Peru. Data were collected via narrative methods of qualitative inquiry based on the researcher's personal experiences with ayahuasca and Willka in Peruvian shamanic rituals. The researcher was the only participant in this study. Analysis of written protocols evaluated how these plants have contributed to the researcher's overall healing process. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis of the researcher's written narratives were utilized with incorporation of relevant texts pertaining to mind-body research. The results of this study highlight the role of set and setting, heightened physical and emotional sensations and awareness, altered states of consciousness, a personal relationship with the sacred plants, expanded consciousness and enhanced self-knowledge and self-healing in facilitating health and well-being. This dissertation research study provides insight into the healing potential of shamanic sacred plant medicine and altered states of consciousness in modern health care. Abstract THE SPIRITUALLY TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES OF CLAIMANT MEDIUMS William G. Everist Saybrook University This qualitative study was designed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the initial experience associated with the spiritual transformation process of inexperienced claimant mediums, commonly described as individuals who allegedly have regular communications with the deceased. Spiritually Transformative Experiences are commonly thought to be a type of transformation and expansion of consciousness. Often referred to as psychic openings, these experiences have occasionally been described as being startling or traumatic, sometimes creating a loss of contact with consensual reality that may possibly lead to psychiatric misdiagnosis in the individual's search for an understanding of the experience. Consequently, the desired outcome of this study was to establish a better understanding of the initial psychic opening and propose a more reasoned approach to its acknowledgement and development by the scientific community. A five-part review of the background literature in the field of study focused on a history of the research and practice of mediumship, an archival biographical analysis of the psychic opening, the proposed psycho-spiritual emergence process, the child's perspective of his or her spiritual development process, and the subsequent development of the medium's purported abilities. Six participants for this study were selected from a group of certified research mediums pre-screened for their abilities by the Windbridge Institute for Applied Research in Human Potential in Tucson, Arizona. A semi-structured questionnaire in compliance with Saybrook Institutional Review Board oral history specifications was utilized as the primary research instrument to provide biographical accountability. However, additional written documentation of the experience was included when appropriate to further clarify the psychological impact of the psychic opening. A thematic analysis of the data revealed that the participants' transformative experiences consist of a sequence of developmental experiences that include an encounter with a single or multiple spiritual entities that one may or may not consider as spirit guides. Depending upon the age of the participant and the existing social support system at the time of the initial experience, the spiritual encounter can be either fearfully traumatic or merely an anomalistic variation of the Transpersonal Psychology 2017 The article begins with a brief introduction to the authors' field experience and expertise relevant to indigenous knowledge. We briefly discuss indigenous cultures, traditional healing practises and shamanism, then elaborate on Southern African indigenous cosmology and its link to a shamanic traditional healing system. Next, we outline paradigm differences between African indigenous and Western traditional knowledge. In addition, we discuss transpersonal dimensions of Southern African shamanism and we propose a significant concurrence between African indigenous shamanic cosmology and the transpersonal paradigm. We suggest that indigenous knowledge facilitates an understanding of people in their cultural context, includes spirituality and non-ordinary states of consciousness, and opens the door to the development of wide compassion towards other cultures, which instigates a path towards psychology that is universally applicable. The authors concur that future training in psychology and health care would do well to integrate an in-depth exploration of traditional knowledge, encourage cross-cultural dialogue between healers and acknowledge indigenous shamanic wisdom.
