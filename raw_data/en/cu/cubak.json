It is a treatment for early and advanced breast cancer, advanced stomach cancer and cancer of where the food pipe joins your stomach (gastro oesophageal junction). What is trastuzumab? Trastuzumab is a targeted cancer drug. It is a treatment for cancers that have large amounts of a protein called - early breast cancer (the cancer hasn't spread beyond the breast or the lymph nodes in the armpit on the same side of the body. So, the cancer hasn't spread to any other part of the body) - breast, stomach and gastro oesophageal junction cancer that has spread to another part of the body (advanced or metastatic cancer) You might have the original drug called Herceptin, or a biosimilar such as Herzuma or Ontruzant. A biosimilar is a very similar copy of the original drug, but it is not exactly the same. Biosimilars undergo strict testing to check they work just as well as the original drug. How does trastuzumab work? Some breast and stomach cancers have large amounts of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). They are called HER2 positive cancers. HER2 makes the cancer cells grow and divide. Trastuzumab is a type of targeted cancer drug called a monoclonal antibody. It works by attaching to HER2 so it stops the cancer cells from growing and dividing. How do you have trastuzumab? For breast cancer, you might have trastuzumab as a drip into your bloodstream (intravenously) or as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). If you have trastuzumab intravenously, you may be able to switch to the subcutaneous injection. For stomach cancer, or gastro oesophageal junction cancer, you usually have trastuzumab as a drip into your bloodstream. Into your bloodstream Each treatment takes between 30 and 90 minutes. You have the first treatment over 90 minutes and your team will check you for any side effects. Depending on the effects you have, the next infusion might be shorter. You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a: - central line - PICC line - portacath If you don't have a central line, you might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment. As an injection under the skin You might have trastuzumab as an injection under the skin, on the upper, outer part of your leg. The injection takes about 2 to 5 minutes. It is important that your nurse changes which leg you have your injection in each time, to stop the area getting sore. They will check you for side effects for a few hours after the injection. How often do you have trastuzumab? For early breast cancer You might have trastuzumab alone, or together with chemotherapy. You have it before or after surgery and chemotherapy. You usually have it every week (weekly regimen) or every 3 weeks (3 weekly regimen). This continues for up to a year. For advanced breast cancer As the first treatment for breast cancer that has spread, you might have it together with the chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel (Taxol) or docetaxel (Taxotere) or with hormone therapies called Trastuzumab is also used as a treatment on its own for people who have had at least 2 types of chemotherapy and where hormone therapy has not worked. You have it every 3 weeks for as long as it is working and the side effects aren't too bad. For advanced stomach or gastro oesophageal cancer You might have trastuzumab as the first treatment for a type of stomach cancer called adenocarcinoma of the stomach that has spread to other parts of the body. Or for advanced gastro oesophageal junction cancer. For stomach and gastro oesophageal junction cancer you usually have it together with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine (Xeloda). Or with the drugs fluorouracil and cisplatin. You usually have the combination of the drugs for the first 6 cycles of your treatment. A cycle is the time between one round of treatment until the start of the next. After each round of treatment you have a break, to allow your body to recover You then have trastuzumab alone for the remaining cycles. You have it every 3 weeks for as long as it's working, and the side effects aren't too bad. Tests You have blood tests before and during your treatment.
