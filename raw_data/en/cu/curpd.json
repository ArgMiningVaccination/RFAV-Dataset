Meighen, Dr. Catherine Zahn, Darrell Louise Gregersen, and Ana P. Lopes C AMH has a tremendous responsibility to the people who turn to us for care. We know meaningful recovery is within reach, and that we cannot stop now. The challenges are formidable. We don't yet fully understand what causes mental illness or how to prevent it. Treatments are effective but don't work for everyone, and many people with mental illness struggle to access the services they need. Their health deteriorates with every roadblock or detour. But while the need is great, our commitment is greater. We are serving more patients at CAMH, while increasing the capacity of care providers across Ontario to care for patients in their local communities. We know we cannot afford to let even one person fall through the cracks. In our Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, our scientists are identifying the biomarkers needed for a greater understanding of what causes mental illness. They are piloting personalized medicine, where a simple cheek swab identifies the right medication for the right patient. This signals the end of trial-and-error prescribing, and sets people on the path to recovery sooner. We are pioneering new treatments with enormous potential. Brain stimulation, for example, is painless and effective with virtually no side-effects\u2014 the most significant advance in mental health treatment in more than a generation. This year we made major discoveries that bring us closer to understanding what causes schizophrenia. We are pinpointing new targets for treatment, and sharing those targets with the world. Our impact extends beyond science. We are helping build a better system to help more people access the right care at the right time. We are tackling the social factors that determine mental health, and are challenging the prejudice and stigma that prevents so many from getting the help they need. By reducing stigma, we know we will stop mental illness from destroying lives.Our ability to create positive change will continue to grow because our work is supported by people with vision\u2014 true leaders in the quest to build a society in which everyone believes life is worth living. Private philanthropy has been central to our success. Through our Breakthrough Campaign , philanthropic leaders are generating the resources needed to have a powerful impact in the lives of people with mental illness. They are helping us turn groundbreaking research into life-saving treatments, and enabling us to create modern spaces that promote healing and recovery. We have reached an exciting milestone in the Breakthrough Campaign \u2014 $125 million on our $200-million goal\u2014 the largest-ever campaign for mental health in Canada. The breakthroughs have already begun at CAMH and there are many more to come. Ana P. Lopes, Chair, CAMH Foundation Dr. Catherine Zahn, President & CEO, CAMH Darrell Louise Gregersen, President & CEO, CAMH Foundation Kelly / Pear Studios4 5Care P oor access to care has long been a challenge in the broader mental health care system. The situation is particularly urgent for young people, for whom early intervention can prevent a lifetime of disability. Our community demands\u2014and deserves\u2014 faster access to the best care available. Access CAMH provides a single front door to all our outpatient services, and is already helping us provide the right care faster for 95 per cent of our patients. Access CAMH is already averaging 1,600 referrals a month. The success stories are already pouring in. One mother felt lost in the system as she tried desperately to research her son's complex mental illness. She called Access CAMH, and connected with a staff person with immediate answers. \"It's great to get a live person to talk to,\" she told us. Another man contacted Access CAMH after struggling with addictions for 10 years. He received support, a brief phone screen and an appointment\u2014 all in the same call. We are building care pathways around the clinical and social needs of our patients, ensuring the best care possible for patients with even the most complex illnesses. These Integrated Care Pathways mark an important next step in the evolution of clinical care, providing detailed guidance for each stage of recovery. Such a detailed plan is already helping treat major depression and alcohol dependence at the same time, and is attracting support from Health Quality Ontario, interest from other health centres, and international attention. Pathways are being developed for other illnesses, and will ensure continuity of care across the province.And through the Medical Psychiatry Alliance , we're developing an integrated model of care to address the complete health needs of the more than 1.3 million Ontarians currently suffering from both physical and mental illnesses. \"This Alliance is about putting mental health back into health care,\" says Dr. Benoit Mulsant , Executive Director of the Alliance and CAMH's Physician-in-Chief. \"We need to create a new model of clinical care that increases the life expectancy of a vulnerable population.\" The Alliance, a joint initiative by CAMH, the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, the Hospital for Sick Children and Trillium Health Partners, was created through a landmark $20-million investment from an anonymous donor, $20 million from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, and $20 million from the four founding institutions. A vision for better health The right care at the right time in the right place. That simple promise\u2014in fact, the first promise we make in our strategic plan, Vision 2020 \u2014is at the heart of everything we do at CAMH. CARE As Canada's leading hospital for mental health, CAMH is transforming the lives of patients across the lifespan through comprehensive care and innovative services that support healing and recovery.Half of all mental illnesses begin by the age of 14, and three-quarters by the mid-20s. This is a vital time in development.Care at a crucial time T hanks to a visionary $10-million gift, CAMH's Slaight Family Centre for Youth in Transition is developing early interventions key to setting young people on the path to fuller recovery. Inaugural director Dr. Aristotle Voineskos has a clear plan to develop the Slaight Centre into one of the world's leading clinical research centres for youth with mental illness. Under his leadership, the Centre has already created a Cognitive Adaptive Training project that gives young people with schizophrenia the tools they need to succeed beyond CAMH. Projects also include a study aimed at reversing\u2014 and possibly even preventing\u2014diabetes in youth with early on-set psychosis. The Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth and Family Mental Health is driving system-wide improvements for young people and their families. In early 2015, CAMH's McCain Centre's inaugural leaders were named, with Dr. Joanna Henderson taking the helm as Director and Gloria Chaim driving the community partnerships essential to the centre's work. As part of a collaboration with other Toronto centres, CAMH is embarking on the Optimizing Human Potential: Ontario Health Family Study. With generous support from Charles and Marilyn Baillie , the province-wide effort is aimed at giving children the best start in life. And we are working closely with youth across Canada to develop care that truly meets their needs. Our National Youth Advisory Committee is collaborating closely with researchers, service providers and young people age 13 to 24 to develop the right care at the right time for children and youth with mental illness and addiction.

It has virtually no side-effects, is painless and non-invasive, and shows potential in treating a range of mental illnesses. With rTMS already approved for adults with depression \u2014 thanks in large part to work performed at the Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention \u2014 researchers are now turning their attention to young people with the disorder. Brain stimulation has been shown to improve working memory performance in patients with schizophrenia, and is being tested as a possible treatment for anorexia. Early results of a CAMH study suggest brain stimulation even reduces cigarette cravings among smokers with schizophrenia; people with schizophrenia have smoking rates three to four times higher than that of the general population. Through her role as the inaugural O'Brien Scholar , established by David and Gail O'Brien , CAMH's Dr. Stephanie Ameis is in the midst of the world's first clinical trial exploring the use of rTMS in young people with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Brain stimulation may improve this population's ability to perform daily organizational tasks. After struggling with treatment-resistant depression for more than a decade, Gail Bellissimo received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at CAMH's Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention. It worked where nothing else had. Not surprisingly, brain stimulation is attracting support from donors who appreciate its tremendous potential. At CAMH's recent Breakthrough Challenge , the community demonstrated just how engaged it is in CAMH's leading brain stimulation work. Through the Challenge, which attracted thousands of online votes and raised $166,000 for CAMH, the public was invited to learn about the work of five researchers and vote for the CAMH scientist they thought most deserved support. Dr. Faranak Farzan's study of rTMS in young people with depression struck a chord with event attendees, earning her $10,000 in support generously donated by Jim and Sandi Treliving . Dr. Yona Lunsky was also awarded $5,000 in support from an anonymous donor for her study aimed at creating a better understanding of developmental disabilities and mental illness. The event was created by CAMH Engage , a dynamic group of young people committed to generating resources for research at CAMH. \"Through the Breakthrough Challenge, we connected researchers directly with the public and empowered them to convey the exciting potential of their research,\" explains Alex Tapscott , Breakthrough Challenge co-chair. \"The public really responded to that connection, and appreciated the opportunity to learn more about CAMH. It was a very interesting and unique way of raising funds for research.\"Revolutionizing care through brain stimulation From left: Gail Bellissimo receiving brain stimulation treatment.

Weinberger, Director and CEO of the Li eber Institute for Brain Development, BaltimoreDiscover 11 10 11DISCOVER Thanks to a $30-million investment from the Campbell Family, the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute is increasing our understanding of the causes of mental illness and addiction\u2014inspiring new hope for early diagnosis, better treatments and prevention of disabling illnesses. 10Research at CAMH is expanding the world's understanding of brain functioning in schizophrenia\u2014findings that could translate into better treatments for patients. chizophrenia is a complex mental illness characterized by hallucinations, delusions and disordered thinking, often emerging in the teens and early 20s. New treatments are needed urgently, as minimal innovation in drug development has been seen in 60 years. Dr. Joanne Knight, a Campbell Institute scientist, and her team have helped identify over 100 locations in the human genome associated with the risk of developing schizophrenia. The findings point to biological mechanisms and pathways that may underlie schizophrenia, and could lead to new approaches to treating it. \"The fact that we were able to detect genetic risk factors on this massive scale shows schizophrenia can be tackled by the same approaches that have already transformed our understanding of other diseases,\" explains Dr. Knight. A study by Campbell Institute scientist Dr. Aristotle Voineskos shows people who suffer from severe schizophrenia have different brain networks than those with milder schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or no mental illness. The findings confirm mounting evidence that schizophrenia is in fact more than one brain disorder. Finding a biological, brain-based indicator could help identify this group of patients when they first seek care for psychosis. Otherwise, it can take years to determine social disability through clinical observation, says Dr. Voineskos. Understanding the circuitry and function of the brain is leading to better treatment for schizophrenia. Dr. Fang Liu , also a Campbell Institute scientist, and her team have discovered a new drug target in the brain that may lead to better antipsychotic medications. The findings generate new hope for patients living with schizophrenia who might be deterred from taking medications that can cause slowed gait, tremors and stiffness. Dr. Liu's next step is to determine how the discovery can be translated into new treatments for patients. \"We are optimistic that our findings will lead to new and better options for treatments for schizophrenia, ultimately allowing individuals affected with schizophrenia to lead a better quality of life.\"New hope for patients with schizophrenia From left, Campbell Institute scientists Drs. Joanne Knight, Fang Liu and Aristotle Voineskos are leading research into schizophrenia.

Thanks to unprecedented support of almost $10 million over five years, CAMH is leading an exciting study that combines a painless brain stimulation treatment with memory and problem solving exercises in older adults. It is the largest-ever grant for Alzheimer's disease prevention in Canada. \"We're intervening at an earlier stage among people who do not have Alzheimer's dementia but are at high risk of developing it,\" says Dr. Benoit Mulsant , lead investigator of the study and a Campbell Institute scientist. The PACt-MD study combines transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with cognitive remediation\u2014activities aimed at improving brain function in daily tasks. The study is generously supported by the Brain Canada Foundation and the Chagnon Family , and could lead to treatments for people before Alzheimer's disease can damage the brain. In our new Brain Gym, CAMH is helping older adults exercise their brains. Housed in the Intergenerational Wellness Centre's Azniv Lochan Group Room , the tech-savvy space provides touch-screen tablets loaded with cognitive games proven to improve memory and executive function. The Brain Gym was created through gifts in the name of Mary Sparrer , who lived with Alzheimer's disease. Exercise for the mind With the Canadian population expected to include seven million seniors by 2021, there is an urgent need to develop better treatments for the challenges older adults face. Major breakthrough in depression research C ould brain inflammation play a role in depression? A study led by Campbell Institute scientist Dr. Jeffrey Meyer has found the most compelling evidence to date of a link between brain inflammation and depression\u2014 a discovery that has important implications for developing new treatments for this common and debilitating illness. Using a brain imaging technique called positron emission tomography (PET), researchers found the measure of brain inflammation in people experiencing clinical depression was increased by 30 per cent. Rates of inflammation were highest among those with the most severe depression. \"Previous studies have looked at markers of inflammation in blood, but this is the first definitive evidence found in the brain,\" said Dr. Meyer. Although inflammation is one way the brain protects itself, too much can be damaging. A growing body of evidence suggests inflammation plays a role in generating the symptoms of a major depressive episode such as low mood, loss of appetite and inability to sleep. The role inflammation played in clinical depression independent of any other physical illness was previously unknown. This discovery has important implications for developing new treatments for a significant group of people who suffer from depression. \"It provides a potential new target to either reverse the brain inflammation or shift to a more positive repair role, with the idea that it would alleviate symptoms,\" says Dr. Meyer.

Getting the right help at the right time can mean all the difference in their lives.\" To make that dream a reality, they're supporting a study of brain stimulation in young people with first-episode psychosis. Valerie, co-host of CAMH's Transforming Lives Awards and a Foundation board member, and Andy know first-hand the power of early intervention. Their daughter, Catherine, received care for anxiety at CAMH. \"Mental health is such an exciting frontier, but the amount we don't know is huge,\" Valerie says. \"Now is the time to come to the table \u2014 we have to support this research.\" Ron Brenneman has always been a big believer in science. He and his wife, Jan Brenneman , are now also big believers in Dr. James Kennedy . Having taken the guesswork out of treating schizophrenia, Dr. Kennedy is now developing personalized treatments for alcohol-use and depression, with Ron and Jan's support. Such a goal has a special importance to the Brennemans, whose son, Tyler, died after suffering from depression and alcohol-use disorder. \"Promising science has to be followed to find out where it leads, and this is at a very promising stage,\" Ron says. \"We're hopeful other people can be helped in the long run \u2014 and saved where our son could not be.\" \"I think any research that can help people like our son is something we would like to see pursued,\" adds Jan. \"We hope these resources can help move the research along more quickly.\" For Susan Caskey and John Francis , supporting efforts that get to the root of mental illness is the best way to have the greatest impact. They have created the Caskey/Francis Family Award in Clinical Research to drive the treatments of tomorrow while helping people through clinical care today. \"The big goal, of course, is to cure mental illness,\" says Susan, who sits on CAMH Foundation's Board of Directors and the hospital's Research Committee. \"We really believe that if we could prevent\u2014rather than simply treat \u2014 mental illness that we would be able to save so many more lives. If we could help people live healthier, happier lives through these research awards, that would be a wonderful goal attained.\"In search of tomorrow's breakthroughs Research is attracting enlightened supporters committed to driving new treatments. These are a few of their stories. Helping kids 'reach' their potential W hen 19-year-old Chelsea Leger-Watt first came to CAMH, she thought finishing high school\u2014never mind university\u2014 was far out of reach for her. \"I was really suicidal. I was really depressed,\" recalls Chelsea, who came to CAMH through the Gerald Sheff & Shanitha Kachan Emergency Department . \"I just felt like I was different than other people. I couldn't deal with things properly. Things would consume me; one thing would happen and it would just consume my life. I would be bedridden. I couldn't deal with my emotions properly. I was angry, sad. I had really bad relationships.\" Fortunately, Chelsea eventually landed in CAMH's REACH (Recovery and Education for Adolescents Choosing Health) Program, a day treatment program that is part of CAMH's Child, Youth and Family Service. Through REACH, young people 14 to 21 years old can earn high school credits while participating in treatment for mental illness and/or addictions. Classrooms are small, with no more than eight students per class. The students work closely with CAMH staff to manage their mental illness and substance dependence, as well as the often painful journey of adolescence. For teens like Chelsea, REACH represents a turning point. Through the program, young people work with teachers, social workers and other CAMH staff. \"At CAMH we say that everybody here is a teacher and everybody here is a student,\" says Raju Bains , manager of CAMH's Youth Addictions and Concurrent Disorders Service. \"This is what the REACH classroom exemplifies every day. There certainly have been some days when students have taught us, and other days where we might have taught them a thing or two, but we're always learning from each other.\" Having finished the REACH program, Chelsea is focusing her attention on her future, her ambitions high, and has even started university. \"Eventually I want to get my PhD in psychology, but first I'm going to do a major in mental health studies with a double minor in linguistics and environmental sciences.\" LEARN CAMH is changing the field of mental health through the professionals we train: generating new knowledge, innovating interprofessional practice and championing the role of patients and families as teachers. From left, REACH students Noah Marks, Aidan Crump, Shannie Hansa and Chelsea 16Learn 17 16P roviding exceptional care to a complex population is not enough for Kwasi Adu-Basowah , a nurse in CAMH's Complex Mental Illness Acute Crisis Unit . He wants that care to be even better. \"I've had an interest in mental health and addictions my whole life; I lived in a community where mental health issues and the stigma around it are prevalent,\" explains Kwasi. \"Nothing can explain the feeling of watching an acutely ill patient recover to the point where they are able to show their appreciation for the care provided.\" Thanks to the Barford Advanced Practice Nursing Scholarship , Kwasi is learning how he can improve the care he provides. The Scholarship is helping him pursue his Master of Nursing with a focus on leadership in health care policy from Ryerson University. Kwasi is one of three CAMH nurses awarded the scholarship last year, and nine since it was created in 2012 by the Ralph M. Barford Foundation and the John & Jocelyn Barford Foundation . It's another example of how education at CAMH is leading to better mental health care at CAMH and beyond. Touching tribute to an Activist, Educator In her life, Diana Capponi was a mental health activist, and an important public educator. She spoke frequently at workplaces and conferences, and taught the course Understanding the Experiences of People with Mental Health and Addiction Challenges at CAMH. It is fitting, then, that The Diana Capponi Client Education Fund has been established to further her vision to create opportunities for low-income patients who wish to pursue an education and realize their potential. Diana knew that meaningful employment is key to recovery\u2014and her vision continues in her name.

With content created for young people by young people, Thought Spot is empowering post-secondary students to take an active role in their mental health. In November 2014 the Thought Spot team hosted Hack-a-Thought, and invited students to design additional mobile solutions for Thought Spot. With 15 teams presenting designs over a weekend, the event was an exciting success. The winning entry, Check It!, allows students to access Thought Spot content on their smartphones, and even recommends activities that promote a healthy lifestyle.

CAMH is now meeting Ontario's increasing demand for psychiatric care, and it's doing so with dignity and respect. hanks to an outstanding $2.5-million philanthropic gift and significant government support, the Gerald Sheff & Shanitha Kachan Emergency Department opened in October 2014, doubling the space available for 24/7 care for people in crisis. The space is a crucial next step in CAMH's ongoing redevelopment and efforts to help more people recover faster. The new emergency department is a warm and welcoming space with improved privacy and comfort for acutely ill patients. Here, CAMH provides urgent care for some of the most seriously ill people in Ontario. The emergency department is now equipped with two waiting areas, allowing greater privacy and faster access for people in need of less acute care; double the number of patient interview rooms; a comfortable patient lounge area; a private quiet room for families; staff training spaces; and natural light in each room of an eight-bed emergency assessment unit. This renovation is the first phase of a two-part vision to expand and consolidate emergency services at CAMH's Queen Street location in the years ahead. \"Gerry and I are inspired by CAMH's vision for the future,\" says Shanitha Kachan . \"Bringing emergency services into the larger redevelopment at Queen Street and creating a safe and effective place for people in crisis is so important. We are privileged to be involved.\" \"Our government is pleased to support this important mental health initiative with a $4.2 million grant,\" says Dr. Eric Hoskins, Minister of Health and Long-Term Care . \"I commend CAMH staff, volunteers and donors for their commitment to improving the way Ontarians receive care when faced with mental health challenges. By investing in CAMH, Ontario is working to transform and strengthen mental health services, helping to connect people with the care they need.\" Shanitha and Gerald strongly support CAMH and its mission to create a world in which everyone believes that life is worth living. Gerald has joined CAMH Foundation's Breakthrough Campaign Cabinet to help drive philanthropic support for CAMH, and Shanitha is a Director on the CAMH Foundation Board. As part of her orientation, Shanitha devoted a full day to watching the CAMH team at work in the crowded emergency department, before the renovations began. This drives her passion for helping CAMH provide welcoming spaces for patients and, in this case, a more modern emergency department that matches the warmth and professionalism of CAMH staff. The emergency department redevelopment also received significant support from Goodmans LLP. Corporate support is important because it demonstrates that the community believes in the care we provide. With rising awareness of mental health, visits to the emergency department at CAMH have grown steadily, with 76 per cent more visits in 2014 than in 2006. \"Let me be clear: more people coming in for help is a good thing,\" says CAMH President & CEO Dr. Catherine Zahn . \"Thanks to the generosity of our donors and the support of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, we now have the kind of welcoming, therapeutic space that patients and families in crisis deserve.\" TBuilding a better hospital From left, Dr. Catherine Zahn, CAMH President and CEO; Han Dong, MPP Trinity-Spadina; Toronto Louise Gregersen, President and CEO, CAMH Foundation.Build Build & CAMH FOUNDATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014/15 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014/15 21 20 21 Warm and welcoming spaces Providing help beyond the walls of CAMH W hen Liza Mauer thinks about her decision to support women's mental health at CAMH, she thinks of a girl in her neighbourhood who suffered from depression and died by suicide. It's a tragic story like so many, and one that touched Liza deeply, saddened her teenage daughters and shocked the community in which they live. \"There are so many girls out there like this girl, and they need to be able to walk into CAMH and see the right doctor who can reach them, right away,\" Liza says. \"Women and girls need a place that understands them better, a place that is more welcoming\u2014 a place for them.\" Liza and her husband, Andrew Sheiner , are helping create that space through their generous support of the Women's Complex Mental Illness inpatient unit. The unit will be an important part of CAMH's new Complex Care Building, with construction set to begin by early 2017 and occupancy by early 2020. The Complex Care Building will feature units for longer-stay patients and outpatient services, as well as an auditorium, a library, a student centre, and a patient and family mental health education resources and support centre. The Complex Care Building will also be home to the Dual Diagnosis unit, being created with generous support from The Harold E. Ballard Foundation . Here, people with intellectual disabilities as well as mental illness will receive the care they need.CAMH's ongoing transformation will also include our new Acute Care Building, which will be home to our new 24/7 emergency department, inpatient units for more acute patients, Access CAMH, a Partial Hospital Program and a Transitional Age Youth Day Program. CAMH's ongoing transformation reflects society's changing approach to mental illness and addiction. \"With community support, CAMH is creating spaces in which people can feel more comfortable and are treated with respect. For many people, CAMH becomes their home,\" Liza says. \"I become very inspired when I see and hear what my peers are accomplishing through philanthropy. It often pushes me to go further, dig deeper and work harder to make a bigger statement in a positive way.\" T he Toronto Justice Service Collaborative, comprising representatives from over 40 justice and social service organizations and facilitated by CAMH, is working with the Reintegration Centre to help men leaving Toronto South Detention Centre start fresh. The service and referral hub is the first of its kind in Canada and could help this population avoid reoffending, says Stephanie Gloyn , CAMH's Regional Implementation Coordinator of the Toronto Collaborative. The Toronto Justice Service Collaborative is just one of 18 Service Collaboratives set up by CAMH across Ontario as part of the Province's Mental Health and Addiction Strategy. Focused on addressing local gaps in services, the collaboratives improve transitions for children, youth and adults who experience mental illness and addictions. In Lanark, Leeds and Grenville, the focus is on keeping children and youth out of the justice system through an early intervention program. Called Intersections, the program brings together police and community organizations to redirect young people before they travel too far down the wrong path. In London, the local Service Collaborative is improving support for children and youth as they transition from the pediatric emergency department to community mental health services. From Thunder Bay to Kingston, CAMH is helping local mental health service providers access high-quality resources, education and consultations for people in need of specialized mental health care. Moving from incarceration into the community can be a difficult transition, especially for people with mental illness or addictions. Through a unique collaboration with justice and social service organizations, CAMH is helping men in this situation find housing, employment, and mental health and addictions support.

Through the Breakthrough Campaign, together we will usher in a bold new era in mental health.\" As the largest-ever campaign for mental health in Canada, Breakthrough was immediately embraced by Canada's philanthropic leaders when it was launched in June 2014. This year alone, 4,000 new donors have joined CAMH's efforts to improve mental health care. Breakthrough has attracted a tremendous range of supporters, from visionary donors and members of the Michael Wilson Society to monthly donors. The campaign's early success echoes Canadians' understanding that now is the time to support mental health. Through Breakthrough, we will uncover the causes of mental illness, revolutionize treatment and prevention, redefine attitudes toward mental illness and offer new hope for the millions of Canadians who live with mental illness. We will continue to build and renew our hospital and our community. Through Breakthrough, we will create a world in which everyone deserves to believe that life is worth living. The next breakthroughs in mental health will happen here \u2014 at CAMH. Igniting action to create meaningful social changeA breakthrough milestone S cientists in CAMH's Social and Epidemiological Research department work in the community, gathering knowledge to inform prevention and service delivery strategies. \"Stigma is a barrier to people seeking help,\" says CAMH Senior Scientist Dr. Carolyn Dewa , who focuses her research on workplace mental health. Her recent survey shows nearly four in 10 workers wouldn't tell their boss if they had a mental illness. \"Yet workers with depression who receive treatment are more productive than those who don't.\" CAMH's unique mobile research lab travels to remote and disadvantaged communities\u2014places often overlooked by researchers\u2014to assess stress and mental health. This year the lab visited Aamjiwnaang First Nation near Sarnia to learn how the system of services for mental illness, substance use and violence could work better to help community members. CAMH's population-based research is influencing public policy. Our Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey has revealed the emergence of certain high-risk behaviours; the alarming number of young people who acknowledged texting while driving is leading to tougher penalties for distracted driving. For the first time, we began tracking suicide ideation using the CAMH Monitor, our ongoing survey of Ontario adults, and results showed more than 230,000 of them seriously contemplated suicide in the last year. Other worrying trends included significant increases in cannabis use, in daily alcohol use, and in self-reported poor mental health, especially among young people 18 to 29 years old. Evidence points to the need for more support from family, friends and health professionals when it comes to the overall well-being of youth transitioning to adulthood. Population education and bold public awareness campaigns like camh Darkness to Light \u2014the all-night challenge to defeat mental illness\u2014 shone a light on mental illness and stigma at the same time. With thousands of people participating, the all-night challenge resonated strongly with the community, drawing corporate support from Boston Pizza, Red Apple Stores and Steeped Tea , and attracting hundreds of participants as individuals, on teams, and through school and community groups. CAMH's anti-stigma efforts are also being driven forward by our many community-based programs such as Gifts of Light, which raised more than $700,000 last year and continues to expand, our growing list of Michael Wilson Society members, and through our more than 3,800 new monthly donors. Changing attitudes is a giant step toward better mental health. CAMH is driving social change by raising awareness and understanding of mental illness and addiction, breaking down the stigma surrounding them and promoting an inclusive society.CAMH's Breakthrough Campaign has reached an exciting milestone\u2014 $125 million raised toward our $200 million goal.

Gaby Abraham Holden AdamsAdreinne Anderson & & CAMH FOUNDATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014/1536Hats off to tremendous support I t's taking a really horrible thing, and saying we can make something good out of this,\" says Enza, co-founder of Hats On for Awareness. \"When I'm suffering, I just want to disappear; I don't want anyone to notice me, and hats would be good to become incognito. With the Hatsquerade, we flip that around; we wear the hat to show support for people with mental illness.\" The idea is simple \u2014 upwards of 400 guests attend the Hatsquerade Gala Fundraiser each year, donning wonderful and creative hats to raise mental health awareness and funds. As one of CAMH's largest annual third-party events, it has already contributed a remarkable $270,000 to CAMH since 2009, helping create the Hats On for Awareness Volunteer Lounge and the Giovanni Tiberi Patient Room in Geriatrics at CAMH. Organizers are now hoping to make Hats On a national effort. \"We are thrilled with the amount of funds we have already raised for CAMH, and are so appreciative of all our donors and campaign contributors. This is only the tip of the iceberg,\" says Benny Caringi , co-founder of Hats On for Awareness. \"We've been successful because we have maintained a grassroots approach within our community. We'll maintain that grassroots approach as we expand across the country.\" Hats On for Awareness means a lot of things to Enza Tiberi-Checchia . It's a way to remember her own father, who died by suicide nearly 27 years ago. It's a creative venue for showing support for the many people who live with mental illness, including Enza herself, and a way to generate funds for CAMH.
