Objectives This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows: To assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicine (CM) for immunological function in women with breast cancer or a history of breast cancer when CM is compared with no treatment, placebo, conventional therapies, acupuncture or other forms of alternatives defined in the review. We will also assess adverse effects resulting from CM intervention. Background Description of the condition Historically, breast cancer has not been regarded as an immunogenic disease, however there is an increasing awareness of the relationship between the immune system and breast cancer. In recent studies, the presence of tumourinfiltrating lymphocytes (a subtype of white blood cells) may have prognostic significance and predictive value in breast cancer care ( [Gingras 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0011); [Rooijen 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0026); [SantaMaria 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0027)). A prospective study that observed 77 women for a 13year period, found that immunity markers were a better predictor of breast cancer recurrence and survival than the traditionally used markers of cancer stage, grade and lymph node involvement ( [Mccoy 2000](#CD013144-bbs2-0020)). A malignant tumour often develops mechanisms during its growth to evade surveillance of the immune system and the immune system's response might be compromised in people with cancer ( [Hamilton 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0014)). For women with a history of breast cancer (had a diagnosis of breast cancer and are now cured or in remission), breast cancer recurrence, metastasis (spread to other parts of the body), or a new primary occurrence, remain constant threats throughout their lifetimes and it is proposed that the immune system plays a critical role in the prevention of may promote tumour growth as well as mediate the eradication of disease ( [CiminoMathews 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0005); [Huang 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0016)). Conventional chemotherapy usually acts by targeting rapidly dividing cells, including cells of the immune system, rather than acting selectively on malignant cells, and this results in transiently compromised immunity ( [Hamilton 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0014); [Tong 2000](#CD013144-bbs2-0032)). Chemotherapyrelated toxicity usually manifests as a reduction in the number of immune cells (known as immune effectors) in peripheral blood in addition to suppression of the bone marrow ( [Carson 2004](#CD013144-bbs2-0003)). An impaired immune system in women with breast cancer exposes them to a higher risk of infection as a result of neutropenia (i.e. low levels of a type of white blood cell neutrophils), and this may affect women's compliance with their scheduled cancer treatments, and potentially lead to the discontinuation of lifesaving therapy. An understanding of the complete role of the immune system in breast cancer is still at the early stages of development ( [Ravelli 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0024)). Although some immunotherapeutic drugs have been developed, the toxicity is significant ( [SantaMaria 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0027)). Safe, less invasive and effective alternatives that benefit the immune system and improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy are needed. Improved diet, physical activity and a positive psychological influence are considered as markers for increased immunity and also for a reduction in recurrence in women with breast cancer in general ( [Goodwin 2001](#CD013144-bbs2-0012); [Gandini 2000](#CD013144-bbs2-0010); [MorenoSmith 2010](#CD013144-bbs2-0021)). Description of the intervention Chinese medicine (CM) is one of the most popular alternative and complementary therapies ( [Tindle 2005](#CD013144-bbs2-0031)), with a history of practice that exceeds 2000 years. It has a clear and systematic approach to the management of many clinical conditions, including cancer or cancer treatmentrelated conditions. The practice of CM is within the framework of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) which operates under a different theoretical paradigm to the dominant paradigm of Western biomedical science ( [Zhu 2009](#CD013144-bbs2-0040)). TCM is a holistic method, where each symptom is defined in relationship with other symptoms and within the context of the whole patient. This differs from western medicine, where different symptoms or body parts can be viewed independently. The practice of TCM has significantly permeated a broad crosssection of western communities ( [Zhu 2009](#CD013144-bbs2-0040)). The forms of CM preparations are varied; from traditional raw herbs made into a decoction (a concentrated liquor), pills, liniments, plasters and ointments to concentrated powder and liquid extracts prepared by modern pharmaceutical procedures. The routes of administration can range from oral to topical (i.e. surface application), from intravenous to injections into specific acupuncture points. Practitioners may choose to select a single herb or a complex formula consisting of a few herbs or more than 12 herbal ingredients. A standard approach involves use of a formula that is not tailored to individual needs and remains unchanged throughout the whole period of the clinical intervention. Conversely, an individualised approach requires prescription of different formulae customised specifically for different individuals, or modifications of a basic formula during different stages of clinical intervention to respond to clinical changes. This is one of the underpinning theoretical constructs of TCM and a number of complementary therapies ( [Zhu 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0041)). A number of studies have observed an impact of CM on the immune system when herbs alone are used either in preparation for chemotherapy, or in women with advanced breast cancer who are no longer suitable for conventional invasive therapies ( reported that when a modified classic Chinese herbal formula was used five days prior to chemotherapy in a group of 27 women with breast cancer, the activities of natural killer (NK) cells which limit spread of certain tumour types and the lymphocyte transformation rate were significantly improved compared to a group of 24 women who received chemotherapy alone. [Zhang 2010](#CD013144-bbs2-0038) found the levels of T cells (part of the immune system; specifically, CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+) were improved after using a Chinese herbal formula in a group of 35 women with various types of breast cancer compared with a group of 35 women who did not use the formula. CD3+, CD4+ CD8+ are classes of T cells that provide a central role in cellmediated immunity, including a homeostatic (stabilising) role in suppressing excessive immune responses ( [D'Acquisto 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0007)). How the intervention might work CM is currently used in public hospitals in China and clinics in other countries ( [Kim 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0018); [Sun 2002](#CD013144-bbs2-0030)). A group of researchers in Taiwan found that a CM formula was more effective than a placebo on cellular immunity and reduced toxicityrelated conditions in women with breast cancer ( [Zhuang 2012](#CD013144-bbs2-0043)). The findings suggested that the herbs might ease or delay occurrence of a reduction in white blood cells and subtypes (i.e. leucocytes and neutrophils); the latter is known as neutropenia and is a serious complication of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The concentration of NK and CD+4 cell counts were also reduced in a trial when women received a similar herbal medicine while being treated with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy ( [Zhuang 2009](#CD013144-bbs2-0042)). Emerging evidence suggests that the leukocyte/lymphocyte immune profile in breast cancer is associated with clinical outcomes, including survival ( [Coventry 2015](#CD013144-bbs2-0006); [Oluboyo 2014](#CD013144-bbs2-0022)). In a small observational study by [Dong 2008](#CD013144-bbs2-0008), it was found that a formula of CM may alleviate abnormal levels of white blood cell subtypes (i.e. Tcell subsets), NK cells and the ratio of CD4+:CD8+, which indicates that the immunity functions in women with breast cancer had improved immediately after chemotherapy. A randomised placebocontrolled trial echoed this research finding, but with a different CM formula ( [Zhang 2008](#CD013144-bbs2-0037)). The anticancer properties of a traditionally used CM, Ganoderma (fungus), has been recently studied in preclinical models. A fungal immunomodulatory protein from Ganoderma Tsugae in Sf21 insect cells (FIPgts) one of the most widely cultivated species of the Ganoderma genus has shown a close association with display antitumour functions ( [Cao 2006](#CD013144-bbs2-0002)). Some preclinical studies have demonstrated that CM may contain compounds that exhibit anticancer effects by inhibiting the growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells ( [Zhou 2007](#CD013144-bbs2-0039)). However, CM formulation is usually a mixture of raw herbs comprising multiple compounds. A single herbal ingredient may contain many chemical compounds. These multiple, biologically active components of CM may regulate multiple targets for a cluster of medical indications ( [You 2013](#CD013144-bbs2-0035)). Hence it is not surprising that the mechanisms of CM on immunity in women with breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer have remained largely unknown. Why it is important to do this review Many people with cancer or cancer survivors use CM and an Australian survey on women with breast cancer reported that one of the objectives of using CM was to boost the immune system ( [Kremser 2008](#CD013144-bbs2-0019)). To date, there has been a lack of scientific or empirical evidence to support the claim. A few systematic reviews involving women with a history of breast cancer have been conducted of these reviews had a general interest, with only a few emphasising the effects on the immune system ( [Chen 2009](#CD013144-bbs2-0004); [Yang 2004](#CD013144-bbs2-0033); [Zhang 2008](#CD013144-bbs2-0037)). It will be scientifically valuable to conduct a systematic review of the available clinical data and appraise the quality of these studies. This would provide a valuable insight into potential therapeutic alternatives for strengthening immunological functions in women with breast cancer or at risk of breast cancer recurrence. The fundamental theories and approaches of CM determine contemporary scientific research in the field. Therefore, it is our intention to follow scientific approaches rigorously, while fully respecting the traditional philosophies and practice of Chinese medicine for this systematic review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicine (CM) for immunological function in women with breast cancer or a history of breast cancer when CM is compared with no treatment, placebo, conventional therapies, acupuncture or other forms of alternatives defined in the review. We will also assess adverse effects resulting from CM intervention. Methods Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies We will include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) considering Chinese medicine (CM) for immunological functions in women with breast cancer or a history of breast cancer. We will verify and confirm the status of RCTs through contacting the authors of the primary studies. We will include crossover trials in the review if unpaired data are available. Clusterrandomised trials will also be included if they have adjusted for clustering in their analysis and can be combined with RCTs that randomise by individual. We will exclude quasirandomised trials. We will impose no restrictions concerning year of publication. We may translate studies published in languages other than Chinese and English, if necessary, with the resources available. Types of participants Women over 18 years old, diagnosed with breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer, regardless of tumour type, stage or type of cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy or palliative treatment). Participants may have been receiving treatment, be in longterm followup, or in remission receiving no conventional treatment, or receiving palliative care. We will exclude studies that include women with breast cancer with no assessment of their immunological functions. Types of interventions Experimental interventions The main intervention (CM) can include a single Chinese medicine ingredient or a comprehensive Chinese medicine formula including standardised formulae and individualised formulae. The intervention may be administered orally, topically, intravenously or by injection. Eligible forms of intervention may include decoction and extraction (in a form of powder, pills, tablets and plaster). The types of ingredients may include plants, fungi, minerals and animal ingredients. We will include CM that may be used alone or as a cointervention alongside conventional therapies, provided that the control group receive the same conventional therapies, and the only difference between the two groups will be whether they received CM. We will exclude trials of different CM formulations in the comparator arm. Comparator interventions Eligible comparators will include placebo, no intervention, any conventional therapies, or any other forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as yoga, Tai Qi (i.e. Tai Chi, a form of mindbody exercise), dietary therapy, and so forth. Comparisons - Any Chinese medicine versus placebo - Any Chinese medicine versus no treatment - Any Chinese medicine versus conventional therapies - Any Chinese medicine versus acupuncture - Any Chinese medicine versus any diet, exercise, or psychological management. Cointerventions either in the experimental or comparator arm may include placebo, conventional therapies, acupuncture or other forms of therapies as long as it is designed in parallel. Types of outcome measures Primary outcomes - Any alteration of immunologic parameters in relation to immunesurveillance and immuneediting processes in breast cancer. This will be evaluated by percentage or absolute concentration (count) of lymphocytes including Tcells (tumour specific such as Tcells infiltrating leukocyte/lymphocyte (TIL) immune profile including CD4+ and CD8+, ratio of CD4+:CD8+) and/or natural killer cells (NK cells) Secondary outcomes - Other immunologic indicators, evaluated by percentage or absolute concentration (count) of other subsets of Tcells and associated cytokines, cytotoxic T cells, chemokines, Bcells and regulatory T cells. - Adverse events related to: - conventional therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anticancer hormonal treatment, targeted therapy (i.e. to see if CM causes an increase or decrease or no impact in the adverse events from the cancer treatment(s)) - CM, including incidence of adverse events evaluated by types and frequency. - Any unfavourable and unintended outcomes (including abnormalities in laboratory or clinical findings). We will assess data at four weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 48 weeks, if possible. We will also assess different time points for each comparison, such as CM during cancer treatment, CM in between sessions of treatment (e.g. radiotherapy or chemotherapy) or CM after treatment. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches We will search the following databases: - the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's (CBCG's) Specialised Register. The process of identifying studies and coding references are outlined in the CBCG's website (https://breastcancer.cochrane.org/sites/breastcancer.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/specialised_register_details.pdf). Trials coded with the key medicine' will be extracted and considered for inclusion in the review. - MEDLINE (via OvidSP) (from 2017 until present), see [Appendix 1](#CD013144-sec2-0008); OvidSP) (from 2017 until present), see [Appendix 2](#CD013144-sec2-0009); - CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, latest issue), see [Appendix 3](#CD013144-sec2-0010); - The World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) for all prospectively registered and ongoing trials, see [Appendix 4](#CD013144-sec2-0011); - Clinicaltrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), see [Appendix 5](#CD013144-sec2-0012); - China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), one of the most commonly used electronic Chinese databases, see [Appendix 6](#CD013144-sec2-0013). We will handsearch conference papers relating to breast cancer and immunity with CM, including the Euro Breast Cancer Summit, the Global Breast Cancer Conference, the AsiaPacific Breast Cancer Summit and the Australian Society for Breast Disease Conference. Searching other resources Bibliographic searching We will try to identify further studies from reference lists of identified relevant trials or reviews. We will obtain a copy of the full article for each reference reporting a potentially eligible trial. Where this is not possible, we will make attempts to contact authors to request additional information. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Selection of studies will be undertaken by two reviewers (XZ and YX). XZ will screen the titles and abstracts of articles found in the search, and discard studies that are clearly ineligible, but will aim to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. YX will obtain copies of the full text articles and make copies for XZ, striking out details of the authors and institutions and removing the results section. Independently, both reviewers will assess whether the studies meet the inclusion criteria, and resolve disagreements by discussion. We will seek further information from the authors when papers contain insufficient information to enable assessment for eligibility. We will record any excluded studies in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. Studies published in languages other than Chinese and English may be translated, if necessary, with available resources. The number of records retrieved and studies analysed in the review will be recorded in the PRISMA flow diagram. Data extraction and management All data extraction and risk of bias assessments will be performed independently by the two review authors (XZ and YX). They will extract data onto a predeveloped data extraction sheet to assess study characteristics, including the location of the study, methods of the study (as per the quality assessment checklist), participants (age range, eligibility criteria), nature of the interventions, data relating to the outcomes specified above, and funding and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors. They will also extract information relevant to CM including ingredients, formulations, dosages, routes of administration, and duration of the interventions for analysis. Any discrepancies will be resolved by a third review author (DP). When aspects of methodology are unclear, or where the data are in a form that is not suitable for metaanalysis, we will seek additional information about the trial methodology or the original trial data from the principal author of those trials that appear to meet the eligibility criteria. When a study has more than one publication, we will check all papers for data and try to ensure that the data set is complete as possible and avoids double counting of data. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies We will assess risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' took, as described in the Chapter 8.5, Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( [Higgins 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0015)), to assess the following domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and providers, blinding of outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of bias. Two authors (XZ and YX) will assess these seven domains, with any disagreements resolved by consensus or by discussion with a third author (DP). All judgments will be fully described and the conclusions will be presented in the 'Risk of bias' figures and will be incorporated into the interpretation of review findings. The risk of bias for each domain will be graded as high, low or unclear, as shown below - Sequencing generation; - Allocation concealment; - Blinding of participants and personnel; - Blinding of outcome assessors; - Incomplete outcome data; - Selective outcome reporting; and - Other bias In addition to the abovementioned biases, we also considered industry, academic, or other bias that could be detected. - Low risk of other bias: the trial appeared to be free of any risk of bias. - Uncertain risk of bias: the trial may or may not have been free of any risk of bias. - High risk of other bias: there were other factors in the trial that could lead to a risk of bias; for example, if a study was under support of herb industrial funding/grants. If risk of bias is assessed as 'low' in all the above domains, we will judge the trial as being at low risk of bias. For assessments of either 'uncertain' or 'high' across domains, we will judge the trial as being at a high risk of bias. We will present other aspects of study quality, including the extent of blinding (if appropriate), the extent of loss to followup, noncompliance, whether the outcome assessment was standardised, and whether an intentiontotreat (ITT) analysis was undertaken in the 'Risk of bias' table and provide a context for discussing the reliability of the results. We will incorporate these quality assessments into the interpretation of the results. Measures of treatment effect We will perform statistical analysis in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( [Higgins 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0015)). Dichotomous data It is likely that some of the studies reporting the primary outcomes will be reported as dichotomous data, such as the number of women who had changes in the defined immunologic parameters. Other immunologic indicators defined as secondary outcomes will be assessed and reported as dichotomous data as well. For example, when neutropenia (the low levels of neutrophils) as one of the adverse events caused by either chemotherapy or CM is assessed, absolute rick reduction (ARR, also known as rick difference) will be calculated based on the numbers of participants reporting neutropenia. Where possible, we will derive the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or harm (NNTH) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We will present dichotomous outcomes in terms of both raw numbers and percentages of participants in each study arm benefiting from the intervention or suffering from adverse events. Continuous data Usually, any alteration of immunologic parameters in relation to immunesurveillance and immuneediting process in breast cancer will be evaluated as continuous data such as by the percentage or absolute concentration (count) of lymphocytes. If the incidence of adverse events from CM is evaluated by the frequency of any unfavourable and unintended outcomes, such as an abnormality in laboratory readings, we will treated this as a continuous data set. For continuous outcome data, we will express results from each study as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs. It is anticipated that different scales may be used to report the same outcomes, in which case we will use the standardised mean difference (SMD). Unit of analysis issues We will analyse dichotomous outcomes for each woman randomised (e.g. number of women with an adverse effect/total number of women randomised). We will treat the data so that participants from individual trials are included only once in each comparison. Dealing with missing data We will contact all study authors by phone or email to obtain any missing participant data. We will record the date of contact. If we are unable to obtain missing data, we will base analyses on participant populations in which outcomes are reported. We will note discrepancies between the number of women enrolled and number of women in whom outcomes were reported in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. Where studies report statistics based on ITT or modified ITT populations, we will perform available case analyses ( [Higgins 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0015)). We will discuss the impact of missing data in the 'Discussion' section of the review. We will make a judgement on how it impacts on the risk of bias and determine whether or not to incorporate results from poor quality or potentially biased studies. Assessment of heterogeneity We will consider heterogeneity when clinical and methodological characteristics of included studies are suitable for a metaanalysis. We will perform statistical analyses in accordance with Cochrane guidelines ( [Higgins 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0015)). We will identify heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots and by using a standard Chi2 test and an alpha significance level of 0.1. We will examine heterogeneity (variation) between the results of different studies specifically by using the I2 statistic (a quantity that describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error), which can be interpreted as follows: - 0% to 40%: might not be important; - 30% to 60%: represents moderate heterogeneity; - 50% to 90%: represents substantial If I2 is between 50% and 85%, we will use the randomeffects model for analysis. If I2 is greater than 85%, we will not perform metaanalysis. We will perform predetermined subanalyses according to subsets of breast cancer (for example, luminal A and luminal B) in order to explore the cause(s) of heterogeneity. Assessment of reporting biases We aim to minimise the potential impact of reporting bias by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies, including the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov, and by being alert to the duplication of data. If there are 10 or more studies in an analysis, we will use a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small study effects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies). Data synthesis Our primary analysis will employ a randomeffects model, with sensitivity analysis using a fixedeffect model, using Review Manager 5 software ( [Review Manager 2014](#CD013144-bbs2-0025)). When data from primary studies are sufficiently similar, we will combine them using a randomeffects model. We will analyse dichotomous outcomes using the MantelHaenszel method. For continuous outcomes, we will use the inversevariance method. We will display an increase or decrease in the risk of a particular outcome which may be beneficial or detrimental through forest plots in the metaanalyses. We will display an increase in the risk of an outcome to the right of the centre line and a decrease in the risk of an outcome to the left of the centre line. We will not combine study results by means of metaanalysis when there is substantial clinical, methodological or statistical heterogeneity, but instead will summarise them in narrative form. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Where data are available, subgroup analyses will be conducted to determine if effectiveness of CM is influenced by: - different subtypes of breast cancer, for example, luminal A and luminal B; - different phrases of treatment, such as during chemotherapy/radiotherapy in combination with the conventional therapies, or CM used alone when no conventional therapies are available. Sensitivity analysis We will undertake sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of the results in relation to a number of factors relating to the way the study was performed. This may include: - studies of different overall methodological quality which will be assessed by the GRADE approach, with trials of high quality (low risk of bias) compared to all trials; - publication bias by country: if publication bias is present, trials from countries where there is a greater publication bias will be excluded; - reanalysis using the fixedeffects model; - exclusion of crossover studies. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence We will use the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence emerging from retrieved studies at the review stage ( [Schunemann 2011](#CD013144-bbs2-0028)). The main outcomes will be: - any alteration of immunologic parameters in relation to immunesurveillance and immuneediting processes in breast cancer, specifically, percentage and absolute concentration (count) of TIL and/or NK cells; - adverse events by treatment group, including rating of the likelihood that the adverse event arose from treatment (where provided); and - adverse events by CM group, including rating of the likelihood that the adverse event arose from CM intervention (where provided) We will assess the certainty of the evidence of our results using GRADE software (i.e. [GRADEproGDT](#CD013144-bbs2-0013)), which will also prepare the 'Summary of findings' table.
