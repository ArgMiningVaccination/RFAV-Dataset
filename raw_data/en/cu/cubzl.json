In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) the causes of the disease could be liver-Qi stagnation, spleendeficiency, kidney-Yin-deficiency and kidney-Yang-insufficiency. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that to successfully treat chloasma you need to look for the roots of the problems, not only the symptom. Methods: Over two case reports, the first being a 42-year-old woman who sought Acupuncture treatment for chronic headache and had the doctor notice the skin stains disseminated on her face, especially in the cheeks area. The second case, a 48-year-old man with constant knee pain was on Acupuncture treatment, and at his physical examination, there was found several dark patches on his face. Both patients were diagnosed with energy imbalance (Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood) and were treated with Acupuncture sessions associated with Chinese dietary counseling. Results: Both patients had a significant improvement of the chloasma patches, even thought that wasn't the main cause of complaint. This overall recovery was achieved with the treatment of the patient in a holistic aspect, because when the energy imbalance that is causing problems is cared for, all the physical and/or emotional symptoms of one or several medical specialties improve at the same time. Conclusion: The treatment of chloasma in TCM has a different point of view from Western medicine, by treating deeply the root cause of the problem in its energy level. Each patient has their own imbalance and the treatment must be individualized to have successful results.
