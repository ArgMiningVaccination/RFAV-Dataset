Western-trained doctors pronounced her incurable. Her father sought out the most renowned TCM doctor in the area, hoping for an alternative. He vowed to Guan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy, that if his daughter's life was saved, he would send her to study Traditional Chinese Medicine to serve the world. Under the care of TCM Doctor Ding Jie Wan, she recuperated from the illness. As promised, her father sent her to study at the Chinese Medical Institute of Shanghai. In 1935, she became one of the first female graduates in medicine. In 1974, Doctor Bing Yin Lee brought her decades of valuable clinical experience to the United States, where she opened a practice in San Francisco's Chinatown. Highly motivated, she completed her PhD at the San Francisco College of Acupuncture in 1984, and became one of the first licensed acupuncturists in California. \"It is my family's honor to carry on the passion my grandmother instilled in us for Chinese herbs\" Wilson Lau - Nuherbs Co.
