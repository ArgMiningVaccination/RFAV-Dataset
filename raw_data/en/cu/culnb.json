Public health surveillance, as defined by the W orld Health Organization, includes the systematic collection, collation, and analysis of data coupled with the timely dissemination of information for assessment and public health response. Integral to its public health mandate, the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) is committed to sharing valuable information obtained through its active surveillance of rare conditions in children and youth in Canada. Key results of CPSP multi-year studies and one-time surveys are published in this annual report. These results highlight important findings and inform health professionals, researchers, and policy makers in developing strategies to improve the health of children and youth in Canada. Suggested citation Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program 2022 Results. Ottawa (ON): Canadian Paediatric Society; 2023.The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) produces Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Tips of the Month that alert participants of new information regarding potential adverse drug reactions, including advice on how to recognize and best manage such events to improve outcomes for children and youth. If you have seen an adverse drug reaction in your practice, please report the event as soon as possible to the CPSP . Case reports are valuable to the CPSP and Health Canada as they contribute to the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk profile of health products used in children and can thus result in changes to information in the product monograph and other risk mitigation measures.CPSP ADR Tips of the Month 3 CPSP 2022 RESULTSTable of Contents Foreword ....................................................................................................................................................... 4 Message from the Federal Minister of Health ........................................................................................... 4 Message from the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada ........................................................................ 5 Message from the President of the Canadian Paediatric Society ............................................................ 6 Message from the Chair of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program ............................................ 7 Acknowledgements ..................................................................................................................................... 8 Funding ......................................................................................................................................................... 8 Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program Scientific Steering Committee ......................................... 9 About the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program ............................................................................ 10 Overview .................................................................................................................................................... 10 Objectives .................................................................................................................................................. 10 Surveillance ................................................................................................................................................ 10 Process ...................................................................................................................................................... 10 Limitations of surveillance ......................................................................................................................... 11 Response rates .......................................................................................................................................... 11 Glossary of terms in study results ............................................................................................................. 12 International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units .......................................................................... 13 Surveillance Studies in 2022 ....................................................................................................................... 14 Acute flaccid paralysis ............................................................................................................................... 14 Adverse drug - serious and life-threatening .............................................................................. 16 Congenital syphilis ..................................................................................................................................... 19 First-time hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa during the COVID-19 pandemic ................................... 22 Hypoglycemia during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ........................................................... 25 Micronutrient deficiencies and autism spectrum disorder (final report) ................................................... 27 Optic nerve hypoplasia and septo-optic dysplasia (final Paediatric pulmonary (final report) .............................................................................. 35 Post-COVID-19 condition (long COVID) .................................................................................................... 37 Serious adverse events related to cannabis used for medical purposes (final report) ............................. 39 Serious and life-threatening events associated with non-medical (recreational) cannabis use in Canadian children and youth ...................................................................................... 41 Severe vaping-related illness and injury (final report) ................................................................................ 44 One-Time Surveys 46 Button battery ingestions ...........................................................................................................................

It is my pleasure to introduce the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) 2022 Results. This annual report captures the ongoing efforts of the CPSP in monitoring important paediatric health issues. Gathering essential information and developing studies on emerging and rare conditions affecting children and youth is key in helping health professionals, researchers, and policy makers understand and address the needs of young Canadians. A big thank you to the Canadian Paediatric Society, Health Canada, and the Public Health Agency of Canada for their continued commitment to improving the health and well-being of children and youth across the country. For more than 25 years, these organizations have worked together on this program which supports the development of better treatments, detection and prevention strategies, and ultimately, improves health outcomes for children in Canada. An example of the dedication to these goals is the program's ongoing surveillance pertaining to the long-term effects of COVID-19 on children's health, which could lead to the development of effective strategies to diagnose post-COVID-19 condition in children and youth. The success of these studies would not be possible without the dedication of the 2,800 paediatricians and subspecialists from across Canada who continually shared data and intelligence on many rare and emerging childhood conditions and diseases - thank you to each of you. As reiterated on February 7 th 2023 through our plan for improving health care for Canadians, our government is unwavering in our commitment to supporting children's mental and physical health. That is why we're investing in timely access to a family health team or provider, a sustainable health workforce, shorter wait times, better mental health, and a modernized health system. In addition, we are addressing immediate pressures in paediatric hospitals and emergency rooms, and long wait times for surgeries, which will directly benefit the health of children and youth in Canada. The well-being of our next generation is of utmost importance and that is why initiatives like the CPSP are critical to ensuring that children receive the best possible care. 5 CPSP 2022 RESULTSMessage from the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam I would like to thank those experts involved in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) and the Canadian Paediatric Society for their instrumental efforts to support the health and well-being of children and youth across the country. The CPSP would not be possible without the many paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists who have voluntarily contributed to the collection of data, despite competing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic and other continuing priorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the importance of having robust surveillance data to help identify, monitor and understand potential and emerging health threats quickly and effectively. In this regard, the CPSP provides valuable data on the incidence of rare and emerging childhood conditions in Canada. The data collected through the CPSP provides researchers with a better understanding of the risk factors, prevention practices, impacts and effectiveness of treatments for rare and emerging childhood conditions. This information supports health care providers in improving patient care and helps communities to build better prevention and support programs. This year's report captures the growing concern about post COVID-19 condition, as surveillance results reveal that it can also impact children and youth. The persistence of symptoms in some individuals can have significant impacts on physical, social and emotional well-being, and can affect the ability to carry out daily activities. This highlights the importance of continued monitoring and research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the need for appropriate care and support for those affected by post COVID-19 condition. It will be interesting to see the results of this ongoing surveillance in the coming years as more data are collected. Moreover, the CPSP is examining indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the incidence of first-time hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa throughout the pandemic and adverse events related to virtual care. These are some of the many diverse mental and physical health conditions captured by the surveillance system. The CPSP also continues to monitor other rare or emerging diseases and conditions, including serious adverse events related to recreational cannabis use, congenital syphilis and hypoglycemia during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. As Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, I commend the Canadian Paediatric Society on the release of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program 2022 Results report. It provides valuable insights into the state of child health in Canada and makes vital contributions to the health and future of our youngest people living in Canada. 6 CPSP 2022 RESULTSMessage from the President of the Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Mark Feldman I would like to thank my colleagues from across Canada who, despite working through the trials and tribulations that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on their practices, have continued to diligently and voluntarily report cases of rare conditions and emerging health concerns to the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). These efforts are so valuable, and so appreciated \u2014 the data collected is used to inform national clinical guidelines and to guide public health decisions and policies. Unsurprisingly, the unintended consequences of the pandemic continue to affect our children and youth. This impact can be seen in the interim study results on first-time hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa during the pandemic (page 22). The study shows that the pandemic was a precipitating factor in many hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa, and close to 40% of new admissions were among children 11 to 13 years of age. Despite eating disorders having one of the highest mortality rates of any mental health condition affecting children and youth, patients can fall through the cracks of paediatric care, as eating disorders are complex biopsychosocial illnesses that do not fit neatly into the silos of mental or physical health. Preliminary study results were included in the Canadian Paediatric Society's written submission to the Standing Committee on the Status of Women and support the need for urgent and dedicated action now. Other study and survey results, on topics such as congenital syphilis (page 19) and severe/life-threatening opioid, stimulant, or sedative use (page 52), demonstrate the many areas of child and youth health that must be prioritized in the coming years. The results from the CPSP study on serious and life-threatening events associated with non-medical cannabis use (page 41) have demonstrated that the most common primary case presentation continues to be poisoning and intoxication, involving mainly children less than 13 years of age and cannabis in edible form. These results were used to inform the Canadian Paediatric Society's written submission to the Cannabis Act legislative review . I urge all my fellow colleagues to take a moment to read the results that have been generated thanks to the time you have taken to report these cases. Again, this data goes a long way to helping us better understand the effects that these rare conditions and serious adverse events are having on the health of our children and youth. Armed with this information, we are better positioned to advocate for timely access to needed services and treatments. I also take this opportunity to thank our partners at the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada. Without their continued support and collaboration, this important work would not be possible. 7 CPSP 2022 RESULTSMessage from the Chair of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program Dr. Catherine Farrell First, I would like to thank my colleagues from across Canada for their continued dedication to reporting cases to the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). As busy paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists, I recognize that completing a CPSP clinical questionnaire(s) at the end of a busy workday isn't always a top priority; and yet, thanks to their efforts, the Program continues to achieve high response rates. In 2022, the CPSP initiated three new studies including post-COVID-19 condition, hypoglycemia during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and adverse events related to virtual care. In addition, four one-time surveys were sent to participants on the following topics: button battery ingestions; severe/life-threatening opioid, stimulant, or phototherapy; and adverse events among breastfeeding infants exposed to maternal cannabis use. I invite you to take some time to read through the various reports and learn about the key, and sometimes alarming, results. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Charlotte Moore Hepburn, who completed her term as the Canadian Paediatric Society's Director of Medical Affairs in 2022. Over the past seven years, she made many outstanding contributions to the CPSP . Her leadership, spirit of innovation, attention to detail, and tenacity allowed the Program to flourish, gain momentum, and acquire greater recognition, despite the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I extend a warm welcome to Dr. Sam Wong, who took on the role of Director of Medical Affairs in late 2022. I look forward to working with him in the years to come, aiming to ensure the CPSP continues its leadership in the areas of surveillance and research on rare paediatric conditions and diseases, and emerging issues of health concern for our children and youth. Finally, I would like to thank our partners at the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada for their continued support, leadership, and expertise. 8 CPSP 2022 RESULTSAcknowledgements FundingThe key strength of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) is its commitment to improve the health of children and youth in Canada and around the world. This focus would not be possible without the participation of Canadian paediatricians, subspecialists, and other health care providers in the monthly collection of information on rare paediatric conditions, the investigators who design studies and analyse the data to provide knowledge and educational solutions, or the guidance of the Scientific Steering Committee members. We thank them all. We also thank IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) centres for their role in verifying the acute flaccid paralysis study data and for their support of the CPSP . The strong partnership between the Canadian Paediatric Society, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and Health Canada allows the Program to grow in Canada and to take a leadership role on the international scene. Funding for the CPSP is required to support Program management. The surveillance Program is funded through a combination of government support and unrestricted grants from Canadian charities, research institutions, hospitals, and corporations. All funding is provided to maintain and expand the Program. We gratefully acknowledge the financial support received in 2022 from the Public Health Agency of Canada's Centre for Surveillance and Applied Research, Health Canada's Marketed Health Products Directorate, and the following non-governmental sources: Bethanys Hope Foundation CHEO Research Institute Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba sponsored studies grant from Novo Nordisk Inc.9 CPSP 2022 RESULTSCanadian Paediatric Surveillance Program Scientific Steering Committee Catherine Farrell, MD Canadian Paediatric Society (Chair) Jill Borland Starkes, MD Canadian Paediatric Society Peter Buck, DVM, MSc Centre for Food-borne, Environmental and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Public Health Agency of Canada Paul Dancey, MD Paediatric Chairs of Canada (Liaison) Marie Ad\u00e8le Davis, MBA Canadian Paediatric Society Elizabeth Donner, MD Canadian Association of Child Neurology (Liaison) Joanne Embree, MD IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) (Outgoing Liaison) Genevi\u00e8ve Gravel, MPH Centre for Communicable Diseases and Infection Control, Public Health Agency of Canada Sabrina Heyde, JD Consultant Melanie Laffin Thibodeau, BCom Canadian Joanna Lazier, MD Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (Liaison) Charlotte Moore Hepburn, MD Canadian Paediatric Society (Outgoing Medical Affairs Director) Shaun Morris, MD IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) (Incoming Liaison) Jay Onysko, MA Centre for Surveillance and Applied Research, Public Health Agency of Canada Stephen Parker, MPH Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases, Public Health Agency of Canada Jorge Pinzon, MD Canadian Paediatric Society Anne Rowan-Legg, MD Canadian Paediatric Society Chelsea Ruth, MD Canadian Paediatric Society Miriam Santschi, MD Canadian Paediatric Society Patrick Seitzinger, MD Canadian Paediatric Society (Resident Representative) Sam Wong, MD Canadian Paediatric Society (Incoming Medical Affairs Director) The CPSP Scientific Steering Committee expresses its sincere appreciation to Dr. Joanne Embree, who completed a six-year term on the Committee as the representative of Canada's Immunization Program ACTive (IMPACT). Her dedication and expertise on many complex issues, especially relating to immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, will be greatly missed by the Committee. We wish Dr. Embree the very best in her retirement. The CPSP Scientific Steering Committee extends a special thank you to Dr. Charlotte Moore Hepburn for her unwavering commitment to child and youth health, her dedication, and her expertise while serving as the CPSP Medical Affairs Director for the past seven years. Dr. Moore Hepburn embraced many opportunities to bring the Program to new heights, working with new partners and innovating methods for near real-time data collection. From the start of the pandemic, her leadership enabled data on children and youth hospitalized with COVID-19 and MIS-C to be shared biweekly with stakeholders at all levels, ensuring the best decisions could be made for our youngest citizens, in the face of much public health uncertainty. We wish Dr. Moore Hepburn the very best in all her future endeavors and we thank her once again for her commitment to the CPSP . 10 CPSP 2022 RESULTSOverview The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) is a joint project of the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Society that contributes to the improvement of the health of children and youth in Canada by national surveillance and research into childhood disorders that are high in disability, morbidity, and economic costs to society, despite their low frequency. The CPSP gathers data from approximately 2,800 paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists each month to monitor rare diseases and conditions in Canadian children. Objectives Maintain an active national surveillance system that monitors low-frequency, high-impact conditions and diseases in Canadian children and youth Involve paediatricians, paediatric subspecialists, and other medical professionals in related disciplines in the surveillance of rare conditions that are of public health and medical importance Generate new knowledge into rare childhood disorders to facilitate improvements in treatment, prevention, and health-care planning Respond rapidly to public health emergencies relevant to Canadian children and youth by initiating rapid one-time surveys and new studies Participate in international paediatric surveillance efforts through the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INOPSU) Surveillance The full surveillance process is summarized in Figure 1 and includes the 3Ds of surveillance: detection, deduction, and dissemination. Health surveillance can be defined as: the tracking of any health event or health determinant through the continuous collection of high-quality data (detection); the integration, analysis, and interpretation of the data (deduction) into surveillance products; and the dissemination of those surveillance products to those who need to know (dissemination). Process Study teams from across Canada are encouraged to submit proposals for new studies or one-time surveys that meet the \"criteria for submission,\" available on the CPSP website at www.cpsp.cps.ca/apply-proposez/criteria- for-inclusion-of-studies. The CPSP Scientific Steering Committee then reviews the proposals on a biannual basis and selects those of highest medical and public health importance. Proposals are evaluated against set criteria and are subject to comprehensive feedback from the multidisciplinary Scientific Steering Committee, composed of representatives from the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Paediatric Society, former CPSP investigators, academic clinicians from diverse specialties, and community paediatricians. Each month, CPSP participants from across Canada receive a form listing the current conditions under study. Participants notify the Program if they have seen any cases that meet the case definitions or have \"nothing to report.\" Participants are encouraged to report all cases, including suspect or probable cases. This sometimes leads to duplicate reporting but avoids missed cases. Participants who have seen a case are sent a detailed clinical questionnaire to complete and return to the CPSP . Once the detailed questionnaire is returned to the CPSP , it is stripped of all unique identifiers and sent to the investigators for data analysis. All notifications of potential cases are assessed against the case definition. Duplicates or cases that don't meet the case definition are excluded.About the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program Did you know? The CPSP celebrated its 26th anniversary in 2022. The CPSP is comprised of approximately 2,800 dedicated paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists. Since its inception, the CPSP has studied 85 rare conditions/diseases and initiated 59 one-time surveys. Over 85 peer-reviewed manuscripts on study/ survey results have been published in high- impact journals. The average monthly response rate is 80%. The average detailed questionnaire response rate varies between 80 to 90%. By December 2022, 97% of participants had committed to receiving their monthly forms electronically.CPSP Quick Facts Figure 1 - Surveillance process summary 11 CPSP 2022 RESULTS It is important to note that CPSP studies use anonymized data from patient charts; the study investigators have no direct contact with individual patients. The study team is responsible for data analysis, and for ensuring that a solid knowledge translation plan is in place to disseminate the results in a timely and effective manner. Study results are published annually and acted upon to improve the health of children and youth in Canada. For example, CPSP study results help to warn of emergent public health issues, identify safety hazards, mobilize knowledge on rare conditions, and inform new policies and guidelines. Limitations of surveillance As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that its surveillance has some limitations, including the following: Reporting on minimum incidence rates can under-represent events in the population. For example, some cases may not be included in the surveillance totals because they presented to family doctors or other health care practitioners and not to paediatricians, while others may live in rural or remote areas and are less likely to receive timely specialist care. Some data elements (e.g., laboratory investigations, pre-existing medical conditions) may not be available in the patient chart at the time of reporting and therefore may be absent from the surveillance totals. Every effort is made to ensure complete data capture and to handle missing data appropriately in the data analysis (e.g., denominators vary according to the number of participants who completed specific data elements in the detailed questionnaire). The results presented in this annual report are provisional. At the time when investigators are asked to prepare study reports, some clinical questionnaires may still be pending. Once pending questionnaires are analyzed, study conclusions may change. Especially for preliminary study reports, the distribution of cases by province/territory may not be representative of the study's final results. Data from Quebec are incomplete. Due to Quebec legislation, cases reported from that province can only be included in the data analysis when reported from a centre with project-specific research ethics board approval. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the unprecedented demands being placed on front-line health care providers, it is possible that some cases may have gone unreported. Despite these limitations, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that allows for a better understanding of the rare childhood conditions under study. Response rates The CPSP's average national monthly response rate is 80% and the average detailed questionnaire completion rate varies between 80 to 90%.

Every effort is made to maximize reporting, and annual response rates are subject to change due to delays in reporting. The total number of individual CPSP participants is approximately 2,800. However, in this table, the number of CPSP participants in Canada is calculated based on both individual and group reporting. When a group designate responds to the CPSP on behalf of group members, it is counted as one response.TABLE 2 - National initial response rates 2018-2022 Reporting year Reporting rates (%) 2018 79 2019 82 2020 81 2021 80 2022 8012 CPSP 2022 RESULTSTABLE 3 - 2022 questionnaire completion rates as of July 13, 2023* Studies/conditions Notifications of potential casesPending % completion rate Acute flaccid paralysis 23 0 100 Adverse drug reactions - serious and life-threatening 21 5 76 Congenital syphilis 213 31 85 First-time hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa during the COVID-19 pandemic 206 42 80 Hypoglycemia during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia <5 \u2014 \u2014 Micronutrient deficiencies and autism spectrum disorder 18 9 50 Optic nerve hypoplasia and septo-optic dysplasia 38 10 73 Paediatric-onset leukodystrophies \u2014 Paediatric pulmonary thromboembolism 19 5 74 Post-COVID-19 condition (long COVID) 17 2 88 Serious adverse events related to cannabis used for medical purposes <5 \u2014 \u2014 Serious and life-threatening events associated with non-medical (recreational) cannabis use in Canadian children and youth53 22 58 Severe vaping-related illness and injury <5 \u2014 \u2014 Total number of cases (all studies) 610 84 78 * The numbers in this table were compiled later than those contained in the individual study reports and hence may differ because of delayed case reporting or case analysis.

Glossary of terms in study results Reported: Notifications of potential cases received by the CPSP Duplicates: Cases reported by more than one participantExcluded: Cases not meeting the case definition and cases reported from Quebec institutions without project-specific research ethics board approval In mid-2018, the CPSP became aware of a change in Quebec legislation that affected the ability of the Program to collect detailed information from physicians who practise in that province. The minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et des Services sociaux approved the continued collection of CPSP case notifications (including date of birth and sex) from paediatricians and subspecialists in Quebec. More detailed case-level information for CPSP studies may also be collected in Quebec from institutions with project-specific research ethics board approval. Therefore, cases notified by Quebec participants after August 1, 2018 are included in the data analysis only if they are reported from an institution with CPSP project-specific research ethics board approval. Pending: Detailed questionnaires not received or not yet verified as meeting the case definition Met case definition: Cases verified as meeting the case definition, excluding duplicate case reports, cases failing to meet the case definition, cases pending verification, and cases reported from Quebec from institutions without project-specific research ethics board approval13 CPSP 2022 RESULTSInternational Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units The CPSP offers an opportunity for international collaboration with other paediatric surveillance units worldwide, through the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INOPSU). The network provides a successful and easily accessible platform for international surveillance. No other network enables international comparisons of demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes for rare childhood conditions. Established in 1998, INOPSU's membership includes many paediatric surveillance units from around the world, from Canada to New Zealand. Many of the paediatric surveillance units have been collecting data on rare childhood conditions for 20 years or more. Over 300 rare conditions have been studied to date, including rare infectious and vaccine-preventable diseases, mental health disorders, child injuries, and immunological conditions. The network encompasses approximately 10,000 child health care providers who voluntarily contribute data on these rare diseases every month. Joint collaborative studies are seen as an important method of advancing the knowledge of uncommon childhood disorders around the world. For example, collaborative work is taking place to combine the data from the CPSP's congenital Zika syndrome and severe microcephaly studies with data from similar national surveillance projects conducted in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. During INOPSU meetings, member countries can highlight their surveillance program activities, explore innovative study ideas of interest to the network, discuss knowledge translation and joint publication opportunities, as well as strategize on how best to maintain active engagement of participants. More information on INOPSU can be found at www.inopsu.com. 14 CPSP 2022 RESULTSSurveillance Studies in 2022 Question Did Canada maintain its polio-free status in 2022? Importance Poliomyelitis is targeted for eradication, with only two countries having ongoing wild poliovirus transmission. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is the cornerstone of monitoring for polio and is critical for documenting the absence of poliovirus circulation required for countries to declare polio-free status. Canada conducts AFP surveillance in children under 15 years of age, in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and standards of practice. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/acute-flaccid-paralysis. Case definition Acute onset of focal weakness or paralysis characterized as flaccid (reduced tone) without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma) in a child less than 15 years of age. Transient weakness (e.g., post-ictal weakness) does not meet the case definition. Unique to this study Cases are captured through both the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) and Canada's Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive (IMPACT) based in 12 paediatric tertiary care centres. Of the cases reported from Quebec, only AFP cases reported by Quebec IMPACT centres are eligible for data analysis in this report. Results - January to December 2022 Note: This report represents a snapshot as of January 3, 2023. There may be uncaptured cases in this report due to reporting delays. The total AFP case counts for 2018 to 2022 have been updated with all the confirmed cases that have been reported and are presented in Table 2. Cases that met the case definition In total, 13 reports of sudden onset muscle weakness in children younger than 15 years of age were provided to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Twelve of 13 cases (92%) were reported through an IMPACT centre.Acute flaccid paralysis Study duration: Ongoing study since January 1996 Principal investigator (interim) Marina I.

Cases reported through the following centres were included in the data analysis for this report: CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal Children's Hospital, Universit\u00e9 Laval.15 CPSP 2022 RESULTS At the time of analysis, all 13 cases (100%) were verified as meeting the AFP case definition in 2022; none were assessed as meeting the polio case definition. The median time from case onset of paralysis to reporting was 103.0 days and the mean was 87.5 days (range: 24-142). Demographics Seven cases were male (54%) and six cases were female (46%). Cases ranged in age from 1 month to 14 years, with a median of 4.0 years and a mean of 6.1 years. Presentation and diagnosis All 13 cases (100%) were hospitalized. Length of stay ranged from 5 to 27 days, with a median of 9.0 days and a mean of 13.1 days. Diagnoses reported for the cases include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis, and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). The most frequent diagnosis was Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Polio vaccination status was reported for 12 of 13 cases (92%). Where vaccination status was recorded, the majority of cases were reported to be up-to-date for their polio vaccinations. Fewer than five cases had stool sample submitted for viral testing. No stool samples were positive for polio. Treatment and outcomes Twelve of the 13 cases (92%) had outcomes documented at initial report, and all 12 of these cases had either fully recovered or partially recovered with residual weakness. Fewer than five cases had clinical outcomes reported at least 60 days after the onset of paralysis or weakness. Study limitations Limitations common to all CPSP studies are listed on page 11. Stool samples in patients with AFP are sometimes difficult to obtain due to the nature of the patient's symptoms, including constipation. Additionally, rapid availability of advanced diagnostic testing often identifies the diagnosis prior to the collection of the stool sample. Conclusions Although Canada did not meet the WHO performance indicators for national AFP surveillance in 2022, there was sufficient evidence to suggest that no paediatric polio cases occurred in Canada. The detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in Canada from wastewater sampling, reported December 23, 2022, is a critical reminder of the importance of maintaining a sensitive and active surveillance system that allows for prompt and appropriate investigation of AFP cases to detect polio. Polio is a reportable disease in every province and territory, and is nationally reportable. Anticipated study impact Canada's polio-free status remains intact, as assessed annually by Canada's National Certification Committee for Polio Eradication.

Importance Only a minority of prescribed pharmaceuticals on the market in North America have been tested in paediatric patients, and many of them are used without the benefit of adequate and/or specific guidance on safety or efficacy in this population. Post-marketing surveillance is essential for detection of ADRs and contributes to the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk profile of health products used in children. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/adverse-drug-reactions-serious-and-life-threatening. Case definition Serious and life-threatening adverse drug reactions * in an infant or child up to the age of 18 years, associated with the use of prescription, non-prescription, biological products (immunoglobulin), complementary medicines (including herbals), and radiopharmaceutical products. * Noxious and unintended severe response to a drug, which occurs at any dose and results in emergency observation, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability, or death Exclusion criteriaReactions to medical devices, blood products (platelets, red cells and single-donor plasma), vaccines, poisonings or self-administered overdoses Unique to this study Significant results for the ADR study contribute to the monthly ADR Tips distributed by the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). Results - January to December 2022 Cases that met the case definition At the time of analysis, 11 suspected serious and life-threatening paediatric ADR reports were verified as meeting the case definition in 2022.Principal investigator Sally Pepper, BScPhm, RPh, Patient Safety Section, Marketed Health Products Directorate, Health Canada; sally.pepper@canada.gc.ca Sally Pepper TABLE 1 - ADR cases in 2022 Reported Duplicates Excluded Pending Met case definition* 14 0 3 0 11 * Due to Quebec legislation, any cases notified by Quebec participants were counted in the \"Reported\" column, but detailed case information was not collected and these cases were excluded from the data analysis.17 CPSP 2022 RESULTS In a small number of cases, more than one product was suspected of causing the adverse reaction. The health product classes (using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system) most frequently suspected of causing the adverse reactions in 2022 were antibacterials and immunosuppressants. Fewer than five cases were reported for each class. The third most frequently reported health product class was antiepileptics, with fewer than five cases. Demographics Patient sex was male in 5 (45%) cases and female in 6 (55%) cases. Cases were reported from all of the following age ranges: 0 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 17 years. Presentation and diagnosis The 11 cases were classified as serious according to the following criteria (more than one cause for classification was provided in some of the reports): fewer than five cases were considered to be life-threatening; 6 (55%) cases required hospitalization; and 8 (73%) cases were considered to be medically important. Medically important is defined as a case that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death/ hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to prevent one of these other outcomes from occurring. The majority of the adverse reactions described skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This finding is consistent with the trend seen for all reports received through the CPSP since the study's initiation in 2004. Adverse reactions also described the following disorders, among others: blood and lymphatic system disorders; gastrointestinal disorders; psychiatric disorders; and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. Treatment and outcomes The outcome was known in most of the 11 cases, with the majority of patients (82%) experiencing a full recovery. No deaths were reported. Study limitations Limitations common to all CPSP studies are listed on page 11. All adverse reactions to health products are considered as \"suspected,\" as a definite causal association often cannot be determined. The true incidence of adverse reactions is unknown because they remain under-reported and total patient exposure is unknown. Conclusions Antibacterials and immunosuppressants were the classes of health products most frequently suspected of causing adverse reactions in 2022. Since the implementation of the CPSP surveillance for adverse reactions in 2004, the product classes most frequently associated with suspect products have been antibacterials for systemic use, antiepileptics, and psychoanaleptics. The most frequently reported suspect drugs in these classes are amoxicillin, carbamazepine, and methylphenidate respectively. No reports meeting the study criteria were received in 2022 for psychoanaleptics. The most frequently reported suspect drug for immunosuppressants since 2004 is infliximab. Anticipated study impact Health Canada recognizes the need to strengthen information related to paediatric health, as medication safety and efficacy may be significantly different for children than adults, and data on safety and efficacy in the paediatric population are limited.1, 2 The TABLE 3 - Suspect health products in 2022 Class of health product Name of health product Antibacterials for systemic use Antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents Sulfasalazine Other systemic drugs for obstructive airway disease MontelukastTABLE 2 - Annual comparison of ADR cases 2018-2022 Year Total cases 2022 11 2021 5 2020 9 2019 13 2018 20 1.

Abi Khaled L, Ahmad F , Brogan T, et al. Prescription medicine use by one million Canadian children. Paediatr Child Health 2003;8(A):6A-56A18 CPSP 2022 RESULTS ongoing sharing of safety information through voluntary reporting of ADRs from various sources, such as the CPSP , is valuable to Health Canada as it contributes to ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk profile of health products used in children and can thus result in the implementation of risk mitigation measures. In acknowledgement of the importance of safety information provided by ADR reporting, Health Canada has implemented Vanessa's Law, an amendment to the Food & Drugs Act that requires certain health care institutions to identify and report serious ADRs and medical device incidents to the federal regulator (for more information, visit: www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs- health-products/medeffect-canada/adverse-reaction-reporting/mandatory-hospital-reporting/education/module-1.html). A key objective of mandatory reporting is to improve the quality and quantity of serious ADR reports, and to expand on the real-world data available to monitor the safety of health products used in children.

How are paediatricians recognizing, diagnosing, and managing infants with CS? Importance CS has become increasingly common and can have irreversible consequences if the diagnosis is missed. Understanding the barriers preventing pregnant people from engaging in prenatal care is crucial to preventing CS. Understanding the patterns of presentation, as well as current patterns in the diagnosis and management of CS, can inform education efforts for health care workers caring for infants and children. Data on the epidemiology of CS can be used to inform public health policy and guide population-level interventions. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/congenital-syphilis. Case definition Any neonate, infant, or child <4 years old with a new diagnosis of confirmed or probable CS in the last month. Confirmed congenital syphilis (requires one of the following) 1. Identification of Treponema pallidum in the infant/child's specimen by polymerase chain reaction or fluorescent antibody examination 2. Reactive serology from venous blood in an infant that is four-fold greater than the maternal serology collected near the time of birth 3. Reactive serology from venous blood in an infant that persists beyond their second birthday Probable congenital syphilis1. Infant born to a mother who had untreated or inadequately treated syphilis at delivery, regardless of findings in the infant OR BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING:2. An infant or child with a reactive treponemal test result 3. One of the following additional criteria: a. Clinical signs of CS on physical examination b. Evidence of CS on radiographs of long bones c. Abnormal cerebrospinal fluid cell count or protein without other cause d. Reactive treponemal immunoglobulin M (IgM) (19S-IgM antibody test or IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) Unique to this studyThis study was designed in conjunction with the Sexually Transmitted and Blood-Borne Infections (STBBI) Surveillance Division of the Public Health Agency of Canada. Results - January to December 2022Principal investigators Carsten Krueger, MD, Division of Infectious Diseases, Immunology & Allergy, University of Ottawa; ckrueger@cheo.on.ca Jared Bullard, MD, Section of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, of Manitoba; jared.bullard@gov.mb.ca Co-investigators Bitnun A, Brophy J, Comeau J, Embree J, Govindapillai S, Gravel G, Isaac M, Johnson D, Leis K, Purewal R, Robinson J, Roussin B, Sauv\u00e9 L, Sheffield H, Talarico S, Tomas K, Wong S Collaborators Guedes J, Sandhu J Jared Bullard TABLE 1 - CS cases in 2022 Reported Duplicates Excluded* Pending Met case definition* 188 19 16 64 89 * Due to Quebec legislation, any cases notified by Quebec participants were counted in the \"Reported\" column, but detailed case information was not collected and these cases were excluded from the data analysis.20 CPSP 2022 RESULTSCases that met the case definition At the time of analysis, 89 cases of CS were verified as meeting the case definition from January 1 to December 31, 2022 and 64 cases were pending verification. Demographics The geographic distribution of cases was: 29/89 (33%) from Alberta, 15/89 (17%) from Manitoba, and the remaining 5/89 (6%) from elsewhere in Canada. Over one third of the cases (32/89, 36%) were from rural areas. The median maternal/birthing parent age was 27 years (range 18-39). The most commonly reported sociobehavioural risk factors of mothers/birthing parents with affected children were substance use (59/70, 84%) and child protection involvement with another child (25/42, 60%). For other risk factors, \"Unknown\" was a common response. For example, for receipt of social assistance, \"Unknown\" was the response entered for 81% (72/89) of the mothers/birthing parents. Of mothers/birthing parents with substance use, 41% (24/59) used methamphetamines and 22% (13/59) were common, with 42% (36/85) of mothers/birthing parents having at least one other STBBI. Chlamydia was the most common (22/36, 61%) maternal/birthing parent co-infection, but importantly 17% (6/36) were diagnosed with hepatitis C. Presentation and diagnosis Almost a third of mothers/birthing parents of affected children (19/60, 32%) had no documented prenatal care. Almost a quarter of mothers/birthing parents (20/87, 23%) did not have syphilis screening in pregnancy. Of the 58 mothers/birthing parents who had positive serology in pregnancy, treatment information was provided in 49 cases and, of these, 22% (11/49) did not receive treatment. Substance use was associated with increased odds of inadequate prenatal care (univariate logistic regression OR 8.2, p<0.01 95% CI [2.56-26.2]), and lack of maternal treatment (OR 3.5, p=0.03 95% CI [1.10-11.5]), but not diagnosed [0.64-4.7]). Most neonates (54/88, 61%) had normal physical exams, and 25% (22/88) were born prematurely. The most common physical exam finding was hepatomegaly (10/88, 11%). Treatment and outcomes Most neonates (76/87, 87%) with confirmed or probable CS started treatment within their first week of life. All 82 infants for whom antibiotic type and duration of treatment were known received at least 10 days of aqueous penicillin G, the treatment of choice for CS. In 69% (61/89) of cases, there were no complications of CS documented at the time of reporting. Study limitations Limitations common to all Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program studies are listed on page 11. Many potential maternal/birthing parent sociobehavioural risk factors were unknown to reporting physicians. Conclusions Maternal/birthing parent substance use was identified as a risk for inadequate prenatal care and lack of syphilis treatment during pregnancy. However, because the presence of other potential sociobehavioural risk factors (e.g., housing insecurity, income inadequacy) was often not known by reporting paediatricians, the sociostructural risk context predisposing to substance use remains unknown. Most affected infants identified by this study were diagnosed and treated early. Anticipated study impact The data gathered may help inform public health strategies for preventing CS. Study results may inform an upcoming Canadian Paediatric Society position statement on CS, as well as Public Health Agency of Canada discussions on the revision of the national case definition for CS. Next steps include exploring perceived barriers to engaging in prenatal care by interviewing mothers/birthing parents of affected infants.21 CPSP 2022 RESULTS Publication and dissemination Presentation to the Public Health Agency of Canada's Syphilis Knowledge Exchange Webinar, in December 2022 Presentation to the Syphilis Outbreak Investigation Coordination Committee, a federal/provincial/territorial group focusing on the enhanced surveillance of syphilis within Canada, in November 2022 Acknowledgements A special thanks to Jo\u00e3o Guedes and Jaskiran Sandhu from the STBBI Surveillance Division of the Public Health Agency of Canada for their data entry, processing, analysis, and general expertise.22 CPSP 2022 RESULTSFirst-time hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa during the COVID-19 pandemic Study duration: September 2021 to August 2023 Questions What is the minimum incidence rate of first-time hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa (AN) among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to the three years prior to the pandemic? What are the clinical features and COVID-19 pandemic risk factors associated with hospital admissions for a first presentation of a primary diagnosis of AN during the COVID-19 pandemic? Importance AN is a serious mental illness with significant, life-threatening medical and psychiatric co-morbidity and mortality. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, paediatricians across Canada have been seeing increased numbers of children and adolescents with AN presenting to their practices. The exact cause of this increase is unknown. This study will address an important and timely paediatric health issue with significant scientific and public health importance by providing valuable data on the incidence, clinical characteristics, severity, and key individual, family system, and other pandemic- related factors thought to drive the observed increase in the number and severity of children and adolescents with AN presenting to hospital for care. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/first-time-hospitalizations-for-anorexia- nervosa-during-the-covid-19-pandemic. Case definition Any patient 11 to 18 years of age (up to their 18th birthday) hospitalized with a primary admitting diagnosis of AN for the first time. As defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), a diagnosis of AN requires all three of the following criteria: 1. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected. 2. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behaviour that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight. 3. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self- evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. Exclusion criteria 1. Patients hospitalized for weight loss and/or malnutrition, however the: a) patient has another DMS-5 diagnosis of an eating disorder (e.g., avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder)Principal investigators Debra K. Katzman, MD, FRCPC, The Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto; debra.katzman@sickkids.ca Ellie Vyver, MD, FRCPC, H, Chan H, Coelho Couturier J, Devoe DJ, Dimitropoulos G, Dominic A, Findlay S, Iynkkaran I, Johnson N, Kurji A, Lam PY , Lane M, Lebeuf S, Norris Patten S, Pesant C, Spettigue W, Steinegger C, M Debra Katzman23 CPSP 2022 RESULTS b) patient's presentation is explained by another medical condition or mental disorder c) cause of weight loss is indeterminate/uncertain d) patient has had previous admission(s) to hospital for anorexia nervosa 2. Patients admitted to a partial hospital or day treatment program 3. Patients admitted for a primary reason other than AN Unique to this study To compare the rate of first-time hospitalizations for AN among children and adolescents prior to and after the beginning of the pandemic, this study will use health administrative data sources including, but not limited to, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, employing the ICD 10 codes for AN (F50.0, F50.01, and F50.02). Results - January to December 2022 Cases that met the case definitionAt the time of analysis (February 17, 2023), 86 cases were verified as meeting the case definition from January 1 to December 31, 2022. Pending cases include notifications from Quebec (n=33) and cases that still need information from reporting physicians (n=67). Clinical data from cases reported from physicians in Quebec must be excluded from the analysis until necessary centre-specific research ethics board approvals are in place. Demographics The vast majority of cases identified as female (78/86, 91%). In the remaining cases, gender was male (7/86, 8%) or unspecified (1/86, 1%). Cases ranged in age between 11 and 17 years. The majority of cases were aged 14 to 17 years (54/86, 63%) and the remaining cases were aged 11 to 13 years (32/86, 37%). The most common patient-reported population group was White (48/86, 56%), followed by unknown (26/86, 30%). Over half of the cases were admitted to a general paediatric ward (48/86, 56%), while more than a third were admitted to a specialized paediatric eating disorders unit (30/86, 35%). Cases were most frequently admitted to hospital in the month of January (16/86, 19%), followed by August (13/86, 15%). March (11/86, 13%) and June (12/86, 14%) were also common months for admission. Presentation and diagnosis The COVID-19 pandemic was identified by the reporting physician as a precipitating factor in the development of AN in 27/86 (31%) cases in 2022 compared to 20/41 (49%) cases in the first reporting period for this study, from September to December 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic was identified by the reporting physician as having precipitated the hospitalization in 14/86 (16%) cases in 2022 compared to 15/41 (37%) cases in the first reporting period for this study, from September to December 2021. The reporting physician identified that 51/86 (59%) cases had one or more comorbid psychiatric condition(s), of which 44/51 (86%) had a comorbid anxiety disorder. In 13/86 (15%) cases, the patient had a comorbid medical condition. Leading up to admission, in 65/86 (76%) cases, the patients were attending school in-person, while in 11/86 (13%) cases the patients were either attending school virtually or attending through a hybrid of in-person and virtual school. In 7/86 (8%) cases, the patient was not attending school at all and, in the remainder of cases (3/86, 3%), information on school attendance was not reported. Changes in, or disruptions to, peer contact and friendships due to the COVID-19 pandemic were rated by the reporting physician as contributing to the admission \"moderately\" to \"very/extremely\" in 18/86 (21%) at all\" in (13%) cases. In the remainder of cases (57/86, 66%), this information was not known or left blank. Exposure to dieting, nutrition, exercise, and eating disorder and fat-phobic content was reported to have contributed \"moderately\" to \"very/extremely\" to the admission in 14/86 (16%) \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" in (13%) cases. In the remainder of cases (61/86, 71%), this information was not known or left blank.TABLE 1 - Cases of first-time hospitalizations for AN during COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 Reported Duplicates Excluded Pending* Met case definition* 196 0 10 100 86 * Due to Quebec legislation, site-specific research ethics board approvals are required for cases notified by Quebec participants to be included in the data analysis. These approvals are pending, so cases notified by Quebec participants were counted in the \"Reported\" and \"Pending\" columns, but detailed case information was neither collected nor included in the data analysis.24 CPSP 2022 RESULTS Disruption of daily structure and routine contributed \"moderately\" to \"very\" to the admission in 21/86 (24%) \"slightly\" to \"not at all\" in (15%) cases. In the remainder of cases (52/86, 60%), this information was not known or left blank. Other potential COVID-19-related factors such as following public health directives, cancellation of important events, not seeking health care due to fear of exposure to COVID-19, changes in eating disorder health care service delivery, increased family conflict, increased parental/caregiver(s) mental health concerns, and patient-expressed loss of control or helplessness were not identified as potential contributors in 2022 to a first-time hospitalization for AN. The top three reasons for admission to hospital were: low weight (79/86, 92%), defined as either less than 75% of median body mass index (BMI) (46/86, 53%) or less than 80% of target weight (33/86, 38%); rapid and/or significant weight loss (63/86, 73%); and severe bradycardia, defined as a heart rate <50 beats/minute at daytime and/or <45 beats/minute at night (56/86, 65%). Study limitations Limitations common to all Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) studies are listed on page 11. This is a preliminary analysis as some centres may not yet have reported all of their cases. The methodology is reliant on children and their families accessing paediatric medical care and the diagnosis being made accurately and appropriately in this setting. Recognizing that this study is cross sectional, it will not provide information about the medical and psychiatric treatment responses, long-term health service usage, and prognosis. Once the required centre-specific research ethics board approvals from Quebec are obtained, cases reported from physicians in Quebec can be included in the data analysis and study conclusions may change. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was identified to be a precipitating factor in the development of AN in almost a third of cases of children and adolescents reported to the study in 2022. This is a decrease when compared to the initial reporting period of September to December 2021. The percentage of cases where the COVID-19 pandemic was identified as having precipitated the hospitalization decreased by more than half in 2022 compared to the first reporting period of September to December 2021. Similar to the first reporting period, in 2022 the majority of hospitalized patients with a first-time diagnosis of AN were female, 14 to 17 years old, and admitted to a general paediatric unit. It is concerning that 11 to 13 year olds comprised more than a third of cases. In over half of cases there was one or more comorbid psychiatric conditions. Based on the case history, reporting physicians identified that disruptions to peer contact and friendships due to the COVID-19 pandemic, exposure to dieting, nutrition, exercise, eating disorder and fat-phobic content, and disruption of daily structure and routine were potential COVID-19-related factors that contributed to a first-time hospitalization for AN. Other potential COVID-19-related factors surveyed were not identified as potential contributors in 2022 to a first-time hospitalization for AN. Anticipated study impact This study will establish a minimum incidence of first-time hospitalizations for AN in children and adolescents in Canada during the pandemic. This study will provide needed information on the clinical presentation and potential precipitating factors of first-time hospitalizations for AN in children and adolescents during the pandemic. Study results will provide important data that will facilitate the implementation of prevention strategies and best ways to adapt, modify, and deliver needed services to support children and adolescents with AN and their families during this pandemic and in the case of future public health emergencies.

What is the frequency of a first episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia while being treated for ALL? What is the timing of onset and duration of hypoglycemia associated with treatment for ALL? What are the management strategies for hypoglycemia associated with treatment for ALL? Importance Likely under-appreciated, a recently recognized adverse event associated with standard ALL treatment is hypoglycemia. Two medications that have been found to be associated with hypoglycemia are asparaginase (most commonly in the form of L- and peg- asparaginase) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Hypoglycemia places children at risk of decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and possibly negative neurocognitive sequelae, especially in younger children. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/hypoglycemia-and-all. Case definition Any patient less than 18 years of age (up to the 18th birthday) with a first known episode of biochemically proven hypoglycemia via laboratory serum glucose sample (if not available, then point-of-care) with blood glucose level below 3.0 mmol/L during chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (all agents and protocols). Exclusion criteria Patients who have had a previous documented episode of biochemical hypoglycemia during chemotherapy for ALL (blood glucose <3.0 mmol/L) Unique to this study The study team will be collaborating with the Cancer in Young People in Canada program (CYP-C) to clearly identify the denominator of patients with ALL who were treated with the various forms of asparaginase during the study period. Results - October to December 2022Principal investigators Mary Jiang, MD, FRCPC, Paediatric Endocrinology Fellow, Children's Hospital of Eastern Alexandra Ahmet, MD, FRCPC, Paediatric Endocrinologist, Children's Hospital Ontario, Professor Ottawa; AAhmet@cheo.on.ca Scott A, Geddie H, Gibson P , Goulet G, Harvey M, Healey A, Luca P , Marks SD, Mitchell J, Mokashi A, Panagiotopoulos C, Punnett A, Rousseau-Nepton I, Saleh D, Simoneau-Roy J, Speckert M, Waldner R Mary Jiang TABLE 1 - Hypoglycemia during treatment of ALL cases from October 1 to December 31, 2022 Reported Duplicates Excluded Pending Met case definition* <5 0 0 0 <5 * Due to Quebec legislation, any cases notified by Quebec participants were counted in the \"Reported\" column, but detailed case information was not collected and these cases were excluded from the data analysis.26 CPSP 2022 RESULTSCases that met the case definition Fewer than five cases were verified as meeting the case definition in Canada from October 1 to December 31, 2022. DemographicsAs per Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) policy, case numbers and data for fewer than five cases cannot be presented. Presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes Specific information on this study cannot be presented at this time due to the small number of cases. Study limitations Limitations common to all CPSP studies are listed on page 11. This study is limited to gathering data from patients who have biochemically proven hypoglycemia. Therefore, the study will not be able to capture the true incidence of hypoglycemia \u2014 including symptomatic or asymptomatic patients for whom a blood glucose was never drawn. In hospitalized patients, hypoglycemia may be masked by the use of glucose containing intravenous fluids in young children. Conclusions Fewer than five cases were reported during the first three months of the study. More time is required before conclusions can be drawn. Data collection will continue for a total of 24 months. Anticipated study impact This study will provide insight into the scope of this iatrogenic side effect in children undergoing ALL therapy. Study results may inform clinical guidance, screening, and strategies to prevent hypoglycemia during ALL therapy, as well as help to promote increased recognition of this adverse drug reaction. Acknowledgements The investigators would like to thank the physicians who reported cases for this study.27 CPSP 2022 RESULTSMicronutrient deficiencies and autism spectrum disorder Study duration: January 2020 to December 2022 - Final report Questions Among children and youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Canada, what is the minimum incidence of specific micronutrient deficiencies (vitamin A deficiency/xerophthalmia; scurvy; severe, symptomatic vitamin D deficiency; and severe iron deficiency anemia)? What clinical characteristics, use of health care services, and health complications are associated with micronutrient deficiencies in children and youth with ASD in Canada? Importance The incidence of micronutrient deficiencies in children and youth with ASD in Canada is unknown. The paediatric population with ASD may be at risk of nutritional problems due to food refusal, limited dietary repertoire, and high-frequency single food intake. Better understanding the burden of serious micronutrient deficiencies in children and youth with ASD will inform anticipatory guidance, screening, and prevention strategies in this population. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/micronutrient-deficiencies-and-autism- spectrum-disorder . Case definitionAll children and youth less than 18 years of age (up to their 18th birthday) with autism spectrum disorder AND a new diagnosis of one or more of the following micronutrient deficiencies: Vitamin A deficiency/xerophthalmia Scurvy Severe, symptomatic vitamin D deficiency Severe iron-deficiency anemia The patient's autism spectrum disorder must have been diagnosed by a general paediatrician, developmental paediatrician, psychiatrist, or psychologist. Definitions for the micronutrient deficiencies and laboratory reference ranges can be found in Appendix 1 of the study protocol.

With an additional 20 cases pending verification, these results are provisional and may be subject to change in the final study analysis. The majority of patients (18/27, 67%) met the case definition for only one of the four micronutrient deficiencies under surveillance; however, one-third of the patients had more than one of the deficiencies (9/27, 33%). Among the 27 patients, there were 35 diagnoses of micronutrient deficiency. Scurvy was the most commonly reported micronutrient deficiency (17 diagnoses), followed by severe iron deficiency anemia (10 diagnoses), severe, symptomatic vitamin D deficiency (7 diagnoses), and vitamin A deficiency/xerophthalmia (<5 diagnoses). Demographics The vast majority of patients were male, which may reflect that ASD is more common in males than females. The median age of patients was 7.7 years (range 1.8-14.9 years). Most patients (19/27, 70%) resided in Ontario, with the remainder residing in other provinces. Presentation and diagnosis Signs and symptoms of micronutrient deficiency were identified in the vast majority of cases (24/26, 92%). In patients with scurvy, arthralgia/limp/abnormal gait/inability to bear weight was the most common presenting symptom (12/17, 71%). All patients (27/27, 100%) were deemed to have a restricted diet/limited food repertoire. In all cases (27/27, 100%), the reporting physician attributed the restricted diet/limited food repertoire to the patient himself/herself (e.g., picky eater, unwilling to try new foods). The total number of different foods in the patient's diet was less than 10 for the majority of patients (20/23, 87%). Most patients (19/27, 70%) were reported as being non-verbal (i.e., using no spoken language or only a few spoken words). A minority of patients (8/26, 31%) had medical conditions other than ASD, and very few (n<5) had food allergies/intolerances diagnosed by a medical professional. Height and weight were not always measured at the time of micronutrient deficiency diagnosis (height and weight measured in 16/27, 59%). Based on the reporting physician's classification of weight status or growth measurements at diagnosis, most patients (18/26, 69%) were of normal/healthy weight, with the remainder classified as either underweight or overweight. The majority of patients (22/27, 81%), had their micronutrient deficiency first diagnosed by a general paediatrician. One-third of patients (9/27, 33%) underwent an invasive procedure as part of their diagnostic workup (e.g., bone marrow aspiration, general anesthetic for imaging). Treatment and outcomes Two-thirds of the patients (18/27, 67%) were admitted to hospital either for investigations leading to diagnosis of their micronutrient deficiency, or for management. The median duration of admission was eight days (n=17, range 3-32 days). All patients (27/27, 100%) were treated via administration of enteral vitamins. Other additional treatments were sometimes used. Prolonged immobilization secondary to micronutrient deficiency was reported infrequently (n<5). No other serious sequelae were reported, although the timing of reporting may limit respondents' ability to comment on long-term effects of micronutrient deficiencies. Study limitations Limitations common to all Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) studies are listed on page 11. Conclusions Over the three-year period from January 2020 to December 2022, 27 children and youth with ASD were verified as meeting the case definition for one or more of the micronutrient deficiencies under surveillance. Scurvy was the most commonly reported of the four micronutrient deficiencies. Follow-up of pending cases is ongoing. The 27 cases identified in this study suggest that: - Very restricted diet/limited food repertoire is common in cases of micronutrient deficiency, and this dietary restriction is imposed by the child or youth themselves. - Weight status and micronutrient status are not synonymous; a child or youth with a micronutrient deficiency may not be underweight. - Hospital admission and invasive investigations are not uncommon in children and youth with ASD and micronutrient deficiency. - Serious sequelae of micronutrient deficiencies in children and youth with ASD appear to be rare.29 CPSP 2022 RESULTS Anticipated study impact This study is the first to evaluate the minimum incidence, clinical characteristics, associated use of health care services, and health complications of micronutrient deficiencies in children and youth with ASD in Canada.

What are the prenatal risk factors for developing ONH? What is the incidence of pituitary hormone dysfunction (PHD) at diagnosis in patients with ONH/SOD and what is the specific pattern of hormone deficiency? What risk factors are associated with the presence of PHD at diagnosis of ONH/SOD? Importance A better understanding of the incidence and risk factors associated with ONH and SOD in children, as well as the presence of PHD, will inform clinical guidance, screening, and prevention strategies. PHD is a common finding in children with SOD and can be associated with significant morbidity if not detected early. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/optic-nerve-hypoplasia-and-septo-optic- dysplasia. Case definition Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) diagnoses are along a continuum. Patients are classified as having ONH when hypoplasia of the optic nerves is an isolated finding and as SOD when there are two or more of the following findings: hypoplasia of the optic nerves, pituitary hormone dysfunction (PHD), and/or midline abnormalities of the brain. A case of ONH can progress into a case of SOD, or clinical evidence of PHD can lead to a diagnosis of SOD, if ONH is present on ophthalmologic examination or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients less than 18 years of age (up to their 18 th birthday) with a new diagnosis of any one of the following: 1. Isolated ONH* 2. SOD, defined as two or more of the following findings: a) ONH b) PHD c) Midline abnormalities of the brain (including agenesis of the septum pellucidum and/or corpus callosum on brain imaging) 3. PHD in a patient known to have ONH 4. ONH reported as a component of a complex genetic syndrome * ONH is defined as hypoplasia of the optic nerves confirmed by an ophthalmologist's evaluation indicating the presence of the double ring sign on direct ophthalmoscopy and/ or nerve diameter <1.5 mm and/or MRI findings reported by a paediatric radiologist. PHD is defined as one or more of the following hormone deficiencies, based on laboratory testing supported by clinical symptoms and physical examination: Growth hormone (GH) Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) hormone (LH) Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) Exclusion criteria ONH thought to be associated with other postnatal events such as retinopathy of prematurityPrincipal investigators Shazhan Amed, MD, FRCPC, MSc.PH, Clinical of E, Clark I, Hozjan Mitchell J, Nour M, Perry R, Pinto T, Rafay M, Rengan S, Rosolowsky E, R, Zuijdwijk C Shazhan Amed31 CPSP 2022 RESULTS Results - November 2021 to October 2022 Cases that met the case definition At the time of analysis, 15 cases met case definition criteria from November 2021 to October 2022. With an additional 18 cases still pending verification, these results are preliminary and may be subject to change during the final study analysis. Demographics Patient sex was female in 5 (33%) cases and male in 10 (67%) cases. Of the confirmed cases, 5 (33%) were from Ontario and the other 10 cases were from elsewhere in Canada. Presentation and diagnosis The median gestational age of the patients was 39 weeks and the median birth weight was 3.3 kg. The median maternal age was 28 years old. The most common diagnoses were SOD (7/15, 47%) and isolated ONH (5/15, 33%). Of the 15 patients reported, 6 (40%) had nystagmus. The following clinical findings were less frequently documented: hypoglycemia, cleft lip/palate, cardiac defects, and micropenis. A complex genetic syndrome was suspected in fewer than five cases. Treatment and outcomes Of the confirmed cases, 12 (80%) patients had an ophthalmology exam. Of those patients, 8 (67%) had bilateral ONH. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were reported for 10 (67%) patients. The most common findings included: 10 (100%) cases of ONH and 5 (50%) cases with absent septum pellucidum. Other less common thinning of the corpus callosum. Hormone deficiencies reported included growth hormone deficiency, adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency antidiuretic hormone deficiency, and luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone deficiency. Study limitations Limitations common to all Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program studies are listed on page 11. All new cases of paediatric ONH and SOD in Canada may not have been captured. Given the relatively small number of reported cases, these results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions Although 18 case notifications are still pending verification, at the time of writing this report, only 15 cases were confirmed as meeting the case definition for ONH or SOD. Based on previous research, the study team anticipated that 150 cases would be detected within Canada in a one-year period and suspects the number of confirmed cases in this study is a gross underestimation of the true minimum incidence of cases in Canada. A possible contributing factor is that research ethics board approvals/data transfer agreements were not in place to collect detailed case information from the province of Quebec. Anticipated study impact The study will provide Canadian-specific data regarding the minimum incidence rates of ONH and SOD in children and will identify risk factors associated with PHD. Study results may inform clinical guidance, screening, and prevention strategies. Acknowledgements We would like to thank the reporting physicians for their participation in this study.

What are the patterns of presentation, clinical features, comorbidities, and diagnostic journeys of children and youth with different types of LD? Importance Determining the minimum incidence of paediatric-onset LD in Canada will provide information that will help with more effective planning of services to children and youth with this condition, and help families and health care practitioners more effectively advocate for this vulnerable group of patients. By determining the proportion of children with each specific LD, diagnostic protocols and educational programming can be developed to enhance clinical care. This study will be foundational for the development of national and international collaborative studies on the natural history and pathobiology of LD, which will serve as a step towards future therapeutic developments. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at w ww.cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/paediatric-onset-leukodystrophies. Case definition All children and youth less than 18 years of age (up to their 18th birthday) with a new diagnosis of a leukodystrophy, defined as a genetically* determined disorder characterized by primary involvement of the white matter. Disorders characterized as leukodystrophies include, but are not limited to, the following (non-exhaustive list): Pol-III intramyelinic oedema eIF2B related disorder (vanishing white matter disease or childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination (H-ABC) (HBSL) Hypomyelination congenital cataract (HCC)Principal investigators Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill Paediatrics and Human Genetics, McGill University Health Centre; genevieve.bernard@mcgill.ca Roberta La Piana, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor, Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University, Associate Member, Department of Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital; roberta.lapiana@mcgill.ca Sunita Venkateswaran, MD, FRCPC, Associate Professor, Division Neurology, University of Ottawa, Department of Paediatrics, H, Li P , Mah J, Mahmutoglu S, Major N, Meaney B, Miller E, Prasad C, Prasad N, Riou lactate elevation (LBSL) Leukoencephalopathy storage disorders (Salla disease, infantile sialic acid storage disease and intermediate form) Single enzyme deficiencies of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation (including syndrome, and Hirschsprung disease * For information on the availability of and access to genetic testing in your region, refer to the list of study principal investigators/co-investigators at the beginning of the study protocol and contact the one who is located closest to your practice. Results - December 2019 to November 2022 Cases that met the case definition A total of 38 cases of paediatric-onset LD were verified as meeting the case definition from December 1, 2019 to November 30, 2022. With an additional 23 cases pending verification, these results are provisional and may be subject to change in the final study analysis. Clinical data from cases reported from physicians in Quebec must be excluded from the analysis until necessary centre- specific research ethics board approvals are in place. Demographics Patient sex was reported as 25/38 (66%) males and 13/38 (34%) females. The average age at presentation was 25 months (SD 27.2). The geographic distribution of cases was 22/38 (58%) from Ontario, 10/38 (26%) from Western Canada, and the remaining cases from other parts of Canada. Presentation and diagnosis Multiple signs/symptoms were seen in the majority of patients at the time of presentation to medical care. Global developmental delay was the most common sign/symptom at presentation (26/38, 68%), and among these patients, 10/26 (38%) presented with subsequent regression. Five out of 38 patients (13%) presented with developmental regression alone. The next most frequently reported signs/symptoms at presentation included the following: abnormal muscle tone (16/38, 42%), feeding impairment issues, including ataxia and falls (9/38, 24%). The most commonly reported often via whole exome sequencing, next generation sequencing, or single gene testing in equal proportions. The remaining cases were diagnosed using chromosomal microarray, single gene testing, and family history.TABLE 1 - Paediatric-onset LD cases from December 1, 2019 to November 30, 2022 Years Reported Duplicates Excluded Pending* Met case definition* 2019-202029 0 4 7 18 2021-202241 0 5 16 20 Total 70 0 9 23 38 * Due to Quebec legislation, site-specific research ethics board approvals are required for any cases notified by Quebec participants to be included in the data analysis. These approvals are pending, so cases notified by Quebec participants were counted in the \"Reported\" and \"Pending\" columns, but detailed case information was neither collected nor included in the data analysis. December 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 January 2021 to November 30, 202234 CPSP 2022 RESULTS On average, it took 18.5 months (SD 27.3) after symptom onset for patients to have a confirmed diagnosis. After presentation to medical attention, patients obtained an LD genetic diagnosis in 6.5 months (SD 19.6), on average. Treatment and outcomes Patients required an average of six different services (SD 2.5) for their ongoing care. Allied health, rehabilitation, and dietician/feeding team were each counted as one service even though multiple services fall under each of their umbrellas. Interestingly, most reporting physicians did not indicate that making the diagnosis was one of the most important challenges to caring for children with LD (7/37, 19%). The most important challenges followed the diagnosis and were associated with the patient's medical complexity (22/37, 59%), the patient's psychosocial care teams (15/37, 41%), and the physician's lack of experience caring for patients with these rare conditions (10/37, 27%). Multiple challenges could be listed for each patient. Study limitations Limitations common to all Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) studies are listed on page 11. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, in-person patient visits and access to diagnostic tests, including neuroimaging and genetic testing, may have been limited. Neuroimaging is a key part of the clinical pathway prior to genetic testing for patients with LD and, starting in March 2020, access to both imaging and anaesthesia services required by this population was limited across the country. There is variable access to genetic testing across the country. The conditions diagnosed are among the more commonly identified conditions via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern recognition. There may be several other undiagnosed LD that have been suspected based on neuroimaging but not yet diagnosed during the study time period. Once the required centre-specific research ethics board approvals from Quebec are obtained, cases reported from physicians in Quebec can be included in this analysis and study conclusions may change. Conclusions Over the three-year period from December 2019 to November 2022, 38 children and youth were verified as meeting the case definition for paediatric-onset LD. Follow-up of pending cases is ongoing. The diagnosis of the more common paediatric-onset LD took an average of 6.5 months after the patient presented to medical attention. Interestingly, the majority of confirmed cases were reported in Ontario where there is more than one centre with expertise in diagnosing LD. Early diagnosis allows for optimal management. Disease-specific treatments (e.g., bone marrow transplant, gene therapy), where available, can be provided once a genetic diagnosis is obtained. In order to make an early diagnosis, the patient must be able to access care from a provider with expertise in childhood neurological conditions. Paediatric-onset LD continue to be challenging to manage, both for the patient and the health care provider, due to the patient's medical and psychosocial complexity, the need for multiple subspecialists and multidisciplinary care, and a lack of physician experience caring for patients with these rare conditions. Anticipated study impact Study results will assist with developing knowledge translation activities to educate child health care providers about the types of LD, the various presentations, and the needs of children with LD. Increasing awareness about the current diagnostic journey of children and youth with LD, may lead to improvements in timely diagnosis and the early implementation of potential therapies as well as the establishment of multidisciplinary clinics which are required to provide the best care for these children. The collaboration of interested paediatricians and subspecialists from across the country in this study may set the foundation for expanding the Canadian Paediatric Genetically-determined White Matter Diseases Network and creating LD centres of excellence across Canada, in collaboration with health care decision makers. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of a prospective Canadian LD registry to study longitudinal cohorts and determine natural history, morbidity, and mortality rates of LD. Study results could contribute to the development of standardized clinical diagnostic algorithms and management guidelines for LD relevant to the Canadian population.35 CPSP 2022 RESULTSPaediatric pulmonary thromboembolism Study duration: January 2020 to December 2022 - Final report Questions What is the minimum incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism in the Canadian paediatric population, and what are the associated demographics? What is the clinical presentation of paediatric pulmonary thromboembolism, and what are the risk factors and short-term outcomes? What diagnostic modalities and therapeutic interventions are chosen by clinicians? Importance Pulmonary thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening event, with very little known about the epidemiology and presenting characteristics in the paediatric population. Variability exists in diagnosis and management. Improved knowledge of the incidence, presentation, and risk factors can help to promote early detection and diagnosis, and improve management and outcomes. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/paediatric-pulmonary-thromboembolism . Case definition Any patient up to their 18th birthday with a new diagnosis of confirmed or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism. Pulmonary thromboembolism is defined as in situ thrombus or embolism, including fragments and fat embolism, situated anywhere in the pulmonary arterial circulation from the right ventricle (RV), through the outflow tract, to the peripheral and subsegmental regions of the pulmonary arteries. Report patients including, but not limited to, asymptomatic patients, post-operative patients, pregnant or recently pregnant patients, and deceased patients. Confirmed pulmonary thromboembolism - patient fulfills one of four criteria: 1. Pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosed on computerized tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography OR conventional pulmonary angiography OR magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography 2. Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan reporting high probability of pulmonary thromboembolism 3. Echocardiogram demonstrating thrombus in the RV OR outflow tract OR main pulmonary artery/branch pulmonary arteries OR in transit 4. Pulmonary thromboembolism identified on autopsy Suspected pulmonary embolism - patient fulfills one of two criteria:1. Clinical suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism AND V/Q scan reporting intermediate probability of pulmonary thromboembolism 2. Clinical suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism AND echocardiogram demonstrating RV dysfunction with no other explanation Unique to this study Initially this study was limited to patients up to their 16 th birthday. An amendment was accepted by the research ethics board to allow for broadening the case definition to include patients up to their 18th birthday, with retrospective reporting allowed for cases identified since study onset.

Krmpotic36 CPSP 2022 RESULTS Results - January 2020 to December 2022 Cases that met the case definition At the time of analysis, 31 cases of paediatric pulmonary thromboembolism were verified as meeting the case definition from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. With an additional 15 cases pending verification, these results are provisional and may be subject to change in the final study analysis. Demographics Cases were predominantly female (25/31, 81%) and between the ages of 11 to 18 years (26/31, 84%). At least one risk factor was present in 28/31 (80%) patients, most commonly exogenous hormone patients had a deep vein thrombosis on presentation. Presentation and diagnosis Almost all cases were symptomatic (27/31, 87%), most commonly presenting with chest pain (18/31, (13/31, 42%), and/or shortness of breath (13/31, 42%). Most symptomatic patients presented with more than one symptom (24/27, 89%). The most common diagnostic modality used was CT pulmonary angiogram (25/31, 81%). Treatment and outcomes Almost all patients were admitted to hospital (28/31, 90%) and almost one-third required intensive care (10/31, 32%). The majority of cases (25/31, 81%) were treated exclusively medically. The most frequently reported treatments were low molecular weight heparin (21/31, 8/31 (26%) patients with 5/31 (16%) experiencing significant bleeding or cardiac arrest. Fewer than five deaths were reported and none were attributed to treatment complications. Study limitations Limitations common to all Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) studies are listed on page 11. Conclusions From January 2020 to December 2022, 31 paediatric patients were verified as meeting the case definition for confirmed or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism. Follow-up of pending cases is ongoing. Adolescents, particularly females, appear to be at highest risk of disease. Though variable, most patients presented with at least one symptom and had at least one risk factor. Most cases were admitted to hospital and treated with systemic anticoagulation; many required intensive care unit admission. Anticipated study impact This study provides Canadian-specific data on the epidemiology, presentation, and outcomes of paediatric pulmonary thromboembolism, and how clinicians diagnose and manage this condition.

What are the demographics and characteristics of children and youth who present with long COVID? What are the clinical characteristics of this condition at presentation? Specifically, what are the symptoms at presentation (including duration) and the impact on the child's participation in daily activities? Importance The incidence and clinical characteristics of long COVID in children and youth in Canada are unknown and the burden of this illness in children in Canada has not been described. Based on early reports and clinical experiences managing children with long COVID, the resource utilization for each patient can be significant. A better understanding of the extent and nature of this new condition in children is required so that health care systems may best support their recovery. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/post-covid-19-condition. Case definition Any patient less than 18 years of age (up to the 18th birthday) who meets both of the following criteria: 1) Experiencing one or more new or persistent symptoms after recovery from acute COVID-19 (proven by laboratory testing and/or highly suspected based on clinical history) AND 2) Symptom(s) have persisted for at least eight weeks Results - September to December 2022 Cases that met the case definition At the time of analysis, of the 17 cases reported during the first four months of the study, 11 met the case definition for long COVID and four were pending verification.

Cases ranged in age from 3 to 17 years, with a median of 15 years. The majority of cases were female. Presentation and diagnosis All 11 cases (100%) had a co-morbid condition. Common co-morbidities included: obesity, allergies, mental health conditions, and neurodevelopmental conditions. None of the confirmed cases experienced multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The number of persisting symptoms at presentation to paediatric care ranged from 2 to 13 (median 4). The most common persisting symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, headache, and sleep disturbance. Of the 10 cases (91%) reporting fatigue, 8 (80%) endorsed post-exertional fatigue. On average, long COVID cases presented to paediatric care 3.5 months after the onset of symptoms. The majority of cases experienced a mild acute COVID-19 illness, while a minority of cases were hospitalized during their acute illness. Treatment and outcomes The management of these 11 long COVID patients included rehabilitation strategies (e.g., physiotherapy, occupational therapy), sleep hygiene measures, psychological/mental health support, and referral to additional specialists. Study limitations Limitations common to all Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program studies are listed on page 11. Conclusions These findings represent the preliminary results from the first four months of a planned two-year surveillance study. Children are presenting to paediatricians across Canada with multiple persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19. The majority of long COVID cases reported to date experienced a mild acute COVID-19 illness. The management of patients with long COVID included multiple strategies addressing physical and mental health. Anticipated study impact The study results will increase our understanding of the incidence and clinical characteristics of this new condition in children and youth in Canada. A better understanding of the extent and nature of long COVID in children and youth is required so that health care systems may better support their recovery.39 CPSP 2022 RESULTSSerious adverse events related to cannabis used for medical purposes Study duration: December 2019 to November 2022 - Final report Questions What are the clinical characteristics of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to cannabis used for medical purposes in children, including indications for use and concomitant medications? How were SAEs associated with intentional cannabis exposure identified and managed? What are the outcomes following SAEs related to cannabis or cannabis products used for medical purposes (with or without a medical authorization) in children and adolescents in Canada? Importance While Health Canada has not approved any product containing cannabinoids for use by children or youth, cannabis for medical purposes is currently used for a variety of conditions, including nausea and vomiting in children with cancer, drug-resistant seizure disorders, and refractory spasticity. There is little real-world Canadian data on SAEs in children using cannabis or cannabis products for medical purposes and limited knowledge about associated products, indications, and adverse events. There is also limited scientific evidence on the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes following SAEs in children and youth exposed to cannabis or cannabis products used for medical purposes. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/serious-adverse-events-related-to-cannabis- used-for-medical-purposes. Case definition Any serious or life-threatening adverse event* in a child up to 18 years of age related to the intentional use of cannabis for medical purposes. Report an adverse event even if there is not certainty it is related to the use of cannabis.

What are the clinical presentations and associated medical needs of children and youth presenting with serious and life-threatening events related to non-medical cannabis exposure? Are there changes in the incidence of serious and life-threatening events during the four-year period following cannabis legalization? Importance There are currently limited scientific data quantifying the impact of cannabis legalization and regulation on the health of children and youth in Canada. Data provided by this study will be used to assess the health impacts of cannabis legalization and regulation in the paediatric population and to inform policy, legislation and regulations, as well as public education and awareness communications. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/serious-and-life-threatening-events- associated-with-non-medical-recreational-cannabis-use-in-canadian-children-and-youth. Case definition Any child or adolescent less than 18 years of age (up to the 18th birthday) presenting with a new health condition or a deteriorating chronic/previously diagnosed condition resulting in either hospitalization (inpatient, intensive care unit, psychiatric), permanent disability, or death, which was likely primarily caused by the use of cannabis for non-medical (recreational) purposes. This includes either intentional or unintentional exposure to cannabis in a child or adolescent, or a condition resulting from use by another individual, such as a friend or a parent/caregiver, who is under the influence of cannabis. Exclusion criteria A condition resulting from cannabis use for non-medical purposes during pregnancy/breastfeeding A condition resulting from cannabis use for medical purposes Results - January to December 2022Principal investigators Richard E.

At the time of analysis, 28 of these cases were verified as meeting the case definition in 2022. In comparison, 10 cases met the case definition from September to December 2018, 38 cases in 2019, growing to 50 cases in 2020 and then decreasing to 34 cases in 2021. Demographics Patient sex was female in 14/28 cases (50%, 95 CI 32-68), male in 13/28 cases (46%, 95 CI 28-65), and unspecified in 1/28 case (4%, 95 CI 0.5-23). The mean age was 7.7 years with a median age of 5.2 years. Most cases were among children 12 years of age and younger (19/28, 68%, 95 CI 48-83). Presentation and diagnosis Like in previous years, the most common primary presentation was poisoning/ intoxication (10/28, 36%, 95 CI 20-56). Poisoning/intoxication cases exclusively involved children aged 12 years and younger, and 8/10 cases (80%, 95 CI 40-96) involved ingestion of cannabis in edible form. Other case presentations included psychosis, including drug-induced psychosis, (6/28, 21%, 95 CI 10-41) and neurological problems (6/28, 21%, 95 CI 10-41). In some cases, more than one primary presenting condition was reported. In more than half of all cases (16/28, 57%, 95 CI 38-74) cannabis was ingested in edible form and all of these cases involved children 12 years of age and younger. All nine cases involving children and youth aged 13 and older involved inhaled cannabis, primarily smoking as a route of administration (6/9, 67%, 95 CI 28-91). Consistent with data from previous years, many cases involved cannabis from unknown (19/28, 68%, 95 CI 48-83) or illegal (5/28, 18%, 95 CI 7-37) sources, as reported by the reporting physician. The reported source of cannabis was not verified. Treatment and outcomes All cases resulted in hospitalization (28/28, 100%): 21/28 cases (75%, 95 CI 55-88) were inpatients and 7/28 cases (25%, 95 CI 12-45) were admitted to a psychiatric bed. Physical treatment, such as intravenous fluids and patient monitoring, was received by 17/28 cases (61%, 95 CI 41-77). Fourteen cases (50%, 95 CI 32-68) received mental health treatment (e.g., psychiatry consultation, referral to a social, addiction or youth worker), either exclusively or in addition to physical treatment. Study limitations Limitations common to all CPSP studies are listed on page 11. Conclusions Serious and life-threatening events associated with non-medical use of cannabis are occurring among children and youth in Canada, with 28 cases meeting the case definition in 2022. More than half of these cases involved ingestion of cannabis in edible form. The most common primary case presentation was poisoning/intoxication, exclusively in children 12 years and younger, and mostly involving cannabis in edible form. This trend continues to be monitored. The number of cases of psychosis in 2022 has increased from the previous year (fewer than five cases in 2021) and is now reportable at six cases. Twelve cases of psychosis have been reported since the study began. This trend continues to be monitored. More time is required to determine the impact of cannabis legalization and regulation on child and adolescent health. While most cases of serious and life-threatening events associated with non-medical use of cannabis were reported to have involved cannabis from unknown or illegal sources, legal edible cannabis products only became available for purchase in late December 2019, and awareness continues to be raised surrounding the distinction between legal and illegal cannabis. Anticipated study impact This study will provide Canadian-specific data on the impact of cannabis legalization and regulation on the health of children and youth. These data may be used to inform policies, legislation, and regulations related to cannabis used for non-medical purposes. To date, study results have contributed to the Canadian Paediatric Society's submission to the legislative review of the Cannabis Act. The information from this study may also be adapted to develop public education and awareness communication materials.

What are the clinical characteristics, product-level and substance-specific risk factors, comorbidities, and treatment outcomes of children and youth with severe vaping-related illness or injury? Importance According to the 2021 Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey, 13% of adolescents 15 to 19 years of age reported vaping in the past 30 days, similar to the proportion reported in the 2019 and 2020 surveys. Gaining a better understanding of the specific risk factors and patterns of illness and injury related to vaping products is essential for the development of effective preventive and regulatory measures. Methodology The complete protocol can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance/study-etude/severe-vaping-related-illness-and-injury . Case definition Any patient less than 18 years of age (up to 18th birthday) requiring emergency department care, hospitalization, or admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to an illness or injury associated with any of the following: 1. Inhalation of aerosol from a vaping device (e.g., acute pulmonary injury, serious gastrointestinal symptoms, central nervous system activation/depression, acute nicotine toxicity or withdrawal) 2. Malfunction of a vaping device (e.g., burn, trauma to the eye, hand, and/or face) 3. Ingestion of a vaping substance (e.g., e-liquid with or without nicotine and/or flavours, tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] oil, hash oil) Exposure to vaping devices/products/substances may be either intentional or unintentional and includes both primary (i.e., direct use/ inhalation) and/or secondary exposures (i.e., exposure to another person's vaping aerosol or injury caused by another person using a vaping device). Vaping devices include any type of electronic cigarette or similar device that aerosolizes a solid or liquid substance (vaping substance) which may contain some or all of the following: nicotine, cannabis, flavouring agents, and other chemicals. Unique to this study This study follows two previous Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) one-time surveys on vaping-related illness and injury conducted in 2015 and 2019. Study investigators will cross-validate study findings with hospital discharge data obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information.Principal investigator Nicholas Chadi, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Paediatrics, Division of Adolescent Medicine, Department of Paediatrics, CHU Sainte-Justine; nicholas.chadi@umontreal.ca Co-investigators Baker M, B\u00e9langer R, Beno S, Brody D, Do MT, Fournier C, Grant C, Leslie K, Moore Hepburn C, Pike I, Richmond S, Tse SM, Tulloch T, Vyver E, Zysman-Colman Z Collaborators Barrett G, Belzak L, Hardy J, Mischki T, Venugopal J Nicholas Chadi45 CPSP 2022 RESULTS Results - February 2021 to January 2022 Cases that met the case definition Fewer than five cases were verified as meeting the case definition in Canada from February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022. Demographics As per CPSP policy, case numbers and data for fewer than five cases cannot be presented. Presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes Specific information on this study cannot be presented due to the small number of cases. Study limitations Limitations common to all CPSP studies are listed on page 11. Cases of severe vaping-related illness or injury that might have presented to outpatient clinics or other non-hospital settings may not have been captured by this study. Similarly, vaping-related illnesses or injuries that did not meet the CPSP case definition of \"severe\" would also not be captured. Conclusions Very few cases of severe vaping-related injury or illness were reported during the one-year study period, contrasting with the 2015 and 2019 one-time CPSP surveys on vaping-related illness or injuries for which 35 and 88 cases were reported, respectively. Of note, these two previous surveys had slightly different case definitions and also included a small proportion of cases seen in outpatient settings. Initially planned for a two-year period, this CPSP study was closed at the end of January 2022 due to the very low number of reported cases after the first 12 months. Potential explanations for the lower-than-expected case numbers in this study may include an actual decrease in the incidence of vaping-related illness or injury, changes in provincial and federal vaping policies and regulations, increased monitoring and control of vaping products by resellers and manufacturers, and changes in access and use of vaping products by children and youth in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anticipated study impact Given the rapidly evolving landscape of vaping products across the country and high rates of youth vaping, further research is needed to measure the acute and long-term impacts of vaping-related illness and injury among children and youth. Ongoing surveillance and research work by the study team, using other data sources, such as hospital discharge data and consumer safety reports, will allow for the continued collection of useful details on individual cases, including product-level and substance- related information, which even in low numbers, may help to inform ongoing changes in vaping-related policies and public health preventive measures.

Importance Button battery ingestions pose a serious threat to child and youth health, and have been increasing over time. The size and power of button batteries have also increased, which has led to increased morbidity and mortality. Tissue damage has been shown to occur in as little as 15 minutes. In the United States, the rate of button battery ingestions has increased 60-fold from 1995 to 2015, with a corresponding 10-fold increase in complications.1 Little is known about button battery ingestions in Canada. Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). The survey tool can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/surveys/Button_battery_ingestions_survey_Aug_29_2022_ Final.pdf. Results The survey response rate was 39% (1067/2716). Of the 1067 survey respondents, 299 (28%) reported having observed or been involved in one or more cases of children ingesting button batteries in the previous 12 months. Respondent demographics Of the physicians who reported having seen one or more button battery ingestions, 145/299 (48%) indicated their area of practice, with general paediatricians and 68% (99/145) being paediatric subspecialists. Button battery guideline knowledge Of all the respondents who replied about their awareness of specific guidelines directing the care of children and youth following button battery ingestions, few were aware of guidelines for the administration of honey (189/721, 26%) or sucralfate (118/721, 16%). Just over two-thirds of the respondents knew about button battery removal recommendations (493/721, 68%).Principal investigators Matthew Carroll, MHSc, BSc, BMed, Division of GI Nutrition, Stollery Children's Hospital, Associate Professor, Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta; mcarroll@ualberta.ca Alexandra Hudson, MD, Hudson 1. Litovitz T, Whitaker N, Clark L, White NC, Marsolek M. battery-ingestion hazard: clinical implications. Pediatrics 2010;125:1168-7747 CPSP 2022 RESULTSButton battery ingestion cases Of the 299 respondents who reported having observed or being involved in a button battery ingestion case in the previous 12 months, 815 cases of ingestions were reported. Patient case details were provided for 133 of these 815 cases. The most affected age group was children between 1 to 2 years of age (60/128, 47%). The most common presenting symptoms were coughing (13/133, 10%), and pain (13/133, 10%). Just over half of the button battery ingestions were witnessed (73/133, 55%). Over half of the time (73/131, 56%), it was unknown how the child got the button battery. If known, the battery was most often found on the ground or laying around (34/131, 26%), or obtained from inside a household product such as a car key fob (13/131, 10%). Complications Endoscopic removal of the button battery was required in 77 patients (77/131, 59%). Esophageal burns (32/133, 24%) and gastric burns (6/133, 5%) were the most common injuries. The most common long-term complication was an esophageal stricture (11/111, 10%). Survey limitations Limitations common to all CPSP surveys are listed on page 11. The survey asked about button battery ingestions seen in the previous 12 months, so there is a potential for recall bias. Multiple specialists are likely involved in the management of button battery ingestion cases and the reporting of duplicate cases cannot be ruled out (i.e., more than one responding physician may have reported the same case). This survey did not capture the experience of all physicians (e.g., otolaryngologists, general surgeons, and others who are not included in the CPSP). Conclusions Nearly half of the button battery ingestions reported in this survey were not witnessed, highlighting the importance of a high degree of suspicion, even in the absence of a positive history. There should be a low threshold to obtain x-ray imaging in young children with airway or chest/abdominal symptoms, given that in almost half of the cases, there was no indication that a foreign body had been swallowed (e.g., caregivers did not witness an ingestion, the patient didn't tell their caregiver about the ingestion). Prevention efforts should continue to be aimed at safe battery storage and disposal, given that finding a loose battery was the most commonly reported way in which the children accessed the button battery, and most of the time the source of the battery was unknown. There is a need for increased dissemination of available button battery ingestion guidelines, since modifiable patient factors, such as honey and/or sucralfate administration while awaiting definitive treatment, can improve patient outcomes. Anticipated survey impact This survey can help inform advocacy efforts for improved button battery packaging, storage, and disposal safety. This survey can inform paediatric training programs and continuing medical education programs about the need to distribute existing button battery ingestion guidelines among paediatricians.48 CPSP 2022 RESULTSHome-based phototherapy November 2022 Questions 12 months, have paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists in Canada seen patients with adverse events associated with home-based phototherapy? What are the risk factors associated with these adverse events? Importance Home phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is gaining popularity, with new studies reporting its feasibility and effectiveness. Studies have not identified significant adverse safety outcomes; however, sample sizes have been small in these studies. Home phototherapy provision is varied across Canada with no overarching guidelines for administration and monitoring. Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). The survey tool can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/surveys/Home_Phototherapy_Survey_FINAL.pdf. Results The survey response rate was 31% (844/2741). Of these respondents, 62% (495/800) said they provided care for neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and these surveys were included in the data analysis. The remaining 44 respondents did not indicate if they provided care for neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Adverse events associated with home phototherapy Twenty-eight cases of adverse events associated with home phototherapy were reported by 15 respondents, with a mean of 2.13 cases (SD 1.96) per respondent. The type of adverse event was reported in 20/28 (71%) cases, with the vast majority (19/20, 95%) being admissions/readmissions to hospital for inpatient phototherapy. There were no cases of serious adverse events including acute bilirubin encephalopathy, or of neonates requiring intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or exchange transfusion. In the 15 cases with a reported outcome, there were no anticipated permanent sequelae due to the adverse event. Of the 12% (57/493) of respondents who said home phototherapy was offered at their centres, 18% (10/57) reported one or more cases of adverse events. Risk factors for adverse events Risk factors were identified in 67% (14/21) of cases of adverse events associated with home phototherapy. In seven cases, the respondent indicated that there were no risk factors for the adverse events. The majority of the risk factors identified were infant-related (e.g., significant weight loss over 15% of birth weight, direct antibody test positivity) (8/14, 57%). Provider/system factors (e.g., lack of, or incomplete, risk factor screening, inappropriately delayed scheduled follow up) and family factors (e.g., poor treatment compliance, parent delayed follow up) were each identified in fewer than five cases. Principal investigators Karissa Holyer, MD, Department was offered at the centres of 12% (57/493) of respondents who provide care for newborns with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The practice settings in those communities were reported as 60% (34/57) urban, 16% (9/57) suburban, and 14% (8/57) rural/remote, with the remainder reporting more than one practice setting. Among respondents who had home phototherapy available at their centres, 63% (35/56) said they had formalized protocols to assess patient appropriateness for home-based phototherapy and 86% (48/56) had a formal process or protocol to ensure appropriate patient follow up. Respondents said that their home phototherapy programs offered the following types of on-call support for parents/caregivers: 43% (24/56) of respondents said there was 24/7 support, 21% (12/56) said there was part-time support (e.g., during regular business hours Monday to Friday), and 16% (9/56) said there was no on-call support available. The remainder of respondents did not know if on-call support was available. Survey limitations Limitations common to all CPSP surveys are listed on page 11. Risk factors associated with these adverse events were based on the respondent's evaluation of the case. Further analysis of data is ongoing and, as such, some results may change. The reporting of duplicate cases cannot be ruled out (i.e., more than one respondent may have reported the same case). Conclusions Fifteen paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists from across Canada reported 28 patients with adverse events associated with home phototherapy for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the previous 12 months. Almost all of the adverse events reported were admission/readmission for inpatient phototherapy and there were no cases of severe adverse events. None of the cases of adverse events associated with home phototherapy were predicted to have permanent sequelae. The most common risk factors for adverse events were infant-related. Home phototherapy is available across Canada with variable implementation of features that may promote patient safety including on-call support for parents/caregivers and formalized protocols to ensure appropriate patient selection and follow-up. Anticipated survey impact The results of this survey indicate that home phototherapy administration varies greatly as does on-call support for parents indicating the need to develop national standardized guidelines. Survey results may support home phototherapy as a safe alternative to inpatient phototherapy for low-risk infants with neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Are paediatricians screening for maternal cannabis use in breastfeeding mothers and are they aware of institutional policies on the use of breastmilk when the mother is known to use cannabis? Importance The impact of cannabis exposure through maternal breastmilk on infants and neonates is unclear due to limited research and conflicting results. Given the paucity of data, this survey was designed to assesses if adverse events have been observed by paediatricians in Canada. Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). The survey tool can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/surveys/Survey-Cannabis-and-breastfeeding.pdf. Results The survey was sent to 2779 paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists and 1008 responded, for a 36% response rate. Paediatricians who reported that they do not provide care to breastfeeding infants were excluded (n=207), and the remaining responses from paediatricians who provide care to infants (n=801) were included in the data analysis. Respondent demographics Of the respondents who provide care to infants, general paediatricians comprised 60% (484/801) of respondents, while 34% (275/801) were subspecialists, and 5% (42/801) did not identify their specialty. The top three subspecialties that participated in the survey were neonatologists, paediatric emergency medicine physicians, and paediatric endocrinologists. Institutional policies and screening frequency Only 8% (62/801) of respondents reported that their institution has a policy on the use of breastmilk when the mother is known to use cannabis, while 44% (349/801) reported that their institution does not have a policy. The remaining respondents were uncertain 48% (387/801) or did not provide a response (n=3) . Just 13% (105/801) of respondents reported always screening for cannabis use among mothers who are breastfeeding or providing breastmilk. More than half of respondents (481/801, 60%) reported never or rarely screening breastfeeding mothers for cannabis use. Over a quarter of the respondents reported that they sometimes screen (210/801, 26%). The remaining respondents did not provide a response (n=5). Adverse events Adverse events were uncommon, with 2% (18/801) of respondents reporting having cared for a breastfed infant with an adverse event that was, or may have been, associated with exposure to cannabis through breastmilk in the previous 12 months. Principal investigators Shamini Selvakumar, MD, Department of Paediatrics, McMaster University; University; giglial@mcmaster.ca Co-investigators Dann M, Fang L, Grant C, Lowe AM, Moore Hepburn C, Raha S, Shea A, Thabane L, Walker O, Williams C Shamini Selvakumar51 CPSP 2022 RESULTS From these 18 respondents, 23 infants were reported with confirmed or suspected adverse events associated with exposure to cannabis through breastmilk. The most frequently reported types of adverse events were poor feeding (n=12), irritability (n=11), tremors (n=11), (n=6), with apnea, bradycardia, and accidental trauma being less frequently observed. Some infants had more than one type of adverse event. Of the reported cases, 10 infants were also exposed to one or more of the following substances in addition to cannabis: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alcohol, opioids, or stimulants. In 13 of the reported cases, there was a history of maternal cannabis use during pregnancy as well. Investigations and outcomes Glucose (n=9), electrolytes (n=6), newborn urine toxicology (n=6), and head ultrasound (n=5) were the most frequently completed investigations to exclude other possible explanations for newborn symptoms. For most of the cases of adverse events, symptoms resolved without intervention. Some cases required cessation of maternal cannabis use or changing to formula/donor milk. Survey limitations Limitations common to all CPSP surveys are listed on page 11. Adverse events secondary to the use of cannabis and other substances reported in this survey are considered to be \"suspected,\" as a definite causal association often cannot be determined. As this survey examined adverse events that occurred in the previous year, the results are susceptible to recall bias. The reporting of duplicate cases cannot be ruled out (i.e., more than one respondent may have reported the same case). Conclusions Eighteen paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists from across Canada reported a total of 23 infants with confirmed or suspected adverse events associated with exposure to cannabis through breastmilk in the previous 12 months. The most common adverse events reported were poor feeding, irritability, and tremors. Most symptoms resolved without intervention. More than half of respondents who care for breastfed infants, never or rarely screen for cannabis use among mothers who are breastfeeding. Less than 10% of respondents reported that there was an institutional policy at their place of practice regarding the use of breastmilk when the mother is known to use cannabis. Anticipated survey impact This study describes suspected adverse events among infants exposed to cannabis through breastmilk that have been observed by paediatricians in Canada. Data from this survey may be used to encourage the development and implementation of practice guidelines and hospital policies, and inform future research regarding the screening and management of infants exposed to the breastmilk of mothers who use cannabis.52 CPSP 2022 RESULTSSevere/life-threatening opioid, stimulant, or sedative use March 2022 Questions What is the minimum incidence of children and youth with severe/life-threatening opioid, stimulant, or sedative exposure presenting to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists in Canada? What are the treatment and services available for youth presenting with substance use to paediatric care in Canada? Importance Illicit drug overdose is a public health emergency in Canada. An increasing number of children and youth in Canada suffer from severe, life-threatening overdose; it is now the leading cause of death in children and youth 10 to 18 years of age in Western Canada.1 Data from the Public Health Agency of Canada suggests that approximately 2% of overdose deaths and 5% of overdose hospitalizations in Canada occur in children and youth 19 years of age and under.2 Epidemiologic data related to this population, including treatment availability for children and youth with severe substance use disorders, remains limited. Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). The survey tool can be accessed at https://cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/surveys/Survey-Severe-life-threatening-opiod-stimulant-or-sedative-use.pdf. Results A total of 1027/2791 respondents completed the survey, for a response rate of 37%. A large majority of survey respondents 934/1027 (91%) reported providing care to children and youth 12 years of age and older. Availability of overdose-related services Among respondents caring for children and youth 12 years of age and above, 296/934 (32%) answered questions about overdose- related service availability in their communities. The majority of respondents reported that their communities had overdose-related services for outpatient mental health for patients 12 to 15 years of age (251/296, 85%) and for 16- to 18-year-olds (248/296, 84%).

Available from: https://health-infobase.canada.ca/substance-related-harms/opioids-stimulants/53 CPSP 2022 RESULTS For all other surveyed overdose-related services, including inpatient stabilization and intensive outpatient management programs, respondent awareness of service availability was low to moderate (25-53%). Respondent demographics Fourteen percent (128/934) of responding paediatricians who provide care to patients 12 years of age and older reported having cared for at least one child or youth with severe or life-threatening overdose in the previous 24 months. Of these paediatric providers, most practised in urban settings (108/128, 84%), but there were cases reported in suburban (12/128, 9%) and rural/remote (7/128, 6%) environments as well. In the remaining case, no response was provided (1/128, 1%). The majority (93/128, 73%) of respondents who cared for a case worked in academic settings, while a quarter worked in community/ non-academic settings (33/128, 26%). In the remaining cases, no response was provided (2/128, 2%). Severe or life-threatening opioid, stimulant, or sedative use cases The 128 respondents who cared for cases of severe/life-threatening substance use in the previous 24 months, reported having seen at least 636 cases. Stimulant overdose was the most commonly reported type with 187 cases, followed by sedative overdose (n=98). Of the respondents who had seen a case, the majority (76/128, 59%) reported providing care to patients with sedative overdose in the past 24 months. Of those, 46/76 (61%) saw 1 to 2 cases, 18/76 (24%) saw 3 to 5 cases, 10/76 (13%) saw 6 to 9 cases, 2/76 (3%) saw 10 to 19 cases, and none (0/76, 0%) saw 20 or more cases. A similar number of respondents (74/128, 58%) reported providing care to patients with simulant overdose in the past 24 months. Of those, 43/74 (58%) saw 1 to 2 cases, 26/74 (35%) saw 3 to 5 cases, 1/74 (1%) saw 6 to 9 cases, 2/74 (3%) saw 10 to 19 cases, and 2/74 (3%) saw 20 or more cases. Half of respondents (65/128, 51%) reported providing care to patients with opioid overdose in the past 24 months. Of those, 36/65 (55%) saw 1 to 2 cases, 19/65 (29%) saw 3 to 5 cases, 8/65 (12%) saw 6 to 9 cases, 1/65 (2%) saw 10 to 19 cases, and 1/65 (2%) saw 20 or more cases. Over one-third of respondents (48/128, 38%) reported providing care to patients requiring medication assisted treatment for opioid use in the past 24 months. Of those, 31/48 (65%) saw 1 to 2 cases, 13/48 (27%) saw 3 to 5 cases, 3/48 (6%) saw 6 to 9 cases, 1/48 (2%) saw 10 to 19 cases, and none (0/48, 0%) saw 20 or more cases. Survey limitations Limitations common to all CPSP surveys are listed on page 11. Children and youth who did not seek paediatric care after an overdose, and youth who received care from adult health services, were not captured in this survey. The reporting of duplicate cases cannot be ruled out (i.e., more than one respondent may have reported the same case). Conclusions Paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists interface significantly with children and youth with severe/life-threatening substance use and overdose. The number of cases of severe/life-threatening substance use and overdose reported among children and youth 12 to 18 years of age is significant and concerning at the population level, particularly because this data does not include children and youth who did not seek paediatric care after an overdose, and those who received care from a non-paediatric provider. Apart from mental health services, paediatric providers have limited awareness of service availability for children and youth who use substances. Anticipated survey impact This survey provides the first evidence of the number of paediatric providers in Canada who are seeing cases of severe/life- threatening substance use in their practices. Given the high number of severe substance use-related presentations revealed in this survey, a multi-year CPSP study on this topic will take place in the upcoming years to better characterize this issue. Data from this survey may help to inform the development of preventive and treatment interventions for children and youth with severe substance use disorders. This survey highlights the need to increase paediatricians' training and level of comfort in the identification and management of severe substance use presentations.

The CPSP is effective at monitoring low-frequency, high-impact diseases and conditions encountered by general paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists. Track record The average monthly response rate from approximately 2,800 paediatricians is 80%. The average detailed questionnaire response rate varies between 80% to 90%. Themes of interest Including examples of successful CPSP studies Rare diseases (including genetic, metabolic, or rare acquired conditions) - Congenital myotonic dystrophy - Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency Rare complications of more common diseases - Adrenal suppression with glucocorticoid therapy - Serious adverse events associated with complementary and alternative medicine Emerging infections - COVID-19 - Lyme disease Threats to public health and safety - Vaping - Neonatal abstinence syndrome - Serious/life-threatening use of opioids, stimulants, and sedativesStudy success factors A disease or condition with an incidence of less than 500 cases per year A multidisciplinary study team, with national representation Local champions who encourage study reporting at their institutions Study impact Knowledge translation: Studies have been published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals; the CPSP is well known and recognized by prominent editorial boards. Public health policies and legislation: Results have informed the total ban on baby walkers and the promotion of booster seats to prevent lap-belt syndrome. Professional medical guidelines: Results have informed guidelines such as the Canadian Paediatric Society position statements on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and medical assistance in dying. Public health promotion and education: Results have informed efforts to prevent vitamin D deficiency rickets and the use of e-cigarettes in those under the legal age to use conventional tobacco products.New Study and One-Time Survey OpportunitiesCanadian Paediatric Surveillance Program \"As the Paediatric Chairs of Canada representative to the CPSP Scientific Steering Committee, I have witnessed the extraordinary ability of the CPSP to bring together study investigators from across paediatric disciplines and across Canada in the study of rare paediatric diseases. For conditions that are high in disability, morbidity, mortality, and economic costs to society, despite their low frequency, national surveillance to capture case-level data is essential. On behalf of the Scientific Steering Committee, I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the thousands of CPSP participants who contribute to the Program. We are truly fortunate to have such a robust paediatric surveillance program in Canada.\" Ciar\u00e1n M.
