If we are not cautious about our own health it can lead to various subclinical discomforts in the future. We now know that we can have an excellent recovery rate (now which is above 90%) even post the COVID infection. People who contract this infection are recovering well and slowly manage to get back to their old lifestyle. For others, while the virus may not be active in our body, we still need to be cautious about what we do in our daily lives to stay immune and healthy. OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM REFLECTS OUR LIFESTYLE AND HEALTH Our immune system is a reflection of our lifestyle and health. Since the immune system is our strongest armour for protecting from recurrent infections, we must enhance this by indulging in healthy eating, fitness-driven lifestyle and positive mental health to build immunity. Lifestyle modifications today, will certainly boost the immunity tomorrow! There are various factors that can affect one's immunity, such as age, nutritional status, gut health, fitness levels, sleep, psychologic stress, mental health, immune compromised conditions and other associated morbid conditions. According to Science and research, for an infection to develop in human body, there needs to be three key factors, known as an epidemiological triad - an infectious agent (virus or bacteria), a favourable environment (our natural surroundings) and, a susceptible host (human). If we keep the 'agent' out of this equation, as we have poor control on it, we can still at least choose to control the 'environment' by ensuring it is a clean, safe, unpolluted and natural environment, and also boost the immunity of the 'host' so that he/she doesn't become vulnerable to the infection or post-covid complications.SUPER IMMUNITY Post COVID RecoveryAtmantan's SUPER IMMUNITY Programme which boosts the post COVID Recovery, is specially curated for anyone who has had a past infection or has a co-morbid condition that makes them susceptible to infections. It is essentially needed for those who want to focus and build on their adaptive immunity and reduce their vulnerability. We are sensitive towards the challenges we face today in this pandemic and hence have curated a programme that is personalized for people of all ages and capabilities. Beyond focusing on the body mass index, we give importance to mind, emotional, intellectual and spiritual mass indexes. Atmantan's SUPER IMMUNITY Programme which boosts the post COVID Recovery is a highly efficient retreat programme that addresses various aspects of your health, where our doctors improve your health parameters in an integrated manner. We use experiential knowledge from traditional medicines such as Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Yoga and Traditional Chinese medicine, and combine them with evidence-based knowledge of fitness, nutrition, physiotherapy and functional medicine. We boost the immunity through prescribed diet, stress management, improved sleep, fresh air, unpolluted environment, fitness, yoga and exposure to nature. We also focus on treating co-morbid conditions that weaken the immunity. Guest healthcare and safety is our topmost priority. Our doctors will do an initial evaluation before you arrive and will advise you on the recommended duration for your retreat. The minimum duration is 7 nights. On the day of your arrival, your consulting doctor will prescribe your treatment plan based on your health profile and symptoms.

These lifestyle diseases like cancer, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and other non-communicable diseases and other non-communicable diseases are today amongst the fastest growing causes of death and disability around the globe. Lifestyle diseases are defined as diseases linked with the way people live their life. This is commonly caused by bad lifestyle choices which could include alcohol consumption, drug abuse and smoking, as well as lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. (Diseases that impact our lifestyle are heart disease, stroke, obesity, type II diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, pulmonary disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal failure, osteoporosis, stroke, depression, obesity and vascular dementia). While modern medicine can manage these diseases most of the time, these come with some unwanted side effects. Ironically, these diseases appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer! It might hence seem counterintuitive cause as a nation becomes more affluent, there is a significant rise in lifestyle-based or non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and auto-immune diseases. And this happens quite predictably more when urbanization occurs, per capita income rises & wealth is created; As a result of this very wealth and affluence, our dietary and lifestyles choices raise the risk of these NCDs.A simple example of how we are each at risk as we become affluent: With the use of motorized vehicles and electronic devices (Mobiles, laptop, etc) our physical activity has been hampered and we are most likely notice a consequent spike in obesity, high blood pressure (hypertension), depressions, elevated blood glucose levels, higher lipids, etc. These risk factors in turn increases our odds of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, hormonal imbalances, inflammation, and gut related diseases. This becomes a daily Vicious Cycle that we land living within!Disease M anagemen t le risk factors Sedentar y lifestyle Impr oper diet Inadequate sleep Lack of social suppor t Impr oper postur e Non-modifiab le risk factors Age GeneticsResulting Chr onic illness Diabetes Hear t disease Stroke Cancer Chr onic r espirator y diseases Autoimm une diseaseIntermediate risk factors Obesity High blood pr essur e Elevated blood sugar High cholester ol High visceral fat Leaky gut InsomniaATMANTAN Wellness Center, Mulshi, Pune Maharashtra, India +91 20 6666 | E : info@atmantan.com | W : www.atmantan.com Doctor 's Con sultation s Body Composition Analysis Postural As sessment Daily Group Clas ses Yoga Therapy Session s Yoga, Br eathing and Meditation Classes Health Talks on Various Topics Therapeutic Food Fresh Herbal Medicin es Recomm ended Naturopath y Treatments an d TherapiesRETREAT INCLUSI ONS Minimum Stay: 7 Nights* T&C ApplyThe following are some of the conditions that are attended to:The time has come to consciously step out of the Vicious Cycle into the Virtuous Cycle Of Good Health!
