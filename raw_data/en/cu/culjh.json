Introduction Cancer has a major impact on society across the world; it is the leading cause of death in the worldwide. In 2012, there were 14.1 million new cases of cancer and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths in the worldwide; the number of new cases of cancer per year is expected to rise to 23.6 million by 2030 ( [www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics)). At present, the main early detection techniques of cancer are low-dose computed tomography, mammography and magnetic resonance imaging, colonoscopy and tissue biopsy, etc. However, its often high cost, low sensitivity, high false positive rate and have invasive procedure ( [Oeffinger et al., al., ](#ref003) [2013](#ref001)). Therefore, it is urgent to develop a rapid and accurate method for detecting cancer biomarkers. PD-L1 is an important immunosuppressive 2013; Okazaki important significance in anti-infection, anti-autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation survival ( [Zhang et al., 2016](#ref029)). Studies have shown that PD-L1 is a protein biomarker over expression in many lung tumors ( [Dholaria et al., 2016; D'Incecco et al.](#ref004), [2015](#ref005)). It plays an important role in lung tumors diagnosis, screening, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. Currently, the technique for determining the level of PD-L1 are mainly including western blot, immunofluorescence, colorimetric, surface-enhanced Raman resonance plasmon resonance biosensor) ( [He et al., et al., ](#ref006) [2016](#ref033)). Among these techniques, biosensors have been introduced as alternative technologies to overcome other methods disadvantages; such as the kit is expensive, time-consuming and has the complex operation steps. Biosensor is rapid, highly sensitive and throughput and real-time optical detection of PD-L1. According to the relevant data, it has been proved that many biosensors have great application prospects in cancer diagnosis and testing; in particular, fluorescence-based methods biosensor have attracted special attention because of their low sample volume, easy operation, sensitivity and high specificity. In recent years, there are some reports of immunofluorescence biosensor based on aptamers a single-stranded oligonucleotides, generated by a SELEX process, and can specifically bind to small molecules, cells and proteins ( [Jin et al., 2017; Jun et al.](#ref010), [2018](#ref012)). Aptamers are high stability, low cost and easy chemical synthesis; thus, it has been widely used for biomarker discovery and biosensing fields ( [Yuan et al., DNase is an enzyme-aided signal amplification, which can cleave phosphodiester bonds to product many polynucleotides with 5-phosphate and 3'-OH groups but cannot digest RNA ( [Lagard\u00e8re et al., 2017; Li et al.](#ref013), [2017](#ref016)). Thus, it has been developed to achieve the sensitive detection of biomolecules recently. In addition, the application of nanomaterials in fluorescent biosensors has become an advancing field, such as organic dyes, quantum dots, noble metal nanoclusters, carbon dots and graphene oxide (GO) ( [Zhang et al., 2012; ](#ref026) GO is carbon nanomaterial with a honeycomb structure ( [Liu et al., 2016](#ref018)), which has attracted remarkable attention due its unique quenching fluorescence ability as well as adsorption capacity for oligonucleotides. However, in some studies, it was found that the fluorescent biosensor based on GO also has disadvantages, such as, poor photostability and low solubility in water. Thus, it is necessary to search for better fluorophors in biosensor. In this work, we take the advantages of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and magnetic silicon microspheres (MNPs) to propose a sensitivity and specificity assay for the quantitative detection of PD-L1 in lung tumors plasma. MNPs have good biocompatibility, easy separation, and ample functional groups for modification ( [Mart\u00edn et al., 2015](#ref019); Altintas, , [2017](#ref002)), thus its can connect capture probes, separate targets, and rGO from substances ( [Zhang et al., 2014](#ref032)), rGO, the strong absorbing capability of single-stranded oligonucleotides and weak interaction with double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids ( [Joon Soo et al., 2014](#ref011)), more importantly, nano-materials will have inner filter effect in solution, the magnetic nanoparticles modified GO can be separated from solution by magnetic field to avoid inner filter effect, thus reduce its interference on the sample fluorescence, because the presence of particles in the solution will reduce the fluorescence intensity ( [Altintas, , 2017](#ref002)). Based on the above advantages, in the absence of PD-L1, PD-L1 aptamer (Apt) could be absorbed by rGO-MNPs, so that the effective fluorescence quenching. Correspondingly, in the presence of PD-L1, because of double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids, the Apt/PD-L1 complex was away from rGO-MNPS and resulting in the recovery of quenched fluorescence. When DNase I is added, it can cleave phosphodiester as well as enzyme-aided signal amplification, leading to the release of PD-L1 and FAM fluorophores, so that the accumulation of free FAM fluorophores and the quantities of PD-L1 can be achieved by fluorescence increment. With the detection range from 100 pg\u00b7mL1 to 100 ng\u00b7mL1, the detection limit was low at 10 pg\u00b7mL1. More importantly, the method has been successfully applied to the detection of PD-L1 in various spiked biological samples (including human urine, saliva, serum, lung cancer patients and normal controls plasma). We believe that this biosensor may be used as a clinical therapeutic and diagnosis tool for lung tumors. 2. Experimental section 2.1 Reagents and materials The ExoQuick Plasma prep and Exosome precipitation kit (from System Biosciences, PM-EXOQ5TM-1). DNase I was obtained from solarbio (Beijing, China; [www.solarbio.com](http://www.solarbio.com)). The rGO-MNPS was purchased from Nanjing Xianfeng, as a reduced graphene oxide modified magnetic nanoparticles. The CA125, GCG TCC ACT GCC CGT-3'-FAM) was synthesized by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China; [www.sangon.com](http://www.sangon.com)), and purified using high performance liquid chromatography. All reagents were diluted to the required concentration with working buffer (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaNO3 pH 7.4) before usage. The ultrapure water obtained from a millipore water purification system (18.2 M\u00b7cm resistivity, Milli-Q Direct 8). 2.2 Human samples In this study, human plasma samples were collected from non-small cell lung cancer patients prior to treatment and healthy donors. Healthy human serum, urine and saliva were obtained from Affiliated Dongfeng Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, and approved by Hospital's Ethics Committee. We selected the exosome surface proteins PD-L1 as the biomarkers in this study. The steps of exosome separation are as follows: exosomes were extracted and purified following the Exo-QuickTC Exosome Isolation Reagent manufacturer's protocol with minor revision. In brief, 400 uL human plasma samples was taken, the PEG in the exosome isolation kit was added into the plasma sample after centrifugation in the proportion of 1:4, mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min and 1,500 g centrifuge for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed, and the exosome pellet was re-suspended in 400 L PBS. The samples are divided into four parts and stored at 80\u00b0C; after the experiment, 100 L exosome was taken as the sample to be tested. 2.3 Optimization of sensing conditions The fluorescence of the mixture was carried out on a Hitachi F-4600 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Co. Ltd, Japan) equipped with a xenon lamp excitation source at room temperature. The excitation was set at 495 nm, and the emission spectra were collected from 510 nm to 600 nm. In this part, the 40 nM FAM labeled PD-L1 Apt and a desired concentration of PD-L1 were first mixed and kept at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, and then 60 g\u00b7mL1 of rGO-MNPS was added. About after 5 min, the reaction solution was added with 6 U\u00b7mL1 DNase I and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Then the solution was diluted to 1 mL. Finally, the fluorescence intensity at 517.6 nm was used to choose the optimal experimental conditions and quantitative determination of PD-L1. In control experiments, measurement of fluorescence intensity at 517.6 nm in the absence of PD-L1. Unless otherwise noted, each fluorescence measurement was repeated three times, and the standard deviation was plotted as the error bar. 3. Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of reduced graphene oxide-MNPS The morphology of the obtained samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy as shown in [Figure 1](#F_SR-04-2020-0087001). The high resolution transmission electron microscopy images were acquired by a Tecnai G2 F30, and transmission electron microscope (FEI, USA) operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. These results clearly indicated the successful synthesis of rGO-MNPS. 3.2 Principle for detection of PD-L1 As shown in [Figure 2](#F_SR-04-2020-0087002), based on the strong absorb capability of rGO with single-stranded oligonucleotides via - stacking interaction, but weak interaction with double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids ( [Huang and Liu, 2013](#ref009)). Thus, in the absence of PD-L1, the rGO-MNPS enabled strong adsorption of Apt to the surface of rGO-MNPS, leading to the effective fluorescence quenching. Correspondingly, in the presence of PD-L1, because of double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids, the Apt/PD-L1 complex was away from rGO-MNPS and resulting in the recovery of quenched fluorescence. Meanwhile, when the DNase I is added, based on the DNase I enzyme-aided signal amplification and leading to the release of PD-L1 and FAM fluorophores. The released PD-L1 is recycled repeatedly, resulting in the accumulation of free FAM fluorophores. The quantities of PD-L1 can be achieved by fluorescence increment. 3.3 Feasibility for strategy To investigate the feasibility of the biosensor for PD-L1 detection, [Figure 3](#F_SR-04-2020-0087003) shows the fluorescence emission spectra of the Apt under different conditions. Which acted as the control experiment (curve a), displayed a strong fluorescence emission when 30 nM Apt added alone. The introduction of rGO-MNPS quenched the fluorescence emission (curve d), resulting in a fluorescence intensity decreased remarkably, shows the rGO-MNPS enabled strong adsorption of Apt and effective fluorescence quenching. Then DNase I was added to a solution of Apt and rGO-MNPS, the fluorescence intensity not obviously increase (curve c), indicating that Apt cannot specifically bind to PD-L1, lead to the FAM fluorophores are produced of the experiment. However, upon adding PD-L1, a significant enhancement of the fluorescence intensity was observed (curve b), as the result of the stronger binding affinity between PD-L1 and their corresponding aptamers induced unwinding of PD-L1 Apt from the rGO-MNPS surface. More importantly, the DNase I-aided target recycling results in the significant fluorescence amplification. Taking these results together, the feasibility of the proposed aptasensor for PD-L1 detection by our sensing method was achieved. 3.4 Optimization of experimental conditions The optimal performance of the fluorescent sensing protocol strongly affected the main experimental conditions, such as the concentration of rGO-MNPS and DNase I, the enzyme digestion reaction time and the reaction temperature. The F1 and F0 represent the fluorescence intensity of the solution in the presence and absence of PD-L1, respectively. As shown in [Figure 4(a)](#F_SR-04-2020-0087004), Maximum F1/F0 value was observed when the concentration of rGO-MNPS was 60 g\u00b7mL1, when increasing the concentration of rGO-MNPS; however, F1/F0 value decreases obviously along with the increasing of rGO-MNPS concentration. Thus, the concentration of rGO-MNPS of 60 g\u00b7mL1 was confirmed as the optimized concentration. According to [Figure 4(b)](#F_SR-04-2020-0087004), maximum F1/F0 values are observed when the concentration of DNase I is 6 U\u00b7mL1 and then decreased gradually because of an accelerated increase in background fluorescent signal; therefore, 6 U\u00b7mL1 is selected as the optimum DNase I concentration. In addition, [Figure 4(c)](#F_SR-04-2020-0087004) shows the effect of enzyme digestion reaction time on the fluorescence intensity at the emission wavelength of 517.6 nm. The fluorescence intensity and the value of F1/F0 is related to the enzyme digestion reaction time; the value of F1/F0 increased gradually along with the increasing enzyme digestion reaction time in the range from 5 to 30 min, and the maximum F1/F0 values are observed when the enzyme digestion time is 30 min. Thus, 30 min was selected as the optimal hybridization time. According to [Figure 4(d)](#F_SR-04-2020-0087004), the F1/F0 value was affected at different levels with the rise of the hybridization temperature; the F1/F0 value reached a maximum when enzyme digestion temperature was 37\u00b0C and then decreased gradually; thus, 37\u00b0C of enzyme digestion reaction temperature was selected for the rest of the experiments. 3.5 Sensitivity and specificity To investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed sensing strategy, various concentrations of PD-L1 were measured under the optimized experimental conditions. As shown in [Figure 5(a)](#F_SR-04-2020-0087005), increasing fluorescence intensity with increasing PD-L1 concentration from 0 to 200 ng\u00b7mL1. It illustrates a highly concentration dependence of the sensor for the detection of PD-L1. Notably, a good linear correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of PD-L1 in the range from 100 pg\u00b7mL1 to 100 ng\u00b7mL1 [shown in [Figure 5(b)](#F_SR-04-2020-0087005)]. The calibration plot of the linear equation is given as y = 137.91\u00b7lg c - 112.89 (R2 = 0.9935), where lg c is the logarithm of PD-L1 concentration and Y is the fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, the detection limit is low to 10 pg\u00b7mL1. In addition, the selectivity of this detection strategy was assessed by measuring and recording the fluorescence response of other different targets such as CA125, CD63, VEGF and EPCAM; [Figure 6](#F_SR-04-2020-0087006) displays the high signal in the presence of the PD-L1 (10 ng\u00b7mL1) with in the presence of other control proteins (50 ng\u00b7mL1). This comparison clearly indicates the high selectivity of our sensing method. 3.6 Analysis of PD-L1 in real samples To further assess the effectiveness of the sensor in biological samples, the detection of PD-L1 in real samples was carried out. First, the detection of PD-L1 was spiked with 10% diluted with buffer solution to human urine, saliva and serum, and the final concentration of 10 ng\u00b7mL1 was performed. Herein, a significant increase of fluorescence in the presence of 10 ng\u00b7mL1 PD-L1 in various biological samples, compared with no spiking biological samples[shown in [Figure 7(a](#F_SR-04-2020-0087007))]. In addition, as shown in [Figure 7(b)](#F_SR-04-2020-0087007), higher PD-L1 levels were observed in serum samples from lung cancer patients than healthy controls, suggesting that maybe PD-L1 is an important biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis. In summary, these results demonstrate that this sensor has considerable application potential to analyze biomarkers in real biological samples, and it may serve as an assay that assists in cancer diagnosis, screening and prognosis. 4. Conclusions Based on DNase I and rGO-MNPS, a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe for the detection of PD-L1 was developed. In this design, as the concentration of rGO-MNPS and DNase I, the enzyme digestion reaction time and reaction temperature were optimized, the sensitive and specific detection of PD-L1 was achieved; this sensor can detect PD-L1 with a linear range from 100 pg\u00b7mL1 to 100 ng\u00b7mL1 and a detection limit of 10 pg\u00b7mL1. Then, the fluorescence signals are also obtained when the proposed strategy is used in biological samples; moreover, the use of DNase I and rGO-MNPs has developed an interference-free fluorescence measurement biosensor; we believed that this fluorescent method provides promising application in biomarker analysis.
