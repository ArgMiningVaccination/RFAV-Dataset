As the program proceeded, however, some military personnel and their families raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of the anthrax vaccine. Acknowledging both the need to protect military personnel and the concerns about the anthrax vaccine, congress directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry out a research program on its safety and efficacy. To assist in the development of this program, CDC requested the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to convene a committee to review the completeness and appropriateness of the research program. In An Assessment of the CDC Anthrax Vaccine Safety and Efficacy Research Program, the committee makes an overall assessment of the CDD research plan and reviews the specific studies proposed by CDC in the three areas of efficacy, safety and acceptability. The committee also notes additional research needs that became evident following the bioterrorist events of 2001 and makes recommendations about the leadership of the research program.Table of Contents Front Matter Executive Summary 1 Introduction 2 Background 3 The CDC Anthrax Vaccine Research Plan 4 Proposed Studies on the Efficacy of the Anthrax Vaccine 5 Proposed Studies on the Safety of the Anthrax Vaccine 6 Proposed Studies on the Acceptability of the Anthrax Vaccine 7 Summary Assessment of the CDC Anthrax Vaccine Research Plan Appendix A Biographical Sketches Appendix B Information-Gathering Meeting Agendas Appendix C Anthrax Vaccine Safety & Efficacy Research Plan Appendix D Food and Drug Administration Final Rule: New Drug andBiological Drug Products; Evidence Needed to DemonstrateEffectiveness of New Drugs When Human Efficacy Studies Are NotEthical or Feasible Appendix E Department of Defense Memorandum: Reintroduction of theAnthrax Vaccine Immunization Program Appendix F Institute of Medicine: CDC Anthrax Vaccine Safety &Efficacy Research Program.
