Governmental approval of a technology is not necessarily sufficient to render it of proven benefit or appropriate or effective for a particular diagnosis or treatment of a Member's particular condition, as explained below.

Any medical device, drug, or biological product must have received final approval to market by the FDA for the particular diagnosis or condition. A ny other approval granted as an interim step in the FDA regulatory process, e.g., an Investigational Device Exempti on or an Investigational New Drug Exemption, is not sufficient.

The American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information; or II. The United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information. 13 recognize the usage as appropriate medical treatment. As an alternative to such recognition in one or more of the compendia, the usage of the drug will be recognized as appropriate if it is recommended by a clinical study or recommended by a review article in a major peer - reviewed professional journal. A medical device, drug, or biolog ical product that meets the above tests will not be considered Experimental or Investigational. In any event, any drug which the Food and Drug Administration has determined to be contraindicated for the specific treatment for which the drug has been presc ribed will be considered Experimental or Investigational. 2. Conclusive evidence from the published peer -reviewed medical literature must exist that the technology has a definite positive effect on health outcomes; such evidence must include well - designed investigations that have been reproduced by nonaffiliated authoritative sources, with measurable results, backed up by the positive endorsements of national medical bodies or panels regarding scientific efficacy and rationale; 3. Demonstrated evidence as reflected in the published peer -reviewed medical literature must exist that over time the technology leads to improvement in health outcomes, i.e., the beneficial effects outweigh any harmful effects; 4. Proof as reflected in the published peer -reviewed medical literature must exist that the technology is at least as effective in improving health outcomes as established technology, or is usable in appropriate clinical contexts in which established technology is not employable; and 5. Proof as reflected i n the published peer -reviewed medical literature must exist that improvements in health outcomes, as defined in paragraph 3, is possible in standard conditions of medical practice, outside clinical investigatory settings.

To initiate a Stage 2 appeal, follow the same process required for a Stage 1 appeal, except that such request must be submitted within sixty (60) days from your receipt of a Stage 1 Appeal decision. Provide all relevant docume ntation with your Stage 2 level appeal request. Most requests for a Stage 2 review will be conducted by the Appeals Committee, which consists of at least one Physician reviewer and two other Physicians/health care professionals. Anyone involved in the pri or decision may not vote on the Appeals Committee. The committee will consult with at least one Physician in the same or similar specialty as the care under consideration, as determined by the Healthplan Medical Director.

To initiate a review, you or your Provider, on your behalf, should complete the State of New Jersey IURO forms provided by Healthplan and mail the completed forms to: Consumer Protection Services New Jer sey Department of Banking and Insurance 20 West State Street, 9 th Floor P.O. Box 329 Trenton, NJ 08625- 0329 (888) 393- 1062 along with a check or money order for twenty -five dollars ($25.00) payable to the \"New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance\" (this fee may be waived in cases of financial hardship , cannot exceed $75 for all appeals submitted annually, and will be refunded if the original adverse benefit determination is overturned). If a Provider is appealing to the IURO on your behalf, the Provider is responsible for paying your portion of the cost of the IURO appeal. The Healthplan will bear the remaining costs of the review. You or your Provider, on your behalf, may also request review of your appeal by the IURO if the Healthplan has missed any timeframes associated with the processing of your medical necessity appeal. If this is the case, you must certify to the IURO that you or your Provider, on your behalf, did not hinder the Healthplan from making a timely determination by failing to pro vide the information required for the Healthplan to make its decision. A review by the IURO may also be requested before exhaustion of the internal appeal process if we expressly waive our requirement of an internal review of any appeal, or if you have or your Provider has applied for expedited external review at the same time as applying for an expedited internal appeal request. Expedited external review may be requested for any of the following: cases that involve care for an urgent or emergency case; an admission; availability of care; continued stay; health care services for which you've received emergency services but have not yet been discharged from a facility; or a medical condition for which the standard review time frame would seriously jeopardiz e your life or health or ability to regain maximum function. Once the IURO communicates its decision, the Healthplan will respond within ten (10) business days to you (or the Provider on your behalf), the IURO and the Department of Banking and Insurance wi th a written report describing how the Healthplan will implement the IURO's decision. 36 The External Appeals Program is a voluntary program. The decision of the IURO is binding on the Healthplan. Notice of Benefit Determination on Appeal Every notice of a determination on appeal will be provided in writing or electronically and, if an adverse determination, will include: (1) information sufficient to identify the claim; (2) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination; ( 3) reference to the s pecific plan provisions on which the determination is based; ( 4) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other Relevant Information as defined; ( 5) a statement describing: (a) the procedure to initiate the next level of appeal; (b) any voluntary appeal procedures offered by the plan ; and (c) the claimant's right to bring an action under ERISA section 502(a); ( 6) upon request and free of charge, a copy of any internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion that was relied upon in making the adverse determination regarding your appeal, and an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for a determination that is based on a medica l necessity, experimental treatment or other similar exclusion or limit ; and (7) information about any office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman available to assist you in the appeal process.

One way to find out what may be available is to contact your local U.S. Department of Labor office and your State insurance regulatory agency. You may also contact the Plan Adm inistrator. Relevant Information Relevant Information is any document, record, or other information which was (a) relied upon in making the benefit determination; (b) was submitted, considered, or generated in the course of making the benefit determination , without regard to whether such document, record, or other information was relied upon in making the benefit determination; (c) demonstrates compliance with the administrative processes and safeguards required by federal law in making the benefit determin ation; or (d) constitutes a statement of policy or guidance with respect to the plan concerning the denied treatment option or benefit or the claimant's diagnosis, without regard to whether such advice or statement was relied upon in making the benefit det ermination. 37 Legal Action Following Appeals If your plan is governed by ERISA, you have the right to bring a civil action in federal court under Section 502(a) of ERISA if you are not satisfied with the outcome of the Appeals Procedure. In most instances, you may not initiate a legal action against the Healthplan until you have completed the Level One and Level Two Appeal processes. If your Appeal is expedited, there is no need to complete the Level Two process prior to bringing legal action in federal court. If your plan is governed by New Jersey P.L.2001, c.187 (2A:53A -30 et seq), you have the right to bring action in state court accordance with that statute.

This provision allows U s to coordinate the services and supplies We provide with what Medicare pays or what Medicare would pay. This provision also allows us to coordinate benefits with what a group Health Benefits Plan, Group Health Plan, Governmental Plan, or Church Plan pays. Coordination of benefits is intended to avoid duplication of benefits while at the same time preserving certain rights to coverag e under all P lans under which the Member is covered. Please note: The ONLY circumstance in which a person may be covered under both this Contract and under Medicare or coverage under a group Health Benefits Plan, Group Health Plan, Governmental Plan, or Chur ch Plan occur when a Member is already covered under this Contract and subsequently becomes eligible for Medicare or coverage under a group Health Benefits Plan, Group Health Plan, Governmental Plan, or Church Plan. DEFINITIONS The words shown below have special meanings when used in this provision. Please read these definitions carefully. Throughout this provision, these defined terms appear with their initial letter capitalized. Allowable Expense : The charge for any health care service, supply or other item of expense for which the Member is liable when the health care service, supply or other item of expense is covered at least in part under any of the Plans involved, except where a statute requires another definition, or as otherwise stated below . We will not consider the difference between the cost of a private hospital room and that of a semi -private hospital room as an Allowable Expense unless the stay in a private room is Medically Necessary and Appropriate. Allowable Charge : An amount that is not more than the allowance for the service or supply as determined by Us, based on a standard which is most often charged for a given service by a Provider within the same geographic area. Claim Determination Period : A Calendar Year, or portion of a Calendar Year, during which a Member is covered by this Contract and covered by or eligible to be covered by Medicare and incurs one or more Allowable Expense(s) under such plans. Plan : Coverage with which coordination of benefits is allowed. Plan inc ludes: a) Group insurance and group subscriber contracts, including insurance continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law; 77 b) Self-funded arrangements of group or group -type coverage, including insurance continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law; c) Group or group- type coverage through a health maintenance organization (HMO) or other prepayment, group practice and individual practice plans, including insurance continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law; d) Group hospital indemnity benefit amounts that exceed $150 per day; e) Medicare or other governmental benefits, except when, pursuant to law, the benefits must be treated as in excess of those of any private insurance plan or non-governmental plan. For purposes of determining plans with which this plan can coordinate, Plan does not include: a) Individual or family insurance contracts or subscriber contracts; b) Individual or family coverage through a health maintenance organization or under any other prepayment, group practice and in dividual practice plans; c) Group or group -type coverage where the cost of coverage is paid solely by the Member, except that coverage being continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law shall be considered a Plan; d) Group hospital indemnity benefit amounts of $150 per day or less; e) School accident -type coverage; f) A State plan under Medicaid. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PLAN We consider each plan separately when coordinating payments. For the purpose of coordinating benefits with this individual Contract, Medicare or coverage under a group Health Benefits Plan, Group Health Plan, Governmental Plan, or Church Plan is always the Primary Plan and this Contract is always the Secondary Plan. Medicare or coverage under a group Health Benefits Plan, Group Health Plan, Governmental Plan or Church Plan pays or provides services or supplies first, without taking into consideration the existence of this Contract. This Contract takes into consideration the benefits provided by Medicare or coverage under a group Hea lth Benefits Plan, Group Health Plan, Governmental Plan, or Church Plan. During each Claim Determination Period, this Contract will pay up to the remaining unpaid allowable expenses, but this Contract will not pay more than it would have paid if it had be en the Primary Plan. The method this Contract uses to determine the amount to pay is set forth below in the \" Procedures to be Followed by the Secondary Plan to Calculate Benefits\" section of this provision. This Contract shall not reduce Allowable Expens es for medically necessary and appropriate services or supplies on the basis that precertification, pre -approval, notification or second surgical opinion procedures were not followed. 78 Procedures to be Followed by the Secondary Plan to Calculate Benefits In order to determine which procedure to follow , it is necessary to consider: a) the basis on which the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan pay benefits; and b) whether the provider who provides or arranges the services and supplies is in the network of either the Primary Plan or the Secondary Plan. Benefits may be based on the Allowed Charge (AC) or some similar term. This means that the provider bills a charge and the Member may be held liable for the full amount of the billed charge. In this section, a Plan that bases benefits on an allowed charge is called an \"A C Plan.\" Benefits may be based on a contractual fee schedule, sometimes called a negotiated fee schedule, or some similar term. This means that although a provider, called a network provider , bills a charge, the Member may be held liable only for an amount up to the negotiated fee. In this section, a Plan that bases benefits on a negotiated fee schedule is called a \"Fee Schedule Plan.\" An HMO and Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO) are examples of network only plans that could use a fee schedule. If the Member uses the services of a non -network provider, the plan will be treated as an A C Plan even though the plan under which he or she is covered allows for a fee schedule. Payment to the provider may be based on a \"capitation\". This means that then HMO or other plans pays the provider a fixed amount per Member. The Member is liable only for the applicable deductible, coinsurance or copayment. If the Member uses the services of a non- network provider, the HMO , EPO or other plans will only pay benefits in the event of emergency care or urgent care. In this section, a Plan that pays providers based upon capitation is called a \"Capitation Plan.\" In the rules below, \"provider\" refers to the provider who provides or arranges the services or supplies and \"HMO\" refers to a health maintenance organization plan , and \"EPO\" refers to Exclusive Provider Organization. Primary Plan is A C Plan and Secondary Plan is A C Plan The Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) the difference between the amount of the billed charges and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or b) the amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. When the benefits of the Secondary Plan are reduced as a result of this calculation, each benefit shall be reduced in proportion, and the amount paid shall be charged against any applicable benefit limit of the plan. Primary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan and Secondary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan If the provider is a network provider in both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan, the Allowable Expense shall be the fee schedule of the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: 79 a) The amount of any deductible, coinsurance or copayment required by the Primary Plan; or b) the amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. The total amount the provider receives from the Primary plan, the Secondary plan and the Member shall not exceed the fee schedule of the Primary Plan. In no event shall the Member be responsible for any payment in excess of the copayment, coinsurance or deductible of the Secondary Plan. Primary Plan is A C Plan and Secondary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan If the provider is a network provider in the Secondary Plan, the Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) the difference between the amount of the billed charges for the Allowable Expenses and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or b) the amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. The Member shall only be liable for the copayment, deductible or coinsurance under the Secondary Plan if the Member has no liability for copayment, deductible or coinsurance under the Primary Plan and the total payments by both the primary and Secondary Plans are less than the provider's billed charges. In no event shall the Member be responsible for any payment in excess of the copayment, coinsurance or deductible of the Secondary Plan. Primary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan and Secondary Plan is A C Plan If the provider is a network provider in the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expense considered by the Secondary Plan shall be the fee schedule of the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) The amount of any deductible, coinsurance or copa yment required by the Primary Plan; or b) the amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. Primary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan and Secondary Plan is A C Plan or Fee Schedule Plan If the Primary Plan is an HMO or EPO plan that does not allow for the use of non-network providers except in the event of urgent care or emergency care and the service or supply the Member receives from a non -network provider is not considered as urgent care or emergency care, the Secondary Plan shall pa y benefits as if it were the Primary Plan. Primary Plan is Capitation Plan and Secondary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan or A C Plan If the Member receives services or supplies from a provider who is in the network of both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan , the Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) The amount of any deductible, coinsurance or copayment required by the Primary Plan; or b) the amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. 80 Primary Plan is Capitation Plan or F ee Schedule Plan or R& C Plan and Secondary Plan is Capitation Plan If the Member receives services or supplies from a provider who is in the network of the Secondary Plan, the Secondary Plan shall be liable to pay the capitation to the provider and shall not be liable to pay the deductible, coinsurance or copayment imposed by the Primary Plan. The Member shall not be liable to pay any deductible, coinsurance or copayments of either the Primary Plan or the Secondary Plan. Primary Plan is an HMO and Secon dary Plan is an HMO or EPO If the Primary Plan is an HMO or EPO plan that does not allow for the use of non- network providers except in the event of urgent care or emergency care and the service or supply the Member receives from a non -network provider is not considered as urgent care or emergency care, but the provider is in the network of the Secondary Plan, the Secondary Plan shall pay benefits as if it were the Primary Plan. Except that the Primary Plan shall pay out -of-Network services, if any, authori zed by the Primary Plan. 81 SERVICES FOR AUTOMOBILE RELATED INJURIES This section will be used to determine a Member's coverage under this Contract when services are provided as a result of an automobile related Injury. Definitions \"Automobile Related In jury\" means bodily Injury sustained by a Member as a result of an accident: a) while occupying, entering, leaving or using an automobile; or b) as a pedestrian; caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile. \"Allowable Expens e\" means a medically necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense covered at least in part as an eligible expense or eligible services by: a) this Contract; b) PIP; or c) OSAIC. \"Eligible Services\" means services provided for treatment of an Injury which is covered under this Contract without application of Cash Deductibles and Copayments, if any or Coinsurance. \"Out -of-State Automobile Insurance Coverage\" or \"OSAIC\" means any coverage for medical expenses under an automobile insurance policy other than PIP. OSAIC includes automobile insurance policies issued in another state or jurisdiction. \"PIP\" means personal injury protection coverage provided as part of an automobile insurance policy issued in New Jersey. PIP refers specifically to provisio ns for medical expense coverage. Determination of primary or secondary coverage. This Contract provides secondary coverage to PIP unless health coverage has been elected as primary coverage by or for the Member under this Contract. This election is made by the named insured under a PIP policy. Such election affects that person's family members who are not themselves named insureds under another automobile policy. This Contract may be primary for one Member, but not for another if the person has a separa te automobile policy and has made different selection regarding primacy of health coverage. This Contract is secondary to OSAIC, unless the OSAIC contains provisions which make it secondary or excess to the Contractholder's plan. In that case this Contra ct will be primary. If there is a dispute as to which policy is primary, this Contract will pay benefits or provide services as if it were primary. 82 Services this Contract will provide if it is primary to PIP or OSAIC. If this Contract is primary to PIP or OSAIC it will provide benefits for eligible expenses in accordance with its terms. Benefits this Contract will pay if it is secondary to PIP or OSAIC. If this Contract is secondary to PIP or OSAIC the actual benefits payable will be the lesser of: a) the Allowable Expenses left uncovered after PIP or OSAIC has provided coverage after applying Cash Deductibles and Copayments, or b) the equivalent value of services if this Contract had been primary. 83 GENERAL PROVISIONS AMENDMENT We may make amendments to the Contract upon 30 days' notice to the Contractholder, and as provided in (b) and (c) below. An amendment will not affect benefits for a service or supply furnished before the date of change; and no change to the benefits under this Contract will be made without the approval of the Board.

ASSIGNMENT No assignment or transfer by the Contractholder of any of the Contractholder's interest under this Contract or by a Member of any of his or her interest under this Contract is valid unless We consent thereto. CLERICAL ERROR - MISSTATEMENTS No clerical error nor programming or systems error by the Contractholder or by Us in keeping any records pertaining to coverage under this Contract will reduce a Member's Coverage. Neither will delays in making entries on those records reduce it. However, if We discover such an error or delay, a fair adjustment of premiums will be made. Premium adjustments involving return of unearned premium to the Contractholder will be limited to the period of 12 months preceding the date of Our re ceipt of satisfactory evidence that such adjustments should be made. If Your age, or any other relevant facts, are found to have been misstated, and the premiums are thereby affected, an equitable adjustment of premiums will be made.
