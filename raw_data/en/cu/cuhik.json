Greens are a great support for the Liver and for nourishing and cleansing toxins out of our system in a healthy and supportive way. Clean Green Soup Recipe is written by one of my favorite Health Chefs, Rebecca Katz, who combines her knowledge of cooking with her expertise in nutrition and health/wellness [Rebecca Katz, MS](https://www.rebeccakatz.com/about) Extra-virgin olive oil 1 large yellow onion, diced 1 large Yukon gold or Yellow Finn potato, peeled and diced small Sea salt 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 generous pinch red pepper flakes 6 cups [Magic Mineral Broth](https://www.rebeccakatz.com/magic-mineral-broth) or store bought organic vegetable broth, plus an extra cup if needed 1 bunch collards, stemmed and coarsely chopped 1 bunch green chard, stemmed and coarsely chopped 1 cup loosely packed chopped fresh parsley 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat, then add the onion, potato, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and saut\u00e9 until the onion is golden, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and stir for another 30 seconds. Pour in 1/2 cup of the broth, stirring to loosen any bits stuck to the pot, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Add in the collards and chard and another 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Stir well to combine so that the greens will wilt. Then add the remaining 5 1/2 cups of broth, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. In a blender, puree the soup in batches until very smooth, each time adding the cooking liquid first and then the greens mixture. Blend the parsley into the last batch. Pour the soup back into the pot, heat gently, and stir in the lemon zest and juice. Taste; you may want to add a pinch more salt. Serve garnished with a drizzle of olive oil.
