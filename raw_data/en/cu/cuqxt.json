This traditional medicine is based on the belief that illness is caused by an imbalance of vital energies in the body. In modern terms, acupuncture can help by increasing blood flow, which increases tissue oxygenation. At The Pet Hospitals, we feel that we can obtain the best results by using acupuncture as a supplement to medical therapy to help restore your pet's health and vitality. The Acupuncture Technique Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into an animal's body at specific points known as meridians, where blood vessels and nerves converge. The needles assist in the movement of vital energy along these meridians, supporting the nervous system and promoting circulation while also enhancing the body's healing abilities.
