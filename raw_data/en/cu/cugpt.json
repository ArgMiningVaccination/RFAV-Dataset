The intent is to engage a broad range of sectors and stakeholders, including public polic y makers, corporations/industry, non-government organizations and academia, in a collaborative e ffort to address the wholly preventable and treatable epidemic of obesity. Various groups have been established by the Task Force, including provincial- and community-level collaboratives, as well as content-specific working groups such as the Working Group on Data and Evidence (WGDE). This document is the report of the WGDE. The purpose of the WGDE is to act as an advisory body that will develop recommendations in the area of data, evidence, evaluation, and surveilla nce for consideration by the Provincial and Community Collaboratives in support of the BC ORS. The WGDE consists of a group of 14 individuals with expertise in epidemiology, surveillance, evaluation, and research. Recommendations of the WGDE are based on input from the other working groups, the experts on the WGDE and the work commissioned for this project. Obesity in Canada There are a number of data sources for the surveillance of obesity in Canada. Despite their availability, each data source has a number of im portant limitations. A key limitation for adults is that obesity tends to be calculated based on an individual's self-reported, rather than measured, height and weight. These limitations are most significant when attempting to assess overweight and obesity in children and adolescents, in particular changes in rates over time. Based on available information, the proportion of Canadian youth who are overweight or obese continues to increase. The key significance of this trend is that excess weight in children tends to persist into adulthood. This resu lts in an increased risk for future health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, digestive disease, and joint disorders. From a public health perspective obesity has reac hed epidemic proportions. Recommendations The WGDE recognizes the existence of data s ources for both adult and childhood obesity in Canada. The intent of the following recommenda tions is to improve on these data sources by addressing current limitations. In the mean time, however, the available data sources will continue to be accessed and utilized within the context of their limitations. In addition, the Obesity Reduction Task Force w ill be recommending that Aboriginal communities and organizations be supported in the development and implementation of an obesity reduction strategy that is specific for Aboriginal people. It is understood that recommendations to monitor the July 2010 Page 5 impact of that strategy will be part of the Abor iginal-specific strategy and thus are not included as recommendations in this report. Surveillance Recommendations 1. Conduct biannual, province-wide surveillance of health behaviours and measured height and weight for Grades 6 and 10. Surveillance conducted using a sampling strategy that allows estimation, at the Health Authority leve l, of health behaviours and BMI for boys and girls separately. Key Features of Recommendation #1 Biannual province-wide survey Use probability proportional sampling to de termine the sample size required to provide Health Authority level estimates 5,488 Grade 6 boys and girls (2,744 each) 5,572 Grade 10 boys and girls (2,786 each) Assessment of health behaviours us ing the SHAPES tool (see Appendix 4) Measurement of height and weight Reports provided to schools participating No individual reporting of findings, all re sults reported at an aggregate level - school, HA, and provincial Use lessons learned by PHSA with th e HASAC project (see Appendix 3) 2. Conduct biannual, province-wide surveillance of policies and activities supporting healthy eating and physical activity for schools, muni cipalities and health authorities. Survey the school administration and municipalities of th e schools selected for the surveillance of students. Key Features of Recommendation #2 School administration in each school that is selected for survey is asked to complete a survey assessing their policies and activities that support healthy living (see Appendix 5) Municipal administration of each community that has a school selected for the survey is asked to complete a survey assessing their policies and activities that support healthy living (see Appendix 6) Health Authorities are asked to compile information from the above two sources to identify gaps in policies and activities that support healthy living 3. Develop a toolkit for schools that are not selected for surveillance, allowing them to conduct their own surveillance of health behaviours (food and physical activity) and measured height and weight. Key Features of Recommendation #3 1. Provide processing of surveys for schools that wish to conduct their own surveillance 4. Conduct province-wide surveillance of measured height and weight for adults using a sampling strategy that allows estimation at the Health Authority level. July 2010 Page 6 Performance Data Analysis Recommendations 1. Incorporating the ability to analyse quality / performance data is a vital part of program planning, implementation and delivery, and should be embedded in the ORS from the outset 2. Analysis of quality / performance da ta should be regular and routine 3. Analysis of quality / performance data shoul d not be dependent on unpredictable granting regimes 4. Resource needs for analysis of quality / perfo rmance data should be routinely identified, quantified and incorporated into annual operating budgets 5. Use existing resources and tools to facilitate analysis of quality / performance (e.g., the CAPTURE project http://www.thecaptureproject.ca/ , see also Appendix 7) July 2010 Page 7 Introduction Obesity Reduction Strategy for BC On April 2nd, 2009 the BC Health Officers Council passed a unanimous resolution to develop a comprehensive Obesity Reduction Strategy (ORS) fo r British Columbia. The intent is to engage a broad range of sectors and stakeholders, including public policy makers, corporations/industry, non-government organizations and academia, in a collaborative effort to address this wholly preventable and treatable epidemic. The Provincia l Health Services Authority is tasked with supporting the development of ORS, and an Obesity Reduction Task Force has been formed to steward its development. The various groups established by the Task Force and their mandates are highlighted below. Task Force: Mandate is to develop the comprehensiv e Obesity Reduction Strategy for BC and mobilize for commitment and action. ( Chair: John Millar ) Provincial Level Collaborative: Mandate is to build the provincia l level strategies/interventions for inclusion in the ORS. Membership includes stak eholders with appropriate level of authority to recommend actions to their organizations from sect ors that have jurisdiction and mandate to implement provincial level actions. (Co-chairs: Task Force member and other stakeholder) Community Level Collaborative: Mandate is to build community level strategies/interventions for inclusion in the ORS. Membership includes stake holders with appropriate level of authority to recommend actions to their organizations from sect ors that have jurisdiction and mandate to implement community based actions. (Co-chairs: Task Force member and other stakeholder) Content Specific Working Groups: Mandate is to propose provincial-level and community-based strategies/interventions to transform the food and physical activity environments as well as propose treatment options. Membership includes content experts from sectors relevant to each content area. (Each Working Group to be co-chaired by a Task Force member and other stakeholder) Working Group on Data and Evidence The mandate of the Working Group on Data and Evidence (WGDE) is to provide expertise on content, tools and processes for ep idemiology, surveillance, evalua tion, and research. Membership includes technical experts in each area mentioned. (Co-chaired by Task Force member) This document is the report of the Working Group on Data and Evidence. Purpose The purpose of the WGDE is to act as an advisory body that will develop recommendations in the area of data, evidence, evaluation, and surveilla nce for consideration by the Provincial and Community Collaboratives in support of the BC Obesity Reduction Strategy. These recommendations will support the strategy recommend ations made by the other Obesity Strategy Working Groups that will range from environmental, policy, and behavioral approaches to obesity reduction. Responsibilities More specifically, the responsibilities of the WGDE are to: Provide expertise, advice and guidance July 2010 Page 8 As a group, identify data, evidence, and r esearch gaps and propose data collection strategies, promising practices, and other relevant methods Identify current initiatives in BC Identify national/international evaluated promising practices Identify gaps in surveillance Submit recommendations to Task Force, and Provincial and Community Collaboratives for review Review potential strategies for acceptability, f easibility, equity, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability Share or contribute resources where relevant. Approach The WGDE consists of a group of 14 individuals with expertise in epidemiology, surveillance, evaluation, and research (see Acknowledgements section above). The co-chairs of the WGDE are members of the other working groups, thus keeping the group apprised of progress by these groups. In addition to a series of meetings/teleconfer ences, the WGDE commissioned several reviews, including an overview of various surveillance pr ograms worldwide and within Canada specific to children and youth (see Appendix 1) as well as one on a rationale for investment in performance data analysis (see Appendix 2). Recommendations of the WGDE are based on input from the other working groups, the experts on the WGDE and the work commissioned for this project. Obesity in Canada There are a number of data sources for the surveillance of obesity in Canada. Despite their availability, each data source has a number of important limitations. These limitations are most significant when attempting to assess overweight a nd obesity in children and adolescents, in particular changes in rates over time. Adult Obesity in Canada Perhaps the most important resource for surveilla nce data on adult obesity in Canada is the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). The CCHS is a cross-sectional survey that collects information related to health status, health car e utilization, and health determinants for the Canadian population. Prior to 2007, data collec tion occurred every two years for an annual period. Data are available for the 2001, 2003 and 2005 peri ods. In 2007, major changes were made to the survey design, resulting in yearly data collection; thus, data is available for 2007 and 2008. The target population of the CCHS is Canadians aged 12 years and older, living in private occupied dwellings in health regions c overing all provinces and territories. Excluded from the survey are individuals living on Indian Reserves and on Crown Lands, institutional residents, full-time members of the Canadian Forces, and residents of certain remote regions. Results on overweight and obesity based on CCHS self-reported height and weight are summarized on the following figure. July 2010 Page 9 While data for youth ages 12+ are collected for th e CCHS, there are several problems with this data. First, the sample sizes are quite small, usually only allowing for information at the provincial level. These sample sizes are not sufficient to yield a representative estimate for B.C. Sufficient data for adults, on the other hand, is usually ava ilable for comparisons at a sub-provincial level (for e.g., by Health Services Delivery Area in B.C.). S econd, the results for youth are usually provided by their caregiver, thus potentially leading to in accurate information. Fina lly, for both adults and children, overweight and obesity rates are calcu lated based on self-reported height and weight. Individuals tend to overestimate their own height and underestimate their weight, thus leading to lower overall rates of reported overweight and obesity. Childhood Obesity in Canada Based on available information, the proportion of Canadian youth who are overweight or obese continues to increase. The key significance of this trend is that excess weight in children tends to persist into adulthood.1,2 This results in an increased risk for future health problems such as 1 Whitaker RC, Wright JA, Pepe MS et al. Predicting obesity in young adulthood from childhood and parental obesity. New England Journal of Medicine. 1997; 337(13): 869-73. 2 Singh AS, Mulder C, Twisk JW et al.

July 2010 Page 10 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, digestive disease, and joint disorders.3,4 From a public health perspective obesity has reached epidemic proportions. Perhaps the best indication of the change in pr evalence of overweight and obesity of Canadian children over time is a 2006 re port from Statistics Canada. 5 The report uses measured height and weight in calculating overweight and obesity prev alence amongst children and youth (aged 2-17) between 1978/79 and 2004. The author notes that th e 1978/79 survey was the last time (prior to 2004) that \"interviewers directly measured the height and weight of a nationally representative sample of Canadians. In the past, most health surveys relied on respondents to report their height and weight, a practice that tended to underestimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents and adults.\" The report shows an increase in the rate of childhood overweight and obesity from 15% to 26% over the 25 year period, with obesity nearly trip ling from 3% to 8% (see following below). This increase is most pronounced in the adolescent years. A 2000 study by Tremblay and Willms reported similar findings. They found that between 1981 and 1996 the prevalence of overweight and obesity of Canadian youth aged 7-13 increased from 11.4% to 29.3%, with BMI increasing at an average of almost 0.1kg/m 2 per year. 6,7 3 Maffeis C, Tato L.

The highest rates are found amongst the Atlantic Provinces, but Willms et al. note that there seems to be a cultural component at play, given the dramatic difference in prev alence rates between neighbouring provinces such as Quebec and New Brunswick.8 A more recent Canadian survey has continued to measure childhood and adult obesity. The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) is a national health survey being conducted by Statistics Canada under the Statisti cs Act in partnership with Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.9 The CHMS takes direct physical measurements from people aged 3 to 79 for the purpose of determining physical fitness, hear t and lung health, obesity and hypertension. The measurements are made by trained specialists at a mobile examination centre that is located in specific sites. Participants also complete a house hold interview to provide information on nutrition, smoking habits, alcohol use and other factors, as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. The first cycle of the CHMS began in March 2007 and concluded in Fe bruary 2009; the second cycle began in late August 2009. Over the next two years, the survey will visit 16 sites in 7 provinces to collect information about the general health and lifestyle characteristics of about 5,700 Canadians. This figure includes a target of 360 residents of Richmond this summer followed by 360 residents of the central and east Kootenay region in the fall. Statistics Canada is examining the possibility of adding a third site in British Colu mbia in 2011 to augment the survey sample. 8 Willms JD, Tremblay MS, Katzmarzyk PT.

The data is presented in the figure below, and hi ghlights the variance between the two classification systems. Although the combined prevalence of overw eight/obesity is relatively consistent between the two, there is considerable variance between the prevalence rates of obesity and overweight individually. The CDC method places more individuals in the obese category and correspondingly fewer in the overweight category. In addition to the two aforementioned classifica tion methods, in 2007 the WHO introduced its own classification system. Shields and Tremblay note that the WHO method classifies more individuals as overweight/obese than either the Cole (IOTF) or the CDC methods. They go on to explain the possible reasons for this variance: 10 The differences observed in estimates of the percentage of overweight or obese children and youth are likely due to differen ces in the samples on which the three sets of cut-points are based, methods used in curve construction and the criteria used to specify the cut-points. The WHO growth cu rves for 0- to 5-year-olds are based on a standard (rather than a reference population), which is an attempt to describe how children should grow versus how they do grow... By contrast, the CDC and IOTF growth curves are based on reference populat ions (nationally representative samples of children selected over time) and they reflect the growth of these children. The higher percentage of 2- to 5-year olds classified as overweight or obese, based on the 10 Shields M, Tremblay MS. Canadian childhood obesit y estimates based on WHO, IOTF and CDC cut-points.

This variance highlights the fact that when interpreting prevalence estimates for excess weight among children and youth it is crucial to consider the method used as it directly impacts the results; consistency in data collection a nd interpretation is needed particularly when tracking prevalence rates over time. Cycle 1 data has also been used to track trends over time, with two notable reports published on the Fitness of Canadian Children and Youth 11 and Canadian Adults.12 Comparison with measured rates of BMI from the 1981 Canadian Fitness Survey foun d that both boys and girls of all age cohorts had statistically significant increases in mean BMI over the time period. Trends in Childhood Obesity in England and the United States Unlike Canada, the systematic surveillance of ch ildhood obesity has taken place in jurisdictions such as England and the United States for some time. In England, for example, children have been incl uded in the Health Survey for England since 1995; as part of this survey, height and weight meas urements are taken. The UK National BMI percentiles have been used to define overweight and obesity in children as at or above the 85th or 95th BMI percentiles respectively of the 1990 reference popul ation. The following chart shows the trend in overweight and obesity prevalence for children in England from 1995 - 2008: 11 Tremblay MS, Shields M, Laviolette M et al.

In the U.S., historical data is also available re garding overweight prevalence in children (obesity in children was not defined), as far back as 1971. Note that in the following chart the year groupings are variable, and data is missing for some years. D espite this, it is apparent that the rising trend in overweight prevalence has reversed since 2003 in the 2-5-year and 6-11-year age groups, while it continues to increase in the 12-19-year age group. Conclusions such as those drawn from surveillance data in England and the US are simply not possible in Canada due to a lack of appropriate surveillance data. The British Columbia Health Assessment of School-Aged Children (HASAC) Project Many jurisdictions have begun to address the lack of appropriate surveillance data by implementing health surveillance programs specific to children and youth (see Appendix 1). In British Columbia, the Health Assessment of School-Aged Children (HASAC) project is an initiative by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) with funding provided by the BC Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport, the PHSA, and Child Health BC. HASAC is designed to help BC schools plan health improvement activity by collecting data on nutrition, physical activity, smoking behaviour, and self-perception of grade six students. The Health Assessment is taken during school hours and has been completed twice thus far, in 2008 and 2009. The 2009 survey covered 19 schools in to tal, 15 elementary schools and 4 middle schools from across British Columbia; this represented two more schools than the year prior. 0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%18%20% 19711974 1976 1980 1988 1994 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006Prevalence of Overweight YearOverweight* Prevalence in Children Based on Measured Height & Weight USA, 19712006, by Age Group 25 years 611 years 1219 years*Overweight is defined as a above the sexand agespecific 95th percentile BMI cut points from the 2000 CDC Growth Charts.

Following are several highlights from that report: 33% of girls and 34% of boys reported consumi ng vegetables and fruit at least six times the day before the survey 20% of students correctly identified that people their age (9-13) should eat 6 servings of fruit and vegetables per day 26% of students reported eating whole grains, such as whole grain bread or pasta, at least three times in the previous day 77% of students reported eating candy, bake d sweets or frozen desserts, 53% reported eating salty snacks at least once the previous day, and 71% reported drinking at least one serving of a sweetened beverage the day prior to the survey 14% of students were physically active for at least 90 minutes every day of the previous week 24% of students report typically spending more than 3 hours watching TV, on computer or on the phone per day Using BMI calculations based on measured height and weight, 34% of males and 27% of females are overweight or obese Obesity and Health Disparities The obesity epidemic is understood as a complex issue that is difficult to define and an issue that has no clear or immediate solution. Resulting from a multi-faceted system of causes, it calls for a comprehensive, cross-cutting, long-term strategy that requires action from multiple stakeholders at multiple levels. Though obesity results from c onsuming too many calories and not expending enough of them at an individual level, the epidemic results from broad societal changes that have taken place in the past thirty plus years. Changes in values as well as changes in people's environments that give easy access to high calor ie foods and decrease opportunities for expending energy are thought to be the key drivers of the epidemic. Interventions targeting individuals are important; however, to reverse the epidemic one must also emphasize the transformation of people's environments to make the healthy option the easy choice. One of the additional challenges in addressing the ob esity epidemic is that of health disparities. Health disparities, or inequities, are systematic differences in health status between different socioeconomic groups. In British Columbia, there are a significant number of disadvantaged people who experience lower levels of health than av erage; these include the unemployed and working poor, children and families living in poverty, people with addictions and/or mental illness, Aboriginal people, new immigrants, and the homeless. 13 Disparities in the prevalence of obesity are most commonly associated with racial/ethnic background and socioeconomic status (SES). In general, \"children from families with lower income and lower levels of education ha ve poorer overall health and higher rates of cognitive difficulties, behavioural issues, hyperactivity and obesity through childhood. The consequences of these disadvantages include children growing into adults with lower educational attainment, weaker 13 Health Officers Council of BC. Health Inequities in British Columbia Discussion Paper , Nov 2008.

Widespread environmental factors such as food availability, food advertising, school policies, recreational facilities, and opportunities for safe, affordable physical activity either directly or indirectly influence health and survival; these factors may often be stratified by racial/ethnic background and SES, and result in an \"obesogenic\" environment for low-income and/or ethnic minority youth. 15 Of the two indicators - SES and racial/ethnic background - the latter is more straightforward as a survey element. B.C.'s largest ethnic populations are Chinese, South Asian, Aboriginal, Filipino, Korean, and Southeast Asian.16 With regard to SES, a wide range of indicators may be used to determine SES levels for children; Shrewsbury & Wardle have recommended that epidemiological studies of adiposity in children include more than one of these indicators, and where possible studies should incorporate SES indicators measure d at both the house hold and neighbourhood level. 17 The following are examples of SES indicators that have been used in U.S. studies of the association of SES with prevalence of overweight in children: Parental education ( < Grade 12, >Grade 12) Parental occupation Family income, i.e.: o < or > 125% of federal poverty level o Poverty income ratio - ratio of household income and the poverty line published by Census Bureau for a certain family size in that calendar year Single-parent household Health insurance status Home postcode Sample Approach to Addressing Childhood Obesity EPODE (Ensemble, Pr\u00e9venons L'Ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 des Enfants: Together Let's Prevent Childhood Obesity) is an integrated European obesity prevention program whose main focus is children and the family. 18 Its principles are: To promote a balanced, diverse, affordable, and fun diet To encourage children and families to be less inactive and to exercise on a regular basis The program is designed to be delivered at a geograp hic level of town or city. The first true EPODE project was initiated in Fleurbaiz and Laventie, two small towns in northern France. Although it began as a school program, the community-at-large ha d become more involved by 1999, helping to 14 Health Officers Council of BC.

July 2010 Page 17 inspire the formal town-wide approach that was launched in 2003. The actual interventions comprised the following: Health check-ups were offered to voluntee rs from Fleurbaiz and Laventie, including a fasting blood sample, a clinical examination, and a questionnaire to screen for on unhealthy habits At-risk individuals were offered family-oriented advice by a dietitian on healthy eating and physical activity Identified health problems (including ch ildhood obesity) were referred to general practitioners Dietitians were also employed to perform inte rventions in schools, community associations, and town meetings Municipal councils supported actions in favour of physical activity, including erecting new sports facilities and employing sport educators to promote physical activity among primary school children Local stakeholders, such as general practiti oners, pharmacists, grocery store owners, and sports organizations set up relevant family activities Newsletters and regular medi a reports were disseminated The related evaluation study included the interv ention towns and two nearby control towns. In 1992, 2000, and then annually from 2002 to 2004, BMI was measured in the entire population of 5- to 12-year-old children in the four towns, with a very high participation rate reported. The prevalence rate for overweight/obesity was signifi cantly lower in the intervention towns in 2004 (8.8% vs. 17.8%). 19 Although scepticism has been expressed in some qua rters about the results, and questions have been raised about the potential adverse effects of the EPODE approach,20 it has been generally evaluated as successful in terms of impact on children's BMI and stakeholder feedback and involvement. As a consequence, the program has now expanded to include nearly 1.8 million inhabitants in 167 French cities, 20 cities in Spain, and 8 cities in Belgium. Cities of varying size (from 10,000 to 100,000 inhabitants) and socioec onomic profiles are involved. Programs based on EPODE are also being implemented in Greece, Au stralia, and Qu\u00e9bec. Other European countries, including Scotland, are actively considering us ing the EPODE approach. One of the latest implementations has occurred in British Columbia , where pilot projects have been launched in Prince George and Abbotsford under the head ing SCOPE (Sustainable Childhood Obesity Prevention through Community Engagement). 21 19 Romon M, Lommez A, Tafflet M et al.

July 2010 Page 18 Summary of Data Limitations in B.C. 1. Sufficient data for adults is available from the CCHS for comparisons at a sub-provincial level (for e.g., by Health Services Delivery Area) but overweight and obesity rates are calculated based on self-reported height and wei ght. Individuals tend to overestimate their own height and underestimate their weight, t hus leading to lower overall rates of reported overweight and obesity. 2. While data for youth ages 12+ are collected for the CCHS, the sample sizes are not sufficient to yield a representative estimate for B.C. In addition, the results for youth are usually provided by their caregiver, thus potentially leading to inaccurate information. 3. Canadian surveys that use direct measurem ent to calculate childhood obesity (e.g. the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) rare ly have a sufficient sample size to allow for valid comparisons at the sub-provincial level. 4. Provincial initiatives such as the Health A ssessment of School-Aged Children (HASAC) tend to be limited in scope (i.e. are not popul ation-based) and duration (i.e. do not cover enough years to allow for the identification of trends). 5. No current B.C. data allows for the analysis of the interaction between overweight/obesity and health disparities. July 2010 Page 19 Recommendations The WGDE recognizes that there are a number of sources of data for both adult and childhood obesity in Canada. The intent of the following recommendations is to improve on these data sources by addressing current limitations. In the mean time, however, the available data sources will continue to be accessed and utilized within the context of their limitations. Rates of overweight and obesity in the Aboriginal population are at least 2 to 4 times that of the non-Aboriginal population. The Obesity Reducti on Task Force will be recommending that Aboriginal communities and organizations be suppor ted in the development and implementation of an obesity reduction strategy that is specific for Aboriginal people. It is understood that recommendations to monitor the impact of that st rategy will be part of the Aboriginal-specific strategy and thus are not included as recommendations in this report. Recommendations from the WGDE Surveillance A review of sample childhood obesity surveillance programs in Canada and abroad is summarized in the following table (see Appendix 1 for further details).

Measurement type(s) : BMI is most common, though measurements of central adiposity in children are increasingly being studied for risk factor prediction utility. Frequency : Many of the surveys were either one-time projects or conducted biannually or on a less frequent basis, only the two surveys in England involve measured height and weight and are conducted on an annual basis. Scope: Most surveys described are designed to give a broad picture of the health and well- being of children, with physical measures being one small component. The exception is England's National Child Measurement Progr amme (NCMP); while this survey only consists of height and weight measurements, it is complemented by the national HSE (Health Survey for England) which includes such measurements as well as information on determinants of overweight and obesity. Surveillance Recommendations 1. Conduct biannual, province-wide surveillance of health behaviours and measured height and weight for Grades 6 and 10. Surveillance conducted using a sampling strategy that allows estimation, at the Health Authority leve l, of health behaviours and BMI for boys and girls separately. Key Features of Recommendation #1 Biannual province-wide survey Use probability proportional sampling to de termine the sample size required to provide Health Authority level estimates 5,488 Grade 6 boys and girls (2,744 each) 5,572 Grade 10 boys and girls (2,786 each) Assessment of health behaviours us ing the SHAPES tool (see Appendix 4) Measurement of height and weight Reports provided to schools participating No individual reporting of findings, all re sults reported at an aggregate level - school, HA, and provincial Use lessons learned by PHSA with th e HASAC project (see Appendix 3) 2. Conduct biannual, province-wide surveillance of policies and activities supporting healthy eating and physical activity for schools, muni cipalities and health authorities. Survey the school administration and municipalities of th e schools selected for the surveillance of students. Key Features of Recommendation #2 School administration in each school that is selected for survey is asked to complete a survey assessing their policies and activities that support healthy living (see Appendix 5) Municipal administration of each community that has a school selected for the survey is asked to complete a survey assessing their policies and activities that support healthy living (see Appendix 6) Health Authorities are asked to compile information from the above two sources to identify gaps in policies and activities that support healthy living July 2010 Page 21 3. Develop a toolkit for schools that are not selected for surveillance, allowing them to conduct their own surveillance of health behaviours and measured height and weight. Key Features of Recommendation #3 Provide processing of surveys for schools that wish to conduct their own surveillance 4. Conduct province-wide surveillance of measured height and weight for adults using a sampling strategy that allows estimation at the Health Authority level. Investment in Performance Data Analysis A brief review of how several countries/organizations have integrated program evaluation with the delivery of a health care intervention was conducte d as part of the background research for the Data and Evaluation Working Group (see Appendix 2). Of importance in this area is the distinction between evaluation and research: The purpose of evaluation is to improve, not prove. Key findings of the review are as follows: 1. Analysis of quality or performance data is a vital part of program planning and implementation 2. Analysis should be regular and routine (=\"short funding cycles\") rather than being dependent on unpredictable granting regimes 3. Analysis should be embedded in the planning and delivery structures (focused on the \"real world\" and \"natural experiments\" rather than one-off research trials under strict scientific conditions) Performance Data Analysis Recommendations 1. Incorporating the ability to analyse quality / performance data is a vital part of program planning, implementation and delivery, and should be embedded in the ORS from the outset 2. Analysis of quality / performance da ta should be regular and routine 3. Analysis of quality / performance data shoul d not be dependent on unpredictable granting regimes 4. Resource needs for analysis of quality / perfo rmance data should be routinely identified, quantified and incorporated into annual operating budgets 5. Use existing resources and tools to facilitate analysis of quality / performance (e.g., the CAPTURE project http://www.thecaptureproject.ca/ , see also Appendix 7) July 2010 Page 22 Appendix 1: Obesity Surveillance Introduction Obesity is a global public health concern that has reached epidemic proportions. It is the most significant contributor to morbidity and mortality, and is a key risk factor for a wide range of chronic diseases. In Canada, the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in recent decades, with similar trends observed in the United States and Europe. Of great concern is the fact that obesity is increasing even more rapidly among ch ildren and adolescents than among adults. There is evidence indicating that obese children tend to remain obese as adults, thus placing them at increased risk of future health problems. It is widely recognized that the use of surveillance systems and measurement tools is a key component in obesity prevention. England's National Obesity Observatory sums up the importance of obesity surveillance: \"Obesity is a complex condition influenced by many factors. Data collection on a large scale allows the monitoring of obesity at a population level and may provide data for in- depth analysis of different causal and contri butory factors, supporting the development of effective interventions and public he alth approaches to tackle obesity.\" 22 In this report, obesity measurements and i ndicators are discussed, along with pertinent issues associated with their use in population-level surveillance. This is followed by an overview of various surveillance programs worldwide and within Canada specific to children and youth, and a discussion of factors to consider when de veloping and implementing such a program. Obesity Measurement The most commonly used measure of obesity in population surveillance is Body Mass Index, or BMI. It is a proxy measure of total adiposity; elevated BMI is linked with current and future morbidity. BMI is calculated by dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. An adult BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 is classified as a healthy weight; 25 kg/m2 and above is categorized as overweight; and 30.0 kg/m2 and above is classified as obese. For children, the relationship between adiposity and BMI varies with age and sex; thresholds are obtained by choosing a specific BMI centile on a child growth reference curve. Among the many advantages of using BMI at a popul ation level is its simplicity; it requires little operator training, the equipment required is not expe nsive, and height and weight can be measured with minimal body contact and w ith a good degree of accuracy. Because it has been widely used and measured around the world for some time, comparisons may be made between regions, populations, and over time. The availability of published thresholds and growth references for children is also an important factor, as equivale nt growth references are not available for other measures. Waist circumference is an indicator of obesity and is a measure of 'central adiposity'. Many studies in adults have indicated that an accumulation of fat around the waist is a predictor of disease risk; this is not as well-studied in children, though similar correlations have been found. There are 22 National Obesity Observatory. Obesity and Overweight Surveillance in England: What is measured and where are the gaps? November 2009.

July 2010 Page 23 guidelines published by the National Institute for H ealth and Clinical Excellence (NICE) that give waist circumference thresholds for adults, but no such thresholds have been agreed upon for children's waist circumference. It should be not ed that although England's HSE for children does collect waist and hip circumference measurements for children ages 11-15 years, there has been no published analysis of the data (though th is is planned for the near future).23 The disadvantages to using waist circumference as a proxy measure of obesity are similar to those for BMI; it does not adjust for the effects of height or body shape/composition, and different thresholds may be needed for different ethnic groups. While these measures may be less useful on an individual level as a result of these disadvantages, the issues tend to even out at the population level. For waist circumference, accurate measurem ent requires more training than for height/weight measurements, and it requires more body contact, which could present ethical issues in the collection of data. Obesity may also be measured by a variety of other means, such as bioelectrical impedance analysis, hydrodensitometry, x-ray absorption, sk infold thickness, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. However, these ar e generally unsuitable for population-level surveillance due to the expense of the equipment and/or practical difficulties. Surveillance Programs Canada Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) The CCHS is a cross-sectional survey that collects information related to health status, health care utilization, and health determin ants for the Canadian population.24 The target population is all Canadians aged 12 and over, with the following ex clusions: individuals living on Indian Reserves and on Crown Lands, institutional residents, fu ll-time members of the Canadian Forces, and residents of certain remote regions. The CCHS re lies upon a large sample of respondents and is designed to provide reliable estimates at the health region level; a sample of 65,000 respondents is required on an annual basis. The survey was launche d in 2000, with data collection occurring every two years; data are available for the 2001, 2003, and 2005 periods. In 2007, major changes were made to the survey design, and data collection now occurs every year. Data collection occurs by a combination of tele phone interviewing and field interviews at private dwellings. The field workers measure the height and weight of participants as part of the survey. Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) is a national health survey being conducted by Statistics Canada under the Statisti cs Act in partnership with Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.25 The CHMS takes direct physical measurements from people aged 3 to 79 for the purpose of determining physical fitness, hear t and lung health, obesity and hypertension.

Participants also complete a house hold interview to provide information on nutrition, smoking habits, alcohol use and other factors, as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. The first cycle of the CHMS began in March 2007 and concluded in Fe bruary 2009; the second cycle began in late August 2009. Over the next two years, the survey will visit 16 sites in 7 provinces to collect information about the general health and lifestyle characteristics of about 5,700 Canadians. This figure includes a target of 360 residents of Richmond this summer followed by 360 residents of the central and east Kootenay region in the fall. Statistics Canada is examining the possibility of adding a third site in British Colu mbia in 2011 to augment the survey sample. British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (AHS) The AHS is designed to provide a comprehensive pi cture of the physical and emotional health of BC youth; it includes questions about perceptions of their current physical and emotional health, risky behaviours, health promoting practices, a nd broader issues such as family connectedness, school safety, and peer relationships. The AHS ask s youth to self-report their height and weight. 26 The AHS was first conducted by the McCreary Centre Society in 1992, followed by three more surveys in 1998, 2003, and 2008. It is completed by BC public school students in grades 7-12; in the 2008 survey, 50 of 59 school districts participated, for a total of 29,440 students. Participation in the survey is voluntary and parental consent procedures are determined by the individual school districts. The AHS is administered by traine d public health nurses in classrooms, with funding provided by the BC Ministry of Children and Family Development and the BC Ministry of Health, with additional support from other key Ministries. British Columbia Health Assessment of School-Aged Children (HASAC) HASAC is a project that aims to gather data on the nutrition, physical activity, smoking behaviour, and self-perception of grade 6 students in BC.27 The first year of the project was 2008, in which 17 schools participated; most recently 19 schools to ok part in the 2009 assessment. The health assessment project is comprised of two parts: Student questionnaire: Developed in collaboration with the Centre for Behavioural Research and Program Evaluation at the University of Waterloo. Students complete this questionnaire under the supervision of school staff. Height and weight measurements: Trained proj ect staff record each student's height and weight in a private area, away from the view of other students. The project is managed by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) and funded by the BC Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport, PHSA and Child Health BC.

Parent/guardian consent was required before data collection could occur. 1. Home Wellness Survey (Parents of Kindergarten to Grade 5 students) - Parents completed this survey at home, wh ich included questions related to food choices, eating routines, level of and op portunities for physical activity, and tobacco use and exposure 2. Student Wellness Survey (Students in Grades 4 & 5) - Questions similar to those in the Home Wellness Survey 3. Direct Physical Measures (Students in Grades 1, 3, & 5) - Direct measurements included the standing & sitting height, weight, waist and hip circumferences of students - Adhered to the National Guidelines of Statistics Canada's Canadian Health Measures Survey 4. Physical Activity Monitoring (Students in Grade 5) - Students were provided with a physical activity monitor to record physical activity over a 7-day period - Monitor collected data on daily step, distances travelled, calories burned, and aerobic activity After the data was collected, each school receive d individual feedback reports. Three provincial fact sheets were also disseminated under the follo wing themes: Healthy Weights and Lifestyles, Social Influences and Environments, and Mental Fitness. Manitoba Youth Health Survey The Manitoba Youth Health Survey is a provin ce-wide chronic disease risk factor surveillance system that was implemented in schools between 2005 and 2008,29 with all eleven of the regional health authorities participating in the survey. Approximately 47,000 students in Grades 6-12 completed the survey; however, since two regions opted not to survey Grades 6-8, the 2009 provincial report only includes data collected from students in Grades 9-12. The survey results were kept anonymous and c onfidential, and participation by students was voluntary. It consisted of 51 multiple choice qu estions on physical activity, nutrition, smoking, alcohol and drug use, and well-bei ng. Self-reported height and weight were used to determine BMI. Feedback reports were produced at the school, school division, district, community, regional health 28 University of New Brunswick Health & Education Research Group.

Nova Scotia Children's Lifestyle and School-performance Study (CLASS) The 2003 CLASS was a survey of grade 5 students in Nova Scotia on health, nutrition, and lifestyle factors. 30 Of the 291 public schools in Nova Scotia with grade 5 classes, 282 (96.9%) participated in the study. Parental consent was received for 5517 students, providing an average response rate of 51.1% per school. One of the 7 provincial school boards did not allow measurement of height and weight, and these students were excluded from the analyses; this left a sample of 4298 children from 242 schools. The survey was comprised of three components: 1. Parent survey : Sociodemographic factors, including child's place of birth and residency, parents' marital status, income le vel, and educational attainment. 2. School principal survey : Information on school characteristics, including sales of soft drinks, type of food services, frequency of physical e ducation classes, and possible financial restraints for recreation and gymnasium equipment. 3. Student survey : Included a modified version of Ha rvard's Youth/Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire, and included validated questions on the frequency of physical activities and the number of hours of sedentary activities. Height and weight was measured by CLASS representatives behind a mobile screen in student classrooms. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm after students had removed thei r shoes, and body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on calibrated digital scales. Raising Healthy Eating and Active Living (REAL) Kids Alberta REAL Kids Alberta is an evaluation of grade 5 students across the province.31 The first phase of the survey was conducted in the spring of 2008, with the next phase planned for the spring of 2010. The survey is comprised of the following elements: Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire for Children and Youth to assess dietary habits and nutritional intake Self-reported information on physical activit y, screen time, and recognition of Alberta Health and Wellness programs Measurement of height and weight for the calculation of BMI Parent survey about the home environment School principal survey on sc hool programs and environment The survey administration to students, as well as he ight and weight measurem ents, is performed by trained evaluation assistants and a Regional Health Promotion Coordinator from the local health authority. Student's weights are measured using a scale that sends their weight to a remote read that the student cannot see. Measurements are not shar ed with the child, parents, or other school personnel. In the first phase of the survey, a total of 3935 grade 5 students and 4209 parents participated from 174 schools across Alberta. A new group of grade 5 students will be participating in the next phase. 30 Veugelers PJ, Fitzgerald AL. Prevalence of and risk factors for childhood overweight and obesity.

Each of the two public health units will be weighing and measuring he ights of at least five Grade 2 classes in a minimum of two schools. Data will be collected for approximately 200 to 300 children; data collection will occur in April 2010, with disse mination of results planne d for June 2010. This first pilot phase will involve the following processes: Communications with health units, school boa rds, principals, teachers, and parents Implied and expressed parental consent Training of staff to carry out weighing and measuring Data collection Data storage and transfer England Obesity prevalence data for children in E ngland are collected from two main sources33: Health Survey for England (HSE) - children National Childhood Measurement Programme (NCMP) HSE - children The Health Survey for England (HSE) is an a nnual survey designed to measure the health and health-related behaviour of adults and children living in private households in England. Data is collected from a nationally representative populatio n sample. It has been undertaken since 1991, though children were not included until 1995, and infants under two years old since 2002. In 2006, the HSE collected data on over 7000 children under 15 years of age. Interviewers take height and we ight measurements for all children, with the exception of infants under two years of age, for whom nurses measure length instead of height. Nurses also measure waist and hip circumference of all children aged 11- 15 years. Data is also collected on the child's perception of their own weight (for children aged 8-15 years), and reported birth weight for all children. The HSE collects information on many of the recognized determinants of overweight and obesity, including dietary habits, physical activ ity, and attitudes to physical activity and healthy eating. This information is collected by interviewi ng either the parent or the child, depending upon the age of the child. Socio-demographic and househol d measures are collected as part of the adult HSE aid in further exploring influences on obesity. HSE can provide estimates of obesity prevalence at national and regional levels, but not at lower geographical levels. A further limitation is that data relating to children from minority ethnic groups or specific age groups is limited by sma ll sub-population sample sizes. Additionally, the HSE does not target specific age ranges, in contrast to the NCMP and the HBSC, in which large 32 See the RFP at http://evaluationcanada.ca/affich age/alpha_20100413.pdf 33 National Obesity Observatory.

July 2010 Page 28 numbers of children are measured with a focus on narrower age ranges. These surveys serve to complement the HSE and allow monitoring of trends among children of these ages. NCMP The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures the height and weight of all children aged 4-5 years (Reception year) and 10-11 years (Year 6) in mainstream primary and middle schools in England. Measurements are take n by Primary Care Trust staff within schools annually; the first NCMP was conducted in 2005/06. Data is collected for over 400,000 children in each year group. This provides a powerful tool fo r examining changes in child weight status and issues such as ethnicity for the speci fic age groups included in the NCMP. Some limitations of the NCMP are that fewer indi vidual characteristics are measured than in some other data sources such as the HSE or the HBSC , and no data on health -related behaviour are collected. Sex and ethnic group are recorded, as we ll as the lower super output area of residence, which provides some geographical information. Data quality issues affecting NCMP data include variation between Primary Care Trus ts with regard to participation and opt out rates, accuracy of measurements and the use of different measurement tools, as well as when in the school year the measurements are taken. USA - Arkansas There are currently at least 13 states in the USA that have legislation for and are implementing school-based BMI-measurement programs. Arka nsas' comprehensive statewide assessment program will be outlined here as an example of an American initiative.34 In 2003, Arkansas implemented a statewide BMI screening program. In the first four years of the program, assessments were conducted on all students in grades K-12. In 2007 the periodicity of the assessments was changed to all students in even-numbered grades (K,2,4,6,8,10). In 2007/08 there was a 98.5% student participation rate, though only 82% of the data was valid for analysis. The remainder of the data either could not be assessed (18%; most commonly due to absence from school) or was invalid (0.04%). The height and we ight measurements are taken by a trained school or student-health professional. This process is conduc ted privately, with the child facing away from the scale. There is a comprehensive reporting system in place for dissemination of the results; reports generated include Child H ealth Reports (confidential and ava ilable to each student's parent or guardian), School Reports, School Dist rict Reports, and a Statewide Report. International Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) HBSC was initiated in 1982 by researchers from three countries, and the following year it was adopted by the World Health Organization as a collaborative study. HBSC is a cross-national research study that aims to gain new insight into , and increase our understanding of, young people's health and well-being, health behaviours, and thei r social context. The first cross-national survey was conducted in 1983/84, the sec ond in 1985/86, and since then it has been conducted every four years using a common research protocol. There are currently 43 participating countries and regions; Canada has been participating since 1989/90.35 34 Arkansas Center for Health Improveme nt.

July 2010 Page 29 The target population of the survey is young people attending school, aged 11, 13, and 15 years. The survey is carried out on a nationally representa tive sample in each participating country, with an average of 4500 young people being surveyed per country. HBSC is a school-based survey, with data collected through self-completed standard questionnaires developed by the international research network and used by all participating countries. The core set of questions fall into four categories, as follows: Background factors : demographics, social background (family structure, socio-economic status) Individual and social resources : body image, family support, peers, school environment Health behaviours: physical activity, eating and dieting, smoking, alcohol use, sexual behaviour, violence and bullying Health outcomes : symptoms, life satisfaction, self-reported health Self-reported height and weight are collected in th e Health outcomes section, and used to determine BMI. Many countries supplement this base questionnaire w ith additional items that are of particular interest on a national level. Summary The following table summarizes the obesity surveys discussed in this document: July 2010 Page 30 Factors to consider when developing a childhood obesity surveillance program: Measurement vs. self-reported : Measurement is becoming the standard, as many studies indicate that self-reported data underestimate overweight prevalence. Measurement type(s) : BMI is most common, though measurements of central adiposity in children are increasingly being studied for risk factor prediction utility. Frequency : Many of the surveys described herein were either one-time projects or conducted on a multi-year basis, only the two surveys in England involve measured height and weight and are conducted on an annual basis. Scope: Most surveys described are designed to give a broad picture of the health and well- being of children, with physical measures being one small component. The exception is England's NCMP; while this survey only consists of height and weight measurements it is complemented by the national HSE, whic h includes such measurements as well as information on determinants of overweight and obesity.

Even more specifically, the following notes relate to the importance of analyzing performance and related data. Before addressing these matters directly, it is u seful to distinguish evaluation and research. The terms are sometimes employed interchangeably, and they certainly do represent closely related arenas, since both involve collection and analysis of data. In fact, evaluators arguably must always be aware of the fact that the information they ge nerate may one day be brought into the service of research per se. But how should these two domains continue to be properly distinguished? James Fain helpfully summed up the differences in a 2005 editorial published in The Diabetes Educator:36 Research is designed to provide results that go beyond an individual program or project and can be generalized to other populations, conditions, or times. This places additional requirements on research. For example, evaluati on considers the results on the population being served by the program or project within the context in which the program is provided. Research asks whether the population has the same characteristics as other groups and whether results can be applied in other contexts. Evaluation, then, is very much focused on qualit y improvement (or maintenance/assurance) in a very specific health care context. Or, as DL Stufflebeam once said: The purpose of evaluation is to improve, not prove.37 The Issue Analyzing the causes and other significance attached to numerical facts is often the dimension that is missing from performance measurement; because of this, the aim of performance measurement to actually make a difference in the real world ma y be compromised. In the language of the well- known PDSA quality improvement cycle\u2014 Plan (based on hypotheses) Do (including monitoring/testing) Study (or reflection) and Act (that is, take an improved next step), \u2014it seems that the Study component is frequently neglected and under-resourced. Leaders within the quality improvement arena have commented on this gap in different ways. Example: United Kingdom Few would disagree that the United Kingdom has been a leader in bringing a performance measurement/quality improvement paradigm to b ear on all aspects of public services, including health care. In this regard, the commentary by Professor Nick Black of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine a decade ago is impo rtant. He identified the following six reasons why \"research evidence has little influence on service policies.\" 38 36 Fain JA. Is there a difference between evaluation and research?

British Medical Journal. 2001; 323(7307): 275-9. July 2010 Page 32 Evidence is dismissed as irrelevant Lack of consensus about evidence Other types of competing evidence Poor quality of knowledge purveying (including translation, communication, etc.) Policy-makers have goals other than effectiveness (e.g., social, financial) Social environments not conducive to policy change Over half of these impediments suggest the importance of careful analysis and application of performance data, presumably supported by routine processes and sustained resources dedicated to such a cause. Example: United States The United States has also been a leader in quality improvement initiatives, sometimes known as the \"quality movement.\" In general, this move ment has been aimed at bridging the recognized knowledge-performance gap in health care.39 The symposium Expanding Research and Evaluation Designs to Improve the Science Base for Health Care and Public Health Quality Improvement was held in 2005 under the auspices of the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. It reviewed a range of quality improvement (QI) interventions and the critical questions that arise in evaluation of these interventions, identified the strengths, weaknesses, and tradeoffs of alterna tive designs and methods for evaluating such interventions, and suggested strategies to facilitate possible changes in fund ing mechanisms, review processes, research and publication standards, and research training to help accelerate the development and spread of reliable QI intervention research methods. A number of important results emerged from the disc ussion, reflected in the following summary of recommendations for combining QI interventions with evaluation focused on ways to increase both rigor and relevance: 40 By working at multiple levels of a system, by developing participatory relationships that transcend single projects, by considering d ifferent ways of knowing (e.g., qualitative and quantitative data), by fostering shared learning among participants in research, and by pursuing development alongside research in QI . To facilitate more quality improvement engagement, more research is needed on how to entice practice leaders into QI studies. Funding agencies could help create research infrastructures in real-world settings and fund in shorter cycles to take advantage of natural experiments in QI . [emphasis ours] This same symposium discussed the well-known Chronic Care Model (CCM) of Ed Wagner as a paradigm for quality improvement. The most su ccessful model for implementing the CCM in different settings has apparently been the so- called Breakthrough Series, a yearlong process that brings together teams from organizations wanting to make changes and expert facilitators. During learning sessions, teams plan the changes that are then tested in the action periods that follow. At the heart of each collaborative is an approach to QI developed by Gerald Langley and colleagues; it has three basic elements: 39 Wandersman A, Duffy J, Flaspohler P et al.

July 2010 Page 33 Set a clear aim Have a measurement system in place that charts whether or not progress is being made Implement a set of changes and test them using rapid cycle PDSA methods to determine whether or not the changes accomplish what they were hypothesized to do Example: North Karelia Project, Finland \"North Karelia Project\" was the name given to the influential comm unity-wide cardiovascular health program in an eastern province of Finland. The encouraging health trend in North Karelia was already evident as early as 5 years after the launch of the Project, and it has been steadily confirmed in the decades since. For example, co ronary heart disease (CHD) mortality dropped by approximately 80% over a 30-year period, a remarkab le improvement that has been mostly tied to dietary changes and decreases in smoking.41 The biological markers confirm this conclusion: serum cholesterol and blood pressure have both greatly declined among men and women, although blood pressure has actually levelled off since 2002. The la tter plateau may reflect the countervailing force of increasing body-mass index in the population, wh ich only serves to underline that, even in North Karelia, the public health battle is never over. Indeed, as in all parts of the developed world, there is now a new emphasis in Finland on tackling obesity, physical inactivity, and the growing rate of type 2 diabetes. According to one of its early leaders, Prof. Erkki Vartiainen, the evaluation component of the North Karelia Project was also very robust from the start. 42 Indeed, scientists were an intimate part of the Project team, moving from village to village with other staff, gathering, analyzing, and reporting data at every stage. The capacity to track pr ocess indicators, as well as the \"harder\" outcomes related to disease rates, likely represents one of the key engines of success related to the Project. Evaluation strategies and structures continue to re present a key public health export from Finland to the rest of the world. It is no coincidence that the Data Centre for the WHO program known as MONICA (MONItor trends in CArdiovascular disea ses) was established in the early 1980s in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. MONICA was supposed to help explain the diverse global trends in cardiovascular disease mortality. Similarly, the Ch ronic Disease Prevention Unit of Finland's newly formed National Institute for Health and We lfare offers leadership in the data collection system used by member countries of the Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Disease Intervention program. The momentum for this sort of intensive data collection and analysis may be partly traced to the remarkable outcomes of the North Karelia Project. There is an understandable desire to reproduce the positive results from what one commentator referred to as a \"sweetspot\" for public health studies. Models of Investment in Performance Data Analysis It would be useful to know how much to budget fo r the analysis of performance data. In practice, there is so much variation that formulas do not seem to be available. At best, the analysis component may be present, but it is usually \"buried\" as part of an overall monitoring/surveillance budget. In the absence of quantitative rules-of-thumb, two potentially useful principles have been identified in the literature: 41 Puska P, Vartiainen E, Laatikainen T et al. The North Karelia Project: From North Karelia to National Action . Helsinki: Helsinki University Printing House, 2009. 42 Personal communicati on. March 3, 2010. July 2010 Page 34 Do Not Depend on \"Grantland\" Sobo and co-authors produced a paper in 2008 examining a new area of health services research (HSR) known as \"Implementation Science\" (IS). Usi ng key informant interviews, they identified impediments in evaluating health care interventi ons that arise from the standard practice of depending on research grants, and the resulting negative impact on project evaluation produced by grant-writing workloads, competition, grant timelin es, etc. The authors dubbed this complex arena \"grantland,\" summing up their observations in the following terms:43 Institutional factors, particularly funding m echanisms and their entailments, structured and ensured high workloads. Attentions were divided (and morale and functionality compromised) not only by the high number of disparate projects undertaken but also by other affiliations and duties that membership in the career researcher world demands. Our combined, long-term research exp erience suggests that such interests are common in most grantfunded HSR settings. More particularly, mo st IS researchers in this study explicitly identified their work as still marginal to the mainstream of health care research. Thus, they may face challenges that ot her researchers might not. What alternative do they suggest? Simply this: a more sustained approach to analyzing performance information. Or, in their words: \"the careful im plementation of different funding structures with longer time horizons might pay large dividends in terms of reducing stress as well as mitigating personnel changes that may interfere wi th health care quality improvement.\" Embed Evaluation Structures and F unding in the Heart of the Program The Quality Assurance Project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), published a detailed re port in 2002 on how quality improvement or quality assurance (QA) approaches in health care needed to mature. The authors identified five phases that are useful in understanding how a quality improvement/assurance regime c ould develop towards the most effective model. Several categories were identifie d in the progression to maturity, but for present purposes the funding element will be highlighted. Th e five phases of institutional growth in this arena are laid out the following table.44 43 Sobo EJ, Bowman C, Gifford AL.

Available at http://www.chs-urc.org/pdf/monogra phinstitQA.pdf. Accessed April 19, 2010. July 2010 Page 35 The report summed up the significance of the funding element in this way: An important issue during institutionaliza tion is the source of resources for QA. QA programs that are entirely dependent on don or resources tend to contract after outside funding ends. Committing the organization's own resources for QA activities by incorporating funding for QA into operating bud gets is thus a key milestone on the road to institutionalization. Recommendations for Program Evaluation/Analysis in Health Care The preceding notes have focused on the important topic of program (or project evaluation) in health care. More specifically, the function of analyzing performance and related data has been examined. Even when there are resources attached to a program for performance and outcome data collection, raw data is not enough. There needs to be a collateral commitment to understanding the meaning of the resultant data set and translati ng conclusions into actionable steps for program quality improvement. What is at stake? If evaluation is robust and continuous, there is the potential for identifying high-quality, high-impact prevention programs of the variety seen in North Karelia. As noted earlier, the Finnish commitment to well- constructed, sustained evaluation helped to catapult their efforts from the merely promising to a being a recognized model for the rest of the world. Phase of Institutionalization Resources for QA Awareness Resources are allocated to support initial QA experiences. Resources are committed to finance QA expansion costs. Budget lines are added for QA activities or resources are allocated for QA within existing budgets. Realistic budgets for QA activities are developed based on awareness of the tr ue costs of doing QA. Decision makers demonstrate a willingness to consistently allocate adequate resources for QA. Sufficient resources are allocated to support ongoing quality initiatives. Estimated QA resource needs are incorporated into annual operating budgets. QA resource needs are routinely identified, quantified, and incorporated into annual operating budg ets. Resources for QA are consistenly made available.

Thr ee implications seem to be pertinent: 1. Analysis of quality or performance data is a vital part of program planning and implementation 2. Analysis ought to be regular and routine (=\"short funding cycles\") rather than being dependent on unpredictable granting regimes 3. Analysis ought to be embedded in the pl anning and delivery structures (focused on the \"real world\" and \"natural experiments\" rather than one-off research trials under strict scientific conditions) July 2010 Page 37 Appendix 3: HASAC - Background In formation & Sample Report The Health Assessment of School-Aged Childre n (HASAC) project is an initiative by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) with funding provided by the BC Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport, the PHSA, and Child Health BC. HASAC is designed to help BC schools plan health improvement activity by collecting data on nutrition, physical activity, smoking behaviour, and self-perception of grade six students. The Health Assessment is taken during school hours and has been completed twice thus far, in 2008 and 2009. The 2009 survey covered 19 schools in to tal, 15 elementary schools and 4 middle schools from across British Columbia; this represented tw o more schools than the year prior. The assessment itself contains two components: A student questionnaire which was developed in collaborations with the Centre for Behavioural Research and Program Evaluation at the University of Waterloo and takes 20- 40 minutes to complete Height and weight measurements Specific measurements are taken by trained project staff in a private area, away from the view of other students. Participation is voluntary and data are kept both confidential and anonymous with none of the data linked to individual students. Data is gathers in January, February, and March, and schools receive a summary report by April. This summary is useful in: Creating an overall profile of student health behaviour Determining what areas of health behaviour require most attention Monitoring changes in health behaviour and results over time The results of the survey have a number of implications for students, school staff, parents, families, and the community; they are meant to stimulate discussion and, ultimately, action. Such actions could include students organizing new initiatives such as intramural sports programs or organizing a student/staff health living challenge, school sta ff modelling health behaviours as an example to their students, and parents planning addition hea lth related activities with the parent advisory council. From a population health perspective, data is u sed to inform and complement a number of ongoing initiatives in the province such as Action Schools! BC, in addition to being combined with similar assessments from Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia to fill critical information gaps concerning child health behaviours. Results from the 2009 survey were presented in a f eedback report for schools, with findings in four main categories: healthy eating, physical activity, sm oking behaviour, and 'other findings'. Each of these areas has important ties to students themselv es, the school, and the community; understanding the connectedness and overlap of each of these dom ains is essential to combating the growing health concerns among our youth. For healthy eating the connection between school and student is well-documented. Children who eat poorly do not perform well in school, and improving nutrition can result in improvements in academic performance. Questions from the survey focused on broad categories, asking students to recall the number of times they had consumed ite ms like fruit and vegetables, whole grains, milk, high salt foods, or sweetened beverages. The surv ey also targeted the underlying knowledge and attitudes by identifying how many fruits and vegetables students believed they should be July 2010 Page 38 consuming to be in good health, how often they eat breakfast or dine out, and how the school environment and social influences shapes their eating habits. The physical activity section covers areas such as how many students meet Canada's Physical Activity Guide for Youth, when students are active, including questions specific to school- related sports and intramurals, social influences on physical activity, and how students perceive their own weight. The focus of the smoking section is on smoking behaviours such as whether or not students have tried smoking, and peer and family infl uences such as friends and family members who smoke. The last part of the survey entitled 'other finding s' is varied, as the name implies. It covers important psychological needs including autonomy, relatedness and competency, and other measures of health not covered in previous secti ons such as sleep habits and school connectedness. HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 1 Health Assessment of School-Aged Children Project Considerations for a Provincial Strategy June, 2009 HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This paper is presented to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Healthy Living & Sport for consideration towards funding and implementi ng a provincial strategy to collect health information including height and weight m easures of Grade 6 students. The paper summarizes the learnings achieved through the Health Assessment of School-Aged Children (HASAC) project, presents options fo r sampling methodology, and identifies key decision points and budget for a provincial st rategy. The importance of the information collected through HASAC is emphasized by the study findings that approximately 31% of grade 6 boys and girls are overweight or obese (21% of boys and 12% of girls are considered obese). While these findings are from a non-representative sample of 19 schools, they are cause for concern given trends in the adult population. Schools across BC are developing innovative policies and programs to improve student health, but there is no systematic measuremen t and monitoring of school aged children to assess the impact of these initiatives. BC is falling behind many of its Canadian and international counterparts in terms of collect ing data in this area and is missing a key opportunity to inform planning at the local, provincial, national and international levels. The Provincial Health Services Authority (P HSA) conducted the HASAC project in order to test a successful model for collecting data on the health status of grade six students in BC schools. The assessments include (a) a survey and (b) height and weight measurements. PHSA demonstrated that this type of project can run smoothly, and that schools have used this information to support healthy school plan ning activities. Data were collected with attention to privacy and confidentiality, a nd no adverse effects on participating children were identified (i.e., there were no teasing, bullying or body image issues noted). In order to implement a provincial level data collection project, there are numerous sampling strategies possible. Table 1 summarizes variations on three sample size options that will provide estimates of body mass index (BMI), various health behaviours and characteristics, and student perceptions of well- being. The three options vary by level of analysis/reporting and require increasing sample size (and therefore cost) but also offer increasingly more information on the provincial picture. All three options rely on the statistical notion of random sampling, and the assessment of entire classrooms rather than individual students. Table 1: Provincial Strategy Sample Size Options & Costs Option/Level of Analysis Number of Students Small Schools Included Small Schools Excluded Probability Proportional Sampling Number Cost Number Cost Number Cost Option 1 30 $101,425 $89/student 23 90 $231,750 HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 3 Key decision points required to select an option include: 1. What level of analysis/reporting is desired/affordable? 2. How critical is it to include all or some of the low enrollment schools? Planning considerations for the project include: school interest in participating, classroom size, study frequency, scheduling the assessments, and assessing the majority of schools over time. The next step is to align and integrate this initiative with existing Ministry and school programs and initiatives designed to improve the health of BC students. It is recommended that BC join with other provinces and jurisdictions by implementing a provincial strategy for collecting health information a nd measures on grade 6 students. HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 4 1.0 PURPOSE At the request of the Ministries of Heal thy Living & Sport and Education (Andy Hazlewood and Paige MacFarlane), this paper has been developed to summarize the learnings achieved through the Health Assessment of School-Aged Children (HASAC) project, present options for a sampling methodology and identify key decision points and budget for a provincial strategy to collect health information includi ng height and weight measures of grade 6 students. 2.0 BACKGROUND Routine body mass index (BMI) measures and comprehensive surveys are being done in a number of American states and the United Ki ngdom. Five other provinces in Canada (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Alberta, and Ontario) are engaging in different combinations of BMI and health behaviour surveys. Nova Scotia - Over two years, randomly sampled 2,300 students in Grade 3, 7 and 11 and collected height, weight, waist circumfe rence, and physical activity and health behaviour information. Alberta - In 2008 Alberta administered surveys to 3,000 grade five students across Alberta and measured their heights and weights, and plan to repeat the same process on a new group of grade five students in 2010. New Brunswick - Ongoing systematic, random ized data collection and surveys, including a Wellness Survey of 33,000 stude nts in 2006-07 with students in grades 6- 12 and a wellness survey, physical activity meas ure and height and weight measures of 22 randomly selected elementary schools in early 2008. BC is falling behind its Canadian and internati onal counterparts in terms of collecting data in this area and is missing a key opportunity to inform planning at the local, provincial, national and international levels as other jurisdictions move ahead. Schools across BC are developing innovative policies and programs to improve student health. However, there is no systematic measurement and monitoring of school aged children to assess the impact of these initiatives. Over the past two years, the Provincial H ealth Services Authority (PHSA) conducted two phases of the Health Assessment of School-Aged Children Project, in order to test a successful model for data on the health status of grade six students in BC schools. The HASAC student assessments include (a) a survey and (b) height and weight measurements. The importance of the information collected through HASAC is emphasized by the study findings that approximately 31% of grade 6 boys and girls are overweight or obese (21% of boys and 12% of girls are considered obese). While these findings are from a non- representative sample of 19 schools, they are cause for concern given trends in the adult population. It would be of great benefit to determine if these findings are representative for all of BC and how they are changing over time. PHSA demonstrated that this type of project is feasible and that schools, parents and students are enthusiastic about participating and about using the information for planning purposes. All data were collected with atte ntion to privacy and confidentiality, and no HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 5 adverse effects on participating children were identified (i.e., there were no teasing, bullying or body image issues noted). HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 6 2.1 Highlights of Learnings/Outcomes Different approaches in the administration of the assessment were tried based on recommendations from the evaluation and feedback received. In Phase 1, a team of trained health care providers, mostly nurse s, administered both the survey and conducted the height and weight measures. In Phase 2, teachers administered the survey and where possible \"non health\" people from the local community (especially people having health related backgrounds or experience with children) were trained to conduct the height and weight measures. Highlights of the learnings/outcomes from the HASAC project are: Student Recruitment Passive consent processes result in a higher participation rate (85%) than active consent processes (70%). Assessment Conducting the assessment during flu season results in lower participation rates. Phase I average times to complete the questionnaire (25 min) and measures (2 min per student) were identified, but the completion time increased significantly in Phase 2 (35-40 minutes) when additional questions were added in the healthy eating section. Physical assessment of height and weight is the most logistically challenging and resource intensive component of the asse ssment, but it is the only way to obtain accurate height and weight information on students as they typically under-report their weight and over-report their height. Assessment Staff (Recruitment & Training) Lay people are difficult to find and once f ound, availability is difficult to ensure. The public health system is in the best position to identify groups and individuals to recruit in the community. People with a health background and those used to working with children are good candidates and they are also easier to train. Nursing students and retired nurses are a rich pool to draw from. In districts with several schools or in schools where local recruitment is very challenging, using small teams is a good option. It is possible to train non-health people to conduct the height and weight measures. Training can be successfully conducted with assessment staff on the same day, or the day before the in-school assessments. It is important to have one or more experienced assessment staff present where newly trained staff are located so that ongoing assessment and problem-solving support is readily available. School/Teacher Engagement Widely varying rates of preparedness between schools and amongst teachers within schools were found. It will be important to strive for improved engagement with all the teachers who will be involved. Outcomes An evaluation of the HASAC project revealed several key outcomes in the schools that participated: The HASAC report findings assisted almost all of the schools in the development and/or revision of their Healthy School Improvement Plan, or other school-wide health plan (e.g., School Growth Plan) by providing schools with health HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 7 evidence. Based on the report findings, more than half of the schools focused their Healthy School Improvement Plan on healthy eating, physical activity and the physical environment. Many of the schools used the report findings to set priorities and/or targets for health-improvement activities related spec ifically to healthy eating and physical activity (e.g., eliminating foods high in sugar from school, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, identifying fitness targets). Approximately half of the schools used the HASAC reports to develop and/or revise curriculum and course material for health-related classes (e.g., Healthy Living Exploration Class, Health and Career Education Class), health-related programs and activities (e.g., physical ac tivity assessments and report cards, healthy lunch programs, healthy food activities), and school-based regulations (e.g., smoking ban for all parents dropping off/picking up students from school and when on field trips). The majority of schools have disseminated report findings to key stakeholders, and indicated those stakeholders became more involved with planning and/or improving healthy school activities as a result of receiving that information. 2.2 Conclusion of Phase II (2008-09) To complete Phase II, the following deliverables will be finished by July, 2009: A project implementation guide containing step-by-step instructions, issues for consideration, troubleshooting options, communication tools, and suggestions as to how to improve the school recruitment and teacher engagement processes. A revised HASAC questionnaire and report template to streamline and improve the assessment and report generation process. 3.0 PROVINCIAL LEVEL HASAC PROJECT: OPTIONS AND COSTING The following section describes options for design and methodology of getting data for provincial level monitoring and trending. It includes the assumptions as well as the costing for each of the three options. 3.1 Sample Size Options This section provides three options and asso ciated estimates of the minimum number of student questionnaires/assessments required fo r the HASAC project to provide estimates of body mass index (BMI), various health behaviours and characteristics, and student perceptions of wellbeing. There are numerous variations of sampling strategies possible and these three options provide some id ea of the range of options available. The first option provides the number of questionnaires/assessments required to assess changes in various health behaviours and characteristics in BC each year, while the second option allows for the detection of changes from year to year (i.e., trending patterns), and the third expands the second option to include estimation at a regional level within BC. Option 1: Minimum number of students required to provide an estimate at a provincial level of the proportion of children with an overweight or obese BMI level, and of the health behaviours and characteristics assessed in the HASAC questionnaire. HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 8 The sample size required is 1,144 students (572 each of boys and girls). This sample size provides a 95% level of confidence with a 5% margin of error (Table 1 - See Appendix A). Given the past 80% participation rate of st udents, 1,430 students would have to be asked to participate to get the required number. (Note: this consideration would be true for all variations of all three options). If an estimate of the proportion of stude nts with an overweight or obese BMI only was desired (found in approximately 25% of the st udents), then 814 students would need to be assessed. Option 2 : Minimum number of students required to provide an estimate of changes at a provincial level on a year-to-year basis in the proportion of children with an overweight or obese BMI level, and of the health behaviours and characteristics assessed in the HASAC questionnaire. The number of students required to detect a change of 5% in the proportion of children with an overweight or obese BMI level, and of the health behaviours and characteristics assessed in the HASAC questionnaire found in 75% of the students with a power of 0.8 (probability that the test will reject a false null hypothesis) and a type 1 error of 0.05 is 3,754 . Note that moving to a 3% difference increases the number of students required to 10,192 (Table 2 - See Appendix A). If a detected change of 3% for BMI only was desired, then 3,576 students would need to be assessed. Option 3: Minimum number of students required to provide an estimate of changes at a provincial level on a year-to-year basis and estimate at a regional level (Health Authority) the proportion of children with an overweight or obese BMI level, and of the health behaviours and characteristics assessed in the HASAC questionnaire. The number of students required to detect a change of 5% in the proportion of children with an overweight or obese BMI level, and of the health behaviours and characteristics assessed in the HASAC questionnaire found in 75% the students with a power of 0.8 and a type 1 error of 0.05 while stratifying by HA is 5,487 (Table 3 - See Appendix A). If a detected change of 3% for BMI only was desired, then 4,164 students would need to be assessed. 3.2 Assumptions A number of assumptions were made in identifying the sample size options: All options rely on the statistical noti on of random sampling which requires that students be randomly selected with a known probability. If random sampling is not used then the resulting sample is not a valid representation of the identified population (grade 6 students in BC), and estimates of he alth behaviours and characteristics are not reliable. In order to avoid stigmatization, the HASAC BMI assessment strategy involves assessing entire classrooms of students so that individual students do not feel that they are being singled out. This leads to a strategy of randomly selecting schools and then assessing the entire grade 6 population of the school. HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 9 The resulting selection of clusters (classroom s) of grade 6 students must be taken into account in the determination of the final num ber of students required. The adjustment factor, known as the design effect, was determined from last year's survey to be approximately 1.5. This means that the number of student questionnaires/assessments has to be increased by approximately 50% to account for the effect of selecting clusters (classrooms or schools) of grade 6 students rather than selecting individual students. 3.3 Costs Table 4 summarizes the three sample size options with associated costs. See Appendix B for a more detailed breakdown of costs. The budget was developed based on the following parameters: The # of students required is fixed, but the # of schools required is an estimate only. The assessments should be spread over several months (e.g., Wave 1 from Sept - Dec; Wave 2 from Jan - Mar). A combination of local height & weight m easurement staff and small teams (traveling short distances) will be used wherever it is most efficient to do so. Training, size and composition of assessment teams will depend largely on the distribution of schools, but will also depe nd on the ability to recruit locally (See Appendix C for sample maps, depicting a variation of Option 2). Table 4: Provincial Strategy Sample Size Options & Costs Option/Level of Analysis Number of Students Small Schools Included Small Schools Excluded Probability Proportional Sampling Number Cost Number Cost Number Cost Option 1 30 $101,425 $89/student 23 90 $231,750 4.0 KEY DECISION POINTS REQUIRED TO SELECT AN OPTION This section describes the decisions that need to be made in order to select a sample size option for implementing HASAC at a provincial level in BC. 4.1 Level of Analysis/Reporting What level of analysis/reporting is desired/affordable? HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 10 The three options presented vary by level of analysis and reporting. The increasing sample size results in increased cost but also offers increasingly more information on the provincial picture. 4.2 Low Enrollment Schools How critical is it to include low enrollment schools? From a statistical perspective the implications are minimal - it is possible to eliminate the low enrollment schools (22 or fewer grade 6 students) from the sample and still have solid provincial representation. Including these schools will increase the numbe r of schools in the sample and therefore increase the costs. For each of the three options, approximately 20% more schools will need to be recruited if the low enrollment schools are included. For example, in Option 1, approximately 39 schools will need to be recruited if low enrollment schools are included, whereas 30 schools are required if they are not included. Is it desirable to pursue an option that will include some, but not all of the low enrollment schools? Probability proportional to size (PPS) is a surv ey sampling technique that can be used to select schools for inclusion on the basis of si ze of the number of grade 6 students in the school. Using this technique results in larger schools more likely to be included in the sample. This approach allows for greater accuracy as the larger schools representation has a greater impact on the final estimates. An additional benefit is that PPS requires fewer schools to be selected to obtain the desired sample size of students. If PPS is used then small schools do not need to be excluded entirely. Some will be selected, although that number will be relatively small because they have a lesser chance of being selected. 5.0 PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS A number of considerations when planning for a provincial strategy include: 5.1 School Interest in Participating Due to the voluntary nature of the project, it is likely that some schools will decline to participate. Logistically speaking, this m eans that the project manager will need to approach the schools in the order that they appear on a randomly generated list of schools until a large enough sample size is obtained. This has several implications: It is possible that some school districts ma y appear to be over or under represented, but as long as the required overall sample size is achieved, a provincial level or regional analysis is valid. It is possible that some interested sc hools might not be included in the randomly generated list (including those who have participated in the past and are keen to continue participating in the future, or thos e who may be selected in Year 1 but not in Year 3). One option might be to offer these schools the opportunity to go ahead with the questionnaire on their own. The costs associated with doing the survey only have not been included in the costing estimates. The costs to schools would include: printing of HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 11 surveys, consent forms, FAQs and teacher instructions; survey analysis & report generation; and some limited project coordination and administrative assistance time (scheduling & communication). The cost to add another 20 schools averaging 60 students each (1200 students total) would be approximately $31,000. 5.2 Classroom Size Classroom size should also be considered. In BC there are 1,249 schools that have 47,034 grade 6 students enrolled. Schools with 22 or fewer grade 6 students represent 449 schools and 4,357 grade 6 students. If sm all schools (less than 22 grade 6 students) were excluded the final pool of schools eligible for participation in the HASAC survey would consist of 793 schools that have 42,332 grade 6 students enrolled (Table 5 - See Appendix D). If included in the sampling the low enrollment schools would be likely to have individual level reports that suppress results due to priv acy concerns or low numbers of responses. For the very small schools, a report would not even be possible. For example, in the last round of HASAC one of the schools with 21 grade 6 students ended up with 15 students participating (three absent the day of the survey and three declined to participate). This resulted in reporting of some of the results fo r both sexes rather than separately. As an example, BMI categories, intake of fruits a nd vegetables and number of times various food groups that were eaten the previous day were reported in this manner while social influences on healthy eating were not reported at all for the school. One option for addressing the issue of reporting for low enrollment schools would be to group smaller schools with nearby schools if any happen to be selected in the sample. 5.3 Study Frequency Ideally the HASAC study would be conducted every year. However, given resource constraints and that BMI and the various health behaviours and characteristics are unlikely to change dramatically from year to year, the assessment could be done every two years and still provide an accurate picture for BC. Three or more years between assessments would not provide timely information for schools and would be too large of a gap for accurate assessment of health changes over time. If the two year frequency is chosen, it is important to note that in order to make valid comparisons and draw conclusions about trending, it is imperative that the total required number of students be assessed during the course of a school year, and not stretche d out over the course of two years. 5.4 Scheduling the Assessments In order to maximize cost and resource effi ciencies (i.e., conduct greater numbers of assessments using a fixed number of staff an d equipment), it is recommended that the assessments be split into two \"waves\" (i.e., October to December and January to March). All assessments need to be completed by early March so that school reports can be generated in time to inform the next year's school planning. 5.5 Assessing the Majority of Schools Over Time If it was deemed desirable to ensure that ov er time the majority of schools in BC were included in a round of assessments, varying periods of time would be needed depending on which one of the options presented was se lected. Assuming that small schools are HASAC: Considerations for a Provincial Strategy 12 included it would take approximately 33 years for the majority of schools to be sampled under Option 1, 10 years under Option 2, and 7 years under Option 3. Excluding small schools would have a relatively small effect on the length of time required under each option. With changing enrollment levels and school closures these estimates would fluctuate. 6.0 CONCLUSION The successful completion of two phases of HASAC has demonstrated the value of this project in generating important BMI data th at do not currently ex ist for BC's grade 6 students, as well as additional information re: various health related behaviours that schools use to support their planning for healthy schools. The next step is to align and integrate this initiative with existing Ministry and school programs and initiatives designed to improve the health of BC students. It is recommended that BC join with other provinces and jurisdictions by implementing a provincial strategy for collecting health in formation and measures on grade 6 students.

The lower the proportion between the number of schools required to get X amount of students, the more cost effective the option will be per student.More schools to visit = increased costs in project coordinator ti me (to recruit and coordinate logistics) & travel, slightly hi gher communication costs (FAQs and consents) and hig her height & weight staff salary and travel. Responsibilities include support in scheduling assessments, prepar ing packages to ship to schools, developing contracts as nece ssary (e.g., scanner) and administering requirements for height & weight staff (e.g., contracts, criminal record cheques, insurance, school division approval). Estimate of cost = # hours required (5 hours per school) x rate of $25/hour. Project Coordinator responsibilities include recruiting and training staff, providing direction to Admin Assistant, communicati ng with schools as required, and attending & overseeing assessm ents - Cost caluclated by identifying the # of hours required (13 hours per school) x rate of $50/hour. It is recommended that advice on sampling (i.e. Epidemiologist's time) would be provided by the Ministry of Education. This budget asssumes that the project will be jointly endorsed by the Ministries of Healthy Living & Sport and Education. Proje ct implications affecting cost include: less time required by Project Coordinator(s) to communicate with and recruit schools; less time required to satisfy school district research approval processes; epidemiological support re: random sampling will be available; and, access to existing communication mec hanisms with schools (e.g., couriers) will be available. Includes scales, stadiometers, repairs, misc. In order to fa cilitate shari ng of equipment, the assessment should be spread over several months (i.e. Wave 1 Sept-Dec; Wave 2 Jan-March) - additional equipment required with 40+ schools. Misc equipment includes batteries, pencils, etc. Acquisition of additional scales and stadiometers (height) is recommended; buying less expensive scales ($50/each) and having s tudents stand backwards is recommended ($1000 will buy 4 scales @ $50 each and 4 stadiometers @ $200 each). Height & weight assessment staff salary includes training. It is calculated by identifying # staff, hours and rate per school (avg. of 4 staff per school for 5 hours per school @ rate of $30/hour).

S HAPES is a survey which collects population-level data from elementary and high schools (grades 5 to 12) on topics relating to health behaviours. Data can be collected from each student at any give n school, and has built-in quality control measures that ensure high quality data. SHAPES currently consists of five modules: Physical Activity Module: This module covers physical activity/inactivity behaviours, with some questions specific to school related enablers, and also includes BMI. Smoking Behaviours Module: Covers demographics and beha viours such as amount, frequency and situation, in addition to attitudes, and the social and physical environment. The module often includes questions relating to beha viours around alcohol and drug use. Healthy Eating Module: Designed in 2006 with nutrition experts from across the country, this module focuses on common healthy eating behaviour s for school aged children and adolescents. This module underwent pilot testing in 2008 and h as now been used successf ully in a number of projects. Mental Fitness Module: In an effort to evaluate and addr ess important psychological needs, this module focuses on the needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competency while also evaluating prosocial behaviour, social responsiveness, and emotions. Sun and Tanning Exposure Module: This is most recently developed module, and was adapted from a Canadian phone survey. The focus is on time in the sun, skin reactions to sun exposure, use of tanning beds and lamps, and sun protection behaviours. Given that schools are often interested in collecting information from a number of these modules, two multiple topic modules have been created. The modules select questions from each of the above modules and ensure that it takes roughly 30-40 minutes for students to complete. Currently one module has a stronger focus on physical activity, while the other has a focus on smoking behaviours. Participating schools receive a report 8 to 10 week s after data collection which can be used to identify areas or strength and weaknesses, and strategies to improve on the findings. In practice the SHAPES study goes well beyond collecting and presen ting data; these steps can be seen as phase 1 and 2 of a 4 phase project. Phase 3 involves working with the local community and school to form a plan for action based on identified priorities. Phase 4 takes this further by reflecting on the previous phases while ensuring that the plan for the future is aligned with local strategies and contexts. Beyond the school setting data is compiled regiona lly, provincially, or even nationally to inform policy and planning, and aid in the devel opment of tailored intervention strategies.

The World Health Organization defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being\" and \"the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations...satisfy needs and...change or cope with the environment.\" On some levels, health is a very personal responsibility. At the same time, policy makers working in the public sector have a unique opportunity to influence health in a broader, more systemic way. For example, policies that acknowledge individual needs, respect diversity and recognize achievement are all part of building healthy working and learning environments, and we know from experience as well as from research that, when we feel good, we're more effective in our jobs and better able to cope with the stresses of daily life. The same is true for children. An extensive body of literature supports the common-sense idea that, when children are healthy they learn better, achieve more and have higher self-esteem. Families play a critical role in supporting children's health, as do others across our communities. However, as the Provincial Health Officer noted in a special report on children's health in 2003... \"Of the four major systems of influence [affecting children] - family, friends or peers, school and community - the school is the only one that is an organized public institution amenable to being structured and mobilized to support societal goals.\" With their primary focus on learning, the school years provide an opportunity for children to systematically explore ideas about healthy living, supported by professional educators and - increasingly - partners from the health and community sectors. The school years also coincide with significant developmental phases when students are particularly vulnerable to health-compromising behaviours such as unhealthy eating, risk taking, and alcohol and drug misuse. Educators and policy makers have long been aware of these connections and much has been done across B.C. to support students' health through the school setting. For example, many schools and school boards have programs and policies addressing issues such as physical safety, nutrition, tobacco use, anti-bullying, empathy, diversity, and making healthy lifestyle choices. The BC Healthy Schools Network is a voluntary organization of schools whose common goal is to address the wide variety of academic, social and emotional concerns of students through the lens of comprehensive school health. Literature clearly demonstrates that interrelated, comprehensive approaches are more effective than solutions addressing only one component. Based on this, the Ministries of Education and Health have established the BC Healthy Schools Network Assessment Tool which schools can use to systematically assess how their school is doing with respect to the key components of a healthy school. Once the assessment is completed, schools will have established priority areas of focus. This information will help schools methodically develop school health improvement plans which will lead to more students realizing the academic, social and emotional benefits of a healthy school. Health and learning are interdependent. Children who are sick, tired and afraid have trouble learning (Allensworth, 1993) while cognition, concentration and cooperation are all enhanced when students are healthier (Kolbe, 1985).Page 2 | Healthy Schools Assessment Tool seC TI on 1: He al T HY sC H ools What Are Healthy Schools? The concept of healthy schools emerges from a global movement that recognizes two key ideas: healthy children are better able to learn, and f schools can directly influence children's health. f Healthy schools embrace - and incorporate into every aspect of their daily work and culture - the view that schools, families, the health sector and the community share responsibility for children's healthy growth and intellectual development. Being a healthy school means incorporating policies and practices that support students' health and overall well-being, recognizing the links between health and student achievement. Comprehensive school approaches are a way of working that becomes everyday practice. What is the Healthy Schools Network? The Healthy Schools Network is BC's expression of Comprehensive School Health. The concept of Healthy Schools arose out of the 1980's United Nations goals of \"Health and Education for All\" and remains guided today by the 1986 Ottawa Charter on Health which recognized the role of everyday supportive environments on health. The Healthy Schools Network is best described as a voluntary network of BC schools that are implementing a healthy schools approach in an action research setting. Network schools support the notion of Comprehensive School Health which is an integrated approach to health promotion that gives students numerous opportunities to observe and learn about positive healthy behaviours and influence healthy decision-making.Health promotion is defined by the World Health Organization as \"the process of enabling people to increase control over and improve their health.\"Benefits of System-Wide Approaches to School Health To achieve their potential, school children must participate fully in educational activities and to do this best, they need to be healthy, attentive and emotionally secure. Health and education are far-reaching complex services and it is clear that effective health promotion will only take place through integration of resources (human and financial) and ongoing coordination and cooperation at both local and provincial levels. Health-promoting actions have important educational benefits. The links between health and well-being of students and their capacity to benefit from educational opportunities and attain high standards of achievement are established. Good health narrows the opportunity gap and has significant positive effects on personal, social and educational achievements. Data associated with today's school-aged population has raised increasing concern with regard to increased physical inactivity, increased overweight and obesity and decreased emotional wellness (increased depression and anxiety) among today's youth. Becoming a healthy school can positively influence levels of physical activity, healthy eating, and improve school connectedness leading to increased emotional and physical well-being, all of which can significantly reduce preventable illnesses. seC TI on 2: bC Heal T HY sCH ools ne Tw oRk as sessmen T Tool The BC Healthy Schools Assessment Tool enables users to prioritize areas for improvement through a simple ranking and scoring system. Schools and their partners can use the tool to: confirm the value of existing health-promoting f policies and practices,The extent to which a nation's schools become \"health-promoting schools\" will play a significant role in determining whether the next generation is educated and healthy. - Jack Jones, World Health OrganizationHealthy Schools Assessment Tool | Page 3 stimulate discussion within and between their f organizations and with other partners support schools in their ongoing efforts to provide f an environment and culture that promote healthy living and foster students' ability to reach their full learning potential. The BC Healthy Schools Network Assessment Tool does not dictate any particular course of action. Neither is it intended as an external evaluation, but rather, this internal assessment tool provides an organized way to think about, integrate and build on the many health- promoting ideas and activities that already influence the culture of schools. The BC Healthy Schools Network Assessment Tool encourages a broad-based, comprehensive approach to health promotion by supporting dialogue and focus in three inter-related areas: teaching and learning, f school environment, and f partnerships. f seC TI on 3: aRe as fo R aCTI on Ultimately, health-promoting polices and practices will have the greatest impact when they fully address all three areas in an integrated, comprehensive way. Many schools find that their initial emphasis on one factor, such as physical activity or healthy eating, leads to a broader set of policies and practice which, combined, create a school culture that supports greater student health and achievement. The following section describes each of the three areas for action. Area 1: Teaching and Learning This area for action includes what students learn, how they are taught, and which resources teachers use for instruction. It includes both formal and informal learning.For example, the B.C. curriculum prescribes health- related outcomes that require students to attain the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to make healthy choices. These outcomes can be achieved through prescribed learning in areas such as Health and Career Education, Home Economics and Physical Education, and through school and classroom based initiatives and resources that support curriculum-based learning by encouraging students to make healthy choices in a fun, challenging and engaging way. Healthy choices can also be encouraged through informal learning throughout the school environment. Examples include: having more healthy foods available; f offering a range of extra-curricular activities that f reflect students' diverse interests; creating opportunities for students to build f healthy relationships with others in the school that encourage feelings of safety and connectedness; and modeling healthy choices and behaviours. f Area 2: School Environment This area for action includes the physical environment of the school and school grounds, as well as the 'feel' of the school environment, its culture, and the values embodied by its teachers, staff and students. Healthy schools feel welcoming and safe. Their physical environments, including such things as playground equipment, safe drop off zones/parking lots, water supplies, sanitation services and food preparation facilities, are designed to minimize the likelihood of injury and illness. Healthy schools also foster a caring, nurturing, respectful environment that gives students a feeling of connection to their school and school community. Health promoting schools have policies and practices that support both formal and informal teaching and learning about health and wellness. Teaching and learning can take place in the school or in the wider community.Page 4 | Healthy Schools Assessment Tool For example, they may engage students in discussing topics such as responsible decision-making, leadership and caring for others, and developing responsive skills to issues such as bullying, intimidation, and harassment. Area 3: Partnerships Partnerships are the basis of successful health promotion. This area for action includes supports and services within a school that contribute to students' physical and emotional health, as well as partnerships with people and groups outside the school that contribute to healthy school communities. Working in partnership is a fundamental principle of healthy schools and yet, forming sustainable partnerships can be challenging. Mutual understanding, trust and respect between all partners is central to building lasting working relationships. Successful partnerships with schools: are based on effective communication and strong f interpersonal relationships; fit with schools' focus on learning; f build on links between health and learning; f have common aims, objectives and goals; f are consistent with school district policy on f sponsorship; require health and education professionals to f understand and value each other's roles; are flexible; and f take time to develop. f Families are key partners supporting and contributing to a healthy school environment (i.e., through the Parent Advisory Councils). Partnerships between schools and health authorities can play a critical role in providing health-related information and support. Other organizations beyond the school also have a rich array of information, resources and services to offer.Some schools have student-led councils that meet regularly to plan school activities, helping to foster a sense of connection and enhance students' self-esteem.seC TI on 4: UsIng THe Heal T HY sCH ools neTw o Rk as sessmen T Tool The following section outlines specific elements for analysis as they relate to one of the Areas for Action discussed above. Templates have been developed to provide schools with an easy process for systematically assessing how their school is doing with respect to the key components of a healthy school. This process will enable schools to establish priority areas for improvement. Phase I: Team Successful use of this tool is dependent on a team approach. When schools develop teams or committees with a central focus on school health, they are more successful in developing sustainable change because all interested parties are part of the process. Success is dependent on involvement of all key stakeholder groups including - but not limited to - students, school administrators, teachers (i.e., physical education specialists, home economics, health counselors and physical activity generalists), parents, school facility and school administrative assistance staff, and relevant professionals from the community (i.e., community nutritionist, tobacco resource coordinator, public health nurse, municipal recreation administrators and members of the local business community). Secondary and middle schools are encouraged to involve students to increase the impact of strategies.Healthy schools use a range of different strategies to foster ties to the wider community. These may include activities such as taking part in neighbourhood clean- ups or engaging other schools in health-focused competitions, such as a fun walk-to-school contest.Healthy Schools Assessment Tool | Page 5 Phase II: Assess Answer all questions related to the Areas for Action . Questions relate to teaching and learning, school environment, and partnerships. The team is asked to rate the level of policy or practice within the school currently associated with each question (minimally, moderately or thoroughly) followed by a points tally and calculation of percentage (see sample on page 10). This will provide trend data on the level of attention the school is placing on each area and element of comprehensive school health. Examples of assessment strategies may include: Posting the school assessment tool in the staff room f Utilizing a series of staff meetings f Developing student and staff surveys f Interviewing staff, parents, students and f health professionals Network with other schools for ideas fPhase I: Checklist Provide an overview of Healthy Schools 5 t o staff including: purpose; concept; and benefits.

Phase III: Prioritize Highlight the areas you have ranked \"1's\" and \"3's\" f and determine which area/s will be a priority focus for your school this year. Utilize the f Approach to Action Section to summarize your areas for focus (p. 27-32) Review what a multi-factorial approach to identifying f health issues encompasses (p. 29) Phase IV: Action Using the results from Phases II and III, the school health team develops a plan for creating positive change. School health plans outline: the school's goals with respect to each priority area f for improvement; strategies for achieving desired results; f timelines for implementation; and f a communication strategy. f Implementing prioritized areas for improvement that require little cost, little time and little effort and will be highly valued by the school at large will gain some quick wins for the school. This helps the school experience the benefits of the healthy schools approach, creating greater school support, enthusiasm Phase III: Checklist Brainstorm a variety of possible strategies 5 t o deal with your #1's and #3's (areas you identified for attention).

Phase IV: Checklist Develop Healthy School Plan For 5 I mprovement. Formulate an inquiry question around 5 t he plan. Utilize S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, 5 a ttainable, realistic and timely) goals. Seek feedback and support through 5 t he Network of Performance Based Schools meetings. Evaluate and reflect on results in the spring. 5ConCl UsIo n Healthy schools combine and integrate resources wherever possible, enhancing and extending school- based expertise, reducing duplication of effort and developing strong connections between schools, families, service providers and the wider community. Creating an inventory of existing health related initiatives before beginning the assessment process will be helpful in larger school settings and will aid in identifying potential duplication. Implementing a healthy school approach involves a continual process of consultation, action and reflection, and keeping everyone informed throughout the process. This generates feelings of commitment and connectedness to the school or service, and ownership of the strategies that are implemented. Healthy school approaches do not require more work, just a way of working that becomes everyday practice. When there is leadership support and everyone is committed to the healthy schools concept, it is possible for health promoting activities to be well planned, coordinated, implemented over the long-term, and sustainable.Assess | Page 7 BC Healthy Schools Network Assessment ToolAssess | The Process | Page 9 Us e R gU ID e: THe PRoCe ss The essential purpose of the BC Healthy Schools Assessment Tool is to create an understanding of comprehensive school health and to provide a framework for discussion and assessment which will yield an environmental health scan of the school.

Look for clustering or common areas of concern. f Brainstorm a variety of possible strategies for f consideration (Appendix II; Strategic Scoring Index Template p. 34). Evaluate and prioritize the strategies using the f Strategy Scoring Index (Appendix I; p. 33 - optional) STEP 3: Establish a School Health Plan implementing the top f priority strategies. Utilize SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, f Achievable, Relevant, Time-limited).STEP 4: Formulate an inquiry question around the plan f (Network of Performance Based Schools). Review and reflect throughout the year. f Seek feedback and support through the Network of f Performance Based Schools meetings. Evaluate, document and celebrate results in the f spring of each school year. The sub-components of the assessment elements have applicability in virtually every instructional setting (primary, intermediate, middle and secondary). If your School Health Team strongly feels that one or two of these components are not applicable, just enter a '5' for that component. In this way, it will not skew your percentage results and it will ensure that you will identify the issues which need to be addressed.Page 10 | Assess | Sample Tool ASSESSMENT TOOL SAMPLE ASSESSMENT ELEMENT #1 Health and Career TOTAL: \u00f7 20 x 100 %aRe a 1: Tea C HI ng an D le aRnI ngPage 12 | Assess | Area 1: Teaching and Learning ASSESSMENT ELEMENT #2 Physical 20 #2 TOTALS/uniF6AF GRAND TOTAL: \u00f7 40 x 100 %Assess | en vIRo nmen T This area includes the physical environment of the school and school grounds, as well as the 'feel' of the school environment, its culture, and the values embodied by the school's teachers, staff, parents and students.

The five areas of assessment are: General practices in support of healthy living Community design in support of healthy living Physical environment related to physical activity Physical environment related to food/nutrition Public transportation in support of healthy living Such an assessment tool may be used by BC Health Authorities to survey the communities in their regions and to develop an overall pi cture of the health environment. 46 Available at http://www.ymca.ne t/downloads/CHLI_27_Comm_Assess.pdf.

The project aims to revolutionize chronic disease prevention by allowing practitioners and prog ram managers to track 'real-world' evidence from programs to understand what is effective, what is not, and under what contexts. Project leaders cite a key piece of the knowledge translation cycle, termed 'action to data', as the focus of the project. In essence CAPTURE wants to make program evaluation easy, accessible, and practical. It is largely web-based, with tools such as e-networking and a search engine in addition to tools that cover planning, evaluation, and dissemination. It is a resource that collects, shares, and supports the use of evidence added by practitioners from across the country. Through this collaborative effort the CAPTURE Project will deliver on its goa l of improving upon chronic disease primary prevention investments. The key features of CAPTURE include the following: Comprehensive Searching : Obtain a range of information relevant to your intervention like demographic data, policies, others doi ng similar work, summaries of interventions from sources like the Canadian Best Practices Portal and the CAPTURE platform. Program Planning and Implementation : Pull together information collected during your needs assessment and coordinate interventi on implementation by assigning tasks or setting milestones with the added convenience of calendar and email reminders. Evaluation Planning : Auto generate logic model and choose evaluation questions and indicators. Develop your data collection form s based on recommended tools or upload your own questions. Data collection and Analysis : Take advantage of online data collection forms or print out your forms for offline administration. The pl atform will automatical ly produce summary tables and graphs and will allow you to export your data for offline analysis. Reflecting on Practice : Share tacit knowledge by responding to prompts about the challenges experienced in planning and implementing your intervention. E-networking : Connect with others working on similar projects and discuss practice issues with those you trust. Reporting : Produce MS Word documents from predefined, customizable templates. Download reports onto your desktop for furt her refinement and publish your results onto the CAPTURE platform. Learning : Optimize your CAPTURE experience and enhance your evaluation skills through online tips, demos, webinars and onsite training "}
