My lower left side of my back hurt so bad all of th time. I work at an elementary school and would go home at llunchtime and lay down and after work lay down to relieve th pain. I would take ibuprofen all th time. After having my stem cells I felt good almost immediately. I didn't want to say so because I was afraid th pain would come back. It's been 9 mo. now and I feel great! I have energy! I am pain free! I didn't think I would b able to work another year after being in so much back pain but now I am already planning on another year at th school. I am 67 years old I recommend stem cells to anyone ihurting. It's great to b pain free! Life is miserable when u hurt and I hate remembering all th time that I did .

Before seeing Dr. Jones, I didn't believe in chiropractors. My past experiences with chiropractors has been disappointing and I didn't think they provided any positive results. All of that changed when I took my mom to see Dr. Jones few years ago for her back pain. Dr. Jones not only provided instant relief for my mom's back problems, but she continues to thrive to this day and he has forever changed our minds about chiropractice care in general. Few months ago, I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis on my left foot. I saw him less than 2 months and noticed positive results. Combined with his care, wearing right kind of foot support for my foot and also icing my foot at night, I noticed tremendous improvements which has improved my quality of life. I continue to see him twice a month and I couldn't be happier. Dr. Jones and his staff are one of the best practice I've come across and I would highly recommend his practice for anyone that seeks pain relief. His office is clean with modern decor, equipped with latest technology equipments so you know you're in good hands. If you are looking for an outstanding staff and a doctor, look no further. Book your appointment today and you will not be disappointed! My name is Sal. I had a car accident 3 months ago and I ended up getting whiplash, with extreme pain that caused me to be unable to look up. My medical doctor only prescribed me with pain killers to deal with the pain. The problem never went away, until I went to Williamson County Chiropractic and saw Dr. Martin Jones, By the second day of treatment from Dr. Jones, I saw immediate results and stopped taking the pain killers. Now, I am able to look up and move my neck. Progress is steady with a long ways to go but I am hopeful. Currently, I am in my second week of physical therapy, seeing results nearly every day. I cannot thank Dr. Jones enough. He knows what he's doing. I appreciate him and his team for doing an outstanding, professional job. Not to mention, the place is clean and neat. I recommend this clinic to anyone and to see Dr. Jones. Never felt better! Dr. Jones gets to the root of the issue so the adjustments hold longer and actually help correct the problem rather than just a temporary fix. He has techniques that allow the adjustments to correct issues in a more permanent way. You will still do things to get your body out of alignment, probably ever single day, so you will want to keep him on your schedule for maintenance once you are feeling better. My issues are so much better! My quality of life has improved greatly! I highly recommend his work! I've just been to WIM to see Karen Zizzo, RN. I am so satisfied with the results I am seeing with the procedure on my right hip and knee I wanted the same results for my left knee. I completely trust Karen's ability and would recommend her to anyone for instant and ongoing relief from pain and function of a joint. I was treated with friendly respect and professionalism and will return for any future treatments and encourage my friends to do the same. Thank you Karen for taking the pain away. At 67 I feel like I have new knees. The word \"Chiropractic\" can send a chill up a persons spine. The truth is, Chiropractic care is as essential to our life as taking care of our teeth and our eyes. I learned in my 20's working for a Chiropractor, how important it was to take care of our spine. There are many opinions out there for Chiropractic care and I am here to put in writing that Dr. Jones is an amazing person and Chiropractor......he WILL change the way you think of Chiropractic care. He is gentle, knowledgeable, caring and most importantly has the utmost integrity. We are all living longer these days, how horrible would it be to live longer and not enjoy it because we didn't take care of our spine? For a great experience contact Williamson County Chiropractic today and make an appointment to feel great and know you are in great hands. Approximately 7 months ago I donated a kidney. After my surgery I began experiencing numbness and occasionally sharp pain in my left leg. I consulted with my primary doctor and was prescribed muscle relaxers and pain medication, she also suggested therapy. The medication helped for a while but it did not resolve my issues. I followed up with the transplant clinic who performed the surgery and I was informed that since it was my left kidney that was removed it is possible that the nerves in that area may have experienced some trauma. I was also informed that nothing could be done other than time usually six months or longer. Basically I was told to take an aspirin. While attending a community event I saw Williamson County Chiropractic offering a free exam. Out of curiosity I decided to check it out. I am so glad I did. After meeting with Dr. Martin and working out a treatment plan, I am pleased to say the pain in my left leg has subsided. The bonus was that the doctor was also treated the stiffness I had in my neck. The staff is very professional and pleasant. Dr. Martin is professional, friendly and caring. I am so glad I visited that booth that day. Thank you so much Williamson County Chiropractic. Pain free and loving it. Dr. Jones and his team are fantastic!! After several years of chronic issues, I finally feel like I am on the path to feeling better because of their care. Dr. Jones takes the time to hear your story and thoroughly evaluate symptoms. He truly cares about his patients and works to make sure you are improving. I never feel like just another patient at his office. I highly recommend Williamson County Chiropractic!!! Dr. Jones and his staff are amazing. Their processes are unique and refined. I love the way Dr. Jones is able to multi task and take care of so many customers needs without ever looking like he is hurried or making his patients feel rushed. His staff takes on his professional and efficient demeanor which is a testament to him and to them. My wife is an avid obstacle course racer and I am an avid armature golfer. Dr. Jones has been able to help us both in ways that other chiropractors, massage therapist, and medical doctors have not. He has improved our standard of living by helping make it possible for us to do what we love........ compete. Great place to go and get adjusted. Caring and compassionate. I feel so much better, 'since Dr. Jones adjusted me! I had not been in alignment 'since before Corona. Dr. Jones & his staff are great! All in all, I'm hoping for a very positive outcome. I have a lot of pain in my left knee probably due to a slight encounter with a small ligament or tendon or something inside the knee. the pain will pass, I'll give it about 2 weeks. I love going to where people know you...not by appointment or social security or any identifying info like that...they know you and call you by name and that goes a long way with me. That's why I love Dr. Jones and his staff. Contact Us Nearby communities of Salado, Taylor, Lakeway & "}
