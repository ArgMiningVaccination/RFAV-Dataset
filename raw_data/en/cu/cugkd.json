BENEFITS OF HIGH DOSE VITAMIN C IV THERAPY FOR CANCER AND LYME DISEASE If you are considering alternative treatments for cancer, we suggest giving vitamin C IV a try. How can it help? There are atoms in your body called free radicals. They damage cells, causing oxidative stress. This leads to aging and various heart, cancer, and autoimmune diseases as well as neurodegenerative disorders. And that is where antioxidants come in. They neutralize excess free radicals, helping your body cope with oxidative stress before it can cause any serious damage. Interesting fact: the bodies of injured animals start producing more vitamin C to trigger fast regeneration. Unfortunately, human bodies don't do that. But we can easily get vitamin C from external sources! High dose vitamin C IV therapy for Lyme disease and cancer fills your body with enough antioxidants to fight the illness naturally. [Contact us](https://iuventusmedcenter.com/contact/) today to try this revolutionary alternative treatment! HIGH DOSE VITAMIN C IV THERAPY DOSAGE Before you went to your kitchen and started stuffing yourself with dozens of lemons or bell peppers, let us tell you that the secret behind the vitamin therapy lies in the dosage and the delivery method. High dose vitamin C IV therapy dosage for cancer patients is about 350 to 400 milligrams per deciliter. This is how much it takes to make cancer cells disintegrate. It is more than 300 times more than your normal level of vitamin C. And studies have shown that oral delivery doesn't produce high enough concentration to fight cancer. The best method in this case is IV. Intravenous infusions deliver vitamin C straight to the bloodstream in the shortest time, allowing to reach the needed concentration instantly. Another interesting fact is that traditional cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy contribute to oxidative stress caused by free radicals. These medical procedures break down vitamin C, decreasing its concentration and causing more harm than good. For this reason, high dose vitamin C IV therapy for cancer is a great supplementary treatment that you can add to your plan to help your body overcome the Big C. "}
