The leading detoxification principle is that illnesses can be caused by the build-up of toxic substances. Ridding the body of these toxins can help relieve symptoms, prevent illness, and increase overall health & vitality. Increased blood circulation stimulates the sweat glands, releasing built-up toxins and waste. In fact, the infrared heat generated by our suites produces sweat consisting of nearly 20% toxins versus only 3% in a traditional sauna. Regular infrared light therapy helps detoxify the body as it rids itself of an accumulation of potentially carcinogenic heavy metals (lead, mercury, nickel, cadmium) as well as alcohol, nicotine, sodium, sulfuric acid, and cholesterol. Detoxification is important because it strengthens the body's immune system and helps the body's biochemical processes function efficiently so that we are better able to digest the nutrients in our foods. Detoxification has also been shown to be helpful with colitis, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, autoimmune disease, immune deficiency states, autism, ADD and ADHD. The United States Center for Disease Control estimates that the root causes of more than 80% of all illnesses are found in personal environments or lifestyles. In other words, the world around you can make you sick. It's in the air we breathe, and in the food we eat. There's very little we can do to reduce exposure. We can, however, use sauna detox as a treatment. Researchers have long told us how the body sweats out toxic substances, including heavy metals. As long as you maintain proper hydration, the more you safely sweat, the more toxins you'll expel from your body. As such, detoxification in an infrared light therapy suite is up to 7 times more effective than in a traditional sauna. As a result, regular usage of infrared light therapy will provide a truly deep, productive sweat where toxins reside, at the cellular level. "}
