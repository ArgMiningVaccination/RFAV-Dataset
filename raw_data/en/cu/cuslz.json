Every other week, our specialists meet to go over every patient's case. This lets us evaluate patients from every angle, trade ideas and match you with the optimal treatments. Our kidney cancer treatment team includes: - Genitourinary oncologists trained in treating cancers in the urinary tract, including renal cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.

We're home to radiologists who specialize in looking at cancer. This gives your doctors the best possible information to guide your treatment. - Other specialists including genetic counselors, cancer-focused surgeons, anesthesiologists and more. Leading-Edge Kidney Cancer Treatments Some kidney cancers grow so slowly that they never need treatment. Others grow quickly and need to be removed. We have the experience to know the difference - and to make sure you get right care for your disease. We offer: Non-Surgical Therapies We start many patients with active surveillance, where we take images of tumors every few months to make sure they're not growing. When tumors need to be removed, our first step is to explore nonsurgical options like: - Percutaneous cryotherapy, which uses extreme cold to freeze and destroy tumors without the risks of surgery. Our specialized radiologists perform this procedure regularly and typically send patients home the same day. - Immunotherapy, which activates your immune system to fight back against cancer. We offer the latest immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors to tackle your cancer with minimal side effects. - [Radiation therapy](/medical-services/specialty-care/cancer-care/radiation-therapy), which we administer in precise, targeted doses to shrink and kill cancer cells. We often use this treatment for patients who aren't healthy enough to undergo surgery, or to ease cancer side effects like pain. Kidney Cancer Surgery If you need surgery to remove kidney cancer, we offer advanced options: - Partial nephrectomy, which removes tumors without removing the entire kidney. We're leaders in using robot-assisted surgery to make this procedure less invasive and more precise. - Open partial nephrectomy, where surgeons remove kidney tumors through an incision. We have many years of experience using this technique to help patients who have multiple kidney tumors or who have already had a kidney removed. - Radical nephrectomy: When patients need an entire kidney removed, our expertise in robotic-assistance makes the procedure more targeted and less invasive, which helps you recover faster. Clinical Trials for Kidney Cancer Our doctors don't just offer the latest therapies - they use clinical trials to develop new ones. These trials give you access to the latest, most innovative treatments. We do our best to match patients with clinical trials that might be right for them, and our doctors are constantly expanding our portfolio of late-breaking treatments.
