Religious and spiritual values are important to patients coping with cancer. Studies have shown that [religious](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=489395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [spiritual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) values are important to Americans. Most American adults say that they believe in God and that their religious beliefs affect how they live their lives. However, people have different ideas about life after death, belief in miracles, and other religious beliefs. Such beliefs may be based on gender, education, and ethnic background. Many patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rely on spiritual or religious beliefs and practices to help them [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with their disease. This is called spiritual coping. Many [caregivers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) also rely on spiritual coping. Each person may have different spiritual needs, depending on [cultural](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476357&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and religious traditions. For some seriously ill patients, spiritual well-being may affect how much [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) they feel about death. For others, it may affect what they decide about end-of-life treatments. Some patients and their family caregivers may want doctors to talk about spiritual concerns, but may feel unsure about how to bring up the subject. Some studies show that doctors' support of spiritual well-being in very ill patients helps improve their [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who treat patients coping with cancer are looking at new ways to help them with religious and spiritual concerns. Doctors may ask patients which spiritual issues are important to them during treatment as well as near the end of life. When patients with [advanced cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) receive spiritual support from the medical team, they may be more likely to choose [hospice](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44182&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) care and less [aggressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46053&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment at the end of life. (See the [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summary on [Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer](/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-pdq) for information on end-of-life issues.) Spirituality and religion may have different meanings. The terms spirituality and religion are often used in place of each other, but for many people they have different meanings. Religion may be defined as a specific set of beliefs and practices, usually within an organized group. Spirituality may be defined as an individual's sense of peace, purpose, and connection to others, and beliefs about the meaning of life. Spirituality may be found and expressed through an organized religion or in other ways. Patients may think of themselves as spiritual or religious or both. Serious illness, such as cancer, may cause spiritual distress. Serious illnesses like cancer may cause patients or family caregivers to have doubts about their beliefs or religious values and cause much spiritual [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some studies show that patients with cancer may feel that they are being punished by God or may have a loss of faith after being [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Other patients may have mild feelings of spiritual distress when coping with cancer. This summary is about spirituality and religion in adults with cancer. Spirituality and Quality of Life Key Points - Spiritual and religious well-being may help improve quality of life. - Spiritual distress may also affect health. Spiritual and religious well-being may help improve quality of life. It is not known for sure how [spirituality](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [religion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=489395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are related to health. Some studies show that spiritual or religious beliefs and practices create a positive mental attitude that may help a patient feel better and improve the well-being of family [caregivers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Spiritual and religious well-being may help improve health and [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the following ways: - Decrease [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), anger, and discomfort. - Decrease the sense of [isolation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454702&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(feeling alone) and the risk of [suicide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Decrease [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [drug abuse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454752&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Lower [blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and the risk of heart disease. - Help the patient adjust to the effects of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and its treatment. - Increase the ability to enjoy life during cancer treatment. - Give a feeling of personal growth as a result of living with cancer. - Increase positive feelings, including: - Hope and [optimism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=640063&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Freedom from regret. - Satisfaction with life. - A sense of inner peace. - Hope and Spiritual and religious well-being may also help a patient live longer. Spiritual distress may also affect health. Spiritual [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may make it harder for patients to [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with cancer and cancer treatment. [Health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may encourage patients to meet with experienced spiritual or religious leaders to help deal with their spiritual issues. This may improve their health, quality of life, and ability to cope.

A spiritual assessment may help the doctor understand how religious or spiritual beliefs will affect the way a patient copes with cancer. A [spiritual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a method or tool used by doctors to understand the role that religious and spiritual beliefs have in the patient's life. This may help the doctor understand how these beliefs affect the way the patient responds to the [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and decisions about cancer treatment. Some doctors or [caregivers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may wait for the patient to bring up spiritual concerns. Others may use an interview or a questionnaire. A spiritual assessment explores religious beliefs and spiritual practices. A spiritual assessment may include questions about the following: - Religious [denomination](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476288&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), if any. - Beliefs or [philosophy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of life. - Important spiritual practices or [rituals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476412&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Using spirituality or [religion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=489395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)as a source of strength. - Being part of a community of support. - Using prayer or [meditation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=730354&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Loss of faith. - Conflicts between spiritual or religious beliefs and cancer treatments. - Ways that [health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and caregivers may help with the patient's spiritual needs. - Concerns about death and afterlife. - Planning for the end of life. (See the [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)summary on [Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer](/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-pdq)for information on end-of-life planning). The health care team may not ask about every issue the patient feels is important. Patients should bring up other spiritual or religious issues that they think may affect their cancer care. Meeting the Patient's Spiritual and Religious Needs Key Points - To help patients with spiritual needs during cancer care, medical staff will listen to the wishes of the patient. - The health care team will help with a patient's spiritual needs when setting goals and planning treatment. To help patients with spiritual needs during cancer care, medical staff will listen to the wishes of the patient. [Spirituality](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [religion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=489395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are very personal issues. Patients should expect doctors and [caregivers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to respect their religious and spiritual beliefs and concerns. Patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who rely on spirituality to [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with the disease should be able to count on the health care team to give them support. This may include giving patients information about people or groups that can help with spiritual or religious needs. Most hospitals have [chaplains](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430477&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but not all [outpatient](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44520&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) settings do. Patients who do not want to discuss spirituality during cancer care should also be able to count on the health care team to respect their wishes. Doctors and caregivers will try to respond to their patients' concerns, but may not take part in patients' religious practices or discuss specific religious beliefs. The health care team will help with a patient's spiritual needs when setting goals and planning treatment. The health care team may help with a patient's spiritual needs in the following ways: - Suggest goals and options for care that honor the patient's spiritual and/or religious views. - Support the patient's use of spiritual coping during the illness. - Encourage the patient to speak with his/her religious or spiritual leader. - Refer the patient to a hospital chaplain or [support group](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45917&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that can help with spiritual issues during illness. - Refer the patient to other [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that have been shown to increase spiritual well-being. These include [mindfulness relaxation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=377712&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [yoga](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=532135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [meditation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=730354&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or creative arts programs, such as writing, drawing, or [music therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=640061&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about religious and spiritual coping in cancer care. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center) (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
