HCA shall approve the request for involuntarily termination of the Enrollee when the Contractor has substantiated in writing any of the following (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.56(b)(1)): The Enrollee purposely puts the safety or property of the Contractor, or the Contractor's staff, providers, patients, or visitors at risk, and the Contractor's attempts to address this behavior with reasonable accommodations of any disability Health Care Authority Page 87 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 of the enrollee have not been successful; and continued enrollment would seriously impair the Contractor's ability to furnish services to the Enrollee or any other Enrollees; The Enrollee engages in intentional misconduct, including refusing without good cause to provide information to the Contractor about third party insurance coverage; or The Enrollee received written notice from the Contractor of its intent to request the Enrollee's termination of enrollment, unless the requirement for notification has been waived by HCA because the Enrollee's conduct presents the threat of imminent harm to others. The Contractor's notice to the Enrollee shall include the Enrollee's right to use the Contractor's grievance process to review the request to end the Enrollee's enrollment. The Contractor shall continue to provide services to the Enrollee until HCA has notified the Contractor in writing that enrollment is terminated. HCA will not terminate Enrollment and the Contractor may not request disenrollment of an Enrollee solely due to a request based on an adverse change in the Enrollee's health status, the cost of meeting the Enrollee's health care needs, because of the Enrollee's utilization of medical services, uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from their special needs or mental health condition (WAC 182-538-130 and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.56(b)(2)). The Contractor shall have in place, and provide upon HCA's request, written methods by which it assures it does not request disenrollment for reasons other than those permitted under this Contract (42.C.F.R. \u00a7 438.56(b)(3)). An Enrollee whose enrollment is terminated for any reason, other than incarceration, at any time during the month is entitled to receive contracted services, at the Contractor's expense, through the end of that month. Health Care Authority Page 88 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 In no event will an Enrollee be entitled to receive services and benefits under this Contract after the last day of the month, in which his or her enrollment is terminated, except: When the Enrollee is hospitalized or in another inpatient facility covered by this Contract at termination of enrollment and continued payment is required in accord with the provisions of this Contract. For the provision of information and assistance to transition the Enrollee's care with another provider. As necessary to satisfy the results of an appeal or hearing. Regardless of the procedures followed or the reason for termination, when a disenrollment request is granted, or the Enrollee's enrollment is terminated by HCA for one of the reasons described in Subsection 4.10.5 of this Contract, the effective date of the disenrollment will be no later than the first day of the second month following the month the request was made. If HCA fails to disenroll the client within this timeframe, the disenrollment is considered approved. American Indian/Alaska Native Enrollment The Contractor will respect and support the enrollment choices of AI/ANEnrollees, including disenrollment into the Fee-for-Service Medicaid Program. Health Care Authority Page 89 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 5 PAYMENT AND SANCTIONS Rates/Premiums Subject to the Sanctions provisions of this Section, HCA shall pay a monthly premium for each Medicaid Enrollee in full consideration of the work to be performed by the Contractor under this Contract. HCA will only pay monthly premium payments for Medicaid Enrollees in the eligible client groups detailed in Subsection 4.2 of this Contract. HCA shall pay the Contractor, on or before the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of the month based on HCA list of Enrollees whose enrollment is ongoing or effective on the first day of said calendar month. Such payment will be denied for new Enrollees when, and for so long as, payment for those Enrollees is denied by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.726(b) or 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.730(e). Monthly Premium Payment Calculation The capitation rates are identified and developed, and payment is made in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.3(c). Supporting rate documentation demonstrates that the rate development pr ocess meets requirements of 42 C.F.R. Part 438 and generally accepted actuarial principles and practices. Rates are based on public or private payment rate s for comparable services for comparable populations, consistent with actuarially sound principles as defined at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 457.10. The monthly premium payment for each Enrollee will be calculated as follows: Premium Payment = Capitation Rate (at the age/gender cell level) x Withhold Factor Additional premium payments are made for Delivery Case Payment Rates and Wraparound with Intensive Services (WISe), as described in Subsections 5.7 and 5.8 of this Contract. The premium payment formula is established by HCA. The Age/Sex Adjustment factors are established by HCA and will be the same for all contractors. The Withhold Factor is intended to hold back a percentage amount, as identified in Exhibit D, Value-Based Purchasing, of the capitation payments excluding any administrative, WSHIP, PAP, IMD, or FQHC/RHC enhancement funding. A calculated portion of the amount withheld from the monthly premium payment will be released upon demonstrated improvement towards the quality measure benchmarks and physician incentive agreements defined in Exhibit D, Value-Based Purchasing. HCA shall automatically generate newborn premiums upon enrollment of the newborn. For newborns whose premiums HCA does not automatically generate, the Contractor shall submit a premium payment request to HCA within 365 calendar days of the date of birth. HCA shall pay within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of the premium payment Health Care Authority Page 90 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 request. HCA shall make a full monthly payment to the Contractor for the month in which an Enrollee's enrollment is terminated except as otherwise provided in this Contract. The Contractor shall be responsible for contracted services provided to the Enrollee in any month for which HCA paid the Contractor for the Enrollee's care under the terms of this Contract. Annual Fee on Health Insurance Providers The Contractor is subject to a fee (the \"Annual Fee\") imposed by the federal government under Section 9010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148 (124 Stat. 119 (2010)), as amended by Section 10905 of PPACA, and as further amended by Section 1406 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111-152 (124 Stat. 1029 (2010)) (collectively, \"PPACA\"), unless specifically exempt under federal law. If the Contractor is responsible for payment of a percentage of the Annual Fee for all health insurance providers, the Contractor's obligation is determined by the ratio of the Contractor's net written premiums for the preceding year compared to the total net written premiums of all covered entities subject to the Annual Fee for the same year. The amount of the Annual Fee attributable to the Contractor and attributable specifically to the Contractor's premiums under this Contract (\"Contractor's Allocated Fee\") could affect the actuarial soundness of the premiums received by the Contractor from HCA for the contract year during which the Annual Fee is assessed. A dollar amount reflecting the Contractor's Allocated Fee, which shall also include an adjustment for the impact of non-deductibility of the Annual Fee for federal and state tax purposes, including income and excise taxes (\"Contractor's Adjusted Fee\"), shall be payable to the Contractor under this Contract, unless t he Contractor is exempt from the Annual Fee under federal law. HCA shall consult with the Contractor and determine an estimated amount of the Contractor's Adjusted Fee based on the pro rata share of the preliminary notice of the fee amount, as transmitted by the United States Internal Revenue Service to the Contractor, attributable to the Contractor's net written premiums under this Contract. Capitation payments for the period to which the tax applies will be retroactively adjusted to account for this fee. The net aggregate change in capitation payments for the period based on the retroactive rate change will be paid to the Contractor. HCA shall make a good-faith effort to make the estimated payment to the Contractor thirty (30) calendar days before the deadline for payment by the Contractor. Health Care Authority Page 91 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 The adjustment shall be reconciled, no later than ninety (90) calendar days following the receipt of the final notice of the fee from the United States Internal Revenue Service, through a retroactive adjustment to the capitation rates for the applicable period and an additional payment to the Contractor, or a refund from the Contractor, as applicable, once the complete data is available to calculate the Contractor's Adjusted Fee. The Contractor agrees to not pursue any legal action whatsoever against HCA or its officers, employees, or agents with respect to the amount of the Contractor's Allocated Fee or Contractor's Adjusted Fee. Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) Report In accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.8, MCOs must report a Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) calculation to HCA on an annual basis. Using the instructions provided in Exhibit F, Instructions for MLR Reporting, and in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.8, the Contractor shall complete the MLR reporting template available in MC-Track for the MLR reporting year beginning January 1, 2019, and submit to HCA no later than May 31, 2020. Gain Share Program MCOs must report MLR experience calculated in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.8. Any settlements which result from the gain share program calculation will be limited such that the Contractor's minimum MLR will not be less than 85 percent when the settlement amount is included in the MLR calculation. HCA will perform gain share calculations on an annual basis for IFC. The following methods will be used to calculate the Gain Share components: Total Revenue is the sum of all Pre-Tax Capitation Rates, Delivery Case Rate Payments and Challenge Pool Payments. Total revenue should include non-risk benefit costs such as Administrative Services O nly drugs) including administrative costs. Total Revenue also assumes full recovery by the Contractor of Value-Based Purchasing withheld funds, regardless of whether those funds were actually recovered under the capitation withhold arrangement described in Exhibit D. Pre-tax capitation rates means that the AH-PDL payments and Health Insurer Fee, B&O Tax, and Premium Tax related revenue will be exc luded from this computation. Total Net Revenue is equal to Total Revenue, net of WSHIP components of the capitation revenue. Revenue for Health Care Expenses is defined as the Total Revenue less an assumed administrative load. [(Revenue) x Health Care Authority Page 92 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 (1- administrative load)] Actual administrative expenses will not be included in the computation. The assumed administrative load is shown on Exhibit A. Net Health Care Expenses will be based on the actual medical service expenses incurred during the contract year less any reimbursements from third-party reimbursements (including, but not limited to pharmacy rebates, overpayment recoveries from providers, net reinsurance costs or third-party liability offsets) plus direct Medical Management costs as defined by NAIC and GAAP guidelines and excluding any overhead allocations. Non-risk benefit costs should be included. Subcontractor expenses will be handled in accordance with the most recent CMS MLR guidance. Upon request by HCA, the Contractor will report its health care expenses for the year with any adjustments and run out claims as specified in the request from HCA. The template for providing the data and due date for the report will be included in the request from HCA. Contractor's Gain/Loss will be calculated using the following formula: Revenue for Health Care Expenses - Net Health Care Expenses (based on the actual incurred expenses for health care) = Net Gain/Loss (for the health care services provided). The net gain/loss divided by the Total Revenue will provide a percentage of the gain/loss which will be compared to the gain sharing thresholds established by HCA. Under the Gain Share Program, HCA w ill share in a significant excess of the Total Revenue for Health Care Expenses over the Net Health Care Expenses experienced by the Contract or as defined in subsection 5.5.5 of this Contract. Six (6) months following the end of the calendar year, using the financial reports provided by the Contractor, a simple profit and loss statement will be developed for the health services portion for each of the four populations. If Contractor experiences gain exceeding 3 percent, HCA will share equally in the gain between 3 percent and 5 percent. HCA will recover all gains exceeding 5 percent. The Contractor will only be required to reimburse HCA if it experiences an actual gain above 3 percent. Recoupments Unless mutually agreed by the parties in writing, HCA shall only recoup premium payments and retroactiv ely terminate enrollment for an individual Enrollee: With Duplicate Coverage as defined in this Contract. Who is deceased prior to the month of enrollment. Premium payments shall be recouped effective the first day of the Health Care Authority Page 93 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 month following the Enrollee's date of death. Who retroactively has their enrollment terminated consistent with this Contract. Who has been found ineligible for enrollment with the Contractor, provided HCA has notified the Contractor before the first day of the month for which the premium was paid. Who is an inmate at a correctional facility in any full month of enrollment. Who is residing in an Institute for Mental Disease (IMD) for more than fifteen (15) calendar days within a single calendar month, and whose primary admission is not SUD. When an audit or review determines that payment or enrollment was made in error. When HCA recoups premium payments and retroactively terminates enrollment for an individual Enrollee, the Contractor's submitted encounter record(s) for the terminated Enrollee for the affected member month(s) are no longer valid. When this occurs, the Contractor: Shall void the inaccurate encounters; May recoup payments made to providers. If the Contractor recoups said payments: The Contractor must issue proper notice to the provider indicating the reason for the recoupment. The Contractor's issuance of the notice must be in a timely manner to ensure the provider has the ability to bill the recouped claim(s) to another payer or government entity, if appropriate. The Contractor's providers may submit appropriate claims for payment to HCA through its FFS program, with the Contractor's notice of recoupment, if the Enrollee was eligible for covered services. Retroactive recoupments are determined on an individual Enrollee basis, and not on a family basis. Recouping premiums for one family member does not necessarily mean there will be recoupments taken for other family members. Health Care Authority Page 94 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 Delivery Case Rate Payment A one-time payment shall be made to the Contractor for labor and delivery expenses for IFC Enrollees enrolled with the Contractor during the month of delivery. The Delivery Case Rate shall only be paid to the Contractor if the Contractor has incurred and paid direct costs for labor and delivery based on encounter data received and accepted by HCA. Delivery includes both live and stillbirths, but does not include miscarriage, induced abortion, or other fetal demise not requiring labor and delivery to terminate the pregnancy. WISe Payment A separate case rate payment will be made monthly for individuals in the WISe Program as defined in this Contract and further described in subsection 17.1.16 of this Contract. Provider Access Payment (PAP) Program Provider Access Payment (PAP) Program - State Directed Payment methodology. The PAP program was developed to provide additional funding to critical professional providers. HCA will base the proposed minimum fee schedule payments on the Average Commercial Rate (ACR), with appropriate trending factors. On a quarterly basis, HCA will do a retrospective review of the providers' accepted professional encounter data to compare managed care payments versus the ACR at the service line level. HCA will aggregate, by provider, the total difference between the managed care payment and the ACR. HCA will pay the Contractor the total amount of the total difference for the PAP eligible providers. On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall pay to the participating providers, the specific directed payment amounts as provided by HCA based on the provider's individual utilization. On a yearly basis, PAP payment s for the calendar year will be reconciled with mature encounter data to ensure participating providers PAP payments do not exceed the programs allowable amounts. HCA will calculate and provide to the Contractor, the specific directed payment amounts to be provided to the PAP participating providers. On a yearly basis, the Contractor will pay to the participating providers, the yearly reconciliation-specific directed payment amounts per provider as provided by HCA. PAP program - ongoing adjustments pr e directed payment methodology. Ongoing adjustments to the PAP per member per month Health Care Authority Page 95 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 premium paid amounts from periods prior to PAP becoming a state directed payment will continue as adjustments to those premium transactions for periods as they occur. On a monthly basis, HCA will calculate and provide to the Contractor, the specific PAP amounts, for each managed care plan, to be passed on to the PAP participating providers. HCA's calculation of the distribution percentages by participating provider ending December 31, 2019, will be extended until the adjustments of prior periods cease. The percentages and clinics are listed below: 0.2836 - Children's University Medical Group (CUMG) 0.0098 - Harborview Medical Center (HMC) 0.0015 - University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) 0.5106 - University of Washington Physicians (UWP) 0.1359 - Valley Medical Center (VMC) 0.0549 - Northwest Hospital (NWH) 0.0037 - University of Washington School of Dentistry (SOD) On no less than a quarterly basis, The Contractor shall pay the monthly reported amounts provided by HCA, subsection 5.9.2.2. The Contractor shall distribute the reported amounts to the participating providers in accordance with the established percentages in subsection 5.9.2.3. Excluded Drugs The prescription drugs included in the table in subsection 17.4.5.16 are excluded from the premium payments described in subsection 5.2.1 of this Contract when not administered in an inpatient setting. Apple Health Preferred Drug List Payment The cost of all outpatient products included on the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Batch submission form, including prescription drugs on the AH-PDL described in subsection 17.3.3.1 of this Contract, have been excluded from the premium payments described in subsection 5.2.1 of this Contract.

The Contractor shall be reimbursed for qualifying accepted National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) pharmacy encounters including an administrative fee in the amount shown on Exhibit A by generating a Service Based Enhancement (SBE) payment beginning July 1, 2019. During the first full week of each month from February 2018 through July 2018, HCA will extract the encounter data submitted by the Contractor during the prior month with dates of service on or after January 1, 2018, for paid claims for drugs on the AH-PDL. Starting in August 2018, the data extract will include all outpatient pharmacy products included on the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Batch submission form with dates of service on or after on or after July 1, 2018. As of July 1, 2019 dates of service, the data extract will only include encounters submitted January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019. This manual data extract and process will account for encounters that have had a business status change and have not been paid. The encounter data files will be provided to the Contractor via HCA Secure File Transfer (SFT) sites for the encounters submitted by the Contractor. HCA will send notification to the Contractor via e-mail when the files have been posted to the SFT sites.

Payment to FQHCs/RHCs HCA will pay to the Contractor a lump sum monthly amount intended to provide funding to supplement the Contractor's payment to each of its contracted Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC)/Rural Health Clinics (RHC) to ensure that each FQHC/RHC receives its entire, specific encounter rate for each qualifying encounter. This monthly amount to be paid to the Contractor in a lump sum and subsequently disbursed to each FQHC/RHC as directed by HCA is called an enhancement payment. The lump sum payment to the Contractor for its contracted FQHC/RHC will continue to be based on a prior month's client assignments. The total amount of enhancement payment to be made to each Contractor will be based on the Contractor's correct and timely reporting and submission of client assignment roster files to HCA on a monthly basis. For purposes of this Section, the \"client assignment roster file\" is the electronic file submitted monthly by the Contractor to HCA that is intended to identify the FQHC/RHC to which a Managed Care client has been assigned by the Contractor. The client assignment roster file is specific to client assignment and the resulting per-client enhancement payment only, and it is a separate and distinct process from encounter claim submission. It is this per-client enhancement payment, or capitation payment, that is aggregated by FQHC/RHC and paid to the Contractor for disbursement to the individual FQHC/RHC. The amount due to each FQHC/RHC will be provided to the Contractor by HCA. The Contractor shall submit its Enrollee assignment roster files to HCA no later than the 10th of the month for the current month of enrollment (i.e. Enrollee assignments for July 2020 are due to HCA on July 10, 2020). HCA will pay to the Contractor a lump sum enhancement payment in the following month. Rejected rosters resulting in errors from the Enrollee assignment roster files will be sent by HCA to the Contractor by the 15th of the month in which the roster was submitted. Corrections will be submitted to MC-Track by the Contractor no later than the 20th of the same month. Any Enrollee assignment roster file data received after Health Care Authority Page 111 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 the 20th of the month will be included in the next payment cycle for HCA's payment to the Contractor. Retroactive enrollment and disenrollment shall follow the same timeline and procedure and will be processed no differently than client assignment roster files for the current month. Using correctly submitted client assignment roster files and corrected error files, HCA will base the total enhancement payment due to the Contractor on the number of successfully loaded client records multiplied by the specific enhancement rate of each contracted FQHC/RHC. Thus, payment due to each Contractor will be the aggregated amount of all capitation payments for each contracted FQHC/RHC. The Contractor shall submit the final roster updates for the previous calendar year by June 15 of the current year. This final roster submission is to include all retro enrollments and disenrollments for the previous calendar year. HCA will provide the Contractor with the monthly enhancement payment funds separ ately from the monthly premium payments. These supplemental payments will include the load for the 2 percent premium tax. The premium tax is retained by the Contractor and is not paid to the FQHC/RHC. The enhancement payments will be calculated separately and apart from the risk-based capitation payments made to the Contractor by HCA and at no time will the Contractor be at risk for or have any claim to the enhancement payments. The FQHC/RHC is entitled to its specific, full encounter rate for each qualifying encounter as outlined in the Medicaid State Plan and in accordance with Section 1902(bb) of the Social Security Act (42 USC \u00a7 1396a(bb)). The full encounter rate shall be at least equal to the Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate specific to each FQHC/RHC and applies to FQHC/RHC reimbursed under the Alternative Payment Methodology (APM) rate methodology and to FQHC/RHC reimbursed under the PPS rate methodology. The encounter rates and enhancement rates for each contracted FQHC/RHC will be provided by HCA to the Contractor on a quarterly basis or sooner if any changes or corrections are needed. The rate files will be published to this location Health Care Authority Page 112 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 (http://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-prov iders/claims-and-billing/professional- rates-and-billing-guides ), according to the following schedule: January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1. Any changes that occur during the quarter will be included in the next file and will specify the effective date of the change. To ensure that each FQHC/RHC receives its entire encounter rate for each qualifying encounter, the Contractor shall pay each contracted FQHC/RHC in one (1) of the ways described below: Under the first payment method, the Contractor shall pay the specific monthly enhancement payment amount provided by HCA to the FQHC/RHC in addition to payment of claims for services made at standard rates paid to the FQHC/RHC by the Contractor.

The published list of RHCs and their NPIs can be located at: https://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-providers- partners/prior-authorization-claims-and-billing/provider-billing- guides-and-fee-schedules . Dates to Service RHC Encounter Payment Method January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 The Contractor will not pass the enhancement through to the clinics. MCOs will use the enhancement funds received from HCA for the sole purpose of paying RHCs for the T1015 portion of encounter eligible claims. January 1, 2020 to current The Contractor shall, no longer receive monthly enhancements for pass through to RHCs and will instead be reimbursed for the T1015 portion of encounter eligible claims via a service based enhancement (SBE) payment. This SBE payment will be generated through ProviderOne after the Contractor submits claims for eligible encounters.

For all RHCs under the payment method described in subsection 5.24.3.3 HCA will perform an annual reconciliation with the Contractor. Reconciliations will ensure that eac h participating RHC received its full encounter rate for each qualifying claim and that MCOs are not put at risk for, or have any right to, the T1015 portion of the claim. Reconciliations will be conducted in the second half of the calendar year following the calendar year for which enhancements were made. Claims included in RHC encounter reconciliations between the Contractor and HCA will include: An eligible RHC encounter service as outlined in the RHC Billing Guide (found at: https://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-providers/claims- and-billing/professional-rates-and-billing- guides# ); A T1015 procedure code; and A certified RHC Billing NPI (participating NPIs will be shared by HCA with MCOs at least annually). HCA will base reconciliation findings on the Contractor's timely submission of encounter data, as specified in Subsection 5.13 of this Contract. Actual payment amounts will be used for each RHC reconciliation, except for the RHCs that receive payment from the Cont ractor under a capitated model. Reconciliation for the RHCs that are capitated will utilize a FFS equivalency methodology. For any underpayment in which the Contractor did not receive sufficient payments for the T1015 portion of encounter eligible claims which were paid in the previous year, HCA shall pay the Contractor the amount due. For any overpayment in which the MCO received more than sufficient payment for the T1015 portion of encounter eligible claims which were paid in the previous year, HCA shall recoup the amount due from the Contractor. Claims adjusted or paid after the finalization of reconciliation will be included in the following year's reconciliation.

The Contractor shall accept, document, record, and process Grievances forwarded by HCA or DSHS. The Contractor shall provide a written response to HCA within three (3) business days to any constituent grievance, unless HCA requests an expedited response.

If the Contractor extends the timeline for a Grievance not at the request of the Enrollee, it must give the Enrollee written notice, within two (2) calendar days, of the reason for the decision to extend the timeframe and inform the Enrollee of the right to file a grievance if he or she disagrees with that decision. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.408(c)(2)(ii); and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.408(b)(1). The Contractor must notify Enrollees of the resolution of Grievances within five (5) business days of determination. The notification may be orally or in writing for Grievances not involving clinical issues. Notices of disposition for clinical issues must be in writing, must be easily understood and meet all Enrollee communications requirements in Subsection 3.2. Enrollees do not have the right to a hearing in regard to the resolution of a Grievance, except to address the C ontractor's failure to adhere to the notice and timing requirements for grievances (WAC 182-538-110(4)). Health Care Authority Page 241 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 Appeal Process The following requirements are specific to the appeal process: An Enrollee, the Enrollee's authorized representative, or a provider acting on behalf of the Enrollee and with the Enrollee's written consent, may appeal a Contractor Adverse Benefit Determination (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.402(b)(1)(ii)). If a provider has requested an appeal on behalf of an Enrollee, but without the Enrollee's written consent, the Contractor shall not dismiss the appeal without first contacting the Enrollee within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the provider's request, informing the Enrollee that an appeal has been made on the Enrollee's behalf, and then asking if the Enrollee would like to continue the appeal.

If the Enrollee does not wish to continue the Appeal, the MCO shall formally dismiss the Appeal, in writing, with appropriate Enrollee Appeal rights and by delivering a copy of the dismissal to the provider as well as the Enrollee. For expedited appeals, the Contractor may bypass the requirement for Enrollee written consent and obtain Enrollee oral consent.

If HCA receives a request to appeal an Adverse Benefit Determination of the Contractor, HCA will forward relevant information to the Contractor and the Contractor will contact the Enrollee. For Appeals of standard service authorization decisions, an Enrollee, or a provider acting on behalf of the Enrollee, must file an appeal, either orally or in writing, within sixty (60) calendar days of the date on the Contractor's Notice of Advance Benefit Determination.

An oral appeal must be followed by a written, signed, appeal unless the Enrollee requests an expedited resolution (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.402(c)(3)(ii)); or the Contractor determines the timeframe for standard appeal decisions could seriously jeopardize the Enrollee's life or health or ability to attain, maintain or regain maximum function. The Contractor shall outreach and coordinate as needed to assist the Enrollee in submitting a written, signed appeal. If the Enrollee does not provide a written, signed appeal within ten (10) calendar days of a standard oral appeal request, the Contractor shall notify the Enrollee, in writing, of the need for the written appeal, unless the Enrollee's sixty (60) day timeline to file an appeal has expired.

Inform the Enrollee that the Enrollee may be held liable for the amount the Contractor pays for services received while the hearing is pending in accordance with RCW 74.09.741, if the hearing decision upholds the Contractor's Adverse Benefit Determination. Expedited Appeal Process The Contractor shall establish and maintain an expedited appeal review process for appeals when the Contractor determines or a provider indicates that taking the time for a standard resolution could seriously jeopardize the Enrollee's life, physical or mental health or ability to attain, maintain, or regain maximum function (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.410(a)). The Enrollee may file an expedited appeal either orally or in writing. No additional Enrollee follow-up is required. The Contractor shall resolve each appeal and provide notice, as expeditiously as the Enrollee's health condition requires, within the following timeframes (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.408(b)(2)-(3)): For expedited resolution of appeals or appeals of mental health drug authorization decisions, including notice to the affected parties, the Contractor shall make a decision within seventy-two (72) hours after the Contractor receives the appeal.

The Enrollee has a right to file a grievance regarding the Contractor's denial of a request for expedited resolution. The Contractor must inform the Enrollee of their right to file a grievance in the notice of denial. Administrative Hearing Only the Enrollee or the Enrollee's authorized representative may request a hearing. A provider may not request a hearing on behalf of an Enrollee. If an Enrollee does not agree with the Contractor's resolution of the appeal, the Enrollee may file a request for a hearing within the following time frames (See WAC 182-526-0200): For hearings regarding a standard service, within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the date of the notice of the resolution of the appeal (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.402(b)(2)).

The Contractor will be bound by the final order, whether or not the final Health Care Authority Page 246 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 order upholds the Contractor's decision. Implementation of the final order shall not be the basis for termination of enrollment by the Contractor. If the final order is not within the purview of this Contract, then HCA will be responsible for the implementation of the final order. The hearings process shall include as parties to the hearing, the Contractor, the Enrollee and the Enrollee's representative, or the legal representative of the deceased Enrollee's estate and HCA. Independent Review After exhausting both the Contractor's Appeal process and the Administrative Hearing, the Enrollee has the right to request an independent review in accordance with RCW 48.43.535 and chapter 182-538 WAC.

The Enrollee requests an extension of services. If, at the Enrollee's request, the Contractor continues or reinstates the Enrollee's services while the appeal, hearing, or independent review, is pending, the services shall be continued until one of the following occurs (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.420 and WAC 182-526-0200 and WAC 182-538-110): The Enrollee withdraws the appeal, hearing, or independent review request.

Health Care Authority Page 341 of 344 Contract No. K3249 Apple Health Integrated Foster Care Rev. 7-1-20 18 Third Party Liability Subrogation of Rights of Third Party Liability Subrogation Rights of Third-Party Liability: \"Injured person\" means an Enrollee covered by this Contract who sustains bodily injury. \"Contractor's health care expense\" means the expense incurred by the Contractor for the care or treatment of the injury sustained computed in accord with the Contractor's FFS schedule. If an Enrollee requires medical services from the Contractor as a result of an alleged act or om ission by a third-party giving rise to a claim of legal liability against the third-party, the Contractor shall have the right to obtain recovery of its cost of providing benefits to the injured per son from the third-party. HCA specifically assigns to the Contractor HCA's rights to such third party payments for medical care provided to an Enrollee on behalf of HCA, which the Enrollee assigned to HCA as provided in WAC 182-503-0540. HCA also assigns to the Contractor its statutory lien under RCW 41.05A.070. The Contractor shall be subrogated to HCA's rights and remedies under RCW 74.09.180 and RCW 41.05A.050-.080 with respect to medical benefits provided to Enrollees on behalf of HCA under chapter 74.09 RCW. The Contractor may obtain a signed agreement from the Enrollee in which the Enrollee agrees to fully cooperate in effecting collection from persons causing the injury.

This report shall be submitted on the template provided in MC-Track. Good Caus e Exemption from Billing Third Party Insurance The Contractor must have a policy to allow Enrollees the right to be exempt fro m billing third party insurance due to good cause. This includes a procedure that allows for the good cause process to apply on an individual claim basis and a means to flag the Enrollee's account so that the need for additional privacy and precaution can be easily seen. \"Good cause\" means that the use of the third-party coverage would violate an Enrollee's confidentiality because the third party: Routinely sends verification of services to the third-party subscriber a nd that subscriber is someone other than the Enrollee; Requires the Enrollee to use a primary care provider who is likely to rep ort the Enrollee's request for family planning services to the subscriber; The Enrollee has a reasonable belief that cooperating with the Contractor in identifying TPL coverage could result in serious physical or emotional harm to the Enrollee, a child in his or her care, or a child related to him or her; or The Enrollee is incapacitated without the ability to cooperate with the Contractor. A description of this process, including any steps the Enrollee must take to seek exemption based on good cause, must be included in every notice the Contractor provides to Enrollees regarding Third Party billing or seeking cooperation with such billing. The notices must include that reasons such as fear of domestic violence or other harm are included in good cause. The Contractor's policy must include a procedure that allows for the good cause process to apply on an individual claim basis. Any denial of good cause is an adverse benefit determination. Any communications or billing must be suspended pending a good cause request or appeal of a request denial.

The formula under which all or par t of the Provider In centives Portion of the Withhold may be earned back is set out in this section. 2.7. During the Withhold Perfo rmance Year, the Contractor at its discretion can seek feedback from HCA on whethe r provider payment arrangem ents qualify as Provider Incentives. 2.8. On or before August 1 following each Withhold Perf ormance Year, the Contractor shall report to HCA the total statewide and regional Assessed Payments that the Contractor made to providers for the Withho ld Performance Year, and the amount of statewide and regional Posi tive Incentives, Po sitive Incentives Earned, Negative Incentives, and Negative Incentives Incu rred for the Withhold Performance Year (\"Provider Incentives Data \"). Failure to provide the report by the deadline may result in loss of Withhold described in th is Exhibit. For the purposes of calculating the Provider Incentives Portion ear ned by the Contractor, HCA will measure Contractor performance by the Positive In centives and Negative Incentives, while the Positive Incentives Earned and Negative Incentives Incurred are for informational purposes only. 2.8.1. Provider Incentives will be assi gned to each region based on the location of the Provider. 2.8.2. Assessed Payments will be cons idered to have been made when the Page 5 of 17 IFC contract Exhibit D3, ValueBased Purchasing Rev. 41420 services have been provided. 2.9. The Contractor s hall report the Provider Incentives Data, and provide examples of the types of Positive Incentives and Ne gative Incentives im plemented in each region, in the format set out in Table 2. Table 2 Statewide and Regional Qualifying Incentives Region Assessed Payments Positive Incentives Negative Incentives Total Positive Incentives Total Positive Incentives Earned Describe* Total Negative Incentives Total Negative Incentives Incurred Describe* BHT Cascade GC King NC NS Olympic Pierce SW WA Statewide total *For example: \"Downside risk arrang ement whereby providers make payment s to contracted payers from an existing reimbursement structure based on quality reporting and performance.\" 2.10. A third-party contractor to HCA will validate the Contractor 's reported actual Positive Incentives and Negative Incent ives to network providers. 2.11. Provider Incentives sh ould be reported in the period in which they apply to the effective contracts in the Contractor 's financial statements. Positive Incentives Earned and Negative Incentives Incurred should be reported in the period in which they are paid or accr ue in the Contractor 's financial statements, using a consistent method of reporting should be consistent to ensure that amounts are not double- counted from year to year. 2.12. HCA will use the data s upplied by the Contractor to calculate the total Provider Incentives for the Withhold Performance Year as a percent of total Assessed Payments for the Contractor for t he Withhold Performance Year. 2.12.1. If for the Withhold Performanc e Year the percent calculated under subsection 2.10 of this Ex hibit is equal to less t han the Provider Incentives Threshold for the Withhold Perform ance Year in Table 1, then the percentage calculated under subsection 2.12 of this Exhibit will be recalculated as a percentage of the Pr ovider Incentives Threshold for the Page 6 of 17 IFC contract Exhibit D3, ValueBased Purchasing Rev. 41420 Withhold Performance Year. The resulting Provider Incentives \"Partial Earn- Back Percentage \" will then be the percentage of the Provider Incentives Portion of the Withhold that the Contractor is eligible to earn back. 2.12.2. The results of the calculations ar e rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is f our or less, it is dropped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decimal is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, rounding 0.667 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.67, or 67 percent. 2.13. For the Contractor to ear n back the Provider Incentives Portion of the Withhold in full, the total Provider Incentives for t he Withhold Performance Year must equal at least Provider Incentives Threshold percent of Assessed Payments made during the Withhold Performance Year. 3. Qualifying Value-Based Payments - (\"VBP Payments Portion \" of the Withhold) 3.1. For purposes of this section, \"Pay ments in a Value-Based Payment Arrangement\" means Assessed Payments in a Va lue-Based Payment Arrangement. 3.2. For purposes of this section, \"Hybrid Payment Models\" means payment arrangements that incorporate multiple APMs. Payments in Hybrid Payment Model shall assign Total Payments to the most dominant APM Category. The dominant APM Category is defined as the APM Cat egory under which a plurality of payments are made. 3.3. For purposes of this section, \"Int egrated Primary Care Pa yment and Delivery Systems\" are systems whereby a primary care provider is held accountable for the total cost of care for their patient population. Assessed Payments that are Integrated Primary Care Pa yment and Delivery Systems shall be included in APM Category 3A (for an upside only, shared sa vings arrangement) or Category 3B (for a two-sided, shared savings and downside risk arrangement). 3.4. The VBP Payments Portion of the Wit hhold shall be 12.5 percent of the total Withhold. The VBP Payments Portion of the Withhold may be earned back in whole or in part by ensuring that A ssessed Payments are tied to Value-Based Payment Arrangements. The formula under which all or part of the VBP Payments Portion of the Withhold may be earned back is set out in this Section. 3.5. On or before August 1 following the Withhold Perfo rmance Year, the Contractor shall report to HCA the total regional and statewide Assessed Payments in each HCP-LAN Category as defined u nder subsection 1.7 of this Exhibit. In addition, the Contractor shall report to HCA the tota l regional and statewide Assessed Payments made by the Contractor in MACRA A-APM payment models certified through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Failure to provide the report by the deadline may result in loss of the amount withheld. Payments will be assigned to each region based on the location of the Provider. 3.6. The Contractor shall report the data outlin ed in subsection 3.5 of this Exhibit in the format laid out in Table 3.

A third party contractor to HCA shall validate the Contractor 's reporting of the total amounts and categorization of the reported Payments in a Value-Based Payment Arrangement. 3.10. HCA will use the data supp lied by the Contractor to calc ulate the total Payments in a Value-Based Payment Arrangem ent as a percent of total Assessed Payments for the Contractor for the Wi thhold Performance Year. 3.10.1. If for the Withhold Performanc e Year the percentage calculated under subsection 3.10 of this Exhibit is less than the VBP Payments Threshold for the Withhold Performance Year, t hen the percentage calculated under subsection 3.10 of this Exhibit will be recalculated as a percentage of the VBP Payments Threshold for the Withhold Performance Year. The resulting VBP Payments \"Partial Earn-Back Percentage\" will then be the percentage of the VBP Payments Portion of t he Withhold that the Page 9 of 17 IFC contract Exhibit D3, ValueBased Purchasing Rev. 41420 Contractor is eligible to earn back. 3.10.2. The results of t he calculation are rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dropped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decimal is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. Fo r example, rounding 0.667 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.67, or 67 percent. 3.11. For the Contractor to earn back the VBP Payments Porti on of the Withhold in full, the total Payments in a Value-Based Pa yment Arrangement for the Withhold Performance Year must equal at least t he VBP Payments Threshold Percent of Assessed Payments made during the With hold Performance Year. The VBP Payments Threshold for Each Withhold Pe rformance Year is set out in Table 1. 4. Overall Quality Improvement Score Calculation - (\"QIS Portion \" of the Withhold) 4.1. The QIS Portion of the Withhold shall be 75 percent of the total Withhold. The QIS Portion may be earned back in whole or in part by achieving quality improvement and attainment targets on t he basis of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set HEDIS\u00ae scores, and by satisfying the ad ditional requirements set out in this Section. 4.2. The Contractor shall re port HEDIS\u00ae measures in acco rdance with the Performance Measures subsection of this Contract. HCA will produce the non-HEDIS scores in accordance with the Performance Measures s ubsection of this Contract. Specific measures will be evaluated to determine the share of the QIS Portion of the Withhold that the Contractor is eligible to earn back and are identified in Tables 5 and 6. Failure to meet the requirements of this paragraph, or failure to pass the HEDIS audit or performance m easure validation may result in loss of the amount withheld. 4.3. If the value for one or mo re measures is missing or not available, the HCA Chief Medical Officer (CMO), in his or her sole discretion, will determine the values to be used in place of the missing values using pu blicly available source s. If the value is missing or not available, using publicly av ailable sources, the HCA CMO will either determine an alternative meas ure or exclude the measur e from the calculation. 4.4. The values in Table 5 shall apply fo r Withhold Year 2019, and Table 6 shall apply for Withhold Year 2018, and Table 7 s hall apply for Withhold Year 2020. 4.5. The comparison values used for HEDI S\u00ae performance are NCQA Quality Compass Medicaid HMO Values in the year set out in Table 1. 4.6. The QIS score calculation methodology di ffers by year. See Section 5 and 6 of this Exhibit. 5. Quality Improvement Score Calculation (\" QIS Portion\" of the Withhold) for Withhold Performance Year 2018 and 2019 5.1. HCA will use the data s upplied by the Contractor to calculate a single Quality Improvement Score (QIS) for the Contractor for the Withhold Performance Year. Page 10 of 17 IFC contract Exhibit D3, ValueBased Purchasing Rev. 41420 The total QISwill reflect a weighted aver age of individual co mposite scores (the \"Measure Composite Score \") that assess annual improvement (the \"Measure Improvement Score \") and objective attainment (the \"Measure Quality Score \") on each Quality Measure. 5.2. The Measure Improvem ent Score and Measure Qualit y Score for each Quality Measure will measure the HEDIS\u00ae score s provided by the Contractor and non- HEDIS\u00ae scores against Target Measure Score and Mean Measure Score values shown in Table 5. 5.2.1. The Target Measure Score values referenced in Table 5 that are identified as HEDIS\u00ae scores are derived from NCQA Quality Compass Medicaid HMO 90th percentile values for the year immediately preceding the Withhold Performance Year, as identifi ed in Table 1. The Target Measure Score values referenced in Table 5 t hat are identified as non-HEDIS scores will be one percentage point above the Mean Measure Score for the year immediately proceeding the Wi thhold Performance Year. 5.2.2. The Mean Measure Score values re ferenced in Table 5 are equal to the Contractor's Improvement Ba seline Year measure score. 5.3. The Measure Quality Score QS(i) for a given measure will reflec t the Contractor's attainment beyond the Mean Measure Score in terms of the total distance between the Mean Measure Score and the Target Measure Score. This relationship is initially ca lculated as the Measure QS Ratio where Measure QS Ratio = (Withhold Performance Year Meas ure Score - Mean Measure Score) / (Target Measure Score - Mean Measur e Score). 5.3.1. The Measure QS Rati o is rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dr opped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decimal is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, rounding 0.667 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.67, or 67 percent. 5.3.2. The Measure QS Rati o will be transformed into a curved distribution using a lookup table provided in Attachment B of this Exhibit, QIS Lookup Table. The result of the lookup transformat ion will be a QS Table Lookup Value. 5.3.3. For a given measure, the QS T able Lookup Value is the value where the horizontal axis that equals the absolut e value of the (W ithhold Performance Year Measure Score - Mean Measure Sc ore) intersects with the vertical axis that equals the absolute value of the (Target Meas ure Score - Mean Measure Score). Howeve r, if the Withhold Perf ormance Year Measure Score is less than the Mean Measure Score, then the QS Table Lookup Value shall be considered to be zero. 5.4. The Measure Improvement Score IS (i) for a given meas ure will reflect the Contractor's improvement from the Impr ovement Baseline Year Measure Score in terms of the tota l distance between the Improvem ent Baseline Year Measure Score and the Target Measure Score. This relationship is init ially calculated as Page 11 of 17 IFC contract Exhibit D3, ValueBased Purchasing Rev. 41420 the Measure IS Ratio where Measure IS Ratio = (Withhold Performance Year Measure Score - Impr ovement Baseline Year Measur e Score) / (Target Measure Score - Improvemen t Baseline Year Measure Score). 5.4.1. The Measure IS Ratio is rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dr opped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decimal is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, rounding 0.667 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.67, or 67 percent. 5.4.2. The Measure IS Rati o will be transformed into a cu rved distribution using the lookup table provided in Attach ment B of this Exhibit, QIS Lookup Table. The result of the lookup tr ansformation will be an IS Table Lookup Value. 5.4.3. For a given measure, the IS T able Lookup Value is the value where the horizontal axis that equals the absolut e value of the (W ithhold Performance Year Measure Score - Improvement Baseline Year Measure Score) intersects with the vertical axis that equals the absolute value of the (Target Measure Score - Improvement Baseline Year Measure Score). However, if the Withhold Performance Year Measure Score is less than the Improvement Baseline Year Measure Score, then the IS Table Lookup Value shall be considered to be zero. 5.5. The Measure Q-I Weighting Factor z(i) for a given measure will determine the respective weight given to the M easure Quality Score and the Measure Improvement Score in calcul ating the Measure Composite Score. The Measure Q-I Weighting Factor shall r ange from 0.25 to 1, dependent on the Measure QS Ratio (not the QS Table Look up Value) as follows: 5.5.1. If the Measure QS Ratio is equal to or less than 0.25, then the Measure Q-I Weighting Factor shall equal 0.25. 5.5.2. If the Measure QS Ratio is more than 0.25 and less than 1 then the Measure Q-I Weighting Factor shall equal t he Measure QS Ratio. 5.5.3. If the Measure QS Ratio is equal to or greater than 1, then the Measure Q-I Weighting Factor shall equal 1. 5.6. The Measure Quality Score QS(i) for a given measure shall equal the QS Table Lookup Value multiplied by the Measure Q-I Weighting Factor. 5.7. The Measure Improvement Score IS(i) for a given measur e shall equal the IS Table Lookup Value multiplied by a value equal to one minus the Measure Q-I Weighting Factor. 5.8. The Measure Composite Score QIS(i) fo r a given measure shall equal the sum of the Measure Improvement Score IS(i) and the Measure Quality Score QS(i). 5.9. The overall Quality Impr ovement Score, QIS, is the weighted average of all the individual Measure Composit e Scores, QIS(i), where th e Measure Weight for each Page 12 of 17 IFC contract Exhibit D3, ValueBased Purchasing Rev. 41420 measure is specified in Table 5 and 6. The resulting QIS (e.g. 0.14) is converted to a percentage (e.g. 14 percent). 5.9.1. In the Contractor's first year of operation under this Contract for Fully Integrated Managed Care, the Behavioral Health Measures shall be given a weight of zero. 5.10. For the Contractor to ear n back the QIS Portion of the Wi thhold in full, the overall Quality Improvement Score, QIS, for the Wi thhold Performance Year must equal at least 20 percent. 5.11. If for the Withhold Performance Year the Quality Improv ement Score for the Withhold Performance Year is equal to less than 20 percent, then the Quality Improvement Score will be recalculated as a percentage of 20 percent. The resulting QIS \"Partial Earn-Back Percentage \" will then be the percentage of the QIS Portion of the Withhold that the Contractor is eligible to earn back. 5.11.1. The results of the calculation ma de in subsections 5.9 and 5.11 of this Exhibit are rounded to the nearest hundred th value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dropped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decimal is fi ve or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, roun ding 0.667 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.67, or 67 percent.

DSHS' Re search and Data Analysis (RDA) will assess the Contractor's perform ance for the RDA measures listed in Table 7. 6.3.1. The Evaluating Entity (EQRO or RD A) will determine if th e following criteria are met for each measure. If either are met, the Co ntractor is allowed the proportion of the Withhold for that measure. 6.3.2.

RDA will determine if each of the RDA behavioral health statewide measures is equal to or above the HCA -determined benchmark for the year designated in Table 1. 6.3.2.1. For the RDA measures, the HCA-determined benchmark for the Withhold Performance Year is the score of the second-best performing AH-IMC MCO for the B enchmark Comparison Year as designated in Table 1. This establishes the 75th percentile standard for the RDA behavioral health statewide measures. 6.3.3. If the above achievement is not me t, the Evaluating Entity will compare the Contractor's performance year score wit h the Contractor's prior year score and determine whether statistically si gnificant improvement occurred by assessing whether an improvement occu rred over the previous score for each measure. 6.3.4. Note that for those specific meas ures where a lower score indicates better performance, the current performance score must be below the previous year performance to show statis tically significant improvement. 7.

The CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH), the federally funded research and development center operated by the MITRE Corporation, was asked to convene this large national ini tiative. To advance this goal, the Alternative Payment Models Framework and Progress Tracking Work Group (\"the Work Group\") was charged wi th creating an alternative pay ment model (APM) Framework (\"the APM Framework\") that could be us ed to track progress towards pa yment reform. Composed of diverse health care stakeholders, the Work Group has deliberated and re ached consensus on many critical issues related to the classifica tion of APMs, resulting in a ra tionale and a pathway for payment reform that is capable of supporting th e delivery of person centered c are. Although the Work Group was not charged with developing a worki ng definition of person centered care, it thought that it was imp ortant to do so because it view s payment reform as one means for accomplishing the larger goal of person centered care. The Work Group believes that person centered care rests on three pillars: quality, cost effectiveness, and p atient engagement. For the purposes of the White Paper, the term is nominally defined as follows: high quality care that is both evidence based and delivered in an efficient manner, and where patients' and careg ivers' individual preferences, needs, and values are paramount . In addition, it should be noted that the opinions expressed w ithin the White Paper are those of the Work Group Members and not of the organizations of which they are affiliated. The Work Group is committed to the notion that transitioning th e U.S. health care system away from fee for service (FFS) and towards shared risk and population based payment is necessary, though not sufficient in its own right, to a value based health care syste m. Financial incentives to increase the volume of services provided are inherent in FFS payments, and c ertain types of services are systematically undervalued. This is not conducive to the delive ry of person centered care because it does not reward high quality, co st effective care. By contrast, population based payments (including bundled payments for clinical episodes of care) offer providers the flexibility to strategically invest delivery system resources in areas with the greatest return, en able providers to treat patients holistically, and encourage care coordination. Because these an d other attributes are very well suited to support the delivery of high valued health care, the Work Group and the LAN as a whole believe that the health care system should transit ion towards shared risk and po pulation based payments. The Work Group hopes the Framework will be useful in this context to est ablish a common nomenclature upon which progress can be discussed and measured. The APM Framework rests on seven principles, which can be summa rized as follows: 1. Changing providers' financial incentives is not sufficient to achieve person centered care, so it will be essential to empower patients to be partners in health care tra nsformation. 2. The goal for payment reform is to shift U.S. health care spen ding significantly towards populat ion based (a nd more person focused) payments. 3. Value based incentives should ideally reach the providers tha t deliver care. 4. Payment models that do not tak e quality into account are not considered APMs in the APM Framework, and do not count as pr ogress toward pa yment reform. 5. Value based incentives should be intense enough to motivate providers to invest in and adopt new approaches to care d eliver y.For Public Release 2 6. APMs will be classified accordin g to the dominant form of pay ment when more than one type of payment is used. 7. Centers of excellence, accountable care organizations, and pa tient centered medical homes are examples, rather than Categories , in the APM Framework because they are delivery systems that can be applied to and supported by a variety of payment models. With these principles in place, the Work Group began with the p ayment model classification scheme originally put forward by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid S ervices (CMS), and subsequently reached a consensus on a variety of modifications and refinemen ts. The resulting Framework is subdivided into four Categories and eight subcategories, as ill ustrated below: For Public Release 3 Overview A LAN Guiding Committee was est ablished in May 2015 as the collaborative body charged with advancing the alignment of payment approaches across and within the public and private sectors. This alignment will accelerate the adoption and dissemination of meaningful financial incentives to reward providers that deliver higher quality and more affordable care. In alignment with the goals of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the LAN aims to have 30% of U.S. health care payments in APMs or population based payments by year 2016, and 50% by year 2018. The Guiding Committee convened the Alternative Payment Models Framework and Progres s Tracking (APM FPT) Work Group (the \"Work Group\") and charged it with creating a Framework for categorizing APMs and establishing a standardized and nationally accepted method to measure progress in the adoption of APM s across the U.S. health care system (the \"APM Framework\"). The Work Group brought together public and private stak eholders to assess APMs in use across the nation and to define t erms and concepts essential fo r understanding, categorizing, and measuring APMs. (A roster of Work Group members, representi ng the diverse constituencies convened by the LAN, is provided in Appendix A . Please note that opinions expressed within t he White Paper are those of the Work Group Members not of the organizations of which they are affiliated.) The aim of the W ork Group is to create a clear and understandable APM Fram ework, to provide a deeper understanding of payment model s and how those models can enhance health and health care, and to provide examples of how public and private payment models are organized within the APM Framework. The Work Group is aware that CMS is in the process of solicitin g recommendations on the implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorizat ion Act of 2015 (MACRA). The Work Group is hopeful that t his White Paper will help CMS consider some of the issues in volved in implementing MACRA, but stresses that providing formal recommendations on how to do so is explicitly not part of the Work Group's charge. Althou gh the Work Group is no longer so liciting comments on the White Paper, formal recommendation s for implementing MACRA and/or other CMS programs and po licies should continue to be made directly to CMS. Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network (LAN) To achieve the goal of better care, smarter spending, and healthier people, the U.S. health care system must substantially reform its payment structure to incenti vize quality, health outcomes, and value over volume. Such alignment requires a fundamental change in how health care is organized and delivered, and requires the participation of the entire health care ecosystem. To enable these reforms, the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network (LAN) was established as a collaborative network of public and private stakeholders, including health plans, providers, patients, employers, consumers, states, federal agencies, and other partners within the health care community. By making a commitment to changing payment models, by establishing a common framework and aligning approaches to payment innovation, and by sharing information about successful models and encouraging use of best practices, the LAN can help to reduce barriers and accelerate the adoption of alternative payment models (APMs). U.S. Health Care Payments in APMs For Public Release 4 The Case for Reforming the Health Care Payment System The LAN and the Work G roup are unanimous in their desire to dri ve payment approaches that improve the quality and safety of care a nd the overall performance and sustainability of the U.S. health system. The Work Group, along with many o ther stakeholders, envisions a health care system that provides person centered care. Recognizin g that the Work Group was not c harged with developing a comprehensive definition of the term or its constituent compone nts, and that these terms may encompass additional characteris tics that are not captured belo w, the Work Group understands person centered care to mean high quality care that is both evidence based and delivered in an efficient manner, and where patients' and caregivers' individual preferen ces, needs, and values are paramount . The Work Group believes that per son centered care, so defined, rests upon three pillars: x Quality : This term indicates that patie nts receive appropriate and tim ely care that not only is consistent with evidence based g uidelines and patient goals, bu t also results in optimal patient outcomes and patient experience. Ideally, quality should be eva luated using a harmonized set of appropriately adjusted process, ou tcome, patient r eported outco me, and patient experience measures that both provide an a ccurate and comprehensive assess ment of clinical and behavioral health, and that report results that can be meaningfully access ed, understood, and used by patients and consumers. x Cost Effectiveness : This term indicates a level of severity adjusted total costs (and, when relevant, unit prices) that reflect benchma rked best achievable results, and that are consistent with robust and competitive health insurance marketplaces as characterized by the deployment of multiple affordable, attractive products across employer group, individu al commercial, and government programs sectors. Care that is l ess expensive than expected, bu t that results in poor clinical outcomes, is not considered cost effective. Conversely, care th at is costly but that results in dramatic improvements in patient outcomes could be considered c ost effective. Affordable health care services are vital to ensur ing that the nat ion can support investments in education, housing, and other social determinants that can independently improve po pulation health. x Patient Engagement : This term encompasses the impo rtant aspects of care that impr ove patient experience, enhance shared decision making, and ensure that pat ients and consumers achieve their health goals. Patient enga gement should occur at all leve ls of care delivery, with patients and caregivers serving as partners when setting treatment plans and goals at the point of care; when designing and redesigning delivery and payment models; on gover nance boards and decision making bodies; and when identifyin g and establishing connection s to social support services. Engaged patients and consumers a re informed of their health sta tus and share in their own care; they are easily able t o access appointments and clinical opinio ns; they seek care at the appropriate site; they possess the information they need to identify high v alue providers and to tailor treatment plans to individual health goals; they provide ongoin g feedback that providers can use to improve patient experience; they are able to obtain transparent price information about services and their value for patients a nd consumers; and they can move s eamlessly among providers that are engaged in different aspects of their care. Routine communi cation with family caregivers and other support members is also a critical part of comprehensive, person centered care. As evidenced by the creation of the LAN, there is an emerging c onsensus among providers, payers, patients and consumers, purchase rs, and other stakeholders in t he health care system that efforts to deliver person centered care have been stymied, in large part, by a payment system that is oriented largely towards volume, as oppose d to value for patients and ca regivers. These stakeholders and the For Public Release 5 Work Group believe that by reconfiguring payments to incentiviz e value, and by ensuring that valuable activities (e.g., care coordinat ion) are compensated appropriat ely, providers will be able to invest in care delivery systems that are optimized for the provision of care t hat is more focused on patient needs. In other words, changes in paymen t are necessary (though insuffici ent on their own) to change provider behavior and drive delivery system transformations, thereby ens uring that health care costs reflect appropriate and necessary spending for individuals, government, employers, and other payers. The Work Group believes that shifting from traditional fee for service (FFS) payments to person focused payments (in which all or much of a person's overall care or ca re for related conditions is encompassed within a single payment) is a particularly promising approach t o creating and sustaining delivery systems that value quality, cost effectiv eness, and patient engagement. Such payments should thus include accountability for the quality o f care at the population level, rather than for the volume of particular services. Although it is not yet possible to reach a definitive , evidence based conclusion about the impact of population based paymen ts on patient care, there is a belief that these types of payment models are designed in a way tha t holds substantial promise. Th is is because person focused, population based payments give providers mo re flexibility to coordinate an d manage care for individuals and populations. In combination with substantially reduced incentiv es to increase volume, and increased incentives to provide services that are currently undervalued i n FFS, there is a consensus that this flexibility will expedite fruitful innovations in care delivery , particularly for individuals with chronic, complex, or costly illnesses. At present, FFS payments are ill suited for initiating investme nts and sustaining population health management innovations, such as i nformation technology, clinica l decision support tools, patient engagement and care coordination functions, and additional oppo rtunities to increase access to care (e.g., payments for telehealth, home visits, and additional off ice hours). This is beca use FFS incentivizes providers to optimize volume. As a result, FFS may at times dis courage the perspect ive that patients require individualized and highly coordinated care. Population based payments may enable providers to develop more innovative approach es to person centered health ca re delivery because they reward providers that successfully mana ge all or much of an individual 's care. Provided that safeguards are put in place to ensure that quality and patient engagement are not sacrificed to reduce c osts, and that the care delivered is state of the art and takes advantage of valua ble advances in science and technology, these innovative approaches to he alth care delivery stand to be nefit patients and society alike. Patients may come to expect a more coordi nated, more accessible, and mor e effective health care system, and the nation would benef it from reductions in national health car e expenditures, and a healthier, more productive workforce. The Work Group recognizes that new payment models require provi ders to make fundamental changes in the way they provide care, and that the transition away from FFS may be costly and administratively difficult. The Work Group also r ecognizes that participation in shared risk and population based payment models involves financia l risk for providers, that not all provider organizations possess the capacity to successfully operate in these payment models, and t hat providers will need assistance to develop additional capabilities. In order to smooth and acceler ate this transition, the Work Group believes that a critical mass of public and private payers must adopt aligned approaches and send a clear and consistent message that paye rs are committed to a populatio n based health system that delivers the best health care possible. If providers were able to partic ipate in APMs that were consistently deployed across multiple payer networks, this would reduce the administrative burden of making the transition and allow investments to be applied to all patient p opulations, independent of payer. Aligned payments from a critical mass of payers would enable providers to establish an infrastructure that would increase the likelihood of success for innovative delivery syst ems over the long term. The Work Group For Public Release 6 expects that the adopt ion and diffusion of these innovative del ivery systems should ultimately improve the quality, efficiency, safety, and experience of patient care , while becoming sustainable business models for providers that are ea ger to take a more comprehensiv e and coordinated approach to medical practice. The Work Group believes that a sh ift to person focused, populat ion based payments will, in concert with other reforms, result in an expansion of high value care in the United States. The Work Group recognizes the possibility that shifts in p ayment can result in unintended and unanticipated consequences, such as cost increases owing to provider consolidation, reduced provide r willingness to exchange data, and a potential reduction in costly but effective medical services. T he Work Group believes that it is therefore absolutely essential to monitor the impact of population based payment systems on patient outcomes, health care costs, and other indi cators of significance to pati ents and other stakeholders in the health care system. The Work Group envisions the shift to person focus ed, population based payment as a course correcting feedback loop between innovation, implementat ion, and evaluation; it also anticipates that its forthcoming effort to measure progress will help accel erate this process. The Work Group is hopeful this, the first in a ser ies of LAN publications, will h elp align stakeholders in the public and private sectors and support the implementa tion of payment systems that promote person centered care. Purpose of the White Paper In order to accelerate the trans formations described above, the Guiding Committee charged the Work Group with creating an APM Framework through which progress tow ards payment reform can be described and measured. In addition to providing a roadmap to m easure progress, the APM Framework helps establish a common nomencla ture and a shared set of conve ntions that can facilitate discussions among stakeholders and expedite the generation of evidence base d knowledge about the capabilities and results of APMs. The White Paper begins by describing the approach that the Work Group used to develop the APM Framework, and then describes the principles upon which the APM Framework is based. With these principles in mind, the White Pap er differentiates the Categori es within the APM Framework by explaining how the Categories are defined and where their bound aries lie. The White Paper concludes with a summary of the Work Group's key findings and recommendat ions, as well as recommendations for how various stakeh olders can use the Framework to accelerat e payment reform. To further clarify the classification of individual APMs, the Work Group has separ ately released a collection of APMs that are currently in use. Approach When developing the APM Framewor k, the Work Group began with th e payment model classification scheme that CMS recently advanced,1 and expanded it by introducing refinements that are described in more detail below. As illustrated in Figure 2, the CMS Framewor k assigns payments from plans to health care providers to four Categories, such that movement from Cate gory 1 to Category 4 involves increasing provider accountabilit y for both quality and total c ost of care, with a greater focus on population health management (as opposed to payment for specifi c services). 1 Rajkumar R, Conway PH, Tavenner M. CMS: Engaging multiple p ayers in payment reform. JAMA. 2014 May 21: 311(19):1967 8. For Public Release 7 The Work Group added to and refine d the CMS model by: 1) articu lating key principles to explain what the APM Framework does and does n ot mean to convey; 2) introduc ing four new Categories to account for payment models that are not considered progress towards pay ment reform; 3) introducing eight subcategories to account for nua nced but important distinctions between APMs within a single Category; 4) delineating explicit decision rules that can be us ed to place a specific APM within a specific subcategory; and 5) compiling, wi th the help of the LAN, exampl es of APMs that illustrate key characteristics of each of the subcategories. Key Principles for the APM Framework The Work Group's Framework is pre dicated on several key princip les. To provide context for understanding the APM Framework and the Work Group's recommenda tions, these principles are delineated and explained below. Principle 1 : Changing the financial reward t o providers is only one way to stimulate and sustain innovative approaches to the delivery of person centere d care. In the future, it will be important to monitor progress in initiatives that empow er patients to have a voice in model design, to seek car e from high value providers ( via performance metrics, financial incentives, and other means), and to become active pa rticipants in shared decision making. For Public Release 8 Although it was necessary to focus on financial incentives for providers as a critical first step, the Work Group recognizes that additional efforts to engage patients and consumers will be needed to achieve a high value, coordinated health care system. As more providers b egin to participate in payment models that are divorced from traditional FFS, the Work Group expects all stakeholders to collaborate on approaches to empower patients t o become active partners as the y strive to achieve their health goals. Such approaches may include strategies to clearly and meaningfu lly communicate, to patients and consumers, information about prov ider and health plan performan ce on clinical and pa tient experience measures; financial rewards for patients and consumers to selec t high value providers and to successfully manage chronic diseas es; and efforts to enlist pat ients and caregivers as partners in the setting of health goals and the development of treatment plans. In order to avoid unintended consequences associated with APM s, the Work Group also believes it is essential for payment models to include safeguards to prevent selection against individuals wit h more complex illnesses or a greater need for social support, and that patients and consumers will b e informed of providers' financial incentives in APMs. Additional a ctivities and monitoring will a lso be needed to ensure that the expansion of population based pa yments does not lead to dispari ties in health outcomes or to a decline in access to care. Principle 2 : As delivery systems evolve, th e goal is to drive a shift towa rds shared risk and population based payment models that incentivize improvemen ts in the quality and efficiency of person centered care. The overarching objective of the LAN is to encourage alignment between and within the public and private sectors as the health ca re system moves away from tradi tional FFS payment. Consistent with this objective, the Work Group recomme nds that over time, the U.S. h ealth care system should move concertedly towards APMs in Cate gories 3 and 4. Nevertheless, t he Work Group strongly believes that providers should clearly understand the requirements for financ ial and clinical parti cipation in APMs, as well as that participation in APM s should be voluntary and that providers should not take on risk that they are not prepared to accept. The Work Group also recognizes that market forces have led to different levels of delivery syst em organization and integratio n, and investment in infrastructure and management will be required to build the capabilities that will ensure greater success of more robust population health payments. There fore, APMs in Categories 3 and 4 will not be readily achievable in every market, for every clinical domain (e.g., dental care), or for every patient population. Furthermore, the Work Group anticip ates that some regional markets may be sl ower to make the transition to these Categories. In particular, the W ork Group expects participation in Category 3 and 4 APMs to be more limited for rural providers and fo r certain small or solo pract ices. Additionally, th e transition may be more challenging for safety net p roviders, given the broad arra y of other services needed by their patient populations that are not integrated into health care, u nless such services can be better integrated into payment reform. A more detailed depiction of the Work Group's goals for the hea lth care system appears in Figure 3. For Public Release 9 * Note: The values presented in the above \"current state\" graph ic are based on available data on private plan s from Cat alyst for Payment Reform and Medicare FFS allocations. This graphic is meant to represent the Work Group's belief of how the health care system should change, and it takes into account the likely impact of Medicare's Merit Based Incentive Payment System. The Work Group cautions that values displayed in the graphic are not precise, nor are they intended to lay out specific targ ets for health care reform. In Figure 3, the size of the various circles represents spending across various types of payment models. As Figure 3 illustrates, payments are expected to shift over ti me from Categories 1 and 2 into Categories 3 and 4. Additionally, the Work Group expects that, over time, APMs within a particular category will increase the extent to which payments are linked to provider ac countability, enable m ore innovation in care, make a greater impact on quality and cost performance, in crease coordination in delivery systems, and result in more value based care. Principle 3: To the greatest extent possible, value based incentives shoul d reach providers across the care team that directly delivers care. Based on the experience of membe rs of the Work Group, payment r eforms for quality improvement and cost reduction are most effective when they directly impact pay ments for providers th at are principally responsible for providing care to patients. These incentives ar e effective because providers delivering patient care are best positioned to develop mechanisms that dri ve person centered, well-coordinated, and high value care that ultimately lead to better outcomes. Fo r example, an accountable care organization (ACO) that is at ri sk for cost and quality would i deally design financial incentives for individual physicians and hospit als in a way that aligns with t he ACO's incentives as an organization. The Work Group recognizes that it ma y not always be possible to mea sure accurately the degree to which incentive payments reach individual practitioners. Nevertheless , the Work Group considers this a best practice and affirms that all del ivery systems pa rticipating in Category 3 and 4 APMs should commit to For Public Release 10 this principle. The Work Group believes that making population based payments to provider organizations that, in turn, pay individual providers on an FFS basis will not harness the full potential of the incentives in the APM. Principle 4 : Payment models that do not take quality and value into accoun t will be classified within the appropriate category with a designation t hat distinguishes them as a payment model that is not value based. They will not be consi dered APMs for the purposes of tracking progress towards payment reform. As illustrated in Figure 4, the A PM Framework represents a cont inuum of payment approaches across four Categories. Category 1 repr esents FFS payment not linked t o quality incentives. Categories 2 through 4 are organized according to the degree to which they a dvance beyond traditional FFS payment. The Work Group believes strongly that there is limited merit in moving toward population based payments if the resulting payment models do not include incenti ves to deliver quality health care based on current clinical knowledge. A lthough the Work Group was not charged with making specific recommendations about what constitutes meaningful quality measu rement, it belie ves that APMs should use harmonized measure sets that include process, clinic al outcome, patient reported outcome, and patient experience of care measures. Quality measures shoul d be appropriately adjusted for patient mix, and whenever possible the m easures used should be endorsed by professional organizations, the National Quality Forum, the Cor e Quality Measures Collaborative , and others involved in developing consensus. Measure sets should a lso be robust enough to provide a comprehensive portrait of a population's clinical and behavior al health. Payment models tha t represent some movement away from traditional FFS, but t hat do not take quality (and therefore va lue) into account, will be placed under the appropriate payment category and marked with an \"N\" to indicate \"No Quality\" considerations (e.g., population based payments not lin ked to value will fall into Ca tegory 4N). Accordingly, such models will not be considered to represent p rogress toward true payment ref orm, and the Work Group will not track them as part of measuring the achievement of the LAN's go als. Principle 5 : In order to reach the LAN's goals for health care reform, val ue based incentives should be intense eno ugh for providers to invest in and implement delivery reforms, and they should increase over time. However, the stren gth of incentives does not affect the classification of APMs in the APM Framework. The Work Group believes that APMs can be effective stimuli for delivery system change if providers are given meaningful incentives to develop and sustain innovative a pproaches to care delivery, and it acknowledges that shifting to per son focused, population based payment systems will require substantial investments on the p art of providers. Accordingly, it is critical that valu e based incentives be large enough to motivate provide rs to invest in and adopt new a pproaches to care delivery, and\u2014over time\u2014to outweigh profits that co uld be generated by increasing FFS billing. For example, the Work Group believes that a two sided i ncentive of plus or minus 10% is likely to promote c hange to a greater extent than a plus or minus 2% i ncentive. To accelerate and sus tain progress throughout the entire health care system, the Work Group also believes that the size of this incentive should grow over time, as providers obtain greater experience in advancing quality whi le managing costs. A similar principle For Public Release 11 applies to the setting of cost and quality benchmarks, in the s ense that higher expectations for quality improvements and cost reduction s are more effective at stimulat ing innovative approaches to care delivery. At this time the Work Group classifies APMs without considering the intensity of the associated incentive payments because it believes that doing so would unne cessarily complicate the APM Framework. Using the example abov e, an episode based payment wi th a 10% financial risk/reward is classified the same as an episode based payment with a 2% finan cial risk/reward. The Work Group believes that more experience and analysis will be needed to de termine what the \"right\" risk/reward level is to promote progress, wh ile also recognizing that it ma y be different for hospitals and health systems than for physician organ izations and health professiona ls. Nevertheless, the Work Group believes that a minimal threshold of risk and reward should be 5%, but likely greater. Principle 6 : For tracking purposes, when health plans adopt hybrid payment models that incorporate multiple APMs, the payment dollars will count towar ds the category of the most dominant APM. This will avoid double counting payments thr ough APMs. The Work Group recognizes that a particular payment model may u tilize several APMs concurrently, especially as the model is evolv ing. For example, an ACO may ut ilize a shared savings model in years one and two along with nominal pay for performance incentives, and then transition to a shared risk model in year three. For the purpose of tracking progress in such hyb rid cases, the entire payment model will be placed in the category that best captures the \"dominant\" APM (in this case, shared savings for years one and two, and shared risk in y ear three). It is also possibl e that bundled payments may be used within gainsharing, shared risk, and population health models, and that a patient centered medical home may be supported by FFS ba sed care coordination fees, pay for performance, and shared savings. In these and other scenarios, payment dollars will count toward s the most domin ant APM in use, meaning the APM to which the gre atest amount of incentive payme nts are directed. Principle 7 : Centers of excellence, patient centered medical homes, and ac countable care organizations are delivery models, not payment models. In many instances, these delivery models have an infrastructure to support care coordina tion and have succeeded in advancing quality. They e nable APMs and need the support of APMs, but none of them are synonymous with a specific APM. Accordingly, they appe ar in multiple categories of the APM Framework, depending on the underlying pa yment model that supports them. Consistent with the mission of t he LAN, the Work Group limited the scope of the APM Framework to payment models, as opposed to de livery models. Because centers of excellence (COEs), patient centered medical homes (PCMHs), and ACOs a re delivery models that can ac commodate a wide variety of payment arrangements, they will be listed according to their un derlying payment arrangement when they appear in the APM Framework. For example, a PCMH that part icipates in a shared savings/risk model will be classified in Categ ory 3, but a PCMH that receive s population based payments linked to value will be classified in Catego ry 4. The Work Group recogniz es that PCMHs and ACOs are commonly understood to be associated with r isk sharing payment models. N evertheless, the Work Group strongly For Public Release 12 recommends maintaining a clear distinction between concepts tha t describe payment models and those that describe delivery models. At the same time, the Work Group believes these delivery models have been developed with the goal of driving care coordination and d elivery improvements, and will enable more advanced payment models whi le at the same time requiring m ore advanced payment models to succeed. In recognition of their dramatic potential to improve the delivery of high quality and efficient health care, the Work Group elec ted to represent ACOs, PCMHs, a nd COEs in multiple categories, where corresponding APMs exist today and, likely, in the future. The APM Framework The Work Group's APM Framework is depicted in Figure 4. The Fra mework represents payments from public and private payers to provider organizations (including payments between the payment and delivery arms of highly integrated health systems). It is desig ned to accommodate payments in multiple categories that are made by a si ngle payer, as well as single p rovider organizations that receive payments in different categories\u2014 potentially from the same paye r. Although payments will be classified in discrete categories, the Fram ework captures a continuum of c linical and financial risk for provider organizations. The following discussion identifies the organizi ng principles that serve as the foundation for each Category, explains how the Categories are differentiat ed, and highlights examples of APMs in each Category. Please note that the examples in Figure 4 are no t meant to be exhaustive, but are rather intended to give a sense of possible arrangements in each of th e subcategories. For Public Release 13 For Public Release 14 n Fee for Service with No Link to Quality & Value (Category 1): Payment models classified in Category 1 utilize traditional FFS payments (i.e., payments are made for units of service) that are adjusted to account for neither infr astructure investments, nor provider reporting of quality data, nor fo r provider performance on cost and quality metrics. Additionally, it is important to note that diagnosis related groups (DRGs) that are not linked to quality and value are classified in Category 1. This is because the Work Group has determined that DRGs are used to reimburse a group of services delivered within a hospitalization, and while DRGs drive efficiencies in inpatient care, hospitals typically bill DRGs in much the same way that physicians b ill services that are paid on a fee schedule. In both i nstances, the provider's incen tive may be to bill for additional services because they are paid more for more volume. Payments in Category 1 are distinguished from those in Category 2 in that the latter incentivizes infrastructure investments and/or involves some method of repor ting or assessing the quality of the care delivered. Unlike payments made in Category 1, payments made in Category 2 are influenced by whether a provider invests in in frastructure, reports quality data, or achieves quality targets. o Fee for Service Linked to Qu ality & Value (Category 2): Payment models classified in Category 2 utilize traditional FFS payments (i.e., payments that are made for units of service), but these payments are subsequently adju sted based on infrastructure investments to improve care or clinical servi ces, whether providers report quality data, or how w ell they perform on cost and quality metrics. The Work Group has split Category 2 into subcategories A, B, C, and D as outlined below: x Payments placed into Category 2A involve payments for infrastr ucture investments that can improve the quality of patient car e, even though payment rates are not adjusted in accordance with performance on quality metrics. For example, payments desi gnated for staffing a care coordination nurse or upgrading to electronic health records wo uld fall under Category 2A. Because investments in these and similar delivery enhancements will lik ely improve patient experience and quality of care, the Work Group co nsiders these types of FFS or per member per month (PMPM) payments an important\u2014though pre liminary\u2014step toward payment reform. x Payments placed into Category 2B provide positive or negative ince ntives to report quality data to the health plan and\u2014preferably\u2014t o the public. Providers may have initial difficulties reporting clinical data accurately. Participation in a pay for reporting program therefore gives providers an opportunity to familiarize themse lves with performance metrics, build internal resources to collect data, and better navigate a heal th plan's reporting system. Bec ause pay for reporting does not link payment to quality performance, the Work Group maintains that participation in Category 2B payment models should be time limited and that participation in Category 2B payment models will often evolve into subsequent categories. x Payments are placed into Category 2C if they provide rewards for high performance on clinical quality measures. Much like pay fo r reporting programs, pay for performance programs that only reward high performance on quality metrics give providers an op portunity to acclimate themselves to the applicable reporting syste ms and measures before they ar e subject to penalties for low performance. In some instances, these programs have an extensiv e set of performance measures For Public Release 15 that assess clinical outcomes, suc h as a reduction in emergency room visits for individuals with chronic illnesses or a reduction in a hospital acquired infecti ons. x Payments placed into Category 2D reward providers that perform well on quality metrics and/or penalize providers that do not perform well, thus providing a s ignificant linkage between payment and quality. For example, providers may receive lower updates t o their FFS baseline or may receive a percent reduction on all claims paid if they do not meet qual ity goals. (Please note that payments in this subcategory are not subj ect to rewards or penalties for provider performance against aggregate cost targets, but may take into account performance on a more limited set of cost measures.) In addition to their capacity to stimulate and fo cus quality im provement initiatives, investments in quality performance assessment a re also valuable because they c an drive the development and expansion of health information technology (HIT). Although the Work Group was not tasked with developing specific recommendations on HIT and data sharing, it believes that providers should invest in interoperable systems; that administrative reporting requiremen ts should be minimized as much as possible; that patients and caregivers should have free and rea dy access to patient records; and that HIT should be used to maintain patient registries and contribute to the development of clinical measures and guidelines. As indicated in the discussion ab ove, the Work Group expects th at providers receiving Category 2A and 2B payments are investing in the HIT and other infrastructure n eeded to assess and improve quality performance, and that payments i n these categories will be an \"on ramp\" to participation in subsequent categories. In other words, the Work Group expects that under m ost circumstances, providers and provider groups will transition quickly into Categories 2C and 2D, though they may do so in different ways. In the private sector, few payment plans support pay for reporting arrangements, and providers often move directly into pay for performance models. By contras t, Medicare pay for reporting programs typically precede and serve as th e foundation for pay for perfo rmance programs in the same facility setting. Because data from the fo rmer determine payment adjustm ents in the latter, providers paid under that Medicare arrangement are typically eligible to recei ve both Category 2B and Category 2D payment adjustments. The Work Gr oup stresses that the payment m odels in Categories 2A through 2C will prepare providers to take on the additional accountability and financial risk associated with APMs in Categories 3 and 4. This concept of Categories 2A and 2B as an \"on ramp\" for subsequent categories will be assessed as the Work Group me asures and tracks progress towa rds adoption of APMs. Payments that fall under Category 2 are distinguished from thos e that fall under Category 3 in two respects. First, Category 2 paym ents do not involve arrangements in which providers assume either shared savings or shared losses based on established cost targe ts. Second, FFS based payments in Category 3 reflect, to a greater degree, care that is provided longitudinally, such that multiple providers are responsible for the cost and quality associated with a part icular set of procedures or services. By contrast, Category 2 payments ar e limited to specific providers . p APMs Built on Fee for Service Architecture (Category 3): Payment models classified in Cate gory 3 are based on an FFS arc hitecture, while providing mechanisms for the effective management of a set of procedures, an episode of care, or all health services provided for individuals. In addition to taking quality considerations i nto account (as in Category 2), Category 3 payments are based on cost perfo rmance against a target, irresp ective of how the financial benchmark is established, updated, or adjust ed. For APMs in Category 3, providers that meet their cost and quality targets are eligible for shared savings, and those that do not may be held financially accountable. For Public Release 16 Additionally, payments in Catego ry 3 are structured to encourag e providers to deliver effective and efficient care. Episode based and other types of bundled paymen ts encourage care coordination because they cover a complete set of related services for a pro cedure that may be delivered by multiple providers. Clinical episode paym ents fall into Category 3 if th ey are tied to specific procedures, such as hip replacement or back surgery. The Work Group has split Categor y 3 into subcategories A and B as outlined below: x Category 3A gives providers an opportunity to share in the savings they ge nerate. If a provider participating in a Category 3A APM meets quality targets but do es not meet cost targets, then the provider is not held financially responsible for excess spendin g. x Payments in Category 3B involve both upside gainsharing (i.e., positive payment adjust ments) and downside risk (i.e., negative payment adjustments) based on per formance on cost measures. Most ACO arrangements today can be placed into either Category 3A (most often) or Category 3B, depending on whether the underlying risk arrangement includes o nly upside gainsharing or both upside gainsharing and downside risk fo r providers. The Work Group bel ieves payments in Category 3 will advance clinical integration a nd affordability to a greater ext ent than payments in Category 2 because risk sharing arrangements provide stronger incentives to manage health care costs and reward care coordination across the span of care. The most important distinction b etween Category 3 and Category 4 payments is that the latter involve a single payment that encompasses a broad array of services, wher eas providers participating in Category 3 models are eligible for only a portion of the losses and/or s avings they generate. Additional conditions must be met before a payment mode l can be placed into Category 4. Specifically, Category 4 payments reflect the total cost of care for treating a primary (typicall y chronic) condition, or for maintaining the health and managing the illness of an entire population. By con trast, even if they are fully capitated, payments that cover a more limit ed set of specialty services (i ncluding primary care) would be classified in Category 3. For example, a Category 4 model for pediatric ca re would have to cover a wide range of medical, preventive, and develop mental services, whereas a popu lation based payment model for primary care would fall under Category 3 if it did not hold pri mary care providers accountable for care coordination and the appropriate utilization of specialty servi ces. Similarly, clinical episode payments tied to conditions (e.g., diabete s or cancer) fall under Catego ry 4, whereas clinical episode payments tied to procedures (e.g., hip replace ment or back surgery) fall unde r Category 3, even if they are made on a per member per month basis. As such, Category 4 payments are mo re person focused, insofar as they include stronger incentives to p romote health and wellness thro ughout the care continuum. q Population Based Payment (Category 4): Payment models classified as Category 4 involve population base d payments, structured in a manner that encourages providers to deliver well-coordinated, high qua lity person level care within a defined (4A) or overall (4B) budget. Thi s holds providers accountable f or meeting quality and, increasingly, person centered care goals for a population of patients or memb ers. Payments with in Category 4 are intended to cover a wide range o f preventive health, health mai ntenance, and health improvement services, and these payments w ill likely require care delivery systems to establis h teams of health professionals to provide enhanced access and coordinated care. Additionally, and in contrast to capitated arrangements in Catego ry 4N, providers participating in Category 4A and 4B APMs are held accountable for delivering high quality, clinically necessary, and appropriate care. For Public Release 17 The Work Group has split Category 4 into subcategories A and B as outlined below: x Category 4A payments are limited to certain sets of condition specific ser vices (e.g., asthma, diabetes, or cancer), but they r emain person focused in the sen se that they hold providers accountable for the total cost a nd quality of care related to t hat condition. For example, bundled payments for cancer care fall un der Category 4A if providers ar e responsible for the total cost and quality of care for a patient, rat her than covering only chemot herapy payments. The Work Group recognizes that in certain insta nces patient care will predomin antly revolve around the management of particular types o f conditions, such as cancer or heart disease. In such cases, we recognize that Category 4A may become a suitable and justifiabl e endpoint, especially for smaller provider organizations which may never be able to deliver certa in types of care (such as transplants). Nevertheless, the W ork Group maintains that provi ders should ideally be paid to maintain health and manage illnes s for an entire population, ra ther than compartmentalizing payments according to particular conditions. We also believe that condition specific payments should, in time, become part of a comprehensive approach to imp roving health and reducing costs for an entire population. For highly integrated delivery system s, the Work Group envisions that Category 4A payments will evolve into Category 4B. x Payments in Category 4B are capitated or population based for all of the individual's health care needs. Category 4B encompasses a broad range of financing and d elivery system arrangements with varying degrees of integration between plans and provider groups. On one end of the spectrum, plans and providers in Category 4B models may be virt ually integrated. On the other end of the spectrum are highly integrated arrangements that are cha racterized by vertical integration of financing and care delivery, common ownership, and strong linka ge across strategy, clinical performance, quality, and resour ce use. These groups may also h ave a higher percentage of salaried physicians. After reviewing the literature and discuss ing these highly integrated arrangements with people who ope rate within them, the Work Grou p has reached the conclusion that they can be ideally suited for delivering person centered care because they: 1) force transformational thinking about delivery system reform; 2) opti mize coordination of infrastructure investments; 3) most fully remove financial incentives for volu me; and 4) expedite community investment and engagement. Although the underlying payment appr oaches were not sufficiently distinct to warrant the creation of a separate subcategory for highly integrated payment and delivery systems, the Work Group believes that these arrangements yield key benefits and efficiencies, because they have a greater impact on organizational responses to quality and value incentives. Category 4 represents the furthest departure from traditional F FS payments, while simultaneously ensuring that providers possess the strongest possible incentiv es to deliver high quality and efficient care. Nevertheless, the Work Group recognizes that not every market currently is suited to support APMs in Category 4, and that the journey to Category 4 will occ ur along different trajectories in different markets, based in significant part on the organization of care delivery systems. For Public Release 18 Conclusion As set forth in this document, the Work Group is committed to the concept that transitioning from FFS to population based payments is critical for health care transformation. Keeping in mind the underlying principles, the APM Framework provides a high level mapping of payment approaches, as well as a pathway for payment reform and a foundation for measuring progress. The Work Group envisions that these mappings will be useful for all stakeholders and prove enduring as they navigate the health care ecosystem. While the Work Group believes that this Framework identifies and encompasses all models of payment reform and will be enduring, Work Group members hop e to return to the White Paper at a later date to take into account new developments in the health care sector. Nevertheless, the Work Group intends the APM Framework to be robust enough to accommodate foreseeable changes, and it strongly believes that this should become the o verarching framework for discussing and evaluating payments in the U.S. health care system. The LAN intends to continue compiling and periodically releasing case studies of payment models. (See APM Framework White Paper Addendum.) The Work Group believes this is important because it will disseminate lessons learned and provide the nation with models to co nsider as public and private plans align around common payment approaches. Stakeholders and the APM Framework Patient Advocacy Groups can use the APM Framework to understand the context behind plan and benefit design so that they can identify and communicate desirable elements and become empowered to participate in decisions about how to design payment plans and delivery systems. Providers can use the APM Framework to make sense of the types of payment reforms underway, to achieve a better understanding of where they are situated, to begin to conce ive of where they might like to end up, and\u2014most importantly\u2014to plan for the future. Plans can use the APM Framework to drive payment and contracting models and as an accounting tool to track spending and the distribution of members/beneficiaries and providers. This is crucia lly important, because adopting a common classification scheme would represent a first step towards the alignment of payment approaches. Purchasers can use the APM Framework to engage and educate their employees about the health insurance landscape and to share information for population based plans, along with the safeguards and benefits that would tip them towards enrolling in such plans.

Exhibit E2, Challenge Pool ValueBased Purchasing Incentives Rev. 10/2/19 Exhibit E-2 Challenge Pool Value-Based Purchasing Incentives 1. Value-Based Purchasing Incentives 1.1. As outlined in HCA 's Value-Based Roadmap and Apple Health Appendix, which can be found on HCA 's website and is incorporated by reference, funding will be available under the terms of this Exhibit to encourage the transition among MCOs to Alternative Payment Models (APMs). This Exhibit describes the funds that are available and the conditions under which these funds may be earned, including reporting requirements and the performance measures that will be used. 1.2. All incentive arrangements are necessary for the specified activities, targets, performance measures, or quality-based outcomes that support program initiatives as specified in the state's quality strategy. 1.3. The Challenge Pool described in this Exhibit, and from which all funds earned under this Exhibit will be drawn, is a pool of funding that will be distributed annually based on reporting and performance metrics that are defined under HCA's Apple Health Contracts, including Apple Health Managed Care, Apple Health Integrated Managed Care, and Apple Health Foster Care contracts. Where more than one of these contracts is effective between HCA and the Contractor, the amount earned under this Exhibit will not be calculated separately for each contract, but will be calculated as a single payment to the Contractor based on data aggregated from each of the Contractor's Apple Health Contract(s). Each Apple Health Contract includes the same Challenge Pool Exhibit, describing the same pool of funding and set of conditions under which these funds may be earned. 1.4. The funding that the Contractor is eligible to receive under this Exhibit draws from annual Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment System (DSRIP) funds via the Healthier Washington Medicaid Transformation (Medicaid Transformation) may be earned under Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Exhibit. The Total Available Funds per year is set out in Table 1 of this Exhibit. The amounts in Table 1 are subject to amendment by HCA without prior notice to the Contractor and subject to the availability of state and federal funding. 1.5. The Base Earnable Funds (BEF) is the amount that the Contractor can earn under Sections 2 and 3 of this Exhibit. The BEF will be a share of the annual DSRIP Funds based on the Contractor 's share of the total attributed member months under signed Apple Health Contracts for the year. The Contractor 's BEF shall be calculated as the Contractor 's attributed state-wide managed care member months for the Performance Year divided by the state wide managed care member months for the Performance Year, multiplied by total state-wide DSRIP Funds available for that Performance Year. The Contractor 's Base Earnable Funds for the Performance Year may be earned on two bases, referred to as Pay for Reporting (P4R) and Pay for Performance (P4P). 1.6. In the event that the Contractor or any other HCA-contracted Apple Health MCO does not earn the full BEF that have been allocated to it for a Performance Year under the P4R and P4P terms set out in the Apple Health Contracts, the unearned Challenge Pool Remaining Funds will be distributed to the MCOs using a formula that accounts for the MCO's achievement related to high level APMs (HCP LAN IFC Page 2 of 9 Exhibit E2, Challenge Pool ValueBased Purchasing Incentives Rev. 10/2/19 Categories 3A-4B) as well as the MCO's Quality Improvement Score (QIS) as calculated under the Contractor's Apple Health Contract(s). The conditions under which the Contractor may earn these Challenge Pool Remaining Funds are set out in Section 4 of this Exhibit. 1.7. For purposes of this Exhibit, reporting and measurement relating to the adoption of APMs will be based on the APM categorization set out in the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network (HCP-LAN) Alternative Payment Model (APM) Framework Final Whitepaper version dated January 12, 2016, attached as Attachment A (Whitepaper) of the VBP Exhibit. The performance measures will assess the percentage of Contractor payments to providers that fits into each APM category under the Whitepaper. 1.8. The Challenge Pool will operate over the five-year period as set out in Table 1.Table 1 shows the relevant time periods, and the division of funding in each year between P4R and P4P. Table 1 Performance Years, Time Periods and Thresholds Time Periods Funding Year Performance Year Improvement Baseline Year Total Available (millions) Base Earnable Funds (BEF) P4R Portion 1.9. The conditions for earning full or partial payment of the funds identified in Table 1 are set out below. 1.10. During the Performance Year, the Contractor may, at its discretion, seek feedback from HCA on whether provider payment arrangements qualify as APMs that will result in earned Challenge Pool funds. 2. Pay for Reporting (P4R) 2.1. The Pay for Reporting (P4R) portion of the Base Earnable Funds will be available to the Contractor for the complete and timely reporting of data required to assess the Contractor 's progress toward meeting performance targets. The amount of the P4R portion of Base Earnable Funds will be determined by HCA as set out in Table 1. 2.2. The required data to be submitted under this Section is set out in the VBP Exhibit to the Contractor's Apple Health Contract(s) with HCA. All terms for the submission of data in the VBP Exhibit ident ified in this subsection are applicable IFC Page 3 of 9 Exhibit E2, Challenge Pool ValueBased Purchasing Incentives Rev. 10/2/19 here and must be met for HCA to deem that the Contractor has met the terms of this Section. 2.3. If all requirements are met under this Section, then the full amount of the P4R portion will be due to the Contractor. If all requirements under this Section are not met, then no funds will be paid to the Contractor under this Section. 3. Pay for Performance (P4P) 3.1. The Pay for Performance (P4P) portion of Base Earnable Funds will be available to the Contractor based on its performance in adopting Alternative Payment Models as set out in this Section. The amount of the P4P portion of Base Earnable Funds will be determined by HCA as set out in Table 1. 3.2. The amount of the P4P Portion of the Base Earnable Funds that the Contractor earns will be determined by a model that incorporates attainment of thresholds and targets, and improvement over the Contractor's APM adoption levels in the Baseline Year. Each of these elements is set out in Table 2. Table 2 P4P Weights, Targets and Thresholds Year Performance Targets & Thresholds Calculation Weight HCP years the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score applies under Section 4 of this Exhibit. In PY4 and PY5 the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score is onally applicable under subsection 3.3.5 of this Exhibit. **This percentage is subject to approval by the C enters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 3.3. By meeting each of the Performance Targets and Thresholds set out in Table 2, the Contractor can earn all or part of the P4P portion of the Total Earnable Funds available to the Contractor. HCA will determine the amount of Base Earnable Funds that the Contractor can earn as follows. 3.3.1. The Contractor's Achievement Percentages for the Performance Year will be established using the data submitted by the Contractor and validated as set out in the Contractor's Apple Health Contract(s), the definition of \"Assessed Payments,\" and other terms included in Contractor's Apple Health Contract(s). VBP adoption Achievement Percentages are measured as the share of MCO Assessed Payments to providers via one or more specified APMs out of total MCO Assessed Payments to providers. For purposes of these measures, MCO Assessed Payments by category of APM and total MCO Assessed IFC Page 4 of 9 Exhibit E2, Challenge Pool ValueBased Purchasing Incentives Rev. 10/2/19 Payments to providers will be aggregated across Contracts identified in this subsection. Failure to provide data by the deadlines set out in any of the Contracts referenced in this subsection may result in loss of eligibility to earn any funds under this Exhibit. 3.3.2. Achievement Score : In each Performance Year HCA will calculate an Achievement Score for the Contractor. The Contractor will have reached or exceeded the HCP LAN 2C-4B Target for the Performance Year (AS Item 1) if the Contractor's Achievement Percentage for HCP LAN categories 2C-4B is equal to or greater than the HCP LAN 2C-4B Target for the Performance Year. The Contractor will have reached or exceeded the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score for the Performance year (AS Item 2) if the Contractor's Achievement Percentage for HCP LAN categories 3A-4B is equal to or greater than the HCP LAN 3A-4B Target for the Performance Year. The Contractor will have reached or exceeded the MACRA A-APMs Target for the Performance Year (AS Item 3) if the Contractor's Achi evement Percentage for MACRA A-APMs is equal to or greater than the MACRA A-APMs Target for the Performance Year. 3.3.2.1. For PY2: If the Contractor has reached or exceeded the HCP LAN 2C-4B Target for the Performance Year (AS Item 1), then the Achievement Score will be 100 percent. If not, the Achievement Score shall be zero percent. 3.3.2.2. For PY3, PY4 and PY5: The Achievement Score will consist of three additive parts. If the Contractor has reached or exceeded AS Item 1 under subsection 3.3.2 for the Performance Year, the Contractor earns 50 percent toward the Achievement Score. If the Contractor has reached or exceeded AS Item 2 under subsection 3.3.2 for the Performance Year, the Contractor earns 40 percent toward the Achievement Score. If the Contractor has reached or exceeded AS Item 3 for the Performance Year, the Contractor earns 10 percent toward the Achievement Score. For instance, if the Contractor has reached or exceeded AS Item 1 and AS Item 3, but not AS Item 2, then the Achievement Score shall be 60 percent for the Performance Year (50 percent + 10 percent). If the Contractor has not reached or exceeded any of the three AS Items for the Performance Year, then the Achievement Score shall be zero percent. 3.3.3. Achievement Subset Score: In PY2, PY3, PY4, and PY5 HCA will whether the Contractor has met an annual Subset Attainment Target. In PY2, the Subset Attainment Target requires that the Contractor have at least one VBP contract in HCP-LAN category 3B or above. In PY3, the Subset Attainment Target additionally requires that the Contractor achieve certification from CMS for at least one VBP arrangement as an Other Payer Advanced Alternative Payment Model under the MACRA Quality Payment Program. In PY4 and PY5 at lease one VBP contract in category 3B or above and including at least one of the following features: 1) More than nominal risk for shared losses, 2) Payments tied to provider improvement or attainment on statewide common measure set using IFC Page 5 of 9 Exhibit E2, Challenge Pool ValueBased Purchasing Incentives Rev. 10/2/19 HCA quality Improvement model or sim ilar tool, 3) care transformation requirements including state-level best practices, or 4) use of certified EHR technology in support of VBP methods. A single contract may satisfy more than one requirement in this subsection. If the Contractor has met the Subset Attainment Target for the Performance Year, then the Achievement Subset Score will be 100 percent, and if the Contractor has not met the Subset Attainment Target for the Performance Year, then the Achievement Subset Score will be zero percent. 3.3.4. Improvement Score : In each Performance Year HCA will calculate an Improvement Score for the Contractor. If the Contractor has met the HCP LAN 2C-4B Performance Target for the Performance Year, then the Improvement Score shall be 100 percent. If the Contractor has not met the HCP LAN 2C-4B Performance Target for the Performance Year, then the Improvement Score shall be calculated as the percent change from the Improvement Baseline Year achievement percentage for HCP LAN 2C-4B to the Performance Year achievement percentage for HCP LAN 2C-4B such that Improvement Score = (Performance Year Achievement Percentage - Improvement Baseline Year Achievement Percentage) / Improvement Baseline Year Achievement Percentage). Where the prior calculation produces a negative percentage, the Improvement Score shall be zero percent. The Improvement Score is capped at 100 percent. 3.3.5. HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score: An achievement threshold applies in years four and five for HCP LAN 3A - 4B such that no funds under the P4P portion of Base Earnable Funds may be earned by the Contractor unless the threshold is met. 3.3.6. In each year, the Contractor's total P4P Score will be calculated as follows. First, the Achievement Score, Achievement Subset Score, and Improvement Score will each be multipli ed by their respective weights as set out in Table 2. The resulting products will be summed to produce the provisional P4P score. In PY2 and PY3 the provisional P4P score will be the final P4P score for the Contractor. In PY4 and PY5 the provisional P4P score will be the final P4P score for the Contractor if the Contractor has met the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score, but if the Contractor has not met the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score then the final P4P score will be zero percent. In all years the final P4P score will range from zero percent to 100 percent. 3.3.7. The Contractor's final P4P Score will represent the percent of the P4P Portion of the Contractor's Base Earnable Funds that the Contractor is eligible to receive. 4. Remaining Challenge Pool Funds Share 4.1. If funds remain in the Challenge Pool for a given Performance Year as described in subsection 1.6 of this Exhibit, the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds will be distributed as set out in this Section. 4.2. Each MCO with Apple Health Contract(s), will be eligible to earn a Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share that is determined by two factors as follows. 4.2.1. HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score: First HCA will determine if the MCO IFC Page 6 of 9 Exhibit E2, Challenge Pool ValueBased Purchasing Incentives Rev. 10/2/19 has met the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score for the Performance Year set out in Table 2. To make this determination, HCA will use the data and methodology outlined in subsection 3.3.1 of this Exhibit to establish the HCP LAN 3A-4B achievement percentage for the MCO. If the MCO's annual HCP LAN 3A-4B achievement percentage is less than the annual HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score then the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share for the MCO will be zero percent of the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds. If the MCO's annual HCP LAN 3A-4B achievement percentage is equal to or greater than the annual HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score then the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share shall be calculated under subsection 4.2.2 below. 4.2.2. Relative QIS Adjusted for Relative Membership: Second, if the MCO has met the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score for the Performance Year then the MCO will receive a percentage of the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds that is determined by the relative magnitude of each MCO's all-contract QIS score established under the Contractor's Apple Health Contract(s), adjusted for attributed member months per MCO. 4.2.2.1. To calculate the Contractor's all-contract QIS score, HCA will calculate an average of the Contractor's QIS score calculated under the Contractor's Apple Health Contract(s), weighted by the share of Apple Health Managed Care Member Months attributable to each contract for the Performance Year. The same methodology will be used to calculate an all-contract QIS score for each of HCA's contracted Apple Health MCOs. 4.2.2.2. The all-contract QIS scores of all MCOs that meet the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score will be summed to find the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Denominator. For each MCO that meets the HCP LAN 3A-4B Threshold Score, the preliminary Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share for the MCO shall then be calculated as the all-contract QIS for the MCO divided by the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Denominator times the total Challenge Pool Remaining Funds under subsection 1.6 of this Exhibit. Finally, the preliminary Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share for the MCO will be adjusted for attributed member months to produce the final Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share for the MCO. For this adjustment, HCA will multiply the preliminary Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share by a Member Months Index and readjust the resulting product for each qualifying MCO on a proportional basis so that the percentage share for all MCOs adds up to 100 percent of Challenge Pool Remaining Funds. 4.2.2.3. The Member Months Index referenced in subsection 4.2.2.2 will be calculated for each MCO by dividing attributed member months for the MCO over the Performance Year by the average MCO attributed member months over the Performance Year. IFC Page 7 of 9 Exhibit E2, Challenge Pool ValueBased Purchasing Incentives Rev. 10/2/19 5. Payment 5.1. The total amount that the Contractor is eligible to receive under this Exhibit will be the sum of the amounts earned under Sections 2 and 3 of this Exhibit for Reporting (P4R) and Performance (P4P), plus the Challenge Pool Remaining Funds Share for the Contractor under Section 4 of this Exhibit. 5.2. On or before October 30th following the end of each Performance Year, HCA will provide the Contractor with a completed Challenge Pool Calculation Summary Form provided in Attachment 1 to this Exhibit to notify the Contractor in writing of its Challenge Pool Value-Based Purchasing Incentives Earned based on the calculations described in this Exhibit. 5.3. The Contractor will have 20 calendar days from the date the Contractor is notified of its Challenge Pool Value-Based Purc hasing Incentives Earned to review and sign the Challenge Pool Calculation Summary Form provided in Attachment 1 to this Exhibit and return to HCA, in writing, of any alleged discrepancies with the calculations. 5.4. If the Contractor submits in writing any alleged discrepancies with the calculations, HCA will respond in writing to the Contractor within 10 calendar days following HCA's receipt. 5.5. HCA will schedule payment for the percentage of the Challenge Pool Value-Based Purchasing Incentives Earned no later than June 30th following the receipt of Challenge Pool Calculation Summary Form.

The Excel workbook is designed to collect all informati on needed for MLR reporting as required by CMS in 42 CFR \u00a7438.8. The f ederal rule regarding MLR requires that all Medicaid managed care contracts require the c ontracted managed care organizations to calculate and report a MLR. The MLR Reporting Template is to be comple ted and submitted to the Health Care Authority (HCA) via MC-Track by May 31st of the year following the MLR reporting year. If the state were to make a retroactive change to the capitation payments for a MLR reporting year where the MLR report has al ready been submitted to the state, the Contractor must re-calcula te the MLR for all MLR repor ting years affected by the change and submit new MLR r eports to the state for al l impacted reporting years. Throughout these instructio ns there will be references to the 2016 Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Final Rule and ot her regulations. All regulations are part of 42 CFR unless cited otherwise.

MLR Calculation This worksheet takes the prior amounts and summarizes them into subtotals and calculates the unadjusted ML R. There are also inputs for member months and credibility adjustments if applicable. The Cont ractor may add a credi bility adjustment to a calculated MLR if the MLR reporting year experience is partially credible but the Contractor may not add a credibility adjustment to a calculated MLR if the MLR reporting year experience is fully credible. If the Contractor's experience is non- credible, it is presumed to meet or exceed the MLR calculation standards. The MCO should enter the number of member months in the appropriate cell. The State has elected a minimum MLR of 85% Expense Allocation Certain expenses may not be attributable to one line of business. Describe methods used to allocate these expenses and how they factor into the MLR calculated for this report. A description can be in cluded in the workbook or a reference can be made to an attached document: See \u00a7 438.8(g) Each expense must be included under only one type of expense, unless a portion of the expense fits under the definition of, or criteria for, one type of expense and the remainder fits into a different type of expens e, in which case the expense must be pro- rated between types of expenses. Expenditure s that benefit multiple contracts or 8 populations, or contracts other than those being reported, mu st be reported on pro rata basis. Expense allocation must be based on a generally accepted accounting method that is expected to yield the most accurate resu lts and shared expenses, including expenses under the terms of a management contrac t, must be apportioned pro rata to the contract incurring the expense. Expenses t hat relate solely to the operation of a reporting entity, such as per sonnel costs associated with the adjusting and paying of claims, must be borne solely by the reporti ng entity and are not to be apportioned to the other entities. Remittance Calculation Remittance of amounts owed to the State will be calculated as described in Gain Share Program section of the IFC contract.

Medical Quality Assurance Requirements. To the extent the Managed Care Plan imposes any medical quality assurance requirements on its network IHCPs, any such requirements applicable to the IHCP shall be subject to Section 805 of the IHCIA (25 USC 1675). Exhibit K, CHIP/IHCP contract Page 5 of 6 Rev. 9-3-19 15. Claims Format.

Arcora is responsible for: Financing and developing, in partnership with the University of Washingt on (UW), a training module and exam for participating denta l providers; Providing the exam, in pa rtnership with UW; Notifying HCA, within 5 business days, of su ccessful course completion by participa ting dental providers; Developing tools and systems to assist m edical providers with oral asse ssments; Developing referral and patient care coordination tools; Developing systems and processes to facilitate shared care between medical and de ntal providers; Developing systems and processes to assist dental provider offices in scheduling an d keeping app ointments; Recruiting dental providers to participate in the program; Attending local and statewide dental provider association meetings; Educating providers about the pilot, including background, duration, enhanced fees, and indicators; Recruiting and educating of medical providers on demographics of Oral Health Connections Pilot Project target pop ulations; Training medical providers about oral syst emic link between oral health and diabetes and/or pregnancy, including how to address oral health in medical setting s while reinforcing t he importance of medical and dental collaborat ion; and Developing and implementing an Oral Health Connections Pilot Project ev aluation tool.Page 2 of 2 Attachment 4 Oral Health Connections Pilot Project IMC/IFC Contract - Rev. 10-22-19 Both medical and dental Oral Health Connections P ilot Project providers will use a referral tool developed by Arcora, called DentistLink, to connect Clients to dental providers in the following ways: Medical provider will refer Clients diagnosed with diabetes or pregnancy to a trained dental provider participa ting in the Oral Health Connections Pilot Project through DentistLink; Medical Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will refer Enrollees, with flagged qualifying diagnosis(es), through care coordination and DentistLink; Dental providers will coordinate with medical pr oviders through DentistLink to receive referrals for patients who are in the two identified target populations. Dental providers will be educated in the specifics of intervention and training for the identified Client population. The Oral Health Connections Pilot Project will also test the effects an enhanced dental benefit has on access to dental care, health care outcomes, and related medical costs. Trained, participating dental providers will be eligible for enhanced reimbursement rates for specific CDT codes per Oral Health Connections Pilot Project guidelines. Periodontal health, in specific, will be the target of the enhancements. Medicaid will pay enhanced fees for codes D0150 (Comprehensive Oral Exam), D0210 (Intraoral complete series of radiographic images), D0274 (Bitewings images), D 4341 (Periodontal Scaling and Root Planing-4 or more teeth), D4342 (Periodontal Scaling and Root Planing 3 or more teeth per quadrant), D4910 (Periodontal maintenance). The Client will be eligible to receive up to three (3) additional D4910 (periodontal maintenance) per twelve-month period. The Oral Health Connections Pilot Project success will be determined through measures evaluating access, cost, and health outcomes. Page 1 of 1 IMC/IFC Contract Attachment 5, ABCD Program Rev. 10/2/19 Attachment 5 Access to Baby and Child De ntistry (ABCD) Program The Access to Baby and Child Dentistry (ABCD) Pr ogram was established to increase access to dental services for Medicaid-eligible Clients through age 5. The Program's goal is to ensure positive dental experiences in early childhood wi ll lead to lifelong practices of good oral health. The ABCD Program is a partnership between public and private sectors, such as the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA), the Washington State Department of Health (DOH), the University of Washington School of Dentistry (UW), Arcora, Washington State Dental Association (WSDA), local dental societies, and local health jurisdictions. The design of the ABCD Program is to develop competency in dental practices to deliver dental services to children; and in primary medical care practices to provide oral health education, oral assessments and treatments, or refer for treatment. HCA has contracted with UW to provide technical and procedural consultation, develop training curriculum and materials, and train dental providers to become ABCD Dental Champions. UW also issues and tracks all certifications for dental providers, and dental champions. UW also provides the Interim Therapeutic Restoration (ITR) certification. The UW sends a list of ABCD- certified providers to HCA and HCA places an indicator on the provider's ProviderOne profile which allows HCA to identify these providers as eligible for the enhanced ABCD rates. HCA contracts with 26 Coordinators to perform community outreach, including identification and referral of eligible children to ABCD providers. These Coordinators are either a local health jurisdiction or a community agency. Each Coordinator has one or more Dental Champions. who works to recruit, and train, local general dentists to become ABCD-certified providers. HCA also contracts with Arcora to provide centralized management of the ABCD Program. Arcora also trains, and issues and tracks all certifications for, medical PCPs through in-office continuing education (1.5 hours) by Arcora. Arcora is also responsible for sending confirmation of certification to HCA to ensure an indicator is placed on the PCP's ProviderOne profile. The training educates providers on delivery of the following preventive services: Links between oral health and total health; Oral health screening and risk asse ssment; Providing oral health education and anticipatory guidance to clients and families; Application of topical fluo ride; Billing; and Referrals for dental care. ABCD services provided by a trained Medical PCP will be covered under the medical managed care or fee-for-service effective January 1, 2020.
