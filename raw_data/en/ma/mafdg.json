The board of health shall ensure that the storage and distribution of provincially funded vaccines, including to health care providers practicing within the Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 3 health unit, is in accordance with the Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol, 2018 (or as current). Operational Roles and Responsibilities Inventory Management Staff Designated to Monitor Vaccine Storage and Handling Practices 1) The board of health shall: a) Maintain the supply of publicly funded vaccine through proper vaccine storage and handling practices and proper inventory management; b) Use Panorama or any other method specified by the Ministry of Health and Long - Term Care (the \"ministry\") for vaccine inventory management on an ongoing basis; c) Designate at least one staff member who has the responsibility for vaccine inventory management processes including vaccine ordering, storage, distribution, and return in each location where publicly funded vaccine is stored. Responsibilities include: i) Ordering vaccines; ii) Overseeing proper receipt and storage of vaccine deliveries; iii) Documenting vaccine inventory information; iv) Organizing vaccines within storage units; v) Setting up and monitoring digital temperature monitoring devices; vi) Reading and recording maximum, minimum and current refrigerator temperatures twice daily; vii) Rotating stock routinely so vaccines with the earliest expiration dates are used first; viii) Removing expired vaccine from storage units; ix) Responding to out -of-range tem peratures (temperature excursions); x) Maintaining all documentation, such as inventory and temperature logs; xi) Training other staff; xii) Monitoring operation of storage equipment and systems; and xiii) Ensuring appropriate handling of vaccines during a disaster or power outage; d) Designate one person as the lead for the board of health who will be responsible for developing and implementing standard operating policies and procedures for the following inventory activities based on the current inventory method specified by the ministry and Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices, 3 these include: i) Ordering; ii) Maintenance of inventory; iii) Returns; and Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 4 iv) Managing vaccine recalls; e) Designate and train an alternate to cover these responsibilities if the lead is not available. The alternate shall be trained in routine and emergency policies and procedures related to vaccine storage and handling; f) Orient responsible staff to the program to ensure they are aware of requirements for vaccine storage and handling, product sensitivities, storage equipment, temperature monitoring devices, and inventory management procedures; and g) Use the Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines, 2012 (or as current) to educate and instruct health care providers who store publicly funded vaccine. 4 Inventory Counts 1) The board of health shall: a) Conduct a physical inventory count of all publicly funded vaccines at least four times a year, quarterly, comparing vaccine inventory to totals listed in Panorama or any other method specified by the ministry. Discrepancies shall be recorded in Panorama or any other m ethod specified by the ministry; b) Organize the vaccine by expiry date to ensure the shortest expiry date is at the front and the longest expiry date is at the back and group lot numbers together; c) Physically count the amount of each vaccine type and record the counts for all inventories in Panorama; d) Compare the physical counts to Panorama inventory amounts according to Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices; 3 e) Adjus t the Panorama Inventory, according to Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices,3 as required; and f) Remove all expired vaccine from the vaccine supply and adjust the Panorama Inventory to reflect the removal of expired vaccine according to the Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices. 3 Review of Vaccine Quantities Required for Immunization Programs 1) The board of health shall: a) Engage in planning and forecasting at a minimum, once every 12 months to maintain an adequate inventory of vaccine to meet the routine needs of health care providers administering publicly funded vaccines and immunization clinics administered by the board of health in each upcoming year for all vaccine by: i) Calcula ting the net usage, at a minimum, from the previous year, for each vaccine. Net usage = vaccines received from OGPMSS (Ontario Government Pharmaceutical and Medical Supply Service) - reusable vaccine returned to OGPM SS - wastage (from all sources); ii) Adding and/or removing vaccine quantities from the net usage based on: I) Demographics; II) Population growth; III) Immunization coverage; and IV) Epidemiology; Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 5 b) Evaluating vaccine wastage and trends. Any vaccine that cannot be used is considered to be wasted. The maximum vaccine wastage rates measured in doses, over a 12- month period (as specified by the ministry), shall not exceed 5% for any vaccine product. If wastage exceeds this level, additional inventory control measures shall be taken to reduce it. Wastage levels for each vaccine shall be reported to the Population and Public Health Division (PPHD) of the ministry upon request; and c) By maintaining no more than a two- month vaccine supply at the board of health. The board of health may maintain a larger supply of vaccine during health emergencies (e.g., case and contact management), immunization clinics, or an adverse condition that may cause delays in the delivery of vaccine by any mode of transportation. Vaccine Order Process Vaccine O rdering by the Board of Health 1) The board of health shall: a) Order appropriate amounts of vaccine to minimize wastage and meet the demand of the population being served. Storing a larger volume than required can increase the risk of wastage as vaccine doses may expire before they can be used or they may become compromised while being stored; b) Place vaccine orders according to the scheduled OGPMSS delivery dates. The board of health may order outside of the scheduled OGPMSS delivery dates during health emergencies (e.g., case and contact management), or during an adverse condition that may cause delays in the delivery of vaccine by any mode of transportation; c) Avoid placing last -minute or rush orders. Prior to placing a vaccine order, the board of health shall: i) Review their current inventory by: I) Physically counting the vaccines on hand and updating Panorama through cycle counts or quantity on hand adjustments (according to Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices 3); or II) Generating the quantity on hand report (according to Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices 3); ii) Call the OGPMSS to determine vaccine expiry dates, if the board of health requires more than a two- month supply of vaccine. The board of health shall only order quantities of vaccine that can be used (administered or distributed) prior to vaccine expiry; and iii) Follow Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices for creating and submitting vaccine orders to the OGPMSS. 4 Receiving Vaccine at the Board of Health 1) Designated and trained board of health staff or their back -up shall: a) Be available to receive and store vaccines when they are expected to arrive; Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 6 b) Never leave vaccine in a shipping container, unpacked or unattended; and c) Know that vaccine deliveries require immediate attention.

Non- reusable (wasted) vaccines that cannot be used by the board of health or health care providers shall be returned to the OGPMSS, unless otherwise specified by the ministry, at least semi -annually. If vaccines are not to be returned to the OGPMSS as spe cified by the ministry, they should be disposed of in approved biomedical waste containers according to local, provincial and/or federal regulations. All non- reusable doses (that are returned or disposed of) shall be recorded using Panorama's Return and Adjustment functionality. The reasons for returning non- reusable vaccines are listed below (please refer to the Glossary for relevant definitions); Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 10 b) Vaccine doses wasted due to any of the following reasons are to be returned to OGPMSS: i) Spoiled vaccine due to a cold chain incident; ii) Defective Product ; iii) Discontinued Product ; iv) Damaged Product ; and v) Expired Product ; c) Vaccine doses wasted due to any of the following reasons are not to be returned to OGPMSS and should be disposed of according to local, provincial and/or federal regulations, however they should be recorded in Panorama as wastage: i) Suspected vaccine contamination; ii) Dose(s) remaining in a multi -dose vial that has expired; iii) Insufficient dose from a multi -dose vial ; iv) Vaccine administration issue(s) ; v) Unused pre-drawn syringe(s); and vi) Count discrepancy ; d) The return of reusable vaccine that cannot be used by the board of health or health care providers to the OGPMSS. The maximum reusable vaccine rate measured in doses shall not exceed 10% for any vaccine product over a 12- month period (as specified by the ministry). If reusable vaccine exceeds this level, additional inventory control measures shall be taken to reduce it; i) Only vaccine that has been maintained at the board of health (i.e., never distributed to a health care provider) in the required storage conditions as indicated on the product monograph, with at least four months of shelf -life (unless otherwise specified by the ministry) can be redistributed by OGPMSS; ii) In the case of emergency redistribution, the ministry shall notify the board of health when vaccine that has not been maintained at the board of health can be redistributed. Redistributed vaccine must be accompanied by the current temperature log book or any other method specified by the ministry indi cating that the vaccine has been maintained at the required storage conditions as specified in the vaccine product monograph; e) The packing of reusable and non- reusable vaccines for return to OGPMSS. non- vaccines must be packaged separa tely. Only the reusable vaccines must be stored and transported under the required cold chain temperature conditions. The packages must be clearly identified by attaching the appropriate approved vaccine return label to the outside of the package; f) Procedur e for health care providers who receive publicly funded vaccine to return non-reusable vaccine; g) Security measures for t he housing of wasted vaccine; and h) A contract in place with a disposal company for products that cannot be returned to OGPMSS. Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 11 Vaccine Ret urn Process for Health Care Providers 1) The board of health shall, f or health care providers that who order vaccines directly from the board of health: a) Instruct health care providers to return all non- reusable vaccines to the board of health; b) Ensure the no n-reusable vaccine is accompanied by a return form; c) Physically count the returned vaccine and verify the amounts provided on the return form; d) Enter non- reusable vaccines into Panorama under the correct provider HP code; and e) Monitor provider return reports for compliance with one month supply. Boards of health shall contact premises that have excessive returns and review their ordering processes. 2) For health care providers that order vaccines directly from OGPMSS, instruct the health care provider to: a) Return all non- reusable vaccines directly to the OGPMSS unless otherwise specified by the ministry; b) Complete the current vaccine return form or any other method specified by the ministry ; c) Attach the form with the returned vaccines; and d) Contact the OGPMSS for a Return Authorization Number (RAN). Vaccine Handling and Use Storage by the Board of Health 1) The board of health shall keep vaccine in the refrigerator, except when removing dose(s) for: a) Shipping to health care providers; b) Transporting to immunization clinics; or c) Transferring vaccines to an alternative refrigerator, insulated container, or facility due to power outages, refrigerator failure, or maintenance. Storage of V accine and Diluents in a Refrigerator 1) The board of health shall store vaccine in a purpose- built refrigerator. a) Keep the refrigerator door openings to a minimum to help keep internal temperatures stable; b) Store vaccines in their original packaging with lids closed until ready for administration to protect the vaccine from light and provide additional thermal protection and stability. Never store loose vials or prefilled syringes outside of their packaging as this increases the risk of administration errors, exposes vaccine to light, and makes it more difficult to track expiration dates and manage i nventory; Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 12 c) Store diluent with the corresponding refrigerated vaccine, if possible. Refer to the product monograph or package insert to determine the required storage conditions for the vaccine diluent (e.g., refrigeration or room temperature); d) Use the diluent provided by the manufacturer for the corresponding vaccine; e) Attach labels to shelves to clearly identify where each type of vaccine and diluent is stored. If diluent is stored separately from the corresponding vaccine, label t he container where it is stored; f) Group vaccine products together by their types and lot number. Place each vaccine type in a separate container that is labeled with the vaccine name(s); g) Place vaccines and diluents in the center of the unit, two to three inches away from walls , ceiling, floor, and door. Avoid storing vaccines and diluents in any part of the unit that may not provide stable temperatures or sufficient air flow, such as directly under cooling vents; h) Not pack the purpose- built refrigerator too tightly as this can restrict air circulation and impact vaccine temperatures; i) Allow space between vaccines and diluents to promote air circulation and maintain a consistent temperature; j) Rotate vaccine inventory after the receipt of a vaccine delivery so that short expiry dated vaccines are placed in the front. Vaccines with the longest expiry dat es should be kept at the back; k) Label vaccines previously exposed to a cold chain incident and use them first, as there is a potential for wastage if products are exposed to a second ( and subsequent) cold chain incident(s); l) Clearly mark fee- for-service vaccine inventory and separate it from the publicly funded vaccines; m) Remove expired vaccines immediately from the refrigerator to reduce the risk of them being used. Expired vaccines should be returned to the OGPMSS as non - usable; and n) Store sterile biological products (i.e., blood products, tuberculin skin testing solution) that require refrigeration in a different container/bin than vaccines. Always store sterile biological products below vaccines and on a different shelf to prevent contamination and reduce the likelihood of medication errors. Vaccine E xpiration Dates 1) The board of health shall: a) Use the product up to and including the last day of that month, when the expiration date has only a month and year. If a day is included with the month and year, the product can only be used through the end of that day; and b) Use the product before the expiration date, if the: i) Reconstituted vaccines have a limited time frame for use once the vaccine is mixed with a diluent; ii) Multi -dose vials have a specified time frame for use once they have been entered/punctured; and Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 13 iii) Manufacturer -shortened expiration dates when a vaccine is exposed to a cold chain incident. Vaccine Storage and Handling Equipment Requirements Physical Requirements at the B oard of Health 1) The board of health shall: a) Use purpose- built refrigerators (also referred to as pharmacy, laboratory, or industrial -quality refrigerators) for storing vaccine inventories. The purpose- built refrigerato r shall: i) Have a feedback system, which has narrow tolerances with internal temperatures, providing appropriate temperature regulation; ii) Have ongoing air circulation for even temperature distribution; iii) Have an evaporator operating at +2\u00b0C, preventing the vaccine from freezing; iv) Have air circulation that is fan- forced; v) Have a temperature recovery system; vi) Be built to handle ambient temperature changes; vii) Accommodate vaccine inventory, taking into consideration times of the year when a large inventory of vaccines shall be stored in the refrigerator (e.g., influenza season) without crowding; viii)Be maintained at temperatures between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C.The thermostat should be set at midrange to achieve a temperature of about +5\u00b0C, which will decrease the likel ihood of temp erature excursions; 5 ix) Have a digital temperature monitoring system with an alarm that is set at +3\u00b0C and +7\u00b0C. This should provide adequate response time to respond to the alarm and implement corrective measures prior to temperatures following above or below the recommended temperature range; x) Be secured, with the refrigerator and/or the room, where the vaccine is housed, locked by desi gnated staff afte r office hours; and xi) Not be used for storing ice/gel packs (including water blankets). A separate refrigerator and/or freezer should be used for this purpose. b) Place the purpose built refrigerators in a room: i) That is well- ventilated, temperature- controlled that is away from direct sunlight and with space between the unit, ceiling, and any wall. Seasonal variations in room temperature may affec t the refrigerator temperatures; ii) Where the temperature is monitored and maintained between +20\u00b0C and +25\u00b0C ; iii) Where the cover of the m otor compartment is not blocked; iv) Where the refrigerator unit is leveled with the doors opening and closing smoothly and fitting squarely against the refrigerator unit; and v) That allows for air circulation around the back and sides of the unit, as recommend by the manufacturer . Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 14 c) Take the following precautions to protect the storage unit's power supply: i) Connect vaccine refrigerators to a dedicated electric circuit so that enough power is available to operate it safely without overloading the sys tem; ii) Use a safety -lock plug or an outlet cover to prevent the unit from being unplugged; iii) Post \"DO NOT UNPLUG\" warning signs at outlets and on storage units to alert staff, custodians, electricians, and other workers; iv) Label fuses and circuit breakers to alert people not to turn off power to storage units and include immediate steps to take if power is interrupted; v) Avoid using power outlets that can be tripped or switched off, including: I) Built-in circuit switches; II) Outlets that can be activated by a wall switch; and III) Multi -outlet power strips. d) Have an alarmed temperature monitoring system for each vaccine refrigerator. The alarm must be either a voice or electronic message that will be telephoned or e-mailed to on- call staff or a security service OR a recognizable audio tone that is monitored during office hours by staff and after office hours by a security service. The security service or on- call staff must be trained in appropriate procedures for responding to an alarm. The alarmed temperature monitor ing system should have a battery back -up system in case of an electricity disruption. Routine Maintenance at the Board of Health 1) The board of health shall: a) Check storage unit door seals regularly for signs of wear and tear. Seals should not be torn or brit tle, and there should be no gaps between the seals and the body of the unit when the door is closed. If seals need to be replaced, contact a repair technician immediately. Unit doors pose a particular risk to maintaining appropriate internal temperatures o f vaccine storage units; b) Check door hinges and adjust so that the doors open and close smoothly and fit squarely against the body of the u nit; c) Clean unit coils and motor as dust and dirt buildup can affect transfer of heat from the coils and prevent the unit from working efficiently; d) Clean the inside of the unit to prevent bacterial and fungal growth. Clean the unit quickly to minimize the risk of the temperature going out of range; e) Have vaccine refrigerator maintenance agreements in place. Maintenance agreements shall include: i) Regular maintenance of vaccine refrigerators completed at least once annually; ii) Testing of the vaccine refrigerator alarm system; iii) Calibration of the vaccine refrigerator's digital temperature monitoring device(s) by a certified technician once annually; and iv) Documentation of the results of maintenance activities and tests; Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 15 f) Maintain the equipment manual and maintenance logbooks for each piece of vaccine storage and handling equipment and create a summary of maintenance information that includes the following: i) Name and contact information for the refrigerator service provider; ii) Itemized list of vaccine refrigerators within the board of health, including location, the date each piece of equipment was installed, size, and serial numbers; and iii) Maintenance history ad status of vaccine refrigerators. g) Replace all vaccine refrigerator batteries (e.g., for alarm system(s) and digital temperature monitoring device(s)) at least annually, or as required; and h) Report breakdowns immediately and transfer vaccine to an alternate storage refrigerator while the refrigerator is being repaired. Stabilizing Temperatures in New and Repaired Refrigerators at the Board of Health 1) The board of health shall: a) For repaired refrigerators or refrigerators that experienced a power outage, the vaccine refrigerator temperatures shall be stabilized between +3\u00b0C to +7 \u00b0C (strive for +5\u00b0C) prior to placing vaccine back into the refrigerator; and b) For new refrigerators, vaccine refrigerator temperatures shall be stabilized between +3\u00b0C to +7\u00b0C (strive for +5 \u00b0C). Monitor temperatures for 2 to 7 consecutive days. Maximum, minimum, and current temperatures need to be recorded twice daily and shall be within the required storage temperature range prior to storing vaccine in the refriger ator. 5 Digital T emperature Monitoring Devices for Vaccine Refrigerators and for Vaccine T ransport at the Board of Health 1) The board of health shall have a digital temperature monitoring device for: a) Each vaccine refrigerator (a data logger is required); b) Each transport container; and c) At least one backup digital temperature monitoring device in case a primary device malfunctions or is out for calibration testing, making sure the backup device has a different calibration testing schedule than the primary device. 2) A board of health's digital temperature monitoring devices shall have a(n): a) Alarm for out -of-range temperatures; b) Low-battery indicator; c) Digita l display of the current, minimum, and maximum temperatures; d) Accuracy within +/ -1.0\u00b0C; e) Temperature increment of 0.1 \u00b0C; and f) Certification that it is calibrated and at a minimum, replaced once annually (or once the duration of certification of accuracy has been reached) or recalibrated by Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 16 a certified technician. Since all digital temperature monitoring devices experience \"drift\" over time that affects their accuracy, calibration testing is needed every one to two years or according to the manufacturer's timeline. 5 Data Loggers 1)Data loggers are continuous monitoring and recording devices that provide detailedinformation on all temperatures recorded at preset intervals. Data loggers provide the most accurate storage unit temperature information, including details on how long aunit has been operating outside the recommended temperature range. When usingdata loggers, the board of health shall : a)Continuously record all vaccine refrigerator temperatures; b)Review the print -outs from the data logger when the vaccine refrigerator temperatur es are below +2\u00b0C or above +8\u00b0C; c)Change batteries annually, or as required; d)Check the digital temperature monitoring device twice daily, when the board ofhealth opens and before the board of health closes, to confirm that vaccinerefrigerator temperatures remained between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C. Record minimum,maximum, and current temperatures in the current temperature log book or anyother method specified by the ministry after each check; e)Continue twice daily observation and the recording of the refrigeratortemperatures or the installation of an alarm system which alerts staff within andoutside of work hours when t here is a temperature excursion; f)Program the continuous temperature recording system for at least a 30 minuteinterval for recordings; g)Place the data loggers in the middle of the refrigerat or with vaccines surrounding it; h)Place the data logger away from doors or walls of the refrigerator; i)Download data loggers on a weekly basis and when an alarm is triggered andretained as per board of health policy. Keep logs for a minimum of one year; j)Download the data from the data logger immediately when an out of rang e temperature occurs to determine the duration of the cold chain incident and todetermine if vaccine is suitable for continued use or no longer viable; k)For data loggers that are utilized to record the minimum, maximum, and currenttemperatures twice daily, data shall be downloaded after the temperaturerecordings in order to reset the minimum, maximum and current temperaturereadings from the previous readings; and l)For data loggers that are utilized in conjunction with a maximum -minimum thermometer, data can be downloaded on a weekly basis (if no out -of-range temperatures occur) provided that the minimum, maximum and currenttemperature readings are documented from the maximum -minimum thermometer. Digital Maximum- Minimum Thermometers 1)Digital maximum -minimu m thermometers show the current temperature and the minimum and maximum temperatures that have been reached since the last time thesuggested Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 17 maximum- minimum thermometer was reset. When using digital maximum -minimum thermometers, the board of health shall: a) Manually reset the thermometer each tim e the temperatures are recorded; b) Use device specific operating instructions as each digital maximum -minimum thermometer has slightly different operating instructions; and c) Change batteries annually, or as required. Checking the Accuracy of a Health Care Provider's Digital Temperature M onitoring D evice 1) Checking the digital temperature monitoring device for accuracy is recommended to ensure that temperature measurements are accurate and cables and sensors are not damaged. The board of health shall check digital temperature monitoring devices for accuracy after: a) Issues are detected with the device (e.g., after a cold chain incident); and b) One year of device use. 2) The board of health shall instruct health care providers to replace or recalibrate the device annually (or once the duration of certification of accuracy has been reached), or send the device back to the manufacturer for recalibration. If these steps have not been completed then the board of health shall check for the accuracy of the health care provider's device by testing the accuracy of the premises' device against the board of health's calibrated device by: a) Determining the accuracy of the devices. If the accuracy of the device is unknown assume an accuracy of +/ - 1.0\u00b0C; b) Establishing the acceptable variance by adding the accuracy of devices together; i) E.g., Health care provider's device has an accuracy of +/ - 1.0\u00b0C and board of health's calibrated device has an accuracy of +/ - 0.5\u00b0C, the acceptable variance is +/ - 1.5\u00b0C. c) Placing the board of health's calibrated device into the health care provider's refrigerator and letting it stabilize to the temperature of the refrigerator (this should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes depending on the refrigerator and thermometer); d) Compa ring the board of health's device results with the health care provider's device results; and e) Instructing the health care provider to replace their device if the difference between the two current temperature readings is greater than the acceptable variance. Placement of D igital Temperature M onitoring Device at the board of Health 1) The board of health shall: a) Refer to the owner's manual for instructions on digital temperature monitoring device placement. Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 18 b)Place the digital temperature monitoring device's digital display outside the unit or in a position inside the unit so temperatures can be read without opening the door. Monitoring Refrigerator Temperatures at the Board of Health 1)Monitoring vaccine storage equipment and temperatures is a daily responsibility toensure the safety of the vaccine supply. The board of health shall implement routinemonitoring activities to identify out -of-range temperatures quickly and take immediate action to correct them, pr eventing loss of vaccines. The board of health shall: a)Document the time and the current, maximum and minimum temperatures of therefrigerator in the Temperature Log Book twice daily (beginning and end of eachbusiness day) and reset the digital temperature monitoring device after recording/downloading the readings; b)View the temperatures every time the refrigerator is accessed; c)Maintain temperature logs and data logger temperature downloads for a minimumof one year (unless board of health policy requires a longer retention period); d)Inspect the storage unit during the twice- daily checks, and, if required, reorganize any misplaced vaccines, and remove any expired vaccines; and e)Check unit doors throughout the day and always at the end of the day to ensurethey are tightly closed to prevent temperature changes and light exposure.

Purpose- built refrigerators, especially those with glass doors, may not be able to maintain temperatures for longer than 30 minutes. Factors including the amount of vaccine being stored in the refrigerator, the external temperatures (e.g., summer vs. winter) and the type, model and age of the vaccine refrigerator will affect the duration of time vaccines within the unit will be kept within the +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C range; c) During a scheduled or a time- limited electricity disruption where the power is expected to be restored before the vaccine refrigerator temperature rises above the recommended range, the board of health shall: following steps: i) Keep the refrigerator door closed until the power is restored to maintain an acceptable temperature range for as long as possible; and ii) Record maximum, minimum and current temperatures: I) Continue to monitor the temperatures inside the vaccine storage unit at 30 minute intervals if the digital temperature monitoring device allows digital temperature monitoring without opening the storage unit doors; d) If it is unsure that the problem can be corrected in time to maintain an appropriate temperature, the board of health shall initiate its contingency plan by: i) Transferring vaccines to alternative storage facility (that is connected to a generator) by: I) Contacting the alternative vaccine storage facility to notify them of the need to store vaccine at their locati on; II) Conducting an inventory of vaccines while packing all vaccines, using insulated containers with appropriate packing materials and digital temperature monitoring devices; III) Recording the time an insulated container temperature before transporting the vacc ines to and upon arrival at t he alternative storage facility; and IV) Continuing to read and record the maximum, minimum and current refrig erator temperatures twice daily; and Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 27 e) Alternatively, if an alternative storage facility cannot be identified within a reasonable distance, place the vaccine in insulated containers with appropriate packaging material and digital temperature monitoring devices and record the temperature at the board of health by: i) Labeling the insulated containers; and ii) Continuing to monitor the temperatures inside the insulated container at 30 minute intervals if the digital temperature monitoring device allows digital temperature monitoring without opening the insulated container. When the Refrigerator Malfunction Has Been Corrected or the Electricity S upply to the Refrigerator Has Been Restored at the Board of Health 1) The board of health shall: a) Document the following: i) Maximum, minimum and current temperatures inside the vaccine storage units; ii) Length of time the power has been off; and iii) Time when the electricity supply is restored; b) Maintain the vaccines in the refrigerator or remove the vaccines from the insulated container and place them into the refrigerator and resume regular vaccine storage and handling practices, as long as the refrigerator and insulated container were able to maintain the required +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C temperature range; c) Maintain the vaccines in the insulated container and continue to monitor temperatures inside the container if the insulated container was able to maintain the required +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C temperature range, but the vaccine refrigerator was unable to maintain the required storage range. Place the vaccine back into the refrigerator once it is able to maintain +3\u00b0C to +7 \u00b0C (strive for +5 \u00b0C); d) Undertake the following if the vaccine storage units (refrigerator(s) or insulated container(s)) were unable to maintain the required temperatures: i) Calculate the maximum length of time the temperature was outside 0\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C; ii) Complete a Panorama ASC (Adverse Storage Condition). Refer to the Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Pr actices; 3 iii) Assess vaccines involved in the cold chain incident by contacting the product manufacturer to determine which vaccines are still usable and which are wastage; iv) Mark vaccines involved in a cold chain incident that have been determined to be usable, in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations, in order to identify them i n case of a future exposure(s); v) Return unusable/wasted vaccines to OGPMSS. Refer to the Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices; 3 and vi) Return vaccines to the refrigerator once temperatures have returned to between +3\u00b0C to +7\u00b0C. Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 28 For Health Care Providers 1) The board of health shall: a) Work with health care providers in their jurisdiction to develop operational contingency plans for any premises that store publicly funded vac cines; and b) Make health care providers aware of the practices to follow in the event of a refrigerator malfunction or electricity disruption.

Any unusable/wasted vaccines should be returned to the board of health by the health care provider. Mark all reusable vaccine as exposed, according to the directions provided by the boar d of health. 3) The board of health shall facilitate completion of a Panorama ASC, according to the Panorama Inventory Data Standards and Best Practices. 3 4) The board of health shall instruct and verify that health care providers enacting any recommendations made by board of health staff to prevent or mitigate the risk of future exposures from occurring. Glossary Calibration : Calibration is the process of configuring an instrument to provide a result within an acceptable range (e.g., +/ -0.5\u00b0C ). Although the exact procedure may vary from device to device, the calibration process generally involves using the instrument to test samples of one or more known values called calibrators. The process teaches the instrument to produce results that are more accurate than those that would occur otherwise. Device calibration is one of the primary processes used to maintain device accuracy. Cold chain: Incl udes all of the materials, equipment, and procedures used to maintain vaccines in the required temperature range of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C from the time of manufacture until the vaccines are administered to individuals. In addition, protection from light is a neces sary condition for some vaccines. Cold chain incident or vaccine exposure: Occurs when vaccine is exposed to a temperature outside the required temperature range of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C for any period of time and the potency of the vaccine is potentially compromised. The vaccine temperature excursion tolerance and permissible time excursion is determined by each vaccine manufacturer. Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 29 Cold chain inspection: Boards of health conduct cold chain inspections to investigate the cause of the cold chain incident, determine whether vaccine can be used by the health care provider or returned to the board of health, provide follow -up education in order to prevent the occurrence of future incidents and ensure that adequate cold chain conditions can be maintained prior to continuing the vaccine supply to the health care provider Conditioning (related to ice/gel packs) : leaving the ice pack(s) (including flexible ice blankets) and gel pack(s) at room temperature to allow the ice or gel at the core to rise to about 0\u00b0C. This minim izes the risk of exposing vaccines to freezing temperatures. Cycle count: Cycle Count is an inventory management process where a small subset of inventory is counted on any given day. Cycle counts are less disruptive to daily operations as only selected holding point locations and/or products are counted, audited, and recounted. Normal transactions can continue for the rest of the inventory not being counted. The cycle counts provide an ongoing measure of inventory accuracy and can be tailored to focus on items in the holding point locations selected. Freezing inventory for a cycle count is optional. Damaged product: Vaccine and/or package that has been physically harmed; this prevents its use. Defective product: Vaccine and/or package that has a flaw(s) or imperfection(s). Demographics: Statistical data about the characteristics of a population, such as the age, gender and income of the people within the population. Digital temperature monitoring device: A n electronic device that measures temperatures and provides a digital display of the temperature reading. This can include devices such as a: Data logger : A digital temperature monitoring device that records temperatures continuously at programmed intervals. Temperature recordings are stored in the device's memory and can then be downloaded for review and storage. Maximum -minimum thermometer: A digital temperature monitoring device that records the maximum and minimum temperature that has been reached over a period of time (since the last reset). Diluent: Liquid substances used to reconstitute lyophilized vaccines prior to administration. Manufacturers of freeze- dried vaccine also supply the matching diluents.

Maximum and minimum temperature: A vaccine storage unit's warmest and coldest temperature readings during a set period of time. Non-reusable (wasted ) vaccine: Any vaccine that cannot be used is considered to be wasted. Wasted vaccine includes doses wasted for the following reasons: expired, spoiled (due to a cold chain incident), defective, discontinued, damaged, dose(s) remaining in a multi -dose vial that have expired, insufficient dose(s) from a multi -dose vial, suspected contamination, vaccine administration issue(s), unused pre- drawn syringe(s) and count discrepancy Physical count : The process of physically counting the vaccines and diluents in the refrigerator. The physical counts are then compared to the quantities reported in Panorama. Population growth: An increase in the number of people that reside in a country, province, county, or city. To determine whether there has been popul ation growth, the following formula is used: (birth rate + immigration) - (de ath rate + emigration). Potency: T he ability of a vaccine to produce a predictable and expected level of immune response in the vaccine recipient. Purpose -built refrigerator : A purpose- built vaccine refrigerator (also referred to as a pharmacy, lab- style or laboratory grade refrigerator) is the recommended standard for storing vaccines to keep them within the required +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C range to ensure potency, safety and effectiveness. Quantity on hand report: The purpose of this report is to indicate Operational Quantity on Hand for an item or a list of items. Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocol , 2018 31 Quarantine : Maintaining vaccines that have been exposed to a potential cold chain incident separate from other vaccines. Routine (annual) inspection : Routine inspections assess the health care providers' level of compliance with vaccine storage and handling requirements, including cold chain requirements. Routine inspections enable board of health staff to provide information and resources regarding the proper storage and handling of vaccines and the proper temperature monitoring device that should be in place to optimize vaccine potency. Spoiled vaccine: Vaccine that cannot be used due to exposure(s) to temperatures below +2\u00b0C or above +8\u00b0C for a specific period of time. This will depend on the specific vaccine.

Temperature recovery system: A mechanism that allows the refrigerator to return to its set temperature after being exposed to out of range temperatures (e.g., after opening the door to remove vaccine). Vaccine administration issue(s ) (in relation to wastage): During vaccine administration, a dose that is only partially (or not) administered to a vaccine recipient is considered wastage. Vaccine forecasting : Estimating the quantity of vaccines needs necessary for immunization programs delivered by the board of health and health care providers W asted vaccine: Any vaccine that cannot be used is considered to be wasted. Wasted vaccine includes doses wasted for the following reasons: expired, spoiled (due to a cold chain incident), defective, discontinued, damaged, dose(s) remaining in a multi -dose vial that have expired, i nsufficien t dose(s) from a multi -dose vial, suspected contamination, vaccine administration i ssue(s) ,u nused pre- drawn syringe(s) and count discrepanc y.)
