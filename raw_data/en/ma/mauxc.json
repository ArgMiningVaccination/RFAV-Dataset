Alarm over diabetes has galvanised a new clinical interest in the hypoglycemic (blood sugar-lowering) properties of ayurvedic drugs. The Indian Council for Medical Research has been cautiously advancing trials of Vijaysar, also known as the Malabar Kino tree, whose wood contains elements that have helped to significantly lower the blood sugar levels of laboratory rats. Another ayurvedic ingredient, the gum of the guar bean, which is used commercially as a thickening agent in sauces and salad dressings, has also been clinically shown to have a hypoglycemic effect. However, ayurvedic interventions are attracting not just hope, but controversy, because some practitioners go so far as to advertise permanent cures for diabetes. \"With Type 1 (juvenile, chronic, insulin-dependent) diabetes, there is no question, a cure is quite impossible,\" says Dr Ganapathy Bantwal, chief of endocrinology at St Johns' Medical College, Bangalore. \"With Type 2 (adult onset), ayurveda may help in the beginning, but as a placebo more than a real benefit. I've seen many patients who opted for ayurvedic remedies but ultimately they all ended up suffering from high blood glucose.\" It can get worse. Other diabetologists complain of young patients being brought in comatose, or half-blind with failing kidneys, after their parents abandoned their insulin regimen in favour of herbal remedies. Scrupulous practitioners of alternative medicine admit there are no miracles on offer. \"I'll never claim we can cure diabetes, I really disagree with that,\" says Dr Isaac Mathai, a leading homeopath. But Mathai, who is the director of Soukya (a centre for integrated medicine in suburban Bangalore, which combines western and traditional systems of medicine with a regimen of closely monitored diets and exercise), holds that alternative medicine can make a difference. \"In the initial stages, before a patient needs to go on an allopathic treatment, we can provide homeopathic and ayurvedic treatments to delay the onset of the disease and maintain their condition; after patients are on insulin, there are treatments that can reduce the amount of medication they need,\" he says. Mathai also holds that these treatments can help manage the complications of diabetes\u2014neuropathies, circulatory problems and swelling\u2014with mudpacks and ayurvedic massages. \"It is recognised the world over that an integrated, holistic approach is the ideal one. But there's no question of taking patients off their insulin protocols.\" From one therapeutic promise, lodged in the past, to another one, glimmering in the future. Bangalore established an anti-diabetes benchmark in 2004, when BioCon became the first Indian manufacturer of human insulin (insulin produced by yeasts carrying human DNA, which is safer than the variety modified from the insulin of pigs and cows). The group now exports human insulin and is using that revenue to fuel the pipeline of new innovative projects, including orally ingestible insulin, according to Harish Iyer, GM, research & development. Other institutes are now heading down the same trail. One is the Stem Cell Research Centre of Manipal Hospital. Stem cells can be treated and transformed into any cell-type in the body\u2014skin cells, nerve cells, heart muscle or even the b-islet cells that secrete insulin from the pancreas. When grafted into a failing organ, like a diabetic pancreas, they have the potential to regenerate and restore its function. In 2004, diabetes became a major focus at Manipal. Its chief scientific officer, Dr Satish Totey, says his team is concentrating on developing an orally ingestible drug that will prevent the ptb1 insulin inhibitor gene from suppressing the body's insulin production. Totey adds: \"There's a spurt in the groups working on diabetes, and with four or five groups in India working on it aggressively. I definitely think we can turn out a permanent cure, and stem cells will have a major role to play.\" How long will that adult cells\u2014it's quite close, maybe just three years down the line!\" It is a source of excitement that radical new therapies for diabetes can be developed in India itself. India is unhampered by the high-strung ethical debate on embryonic stem cell that is blockading research in the US, and it could plausibly move to the forefront of stem cell research as funders and researchers grow bold. And the growing numbers of Indian diabetics may have more reason to hope, perhaps for a cure, or even just easier management of this disease. "}
