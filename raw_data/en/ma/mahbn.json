Scientists, mystics, peak performers, CEOs and creatives around the world have been experimenting with plants and substances that have long been labelled as \"bad\". Their experiments \u2014 whether personal trials in their daily life, or rigorous scientific research in a laboratory \u2014 have produced mind blowing, life changing, health transforming results... and yet still, psychedelics are seen as 'taboo'. Today's podcast guest, Paul Austin is on a mission to change this perception and to spread the message that when safely, responsibly and strategically used, these substances can literally change your mind, your life, your mental and physical health, and radically accelerate your spiritual evolution. Paul Austin is an entrepreneur, public speaker, and educator. He has founded two companies in the emerging psychedelic space, Third Wave and Synthesis. Within Third Wave, Paul leads his team in building an educational platform to ensure psychedelic substances become responsibly integrated into our cultural framework, while Synthesis is a legal psilocybin retreat just outside of Amsterdam. Paul has been featured in the BBC, Forbes, and Rolling Stone and sees psychedelic use as a skill, one that becomes more refined as we explore the many nuances of these awe-inspiring medicines and molecules. Known as the Microdosing Coach, Paul provides long-form psychedelic guides, online microdosing programs, and an industry-best network of clinics and retreat providers. I have to confess that a few years back, this was not a topic I was interested in at all. But after hearing about the life-altering journeys that some of my friends experienced using plant medicine, my perspective started to shift. So if you want learn about how people are using plant medicine in a responsible, safe manner to blast through the limits of human possibility, improve their mental health, make monumental leaps in their spiritual evolution, as well as just give themselves a creative 'edge' in their daily lives, then pop in those earbuds and open your mind... this one's for you!
