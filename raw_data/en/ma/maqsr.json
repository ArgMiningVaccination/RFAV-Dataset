It was estimated that in patients older than age 60 years, 50% have diverticulosis [1,2]. Surgeons' interest for this disease is related to the treatment of the complications of diverticulitis (perforation, occlusion, bleeding). About 25% of patients hospitalized for diverticulitis will require a non-elective surgical intervention, in most cases for perforation [3,4]. The surgical management of emergencies for diverticulitis progressed over the past years. The three stage procedure (stoma without resection of the diseased segment as first stage) only maintains a historical value. The two stage procedure, better known as Hartmann's procedure (HP), includes the resection of the perforated or stenotic segment with terminal colostomy (first stage) and the subsequent restoration of the bowel continuity (second stage). Most recently a one stage surgical approach was proposed including resection of involved colon and primary anastomosis realized in the same setting, with or without protective ileostomy (PRA). Many studies demonstrated no differences between HP and PRA in terms of morbidity and mortality [5,6]. Nevertheless, most surgeons still prefer HP in the emergency setting to treat perforation or obstruction from acute colonic diverticulitis [3,7,8]. Most retrospective studies and the only two prospective trials [6,9] are focused only on patients operated for perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (Hinchey stage III and IV). Our systematic review aimed to evaluate the literature comparing PRA (with or without protective ileostomy) with HP in all non-elective surgical patients with complicated acute diverticulitis (perforation or obstruction) to assess the effectiveness and safety of the one-stage technique. Methods Data sources and search strategy A comprehensive computerized literature search was performed until July 2014 on Medline databases using the and \"acute diverticulitis\". Only papers published in English were considered while no publication date restrictions were applied. The computer search was supplemented with a manual search of reference lists for all available review articles and meta-analyses to identify further relevant works not found by the computer search. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. *Corresponding author: Lorusso D, Department of Surgery, Scientific Institute Digestive Disease, \"Saverio de Bellis\" Bianco Complicated Diverticulitis.

The latest published meta-analyses were limited to the most severe stages (Hinchey III and IV). Our systematic review aimed to compare PRA with the HP in all non-elective surgical patients with complicated acute diverticulitis (perforation or obstruction). Methods: A computerized literature search was performed on Medline databases until July 2014. The studies included in the meta-analysis were 24 with a total of 4,062 patients. Study outcomes included postoperative surgical complications, reintervention, 30-day mortality, overall mortality as well as the length of stay as secondary outcome. The pooled effects were estimated using a fixed effect model or random effect model based on the heterogeneity test. Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Subgroup analyses by study type were performed. Results: The PRA group had a lower rate of postoperative surgical complications (OR=0.525, 95% length of stay (MD=9.129, 95% CI 2.391-15.867) compared to the HP group. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis shows that the PRA technique is better than HP for all considered outcomes. Due to the high variability of the included studies, further randomized controlled trials would be required to confirm these results.Non-Elective Surgery for Acute Complicated Diverticulitis. Primary Resection-Anastomosis or \"Saverio de Bellis\" Hospital, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy Center, Digestive \"Saverio de Bellis\" Hospital, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Disease \"Saverio de Hospital, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Lorusso D, et al.44 Volume 12 Issue 2 1 Eligibility criteria Eligible studies were those comparing PRA (with or without protective ileostomy) with HP in non-elective surgical patients with acute diverticulitis complicated by peritonitis or bowel obstruction. The laparoscopic techniques were not considered in the present review. Peritonitis and bowel obstructions caused by inflammatory bowel diseases or cancer were also excluded. Surgical interventions on acute colonic diverticulitis meeting the above criteria had also to include at least one of the following primary outcomes: (i) postoperative surgical complications, (ii) reintervention, (iii) 30-day mortality and (iv) overall mortality. Postoperative surgical complications included wound infection, wound dehiscence, intra-abdominal infection/abscess, rectal stump dehiscence, occlusion and intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The number of events for each study was obtained by summing all postoperative surgical complications occurred while the number of possible complications was calculated multiplying the number of patients by 9, which expressed the number of complications. This method was applied to estimate the postoperative complications occurred after the first intervention as well as to sum the complications occurred after the first and the second intervention, when the restoration of the bowel continuity was indicated. Reintervention was defined as any surgical procedure required in a postoperative patient within a few days/weeks following the initial surgical procedure and related to the initial surgery. The 30-day mortality expressed the number of deaths from any cause within 30 days from the first hospital admission for non-elective surgery in patients with complicated diverticular disease. Overall mortality recorded the number of deaths occurred after both the first intervention and the second intervention of recanalization. The overall mortality coincided with 30-day mortality, for patients who underwent PRA without diverting loop ileostomy. Secondary outcome considered the length of stay (LOS) in days for first admission in both groups. Randomized controlled trials (RCT), prospective non randomized trials (PNR) and retrospective studies (R) were included in this study. Data extraction Original articles were reviewed and the variables of interest were abstracted, where reported. When discrepancies occurred between reviewers, the reasons were identified and a final decision was made based on the reviewers' agreement. Quality score was assigned to each study by the Jadad scale assessing 3 major criteria: reporting and handling of randomization and blinding and handling of withdrawals. The maximum possible score was 5 while studies with extensive flaws were those with a 2 score. The validity assessment was performed by the same two reviewers who extracted data from the full text articles. Statistical analysis For dichotomous outcomes formal statistical tests for heterogeneity of the odds ratios (ORs) were performed with the Cochrane Q test, heterogeneity being assumed with a p value 0.05. When a Q test indicated substantial heterogeneity, a random-effects model weighted by the DerSimonian-Laird method was used. A fixed-effects model weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method was used for pooling the ORs. Results were expressed as OR and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI was calculated. The pooled effects were estimated using a fixed effect model or random effect model based on the heterogeneity test. We performed subgroup analyses to assess the effect of the study type (RCT, PNR or R) on the association between surgical technique and outcomes. All meta-analytical data were analyzed according to intention- to treat analyses. All procedures and calculations used in the meta-analyses were made following the methodology reported elsewhere [10]. Results A total of 372 potentially eligible studies were identified, as reported in Figure 1. Study titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion. 307 were excluded and the remaining 65 possibly relevant studies were retrieved as full text articles. Based on the full text assessment, 41 studies were excluded for the following reasons: elective surgery (n=9), outcomes not reported or not available (n=25), other surgical technique (n=1), data included in previous or more complete studies (n=4), Italian language (n=2). The USA national survey conducted by Masoomi et al. [11] was excluded to avoid a selection bias because the authors compared 56,866 HP patients with 3,361 patients treated Figure 1: Systematic review PRISMA flow diagram.

A total of 24 studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis, yielding a total of 4,062 non-elective surgical patients with acute complicated diverticulitis. 1,184 patients underwent PRA (with or without protective ileostomy) while 2,878 patients were submitted to HP. The selected study characteristics are summarized in Table 1 [12-33]. Two randomized controlled trials [6,9] were included in the meta-analysis and ranked as high quality studies with a Jadad's score of 3, while four were prospective non randomized studies and eighteen followed a retrospective design. The inherent lower methodological quality of retrospective and prospective non randomized designs suggested us to perform subgroup analyses by study type (Figures 2-6). Postoperative surgical complications Patients who underwent to PRA had a substantial lower risk to develop postoperative surgical complications compared to HP (OR=0.525, 95% CI 0.387-0.713; heterogeneity: Q value=49.364; P<0.0001). The observed heterogeneity is mainly due to the retrospective studies in which, however, the average effect went in the same direction of the other two groups that, instead, did not show heterogeneity. For this reason we considered the random effect model used strong enough. The PRA group also showed lower postoperative surgical complications in all study types analyzed (R, PNR and RCT) (Figure 2). Although few studies [6,9,17-25] reported the complications occurred after the second intervention planned to restore the bowel continuity, the same results were found considering the sum of the complications occurred after the first and the second intervention (OR=0.490; 95% CI 0.361-0.664; heterogeneity: Q value=50.716; P<0.0001) (data not shown). The previous considerations about heterogeneity could also be applied in this case. Reintervention HP patients showed a higher risk to be submitted to reintervention compared to PRA (OR=0.688, 95% CI 0.525-0.902; heterogeneity: Q value=33.027; P=1.000). Such result was confirmed in the R and PNR subgroups but not in the only RCT considered (Figure 3). Despite the absence of heterogeneity, in our opinion this result should be interpreted with caution and further studies would be required to confirm it. The complications that led to perform a reintervention were reported only by six studies and amounted to 18.0% for HP and 9.7% for PRA. In the HP group, the main causes of reintervention were related to wound complications (41.8%), stoma complications (27.3%) and intraabdominal abscess (14.5%) while to PRA were reoperated for anastomotic leak (57.9%), wound complications (21.1%) and resuturation of abdominal incisions (21.1%). 30-day mortality Statistical heterogeneity was present among the 24 studies considered (Q value=50.548; P= 0.001). By using a random effect model, pooled analysis showed a statistically significant advantage in the PRA group in terms of lower 30-day mortality rate (OR=0.389, 95% CI 0.259-0.586), which was confirmed in the three subgroups considered (Figure 4). Overall mortality The overall mortality rate was 8.5% (19/224) in the PRA group and 16.9% (50/295) in the HP group, respectively (Figure 5). Data were pooled from 8 studies and demonstrated a significant lower overall mortality risk in the PRA group (OR=0.467, 95% CI 0.272-0.803), which was confirmed in the three subgroups considered. Heterogeneity among the studies was no significant (Q value=6.247; P=0.511), allowing us to use a fixed effect model. Length of hospital stay The trend was in favor of the PRA technique with a pooled MD of 9.129 (95% CI 2.391-15.867), in spite of the presence of significant heterogeneity among the 4 considered studies (Q value= 25.730; P<0.0001).

Discussion Worldwide, HP is still the most common procedure performed in emergency surgery for complications of acute diverticulitis. This tendency was also reflected in the data collected in our meta-analysis: excluding the two RCT, out of a total of 3,910 patients 2,792 (71.4%) patients were submitted to HP while only 1,118 (28.6%) patients underwent PRA (with or without protective ileostomy). Emergency colorectal resection is an independent risk factor for anastomotic leak (relative risk 4.6, 95% CI 1.9-9.8) and the presence of peritonitis and/or bowel obstruction is also a predictive factor [34]. This is the reason why, in patients with a diffuse peritonitis or occlusion in a colon not prepared, most surgeons commonly avoid the anastomosis for the high risk of dehiscence with major complications for the patient [25,35]. However, many studies, including the only completed randomized clinical trial and four systematic reviews, have demonstrated the feasibility of anastomosis for peritonitis due to perforated diverticulitis so that nowadays the colorectal anastomosis is not absolutely contraindicated in emergency surgery for this disease [5,6,8,36,37]. In particular, the above mentioned studies showed that morbidity and mortality J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Primary Resection-Anastomosis or Hartmann's Procedure? 47 Volume 12 Issue 2 1 Figure 4: Forest plot for 30-day mortality by study type and results of meta-analysis.

Almost all of the studies reviewed, including the two randomized controlled trials and three out of four systematic reviews [5,8,37], considered only patients with peritonitis secondary to perforated diverticulitis (Hinchey stage III-IV). Our review, instead, together with the review performed by Constantinides et al. [36], is the only one that considered all non-elective surgical patients with complicated acute diverticulitis (perforation or bowel obstruction). Indeed, we consider common practice to perform HP also for acute intestinal obstruction secondary to diverticular sigmoid stenosis with dilated and unprepared proximal colon. Constantinides et al. [36] reported in their review a significantly decreased mortality for emergency operations with PRA vs HP (7.4% vs. 15.6%; OR=0.44). Also the incidence of wound infection and postoperative abscess or peritonitis was significantly lower in the PRA group (OR=0.42 and 0.43, respectively). The results of our review are in agreement with those of Constantinides. In fact, our meta-analysis shows that the 30-day mortality rate is significantly lower in the PRA group vs. the HP group. Also the overall mortality (number of deaths occurred after both the first intervention and the second intervention of recanalization, when indicated) was 8.5% in the PRA group and J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Lorusso D, et al.48 Volume 12 Issue 2 1 Figure 6: Forest plot for length of hospital stay (days) by study type and results of meta-analysis. Abbreviations : HP: Hartmann Deviation; N: Numerosity 16.9% in the HP group. Our study also shows that patients undergoing PRA have a lower risk of reintervention compared to HP group. However, it should be noted that the first cause of reintervention in the PRA group was the anastomotic leak (57.9% of reinterventions). Some of the results of our meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution for several biases related to the variability of the studies, the inclusion of only two RCT of which one was stopped early [39], the wide span of time in which the trials were conducted (1988-2014) and, above all, the patients' selection bias which definitely influenced the results. As previously highlighted, in the retrospective and prospective non randomized studies included in our meta-analysis, the PRA technique was performed only in 28.6% of cases, suggesting that surgeons followed rigorous criteria, such as most favorable clinical conditions, to define the indication to the PRA technique. This could explain the better outcomes shown in this group, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. However, the two randomized controlled trials, of which only one was, concluded [6], and the prospective studies showed average values in favor to the PRA technique, encouraging the promotion of further studies to confirm the hypothesis that the PRA technique is more effective and safer in emergency setting for acute complicated diverticulitis. Furthermore, based on the results of our review, we can assert that the HP is not the only technique to perform in non-elective surgical patients with acute complicated diverticulitis and that, in selected cases; PRA can be executed without increased morbidity and mortality, even obtaining in some cases better results. The surgeon will choose, case by case, the most appropriate technique, taking into account his own experience in colorectal surgery [40] and considering that the anastomotic leak risk is based on the patient's risk factors (severe comorbidities, significant intraoperative hemorrhage, shock, sepsis) [34]. Highlights Best surgical technique for complicated acute diverticulitis is an open question. Included studies didn't provide strong evidence to define the best surgical technique. Primary Anastomosis was better than Hartmann's procedure for all included outcomes. Further well-designed studies should be performed to confirm our evidences. Conclusion The available studies do not provide strong evidence to define the best surgical technique in non-elective patients with complicated acute diverticulitis (perforation or obstruction). However, in selected cases, the PRA technique may be preferred to HP for the lower morbidity and postoperative mortality. Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess if the PRA technique could be routinely executed, leaving the Hartmann's procedure for particularly severe cases.

The idea was to investigate the potential benefits when dealing with complications (adherence of the flexor tendons and severing or scarring of the median nerve using the two- inch matrix as an adhesion barrier following mini-open carpal tunnel release).

Patients in the standard procedure group (200 patients in all) underwent operations using the same technique in carpal tunnel surgery in both groups, completing follow-up evaluations at no less than 3 to 6 months post-operation. The male to female ratio was 1:6. In twenty patients, there was bilateral involvement. Method All operations were conducted by the author at the Hospital General Universitario de Valencia, and the Cl\u00ednica La Salud, Valencia, Spain, between 2012 and 2013. All patients complained of numbness and/or sensory disturbance or weakness in the median nerve distribution of the hand. Tinel and Phalen sign tests were positive in about two-thirds of patients. EMG studies were performed in all patients and were positive, ranging from mild to severe. Results Numbness and paresthesia were relieved in 95% of patients in the L.S.M. group and 89% in the control group (CG). Pain was relieved in 95% DG and 90% CG. weakness was relieved in 95% DG and 92% CG. Normal grip strength was evident in 93% DG and 91% had normal pinch strength. Re-operation rate Adherence of the flexor tendons in 3 CG patients and 8 patients due to scarring involving the median nerve, with the L.S. matrix group undergoing re-operation for the following reasons: recurrent pain (3 patients due to scarring around the median nerve). The difference in the re-operation rate between the collagen matrix group and the standard procedure group is statistically significant (p<0.01). Conclusion Findings in this study (reduced pain and lower incidence of adhesions) are consistent with the L.S. matrix acting as an effective adhesion barrier. By preventing median nerve adhesions, the L.S. matrix may significantly reduce the incidence of disabling pain associated with re-operation. Ultimately, the prophylactic use of the Layershield Matrix to prevent adhesions may result in improved patient outcomes. Carpal Tunnel Release: Avoiding Complications with Layer Shield Matrix Arrotegui JI* Departamento de Neurocirug\u00eda, Hospital General Universitario de V alencia, Spain (EMG) studies, plays an important role in the evaluation of patients with possible CTS. Electrodiagnostic testing has been shown to have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in evaluation of CTS [3]. In addition, it may help to identify superimposed or alternative neuropathic conditions mimicking CTS, such as cervical J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Arrotegui JI52 Volume Issue 2 2 radiculopathy, brachial plexopathy, proximal median neuropathy or other upper limb mononeuropathies, as well as peripheral neuropathy. When electrodiagnostic testing is normal, this may suggest that non-neuropathic conditions, such as arthritis or tendinitis, are responsible for the patient's symptoms. Despite the clear value of nerve conduction and EMG studies in the evaluation of patients with possible CTS, the tests may be underutilized in clinical practice. Since CTS has become an important public health problem because of its frequent occurrence in workplace settings leading to repetitive stress injury, its diagnosis and treatment have attracted the attention of organized medicine and governmental agencies. At least nine medical specialty societies have published position papers of various kinds, and three governmental agencies have issued statements on the subject [4]. There is an increasing debate related to the proper setting for electrodiagnostic testing, and some attempt has been made to limit its use in the diagnosis of CTS. Much of this debate has been based on the opinions of individuals or groups with varying degrees of expertise in the field, little on actual data. We carried out this study in order to determine the actual real-life experience of a clinical neurophysiology laboratory in the evaluation of CTS. Surgical division of the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) has been performed since 1933 and is usually a relatively simple procedure [5]. A recent report on a microsurgical carpal tunnel release (CTR) technique, performed on an outpatient basis, documented excellent results equal to those obtained by using minimally invasive techniques such as the retinaculotome or the endoscope [6]. The reported advantage of the minimally invasive techniques is a small-sized incision, which allows for a short operating time and an early return to work for the patient. A thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the carpal tunnel is essential in order to avoid complications and to ensure optimal patient outcome. There are many strong arguments for open (short 2-cm incision) vs. conservative treatment. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) potentially have great value in selecting patients for a specific treatment and in objectively assessing the efficacy of treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. Release of the transverse carpal ligament can be performed safely under local anaesthetic without requiring a tourniquet (bupivacaine 0.5% without adrenaline) and bipolar diathermy. The local anaesthetic was injected into the carpal tunnel and into the subcutaneous tissue under the skin incision, from proximal to distal, in order to make infiltration more comfortable. Purpose The objective of this prospective clinical study was to investigate the potential benefits when dealing with complications (adherence of the flexor tendons and severing or scarring of the median nerve) using the Layershield Matrix (SuprofilmTM) as an adhesion barrier following mini open carpal tunnel release. Patients and Setting The study cohort (L.S matrix group) consisted of consecutive patients (200 patients) treated with Suprofilm. Patients in the standard procedure group (200 patients in all) underwent operations without using the matrix. Patients underwent carpal tunnel surgery (Figure 1) using the same technique in both groups and completed follow-upevaluations at no less than 12 to 24 months post-operation. The maleto female ratio was 1:6. Twenty patients were found to have bilateralinvolvement. All operations were conducted by the author (2012-2013). All patients complained of numbness and/or sensory disturbance orweakness in the median nerve distribution of the hand. Tinel andPhalen sign tests were positive in about two-thirds of patients. EMGstudies were performed in all patients and were positive, ranging frommild to severe. Study Design and Technique To evaluate the role played by the L.S matrix in avoiding scar tissue and adhesion of the median nerve after decompression in carpal tunnel syndrome (Figure 2). Results Numbness and paresthesia were relieved in 95% of patients in the L.S.M group and 89% in the control group (CG). Pain was relieved in95% DG and 90% was relieved in 95% DG and92% CG. Normal grip strength was DG and 91% hadnormal pinch strength. Re-operation Rate Adherence of the flexor tendons in 3 CG patients and 8 patients due to scarring involved the median nerve, with the L.S matrix group undergoing re-operation for the following reasons: recurrent pain (3 patients for scaring around the median nerve). The difference in re-operation rate between the L.S matrix group and the standard procedure group is statistically significant (p<0.01). There were no infections or complications due to the L.S matrix. After 8 weeks the matrix became endogenous tissue, meaning that fibrosis was over at this point. Discussion Long-term persistent pain is a major determinant for the success or failure of open carpal tunnel release (OCTR). The complication of long-term persistent pain may arise from any of the following causes: hypertrophic skin scarring, intra- and perineural scarring, adherence of the nerve to the skin, subcutaneous tender nerve secondary to Figure 1: Short incision for a carpal tunnel release. Figure 2: Suprofilm matrix in place to avoid complications: scarring of the median nerve.J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Carpal Tunnel Release with Shield Matrix 53 Volume 12 Issue 2 2 superficial position, adhesions between flexor tendons and the median nerve, pillar pain at the thenar and hypothenar eminences, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) [7]. Hypertrophic scars are often the result of an incision that transverses the flexion crease at a right angle. If a painful hypertrophic scar should occur despite all attempts to prevent this, scar revision should be performed [8]. Intra- and perineural scarring sometimes produces dysesthesia, pain scarring [9]. intra- and perineural scarring should develop despite the surgeon's best efforts to prevent it, the hypersensitivity and dysesthesia respond to coverage of the nerve with a L.S matrix (Figure 1). The superficial position of the median nerve and adherence of the nerve to the skin are usually consequences of an improper skin incision directly above the nerve, rather than toward the ulna. Splinting the wrist in a slightly dorsiflexed position for the first 3 to 5 postoperative days may lessen the likelihood of superficial nerve position [10]. Three common methods of insulating the nerve from the skin surface include: rotation of a hypothenar fat-pad flap; rotation of local muscle pedicle pronator quadratus and abductor digiti minimi; and Z-plasty with underlying temporary silicone sheeting, or the easy way[11] is to use L.S matrix to prevent scar adherence. Tendon adhesionsmay result from poor hemostasis during conventional OCTR surgeryor from bleeding associated with tenosynovectomy. Resection of thesynovium is usually indicated only in cases of an extremely bulkysynovium, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis, becauseof the propensity of tenosynovectomy to cause bleeding and scarformation with subsequent adhesions between tendons or betweentendons and the median nerve [12]. Using the matrix may reducethis point. Preoperatively, patients should be informed about theexpected clinical course following carpal tunnel release. They should be specifically warned about tenderness around the incision for up to 8-12 weeks after the operation. Although night-time symptoms are oftenrelieved immediately, other symptoms, such as persistent numbness,weakness or clumsiness are due to nerve damage. These will be verygradually resolved, and recovery may be incomplete [13]. The patientshould be counselled regarding activity modification and the possibleimpact on his/her employment. The patient should also be instructedon the isolated tendon-gliding exercises to be initiated postoperatively. Gentle exercise and light use of the hand is encouraged from the day after surgery. The bandage and stitches are removed about a week after surgery. The palm is tender for at least four to six weeks after the procedure. Golf and hand-related sports are usually too uncomfortable for up to six to eight weeks postop. Patients planning to return immediately to strenuous activities may do so in a short arm cast or strong clamshell splint, 30 degrees wrist dorsiflexion, basal joint immobilized, worn for one month. The effects of scar tissue shrinking and maturing result in adhesions which pull on the median nerve and often result in brief shooting or electrical pains with motion, particularly when the patient stretches his or her hand out to reach something at arm's length. Sudden shooting or electrical shock pains may also occur spontaneously while the patient is inactive. Both of these are normal occurrences and improve with time [14]. The shrinking and swelling associated with scar maturation results in the feeling of a lump at the base of the palm at the proximal end of the incision. This is most noticeable when the patient leans on the hand while changing from a sitting to a standing position. This is normal and improves over time and with massages. Patients are given therapy to make their hands less tender. Grip strength is normally reduced for two to three months following surgery, but full recovery can be expected. The mid-proximal palm is normally the most sensitive and tender to the touch during the interval from two to six weeks following surgery. The patient is given clearance to resume light activities within their own tolerance level, including driving, as soon as they feel comfortable enough to do so. They are encouraged to use common sense and avoid activities that may cause pain. They are normally seen for a follow-up visit four to six weeks after surgery. Conclusion Findings in this study (reduced pain and lower incidence of adhesions) are consistent with the Suprofilm Matrix acting as an effective adhesion barrier. By preventing median nerve adhesions, the collagen dural matrix may significantly reduce the incidence of disabling pain associated with re-operation. Ultimately, the prophylactic use of the L.S Matrix to prevent adhesions may result in improved patient outcomes.

According to Pe\u00f1a and Bechit there is a wide spectrum of presentation, ranging from low perineal fistula to high anomalies with complex surgical management [3,4]. As Stoll and Moore discussed, ARMs are often associated with a complex range of another anomalies i.e. esophageal atresia, and central nervous system, cardiovascular, urogenital, gastrointestinal and skeletal defects [5,6]. In his report, Holschneider stated that the advances in imaging techniques and improvements in the knowledge of embryology, anatomy and physiology of ARM cases have refined both diagnosis and surgical therapy [7]. Other authors found that the classical approach to this pathology have moved towards PSARP and minimally invasive techniques with a clear goal of improving anatomical and functional outcomes and quality of life [8].

Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 146 patients with ARMs was conducted over a 20 years period in our pediatric surgery department. The clinical and demographical data, operative protocols, short and long term outcomes were subject to assessment. Results: The patient series included 85 boys and 61 girls aged between one day and two years, of which 82.19% were diagnosed in the first few days of life by means of clinical examination and current imaging tests. In 26.02% of cases we found associated congenital abnormalities. A total of 142 (97.25%) cases of all our series underwent surgical treatment; four patients died before surgery. For 131 children the definitive treatment involved posterior sagittal in 115 patients showed good clinical continence in 82 cases (71.30%) but more than half of the teenagers had body dissatisfaction and social difficulties. Conclusions: Through this review of 20 years of experience our findings are consistent with other reports regarding male predominance, low birth weight, clinical and imaging diagnosis. We found however a lower incidence of associated abnormalities. The most frequent surgical intervention was posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) or posterior sagittal anorectovaginourethroplasty (PSARVUP), both by satisfactory functional outcome reporting nevertheless moderate social insertion. Our experience in ARMs proved the effectiveness of the consecrated surgical strategy; long-term assistance for patients and their families should be improved.Anorectal Malformations in a Tertiary Pediatric Surgery Center from Romania: 20 Years of Experience Iai, Romania Mary\" Emergency Hospital for Children, Iai, Romania 3\"St. Spiridon\" Emergency Hospital, Iai, Romania characteristics of the mother and child, birth weight, type of ARMs, clinical features including associated malformations, imaging tests, initial and definitive surgical approach and postoperative outcomes, comprising a long term follow-up with respect to functional aspects, psychological modifications associated with chronic disabilities, social insertion, and quality of life. Results The patient series included 146 children, 85 boys and 61 girls, with ages between 1 day and 2 years old, with a mean age of 46.4 \u00b1 5.7 days. Our report showed male predominance (58.21% vs 41.78%) along with a higher frequency in neonates with low birth weight (68.4% of all the patients, N = 100). A significant percentage of these children came from rural areas (64.4%, N = 94) and from families with low incomes (75.34%, N = 110). Mothers' age ranged from 16 to 42 years old, with a mean age of 21.3 \u00b1 2.3 years old. The initial diagnosis was made J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Ciongradi I, et al.56 Volume 12 Issue 2 3 in the first four days of life by means of a full physical examination in 120 patients (82.19%), within the first year of life in 14 cases (9.58%), and after one year in 12 children (8.21%) respectively. In the cases with delayed diagnosis, the main presenting complaint was chronic constipation. Although most of the patients admitted in our department were usually diagnosed at birth, some of them the anomaly correctly diagnosed beyond the early newborn period. All these cases were patients with perineal fistula, both males and females, or girls with vestibular fistula, in which a superficial examination of the perineal area and the presence of feces evacuation through the fistula in the first days of life led to a delay in establishing the diagnosis. These children subsequently developed constipation that consistently coincided with a change in their diet from breast milk to formula, or at the time of switching to solid food, so they were admitted for a pediatric surgical examination which identified the malformation. In the neonatal period, the anomaly presented most frequently with abdominal distension, vomiting and failure to pass meconium, associated with an abnormal aspect of the perineum (with or without the presence of an orifice). Upon perineal inspection, the most frequent clinical sign that we identified was the absence of a normal anal opening. Other frequently encountered findings upon physical examination included a bulge in the perineum or an anterior anal opening, meconium in urine and stool passing through the vestibule or, in the case of girls, through the vagina. Older patients presented with constipation and/or narrow anal opening (Table I). Clinical diagnosis of so called \"low\" ARMs was made in almost all of the male and female patients,while the more complex cases required further explorations. However, all the patients underwent plain thoracic and abdominal X-Ray, as well as cardiac and abdominal ultrasound to assess cardiac, genitourinary, vertebral and other associated anomalies. Invertography was performed in 27 cases (18.49%) to determine the location of the rectal pouch in patients without visible fistula (Figure 1). Other imaging contrast studies such as rectal pouch examination, fistulography and urethrography were performed in 40 cases (27.39%), while voiding cystography was conducted in 15 cases (10.27%) in order to detect the rectal urethral fistula or associated vesicoureteral reflux. Endoscopic evaluation of the genitourinary tract was performed in 62 patients (42.46%), including 11 cases of cloaca, in order to assess the complexity of the malformation. In 8 of these cases the length of the common channel was less than 3 cm. Other endoscopic findings included the presence of a septate vagina (2 cases) and the identification of recto-urethral fistula (3 cases). In two cases perineal ultrasound measured the distance between the rectal pouch and perineal skin. None of the patients underwent CT or MRI explorations. As far as the type of ARMs according to Pe\u00f1a's classification is concerned, there were 87 perineal fistulas (59.58%), and two patients with rectal atresia (1.36%) (Table II and Figure 2). Associated abnormalities were found in 38 patients (26.02%), some of them having two or even three congenital defects. The most common were genitourinary lesions in 14 (9.58%), agenesis, undescended testis, and syndrome. anomalies were reported 11 cases (7.53%), including tetralogy of Fallot or left ventricle hypoplasia. We noticed a significant incidence of Down syndrome (12 cases; 8.21%), esophageal (OESI) (2 cases; 1.36%). Surgical treatment was performed in 142 out of 146 patients; four patients died before surgery due to multiple associated congenital anomalies. The surgical approach and timing were dictated by the type and anatomy of the malformation, general condition at the time of presentation, and additional pathology (Table III). A total of 33 patients (23.23%) underwent colostomy; in 30 children, the colostomy was placed on the transverse colon, while the other three were fitted with a divided colostomy placed at the end of the descending colon. All the female patients with cloaca and vestibular fistula received an ostomy, and all the rectourethral fistulas in male patients were managed in the same way. Also, the colostomy as the first surgical procedure was performed on the two patients with rectal atresia. The preliminary colostomy was part of three stage repair, as all cases subsequently underwent posterior sagittal with imperforate anus or perineal fistula (109 patients) underwent a mini PSARP or PSARP procedure, without requiring a colostomy, so in 76.76% of the cases the original and preferred surgical protocol was a definitive anorectal reconstruction (Figure 3). The definitive treatment in 131 children (92.25%) was PSARP, with an additional abdominal access in 4 cases due to a high placed rectal pouch. All cloacal cases underwent a PSARPVUP procedure (7.74%) with abdominal access in 4 cases. Early postoperative complications were minor, including perineal wound infection (4 patients), and colostomy related complications - prolapse (4 cases) and stenosis (1 case); all such complications were treated conservatively. We also reported three postoperative obstructions which required surgical therapy. Patient follow-up was carried out on a regular basis for all the patients every 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, and then annually. In patients over the age of three, periodic monitoring included clinical continence, social insertion and their quality of life. The functional outcome was assessed in 115 patients over the age of three, and the results were as follows: good in 82 cases (71.30%) - presence of voluntary defecation, no or occasionally soiling, absent or mild constipation; acceptable in 25 cases (21.73%) - presence of bowel movement, rare soiling, moderate constipation); and poor in 8 cases (6.95%) - absence of voluntary defecation, moderate to severe soiling and any degree of constipation. Three of these cases required additional surgery for continence purposes. In the follow-up group, 39 children (33.91%) presented with constipation, which was more prevalent in the group with perineal, vestibular fistula and imperforate anus, but it Figure 1: Invertography: Holding the baby upside down, a lateral radiography is performed to observe the distance between the level of gas in the distal rectum and a metal piece placed over the expected anusClinical Findings N (%) Vomiting, abdominal distension 69 patients (47.26% ) Failure to pass meconium 63 patients (43.15%) Bulge in perineum with absent anus 42 patients Anterior anal Constipation/narrow anal 26 patients (17.80%) Meconium in urine patients (14.38%) Passing meconium through the vagina / vestibule 20 patients (13.69%)Table I: Associations of clinical findings in children with ARMs.J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Anorectal Malformations in a Tertiary Pediatric Surgery 57 Volume 12 Issue 2 3 was associated with good bowel control. On the other hand, cases with severe malformations (cloaca, recto-urethral fistula, rectal agenesis) were found to have a high prevalence of soiling (8 cases, 6.95 %). A small group of 44 children (24 males and 20 females) remained in our database until the age of 18; psychological assistance was provided in all cases, along with short psychotherapy meetings. Standardized interviews were used to assess the patients' school performances and behavior, while validated tests and questionnaires were used to evaluate their intelligence, attention, self-esteem and quality of life. The majority of the patients (35 cases, 79.54%) have normal intelligence (for IQ, M = 92) with no statistically significant difference between boys and girls. All patients were enrolled in normal schools. Psychological distress and emotional difficulties were identified in teenagers (32 cases, 72.72%) together with a low level of body-consciousness and self-confidence, as well as a relatively reduced autonomy and social contacts (28 cases, 63.63%). Over half of these children (26 patients, 59.09%) avoided participating in activities that are specific for their age. Discussion Malformations of the anus, anal canal and rectum are relatively common congenital defects, often coexisting in a significant percentage of cases with other congenital anomalies, but as different authors reporting their incidence has major differences in terms of worldwide geographic distribution [1-3,7]. Researchers such as de Blaauw and Wijers found that the causes of ARMs are unknown, but some studies demonstrated a genetic predisposition to these conditions [9,10]. ARMs include a wide spectrum of inborn defects ranging from perineal fistulas that require a relatively simple modality of treatment to major defects that require complex management. The multiple taxonomy of these lesions (Wingspread, Pe\u00f1a, Kirkenbeck) proposed in the literature is rather confusing, most practitioners currently favoring a classification based on the anatomical criteria depending on the position of the rectal pouch relative to the puborectal sling, associated abnormalities (\"syndromic\" forms) and the presence or absence of fistulas [2,10,11]. Advances in imaging techniques along with improvements in embryology, morphology and pathogenesis of these lesions have refined both diagnosis and management, moving from classical procedures to PSARP (VUP) and even minimally invasive methods, as discussed by different authors [12-18]. In our report we noticed a male predominance and a higher frequency in male neonates with low birth weight. The median age of the mothers was 21.3+/-2.3 years, lower than the national average reported by the National Statistics Institute for that period, i.e. 22.5-26.0 years [19]. These findings are consistent with Vermes' report, which suggested that the male gender and intrauterine growth restriction, together with mother's age and low socioeconomic conditions may have an impact on the risk of ARMs [20]. In our series, the majority of ARMs were diagnosed at or soon after birth upon routine postnatal examination. Evident features of these anomalies included the absence of the anus or an abnormal appearance of the perineum, i.e. lack of or minimal passage of meconium, but evidence of perineal, vestibular, recto-urethral fistula or persistent cloaca (as a frequent deformity in female patients). In addition to this, clinical signs in the neonatal period included vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium. We performed VACTERL (Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheoesophageal and/or Esophageal atresia, Renal and Radial anomalies, and Limb defects) screening in all newborn with a diagnosis of ARMs upon the first perineal inspection. However, we have identified a number of 26 cases (17.80%) with a late diagnosis in children with perineal fistula or vestibular fistula misdiagnosed in the neonatal period and referred to us due to severe constipation or narrow anal opening. We consider that a correct physical examination of the perineal area is crucial in the neonatal period in order to avoid a delay in the diagnosis of these cases. In a quarter of the cases, ARMs presented with associated abnormalities, the most common of which were urinary tract and cardiovascular defects. Our findings are not consistent with other authors' research that finds an association between anorectal malformations and other inborn defects ranging from 68% to 78%. As far as the types of associated congenital defects are concerned, the literature reports a variety of multisystemic conditions associated with ARMs and fetal alcohol syndromes [21]. Authors like Blnescu and Nah found an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and urogenital defects, while others found more genitourinary and spinal anomalies [14,22]. The most frequent associations in our study were genitourinary malformations and Down syndrome, followed by cardiovascular anomalies and esophageal atresia. The diagnosis of ARMs in our series was mainly clinical, including routine imaging (thoracic, abdominal, pelvic and spinal X-rays) and invertography, abdominal ultrasound and contrast studies, along with endoscopic evaluation that aimed to evaluate the topography and extent of the lesion. The recent ARM-Net meeting brought minor changes to the preoperative management of ARMs regarding the 24 hours re-evaluation and cross-table lateral X-ray, compared to Levitt and Pe\u00f1a's flow chart [23,24]. It wassuggested that in a newborn male with a perineal fistula, a cross-tablelateral X-ray is unnecessary, this procedure being recommended onlyin cases of normal buttocks, normal spine, normal sacrum, and negative urinalysis on meconium; this protocol was extended to female neonates with visible fistula. Early diagnosis was essential for short and longterm prognosis. Almost all our patients underwent surgery, except fora few patients (4 cases, 2.73%) with delayed admission, majorcomorbidities and impaired general condition, who died shortly afterpresentation. Neonates with low-type ARMs benefit from minimalPSARP, with good short and long term results. PSARP was performedin male patients with cases of high-type ARMs, preceded by a protective colostomy. All cloaca cases were treated in the neonatal distribution (according to Pe\u00f1a's classification). A B D C Figure open access journal Ciongradi I, et al.58 Volume 12 Issue 2 3 placing a colostomy, and a PSARVUP procedure was later used as final surgery, sometimes requiring an associated abdominal approach. As far as the treatment alternatives for female patients with vestibular fistula are concerned, the literature argues for either a one or a three stages surgery. The supporters of perineal surgery in the neonatal period champion the idea of one stage surgery for the purpose of reducing possible anesthesia and morbidities-related colostomy complications. However, this type of surgery requires good bowel preparation, as there is a great risk of infection. We preferred to do a three stages surgery (colostomy, followed by PSARP and then colostomy closure) in a more cautious approach, although there are studies like Adeniran's and Liu's showing no significant differences in functional outcomes between a one stage and three stage operation [25,26]. The final goal of the surgical treatment in ARMs is to obtain an anus placed within the muscular complex, by separating the rectum from the genital or urinary tract and also to gain continence without any social impairment. The long term functional outcome is essential for these patients' quality of life. During our follow up period, we noted that 71.30% of the cases acquired voluntary bowel movements, these results being similar to those previously reported by Sohyun Nam (84.8%) or Pe\u00f1a (75%) [8,27]. Almost half (42.10%) the children with high anomalies like cloaca, recto-urethral fistula and rectal atresia presented with moderate and severe soiling (i.e.6.95 % of patients in the follow-up group), a result that also seemed similar to other series, as Rintala reported a rate of 30% soiling in these patients [28]. The majority of patients that remained in our database until the age of 18 had a normal intelligence, but their sustained attention was below the norm. This data is consistent with Hondel's studies, which also suggest that these patients should benefit from special education or remedial teaching [29,30]. All the children from our sample were enrolled in normal schools. Due to educational policies in Romania of the last two decades, we have no cases of children integrated in a special institution. We found that 63.63% of teenagers were dissatisfied with their body and 59.09% were having difficulties in social activities; our results are consistent with Grano's reports on self-perception and social insertion in children with ARMs [31]. Schmiedeke considers that multidisciplinary behavioral treatment (MBT) should offer psychological assistance both for the parents and the child, as well as physical therapy, thus reducing psycho-social distress. There is still an open discussion regarding the possibilities of accurate quantification of the short and long term outcomes. Despite our sometimes limited possibilities to investigate these children, we succeeded in taking a correct approach to our cases, with promising short and long term results of definitive surgery; reduced morbidity and lack of postoperative mortality come to support our approach to surgical treatment of this pathology. This study has several limitations as it is a single center report and it only provides limited data regarding the long-term monitoring of the patients. We intend to focus our future research on vestibular fistula dilation in selected patients. (Low birth weight <2,000 g or severe associated congenital anomalies). Conclusion A better understanding of pathogenesis with more accurate pre- and intraoperative diagnosis together with continuous perfectible practice of established operative techniques appear to be the keys to success in ARMs management, aligning our team experience and expertise toward reputed centers. We support a multidisciplinary approach to these cases, using complex teams that include neonatologists, pediatrics, surgeons, pediatricians, psychologist and family doctors, together with a monitored transition towards adult gastroenterology centers.

Condylomas have been well known in history with physicians of ancient Roman Empire calling them as \"figs\" which were thought to result from excessive sexual exploits [1]. The term \"acuminatum\" means \"pointed\" and was used (commonly known Buschke-Lowenstein tumor) is a rare, aggressive, slow growing; fungating variant of condyloma that is usually found in the genital and perianal regions but may affect any portion of the anogenital region. While the tumor was first clinically described by Buschke in 1896, both Buschke and Lowenstein first discovered the histological features in 1932 and hence the name, Buschke-Lowenstein tumor. Although benign in nature, the GCA is also sometimes known as \"verrucous carcinoma\" because of its tendency to deeply invade the underlying tissues. It has been also described as a rare variant of genital warts [3]. Some authors, however, consider GCA as an intermediate form between benign condyloma acuminata and malignant verrucous carcinoma [3]. While there is no standard treatment due to its biological behavior, surgical excision remains the method of choice to achieve local control of the disease. Most of the authors recommend radical excision with clear histological margins and eventual abdominoperineal resection for perianal and anal canal invasion or malignant transformation [4-6]. The use of a temporary loop colostomy before excision, to avoid a possible contamination of the wound is rarely applicable. On the other hand, skin reconstruction can be performed with the use of different plastic procedures. S-plasty grafts (right or left gluteus and posterior leg flaps) and V-Y advancement flap technique have been commonly used [7,8]. We represent a case report of a perianal and anal GCA treated by radical local excision and reconstruction with the V-Y plasty technique and a review of the literature. Case Report A 51 years old homosexual man was admitted to the surgical department in October 2010 for a lesion located in the perianal and anal region. The patient was complaining of a painful palpable mass for the last year and also of itching and constipation. The last month he noticed a foul smell, bleeding and mucopurulent perianal discharge. On physical examination an enormous, exophytic, cauliflower- like tumor was found with irregular surface, eventually exceeding 10 cm in length and 8 cm in diameter. All the patients blood tests were normal, while he was found HIV negative and HbsAg positive. The tumor was totally excised. The entire specimen was sent for histological examination to ensure clear margins and the absence of a malignant verrucous carcinoma. Skin defect reconstruction was achieved with a bilateral V-Y fasciocutaneous advancement flap. The skin incision was closed with a stapler and the medial edge of the flap was sutured to the anal area by a 3/0 ployglactin material. The histological report of the specimen revealed the presence of a giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Lowenstein tumor) with clear surgical margins and no evidence of malignant transformation. An HPV analysis was also performed by PCR technique, demonstrating the presence of HPV types 16 and 18, something less common in giant condyloma acuminatum. A non-fiber diet and loperamide (12mg/day) were administered for 4 days to avoid wound infection. There were no postoperative complications and the patient was discharged. After 2 years the patient is doing well without any evidence of recurrence (Figures 1-6). *Corresponding author: Dimitrios Sampanis, 4th Department of Surgery, Hospital, Athens, Greece, Tel:+306932655495; Fax: +302104297904; E-mail: Publis hed April Citation: Sampanis Condyloma Acuminatum (Buschke-Lowenstein Tumor): A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Although clinically malignant, its histology is benign without distant metastases. The incidence is 0.1% in the general population and while the prognosis is generally good with early diagnosis and proper treatment, mortality rates as high as 20% have been reported. Human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11are implicated as etiologic factors in the development of GCA. Radical surgical excision with clear histologic margins and plastic reconstruction remains the cornerstone treatment of choice, while preventing the incidence of recurrence. Topical agents and local destructive methods can be helpful for smaller lesions and immunotherapy as an alternative for widespread and relapsed cases. The authors report the case of a 51-year-old male patient with a perianal 8 \u00d7 7 cm Buschke-Lowenstein tumor who underwent total excision and plastic reconstruction with V-Y flap technique.Giant Condyloma Acuminatum (Buschke-Lowenstein Tumor): A Case Sampanis*, Maria Siori, Pantelis Vassiliu, and Evaggelos Kotsiomitis 4th Department of Surgery, Athens Medical School, ATTIKON University Hospital, Athens, Greece J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Sampanis D, et al.62 Volume 12 Issue 2 4 Discussion The incidence of GCA is probably 0.1% in the general population and about 2 to 3 million newly reported cases each year have been estimated [9]. While the prognosis is generally good with early diagnosis and proper treatment, mortality rates as high as 20-30% has been reported. Most frequently, Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 are implicated as etiologic factors [10] in the development of GCA. However, an immunologic aberration of the cell-mediated immune system and/or the combined synergistic effect of viral or environmental carcinogens may all contribute to the formation of the tumor. In addition, one of more of the risk factors may have a significant contributory role in the development or aggravation of the disease process. Gender: Buschke-Lowenstein tumor is much more common in males than in females. The ratio of males to females is approximately 2.3:1 [11]. Viral infection: The tumor has been found to be frequently associated with the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) viral infection [11,12]. In fact, almost all cases of GCA are associated with contagious low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 [3]. Condyloma acuminatum: GCA is always preceded by condyloma acuminatum, and the immune system is probably suppressed. Homosexual men: Common practice of anal receptive intercourse in the homosexual population is also considered a risk and GCA, therefore, is mainly seen in men. Uncircumcised males: The tumor has also been frequently noticed in uncircumcised men between the ages of 18 and 86 years. According to an estimate, about 5% to 25% of all penile cancers are GCAs [10]. Age: While GCA can occur at any age after puberty, it usually affects young patients in the second and third decades of life. However, its development between the 4th and 6th decades of life is also not uncommon. Various studies have shown that the average age for the occurrence of disease among most patients is 43.5 years [13]. Immunocompromised patients: In some cases, GCA has also been found to be associated with chronic diseases or immunocompromised states such as congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS), alcoholism, diabetes, or chemotherapy with immunosuppressive therapy [9]. Other associated risk factors include numerous sexual partners (such as common in prostitution), poor hygiene, depression of immune system, smoking and anaerobic infections etc. Although GCA is a highly differentiated squamous cell tumor of the genital region that is mostly benign, the characteristic thicker stratum corneum, marked papillary proliferation and its tendency to invade deeply displacing the underlying tissues are the histopathological features that differentiate the GCA from ordinary condylomas, and squamous cell carcinomas. It should also be noted that while squamous cell carcinoma and giant condyloma acuminata can coexist in 30% to 56% of patients [14], GCA only rarely presents with histological features of malignancy such as infiltration of the basement membrane, frequent mitotic figures, lymphatic or angioinvasion, and distant metastases. Granular vacuolization is present, and individual keratinocytes have large cytoplasm and a nucleus with prominent nucleolism [15]. The basal membrane is intact, and a lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate is present in the upper dermis [9]. The penis is the most common site for GCA development [3] Figure 1: A Buschke-Lowenstein tumor in the perianal area. Figure 2: The tumor very close to the anus. Figure 3: Circumferential excision is performed with wide margins, histologically negative for Condyloma acuminatum,although the perianal region, rectum, scrotum, perineum and bladder may also be involved. In women, however, the tumor usually occurs in the vulva, vagina, or cervix. Most frequent symptoms include continuous perianal discomfort, anal itching, and painful defecation associated with bleeding and mucopurulent perianal discharge. A clinical study involving review of 51 patients with GCA showed the most frequent clinical features to due to tumor-effect: perianal mass (47%), followed by (32%), and bleeding (18%) [11]. On physical examination, the tumor presents as an enormous, exophytic, cauliflower-like, white or yellow vegetative growth of papillomatous and irregular surface, eventually exceeding 10 cm [9]. It should be noted, however, that the gross appearance of GCA is not easily differentiated from ordinary condylomas or malignant squamous cell carcinomas as all of these masses appear as large cauliflower-like lesions. J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal A Case Report of Buschke-Lowenstein Tumor 63 Volume 12 Issue 2 4 squamous cell carcinoma because of its highly malignant behavior which often conflicts with its benign nature and histopathological features. In fact, according to some estimates, GCA has a malignant transformation rate as high as 50% [3]. Therefore, while the GCA tumors do not metastasize, clinically they are nevertheless regarded as malignant [16]. Appropriate treatment of GCA provides very good prognosis and low rate of recurrence. Prognosis is specifically considered good with adequate surgical excision [10]. However, good prognosis does not necessarily affect the rate of recurrence of the tumor which is also considered relatively high. Initial diagnosis is based on a detailed clinical history and a thorough, carefully performed physical examination of the patient. In most cases, the pathologic analysis of the specimen confirms the diagnosis of condyloma acuminatum, with moderate degree of dysplasia of the koilocytosis atypia, acanthosis, and a confirmatory diagnosis of GCA, however, deep biopsy from different points of infected tissue should be performed essentially involving the epidermal/dermal interface as the specimen usually shows presence of koilocytocic cells and the large hyperkeratotic cellular nests propagate deep into underlying stroma [15]. Although the lesion is generally benign, its management is often challenging due to the size, degree of local invasion, young age of the patients and high recurrence rate. In addition, as there are no universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of GCA, therapy is mainly based on individual case reports and degree of severity of the disease. The following treatment modalities are generally implied in most cases: Surgical excision: When possible, surgical excision with examination of histologic margins is considered as the cornerstone of treatment and is generally recommended as the treatment of choice in the early stages of the tumor for complete elimination of the tumor and prevention of recurrence. Excision must be wide and the Mohs technique is often used [9]. Lymph node dissection is indicated only in cases of suspected malignant transformation. However, evidence has shown that even surgically excised GCA cases tend to have a recurrence rate of about 50% [11]. In some cases, Cryosurgery has been also found to be successful but only in small, simple lesions. Medical treatment & chemotherapy: Most of the published studies and documented evidence have shown highly variable response to the medical drug / chemotherapy. Topical application of podophyllin, for example, has shown to be helpful for ordinary condyloma acuminata but is not recommended for the treatment of condylomata gigantean because of its large size. Similarly, topical chemotherapy with 5-fluororacil has been used for the treatment of genital condylomata, but seems to yield poor outcome with giant lesions. However, administering interferon injection directly in the lesion is considered safe and has an eradication rate of 47% to 62%. It should also be noted that interferon chemotherapy is associated with high cost and a recurrence rate up often 40% [14]. Similarly, systemic interferon therapy may be considered for those very large lesions that cannot be excised surgically because of the immune-modulating, anti-proliferative and antiviral properties of GCA. It is expensive, however, with a high incidence of side effects and a variable response rate. Systemic chemotherapy with methotrexate, 5-FU, bleomycin, mitomycin C, cisplatin, and leucovorin may also be tried in extensive or recurrent GCA. On the other hand, long-term treatment with oral retinoids such as etretinate or acitretin has been reported to be effective in GCA because of their immune-modulating, anti-proliferative and proapoptotic properties. In addition, Imiquimod, a potent antiviral and antitumoral agent known for its protective cytotoxic immune response against HPV acts as a synthetic imidazoquinaline immune- response modifier. As Imiquimod also offers the valuable benefits of Figure 4: The residual defect will be closed by advancing surrounding V-shaped islands of skin and underlying tissue. Figure 5: Closure of the flap wounds converts the V-shaped wounds to Y-shaped suture lines. Figure 6: Follow up after 2 months. GCA of the penis, for example, appears as a soft, pink, vascular, cauliflower-like warty growth that may be relatively small and localized initially but gradually enlarges to a size greater than 5 cm in diameter. The lesion begins on or around the prepuce and gradually becomes nodular [10]. In many cases, peripheral clinical signs such as inguinal lymphadenopathy have also been observed. The tumor often forms an ulcerating mass with abscesses and necrotic tissue [1]. Although GCA rarely metastasizes, its aggressive nature displaces deeper tissues by downward growth, causing multiple sinuses or fistula tracts that may invade deeply into the fascia, muscle, or rectum. In some cases, extension into the urethra, genitalia, and perineum can occur. This may result in inflammation, secondary bacterial infection, or hemorrhage. The lesion is also often complicated by several deep fissures discharging pus and blood. Improperly treated or unmanaged cases have been even found to be fatal in some cases [15]. One of the complications of GCA is its neoplastic transformation into fully invasive J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Sampanis D, et al.64 Volume 12 Issue 2 4 less tissue damage, self-applicability on an outpatient basis and lower recurrence rates, its 5% cream has been approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration for the topic treatment of GCA. It is applied three times a week overnight for up to 4 months [3]. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy with autologous vaccine from the patient's own condyloma has been reported with good success rates and, therefore, has been suggested for giant condyloma acuminata and recurrent lesions. Radiotherapy: Evidence has shown radiotherapy as a controversial option (even contraindicated by some) for the treatment of GCA because of high rate of recurrence and appearance of anaplastic transformations in some cases [15]. It should be, therefore, reserved for non resectable or adamantly recurrent lesions [3]. However, there is some evidence that indicates the effectiveness of definitive radiation therapy as used in the Nigro Protocol when a patient with recurrent GCA after four surgical excisions, treated definitively with radiation therapy to 45 Gy, showed total regression, and was biopsy-proven to be disease-free 20 months after radiation [11]. Laser therapy: Recently, CO2 laser therapy as the next step after the surgical excision has been found to have some benefits such as a bloodless field, the least destruction of surrounding tissue, the lesser degree of scarring and hemostasis in a same time [15]. HPV vaccine: The available quadrivalent HPV vaccine which is frequently used in females aged 11 to 26 years for the prevention of cervical cancer has been suggested by some to be used in males as a preventive therapy against condylomas and extensive condylomatosis although, at present, no data is available to support this claim [13]. While the overall rate of recurrence of GCA is variable and depends on the on the modality of treatment, recurrence rates as high as 67% and mortality rates of 20% to 30% have been reported. High rate of recurrence (over 60%) is characteristic for chronic disease [15]. Conclusion Condylomata gigantean commonly known as Buschke-Lowenstein tumor or giant condyloma acuminatum (GCA) is a rare but highly aggressive tissue destructing lesion of genital or perianal region that is usually found in men but is also not uncommon in women. Because of its location, severity and high recurrence rates, the disease causes significant psychological morbidity and requires active treatment. However, with no universally defined treatment guidelines, GCA tumor remains a well-known, clinically challenging, entity. To date, surgical excision remains the treatment of choice for most of the cases but other treatment modalities such as chemoradiotherapy and laser have yielded mixed results with variable success and recurrence rates. The tumor also has a strong tendency to recur but is not frequently associated with metastatic potential and yet is known for \"behaving in a malignant fashion\" despite having no histopathological features of typical malignancy. Post-treatment clinical monitoring is highly recommended.

One third of patients with one of these tumors present clinical and biochemical data of virilization or defeminization [2,3], although they generally have a good prognosis [4]. These tumors were initially called arrenoblastomas, and in 1958, they were designated Sertoli-Leydig tumors [5]. On the other hand, Meigs' syndrome is characterized by the presence of ascitis and pleural effusion, associated with a benign tumor of gynecological origin [6,7]. The majority of Meigs' syndromes present as with fibromas, thecomas, and granulosa cells, or Brenner tumor; the association of a Sertoli-Leydig tumor with Meigs' syndrome is an extremely infrequent event; thus, the importance of reporting a case in which this association is present. Clinical Case Patient feminine gender 48 years of age, without antecedents of importance, who initiated with a clinical condition with seven months of evolution, characterized by abdominal distension and edema of the lower extremities without other accompanying symptoms (Figure 1). The patient made an appointment with the physician, who requested abdominal Ultrasound (US), which detected a pelvic tumor, multicystic, heterogeneous, 24.4 \u00d7 23.5 \u00d7 18.4 cm in size, 5.605 cc in volume, uterus 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 10.8 cm in size, with intramural myomas of 6 \u00d7 4 cm, endometrium of 8 mm, ascitic fluid, which the requirement of multiple hospitalizations due to respiratory difficulty, with the performance of three evacuatory paracenteses prior to admission at our institution (Figure 2). On her admission, the patient exhibited anasarca with paleness and respiratory difficulty, integrating bilateral pleural syndrome, globus abdominalis at the expense of fluid with tense ascites without achieving delimitation of visceromegaly or intra-abdominal tumors, weight = 87 kg, Karnofsky scale = 50. Paracenteses was carried out, draining 6 L of cetin fluid and with placement of a pleural catheter for lung drainage. Tumoral markers on the patient's admission to the institution were the following: CA 125, 352 IU/ml; Alpha Feto Protein (AFP), 17 Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 0.62 ng/ml; CA 19-9, 2.9 IU/ml, and CA 15.3, 12.9 and hormones mesothelium without neoplastic cells. Computer Axial Tomography (CAT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were performed, considering that the patient was not an initial candidate for cytoreduction; thus, the decision was made to conduct a guided biopsy for diagnosis and to establish norms for treatment behavior. The biopsy was conducted with a cutting needle of the adnexal lesion without complications, reporting an ovarian stromal tumor, complementing the study with positive. was carried out, finding a multilobulated tumor, septated, multicystic, right ovary-dependent adhered to pelvic cavity, and right parietocolic gutter with myomatic uterus and left ovary of normal appearance. The transoperative study of the lesion reported a tumor of 29 cm with integral capsule with tumor of the sex cords. The patient was in intensive therapy for 7 days due to important bleeding during the surgical procedure, presenting resolution of the pleural effusion and of the ascitic fluid. The definitive pathological report demonstrated right ovary with Sertoli-Leydig-cell tumor of intermediate differentiation.

However, these conditions are resolved after tumor excision. Fewer than 60 cases of Meigs' syndrome have been reported in the literature to date that have a rise in the CA 125 antigen. The first case was documented by Jones and Survit in 1989 in a 70-year-old patient with a fibrothecoma and with an elevation of CA 125 of 226 IU/ml. The association of a Meigs' syndrome with Sertoli-Leydig tumors is extremely rare, we present the second case reported in the literature. The fact of being able to find the association of these two entities renders it evident that the Clinician should bear this in mind at the time of carrying out the evaluation of a patient with a pelvic injury that is bears a resemblance to advanced-stage ovarian cancer, and even more so if it presents with elevations of CA 125, in that Meigs syndrome will present complete resolution after the tumor excision.Sertoli-Leydig Tumor and Meigs' Syndrome, an Infrequent Association-A Case Nacional de Cancerolog\u00eda de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico 2Department of de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xicoJ Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Campos JS, et al.66 Volume 12 Issue 2 5 of 29 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 10 cm with integral capsule (Figure 3).

Discussion Sertoli-Leydig tumors represent a very low percentage of ovarian neoplasms at the National Institute of Cancerology (INCan) in Mexico: during the 2000-2004 periods, only five cases occurred among 754 ovarian neoplasms registered [8], corresponding to 0.66%, similar to that reported in the literature [2-5,9,10]. It affects all ages, but mainly women 25 years of age [11]. Are hormonally active with estrogen secretion, which is associated early puberty, endometrial hyperplasia, related with elevations in testosterone of >200 ng/dl. These tumors are solid in consistency and generally unilateral, up to 98%. Only 4% present with ascitis [14] and the majority of patients have pain and abdominal distension. Elevations have been reported of the marker AFP, which have been related with the existence of an intestinal-type component, obliging the performance of differential diagnosis with germinal cell tumor and, although less frequently, with hepatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry allowed confirmation of the diagnosis, because it was positive for alpha-inhibin in Sertoli as well as in Leydig cells. Prognosis is general is favorable, due to that 95% of these present confined to ovary [14], with 90% survival; generally, it has a malignancy rate of 13% with intrapelvic and abdominal distension, and recurrence can present in the first 10 years, although its percentage is extremely rare, with only one case of recurrence present in the literature [15]. Poor prognostic factors associated with this neoplasm comprise the heterologous component, the presence of gastric or intestinal epithelium, carcinoid foci, or stromal elements and retiform pattern, which determine to offer of adjuvancy in the treatment [5]. On the other hand, the Meigs' syndrome, also with infrequent presentation in approximately 4% of benign ovarian tumors [16], affects middle-aged women and is characterized by the association of a benign tumor of gynecological origin with ascitis and pleural effusion [17], which, in the majority of cases, induces the Clinician to suspect a malignant etiology. However, these conditions are resolved after tumor excision. Other tumors distinct from fibroma, such as teratomas or uterine leiomyomas are associated with the Meigs' criterion, and the denomination of Pseudo-Meigs' syndrome is preferred. The distinction between Meigs' and Pseudo-Meigs' syndrome is merely academic, because therapeutic treatment is the same [18]. Multiple theories have attempted to explain the pathophysiology of ascitis and of pleural effusion from the publication of Meigs in 1960, in which the author suggests that the ascitis could be associated with the pressure exerted by the tumor itself on the lymphatic vessels, thus the accumulation in the peritoneal cavity, or associated with the exudate of the tumor itself to the peritoneum6, and up to the most recent theories, which have related the production of inflammatory cytosine's or of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGF) and Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF), whose values have been documented as elevated pre-operatively, in pleural fluid as well as in ascitic fluid, with a decline in these values after tumor extirpation [19-22]. Fewer than 60 cases of Meigs' syndrome have been reported in the literature to date that have a rise in the CA 125 antigen ranging between 42 and up to 7,000 IU/ml (Table I) [23-63]. The first case was documented by Jones and Survit in 1989 in a 70-year-old patient with Figure 1: Teleradiography of thorax showing total collapse of the right lung at the expense of massive pleural effusion, which conditions displacement to the left of the cardiomedi astinum, left lung with compensatory expansion.Figure 1: Teleradiography of thorax showing total collapse of the right lung at the expense of massive pleural effusion, which conditions displacement to the left of the cardiomediastinum, left lung with compensatory expansion.

In our case, the patient also presented with a rise in CA 125 on her admission to our institution of 352 IU/ml. Elevation of CA 125 is considered the responsibility of the mesothelial cells, which produce the rise in response to the mechanical irritation generated by the tumor itself or by the ascitis [22]. The majority of Meigs' syndromes present as tumors, such as fibromas, thecomas, and granulosa cell tumors. Tumor size, to a greater extent than the histology itself, is found in relation to the amount of ascitis, as well as that of the pleural effusion, above all in lesions measuring >13 cm. The presentation of the Meigs' syndrome associated with a Sertoli- Leydig-cell tumor is extremely infrequent and, on our intentionally searching in the published literature, we found only one case that had occurred prior to our own. This case was reported in 2006 by Boldorini et al., in which the authors presented the case of a young, 26-year- old patient with a pure, 20 cm Sertoli-cell tumor associated Meigs' syndrome with elevated CA 125 levels of 1.720 IU/ml [7]. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors usually appear as solid masses, however, they may also present as heterogeneous lobulated lesions with both cystic and solid components [64], diagnostic image studies should include pelvic ultrasound and abdominopelvic computed tomography scan in selected cases [65]. Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors may exhibit characteristic radiologic features with which radiologists should become familiar [66]. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor are characteristic virilizing neoplasms and can easily be detected using color Doppler US rather than trasnvaginal US alone, but this presentation is small, no more than 30-50% of cases, the rest of these tumors have nonspecific appearance. On US usually present either as a distinct hypoechoic mass or a heterogeneous mass that is primarily solid with multiple cystic spaces. On CT images a soft-tissue attenuating adnexal mass is usually seen (Figure 4A-D). The solid portions characteristically exhibit avid contrast uptake [67-69]. On MRI strong hypo-intensity on T2- weighted images is not characteristic [70,71], but most of these tumors show a predominantly low signal intensity of the solid components, relating to the fibrous stroma, with some scattered cystic areas of high signal intensity [64]. Conclusion The association of a Meigs' syndrome with Sertoli-Leydig tumors is extremely rare: this is, to our knowledge, the second case reported in the literature. Tumor size in Meigs' syndrome is related to a greater degree with the severity of the presentation of ascitis and pleural effusion than with the histology. The diagnosis should include color Doppler US and abdominopelvic computed tomography and is confirmed with immunohistochemistry positive for alpha-inhibin. Meigs syndrome will present complete resolution after the tumor excision.

Case Report Open AccessJournal ISSN: 1584-9341 J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Volume 12 Issue 2 6Keywords: Complication cardiac surgery; Celiac trunk dissection; Post cardiac surgery Introduction Spontaneous dissection of the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries and of the celiac artery is uncommon occurrence [1]. Celiac artery dissection (CTD) is rare, and can present with intimal flap, mural thrombus or infiltration of fat around the artery. The causes of CTD are several and different: hypertension, arteriosclerosis, degeneration of the arterial wall, trauma, pregnancy, and arteriopathy, iatrogenic and unknown ones. The evolution of CTD isn't well known: it can be associated with complications like aneurysm formation or occlusion, splenic infarction, intraperitoneal hemorrhage and the intestinal ischemia. There are several management modalities applied by the physicians on a case by-case basis like endovascular repair or interventional radiological approach [2] or conservative treatment options by anticoagulants and anti-platelets besides antihypertensive drug are also applied. The choice of CTD isn't univocal and wee-defined: according to the reported scientific paper documented CTD from 1959, the proper treatment is related to celiac trunk lesion, celiac trunk complication and patient's clinical trend. The medical treatment consists of oral anticoagulation therapy and monitoring of the patient. The medical therapy failure or the CTS complicated with widespread bowel ischemia and /or large splenic infarction needs surgery because the life-threatening development. On the contrary, a localized and mild CTD due to malperfusion or with high risk of rupture could be treated by endovascular choice. Case Report A 72 year old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and chronic coronary artery disease treated with percutaneous coronary intervention two years earlier, was admitted to our hospital suffering from chest pain (angina) and exercise intolerance. Coronary angiography documented a severe lesion of the main stem (>70%)and mild lesion (50%) of the proximal right coronary artery. A Trans Thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) dilated aortic regurgitation (Regurgitation Volume 35 ml/beat). He underwent double coronary artery bypass surgery and Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR, with bioprosthetic valve). Surgery was performed with standard approach (median sternotomy) in normothermic (34\u00b0C) extracorporeal circulation. The Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) time was 170 minutes and mean blood pressure was maintained at about 70 mm Hg. The perioperative period was free of early complications. Hence, we administered Indobufen (200 mg die) and Warfarin to achieve a International Number Ratio (INR) range between 2 to 3. At the second postoperative day, the patient suffered two episodes of high-rate atrial fibrillation, immediately treated with Amiodarone and Metoprolol. After 48 hours, the patient presented abdominal pain with negative physical examination (the pain was mild and widespread, epigastric tenderness, no organomegaly, no signs of ascites, no abdomen aortic pulsation, normal bowel sounds, Blumberg', Murphy' Giordano' signs were negative) but mild leukocytosis (WBC 11980/mm 3). So we started diagnostic workup: an abdomen X-ray showed small air-fluid levels in the abdominal ultrasonography was negative; a computed tomography (CT) scan showed dissection of the celiac branch of the abdominal aorta (Figure 1A and B) associated with mesenteric distension. Hereby, an endoscopic exam documented ulceration with necrotic area at the second portion of duodenum without evident bleeding sites. Considering the patient details (Table 1) and the high surgical risk due to recent cardiac surgery and possiblemesenteric ischemia, we collegially decided for conservative therapy.The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit, nasogastric tubewas positioned and antibiotic prophylaxis was started. Indobufenand Warfarin were stopped and we introduced low molecular weightheparin (Enoxaparin 4000 UI subcutaneous twice daily) with protonpump inhibitors 40 mg die intravenous). Two dayslater, a 64-slide CT scan was performed and showed no aggravationor modification of the abdominal view (Figure 2).

This may result from atheroembolization, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or hypoperfusion. We reported the case of 72 year old man undergone to coronary artery bypass and aortic valve replacement, presented isolated celiac trunk dissection after surgery. CT scan described a dissection flap of the first part of celiac trunk possible due to ulcerative plaque without note of anterograde or retrograde development. Considering patient's hemodynamic, respiratory and general trend, we decided to choose conservative management. The sequent postoperative period was uneventfully, the patient was hemodynamically stable and he was discharged at the 20 th postoperative day. The atheroembolization was a life-threatening problem of all vascular districts: a correct CPB pressure and postoperative BP monitoring could help to reduce the incidence of its complications.Isolated Celiac Trunk Dissection after Surgery Unit and Heart Transplantation Centre, Department of Heart and Vessels, \"S. Camillo-Forlanini\" Hospital, Italy 2Cardiac Surgery Unit, Department of Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital Circolo Fondazione Macchi, Italy 3General Surgery Unit, Department of Hospital Circolo Fondazione Macchi, ItalyJ Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Terrieri F, et al.72 Volume 12 Issue 2 6 postoperative day, the endoscopy showed worsening and increasing of the ulcerations at the second segment of the duodenum with an evident bleeding site, ulcerations were treated with endoclips and local therapeutic injection of Epinephrine (1:10.000, 8 ml). The subsequent course was uneventful and with stable haemoglobin at laboratory test. At the 20 th postoperative days, the US-ECHO did not detect the intimal flap of celiac branch (Figure 3A and B). The endoscopy showed a regression of ulcerative lesions of the duodenum (re-epithelialisation). The patient was discharged and the 1 year and 3 year follow up was free of long-term complication. He didn't refer any abdominal symptoms, the control CT scan and echography didn't showed alteration of the abdomen vascularisation (Figure 4). Discussion Gastrointestinal complications after cardiac surgery are rare but carry significant morbidity and mortality even when recognized early and treated appropriately. Reviewing the scientific literature these complications are rare (0.53%-2.1%) but often fatal (13.9%-63%) [3]. According to Mangi et al. [4], the documented or suspected postoperative mesenteric ischemia is a life-threatening fatal complication (death in the 68% of the cases). The outcome in mesenteric ischemia is closely dependent on the elapsed time to diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis is typically difficult and delayed due to nonspecific results of biological and radiological tests. The etiology of mesenteric ischemia may also be conceptually classified into two distinct subsets: low flow and low perfusion states and embolic related events. Mangi et al. [4] observed that CPB had been implicated in the development of mesenteric ischemia modifying the regional intestinal blood flow, by pulsating to continuous flow. Tao et al. [5] demonstrated that normothermic CPB may cause a diversion of the blood flow in the splanchnic district away from the ileum and colon. These changes accompanied dysfunction of mesenteric endothelial cells causing hyper-reactivity of alpha agonists [6]. Survival from the insult of mesenteric ischemia depends partially upon the early diagnosis. The most sensitive indicators of mesenteric ischemia after cardiac surgery are abdominal pain (continuous, not local), increasing of lactate and base excess (BE) and spreading of metabolic acidosis. As the majority of cases of mesenteric ischemia occur during the initial hours to days following operation, fast-track extubation pathways and or minimal sedation theoretically may enable earlier recognition of a catastrophic gastrointestinal complication. When intestinal ischemia is clinically suspected, diagnostic imaging studies should be performed even if peritoneal signs are absent. Acute mesenteric ischemia is considered a vascular emergency; if treated during its initial stage, its mortality rate is less than 30% but if treatment is begun more than 6 to 8 hours after symptom onset, the mortality rate increases exponentially. Various treatment options are currently available, including conservative management, anticoagulation, endovascular stenting, and surgical repair. A review of current literature show that endovascular treatment techniques should be preferred, in order to place less of an additional burden on patients, most of whom have multiple morbidities [7,8]; immediate laparotomy must be performed for acute abdomen and revascularization of the intestine is the primary aim of treatment. Irreversibly damaged portions of the intestine must be resected. Carefully analyzing our reported case report (Table 1), we decided collegially (cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, cardiovascular anaesthesist and general surgeon) to choice the conservative management. Our conservative management consisted of: strict blood pressure monitoring, every day blood gas analysis and diuresis balance, daily control of bowel function and abdomen physical exam, performing control CT scan and abdomen echography periodically with a maximum interval time of 48 hours. Following this management, we have controlled closely the patient, every possible variables and changes, and the patient was successfully discharged after 20th day. Conclusion Acute mesenteric ischemia is a life-threatening surgical emergency in which the outcome is closely dependent on the elapsed time to diagnosis and treatment. Some studies have undertaken systematic analyses of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables to define the risk stratification to influence cardiac surgeons to Figure 1A: Axial contrast-enhanced CT Axial contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis CS: Patient's Trend Details Mild Symptoms Widespread and Shallow Abdominal Pain Mild diagnostic signs1.

Identification of risk factors for death after gastrointestinal complications provides general surgeons with clinically relevant features indicating subsets of patients most likely to benefit from laparotomy. The outcome is closely dependent on the elapsed time to diagnosis and treatment. Conservative management consisted of strict blood pressure control, bowel rest, and close observation, without the use of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents. Patients with a symptomatic dissection of the superior mesenteric artery should initially undergo conservative management without anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy if bowel perfusion is not compromised and if the superior mesenteric artery is not likely to rupture. Surgery is indicated in patients with superior mesenteric artery thrombosis; questionable bowel viability, bowel necrosis or severe haemorrhage. Patients initially treated with conservative management should be monitored closely and should undergo a follow-up CT scan.

A germline mutation of the STK11 gene located on chromosome 19p13.3 is responsible for development of PJS [4]. A solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp is a variant of PJS characterized by the presence of hamartomatous polyps in the absence of other manifestations of PJS [5]. These patients present with nonspecific symptoms with most diagnosed incidentally during endoscopy. We are reporting a case of giant solitary Peutz-Jeaghers-type hamartomatous polyp in the duodenum in a young girl presenting as gastric outlet obstruction. Case Report An 18 year old girl presented with history of recurrent non bilious vomiting of 4 month duration associated with vague upper abdominal pain. On abdominal examination, she had a mass in right hypochondrium with features suggestive of mass arising from the pancreas. She didn't about 10 \u00d7 6 cm arising from the medial wall of second part of duodenum close to ampulla of vater (Figure 1A). Biopsy from the mass was reported as adenoma with severe dysplasia. Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the abdomen revealed mass of size arising from the second part of duodenum with loss of fat planes with pancreatic head (Figure 1B). The mass was abutting superior mesenteric vein and right renal vein (Figure 1C). Patient underwent pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (Figure 1D). Post operatively she developed post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF) grade B which was managed conservatively. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed solitary Peutz-Jeaghers-type hamartomatous polyp arising from the 2 nd part of duodenum involving the ampulla of vater (Figure 1E and F). There was mild dysplasia, however no evidence of invasive malignancy. All the resection margins were free and lymph nodes were reactive. After recovery she underwent colonoscopy which was within normal limits. On retrospective enquiry, patient's parents had 2 nd degree consanguineous marriage though there was no family history of any hereditary disorders. At 8 months follow up, patient is disease free and in good health. At last follow up, patient underwent colonoscopy to rule out any other polyps. Discussion A solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp in the duodenum was first described in 1986 by Bott et al. [6]. This disorder differs from Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) in following characteristics: Diagnosis at a more advanced age, absence of mutation of the STK11/LKB-1 gene and family history as well as lack of muco-cutaneous pigmentation [5]. However in many cases it is difficult to determine whether these polyps are a separate variant or initial clinical manifestation of PJS. Present patient had no significant family history except for 2 degree consanguineous marriage among her parents and no muco cutaneous pigmentation around the oral cavity. Literature review by Suzuki et al revealed only 19 cases of solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp of the duodenum reported in English literature [7]. Age at diagnosis ranged from 23-89 years. Most common site affected was second portion of the duodenum followed by the duodenal bulb. Size of the polyp ranged from 5-70 mm. Present patient had a solitary hamartomatous polyp of size 80\u00d730\u00d730 mm [7]. The present case represents the largest polyp of this subtype reported in English literature. In addition, unlike previous reported cases she presented at the age of 18 years. Although most of these patients are asymptomatic with polyp being detected incidentally some may present with features of cholangitis or bleeding [7-9].

It is quite rare with only 19 cases reported in English literature. These cases present in older individuals are usually asymptomatic and carry increased risk of malignant transformation. Hamartomatous polyps are characterized histologically by tree-like branching of smooth muscle fibres covered by mucosal tissue of near normal appearance. Endoscopically, they are characterized by a lobular or nodular surface and whitish colour. We are presenting a case of giant Solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp of the duodenum who presented with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction that was treated with pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.Giant solitary Peutz-Jeaghers-Type Hamartomatous Polyp in the Karnataka, IndiaJ Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Pai VD, et al.76 Volume 12 Issue 2 7 of gastric outlet obstruction probably owing to the size of the mass. Hamartomatous polyps are characterized histologically by tree-like branching of smooth muscle fibres covered by mucosal tissue of near normal appearance [10]. Endoscopically, they are characterized by a lobular or nodular surface and whitish colour [11]. Whitish colour is because of the presence of diffusely scattered white spots on the surface of the polyps [12]. However, as diagnosis by morphologic features is difficult, endoscopic biopsies must be performed to establish the diagnosis and hence guide treatment. There is no consensus on the management of Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp of the duodenum. In general, hamartomatous polyps are considered to have very low malignant potential compared to adenomatous polyps [13]. However, malignant transformation has been reported in 3%-6% of the polyps in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome [14,15]. Although, it is a general belief that solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp of the duodenum have low malignant potential, 4 of the 19 patients included in the review by Suzuki et al had malignant transformation [7]. In this review, it was observed that higher age of presentation was associated with increased risk of malignancy. In addition, in one of the cases reported by Sekino et al, there were extra duodenal malignancies involving 6 other viscera [16]. In view of these findings, it is reasonable to consider resection of these tumors. The present patient had mild dysplasia in the polyp and hence warranted resection. Conclusion Purpose of reporting this case is because of Rarity of solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp.Giant size and varied presentation with symptoms of gastric outlet obstructionConflict of Interests The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and publication of this article.

While surgical resection has been an effective way of getting rid of colorectal carcinoma, laparoscopic resection offers the benefits including shorter hospitalization, rapid recovery, and smaller incisions, and thus has been widely used in removing the colorectal carcinoma. For colorectal cancer, migration of tumor cells to distant organs leading to the metastases of cancer is the main cause of death in colorectal cancer patients [1,2]. Currently, there have been efforts in understanding whether the surgical resection and laparoscopic resection result in significant differences in the peritoneal metastases of cancer [3,4]. This paper reports a study assessing the impact of surgical resection and laparoscopic resection on the peritoneal metastases of cancer in colorectal cancer patients. Study Design and Methods A cohort study design A total of 66 colorectal cancer patients treated between August 2013 and August 2015 were enlisted in a cohort study in which they were equally divided in random into two groups: a control group (33) and an observation group (33). Patient selection was based on the following criteria: (1) The absence of distant metastasis based on preoperative images including CT, ultrasound, and X-ray; (2) No dysfunction of the liver, kidney, heart, and brain; (3) No history of operation for gastrointestinal carcinoma; (4) Patients' age between 40-65 years old. Patients were excluded in the study based on the following criteria: (1) Abandoned operation due to tumor spreading to peritoneal cavity and peritoneum; (2) palliative operation. The control group had 11 females and 22 males, with ages ranging from 40 to 64, and an average age of 53.23 \u00b1 10.33 years old. In this group the average tumor size was 3.56 \u00b1 1.54 cm. Based on the Dukes classification of tumors, there were 8 cases in Stage A, 15 cases in Stage B, and 10 cases in Stage C. The observation group had 10 females and 23 males, with ages ranging from 40 to 65, and an average age of 53.09 \u00b1 10.13 years old. In this group the average tumor size was 4.10 \u00b1 1.65 cm. Based on the Dukes classification, there were 9 cases in Stage A, 12 cases in Stage B, and 12 cases in Stage C. Comparison of the patients' sex, age and Dukes classification between these two groups demonstrated no statistical differences (P>0.05). Treatment Patients in the control group were subject to surgical resection. Please refer to the Surgical Procedures section for colorectal tumor separation, dissection, removal and digestive tract repair. Patients in the observation group were subject to laparoscopic resection, with the procedures detailed as below.

Methods: A total of 65 CC cases undergoing radical resection at our hospital were analyzed. They were divided into two groups of LAP (laparoscopy, n=35) and OP (open surgery, n=30). Peritoneal tissues were collected at incision and beyond .Also abdominal rinse was collected before tumor resection and abdomen closure. The expressions of adhesion molecules (ICAM1 ,CD44v6 & integrin beta 1) in peritoneal and abdominal cavities of two groups were detected by immunohistochemistry and double antibody sandwich ABCELISA. And cancer cells in abdominal rinse were detected by peritoneal lavage cytology (PLC) for comparing two surgical methods. Results: In LAP group, PLC was positive in 3 cases (8.6%) before tumor resection and 8 cases (22.9%) before abdominal closure. In OP group, PLC was positive in 4 cases (13.3%) before tumor resection and 8 cases (26.7% ) before abdominal closure. No intergroup difference existed in PLC (P>0.05). The expressions of CD44v6, ICAM1 and integrin beta 1 in abdominal cavity (before tumor resection & abdomen closure) were compared for LAP and OP groups. And there was no statistically significant difference ( P>0 05). The expressions of CD44v6 ,ICAM1 and integrin beta 1 in peritoneal tissues (at incision and beyond) were compared between LAP and OP groups .And there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) . Conclusion: Compared with CC patients undergoing traditional open surgery, the risk of exfoliated cancer cells in abdominal cavity shows no increase. And there is no impact `upon the expressions of adhesion molecules.To Investigate the Impact of Laparoscopic Resection of Colorectal Carcinoma on the Peritoneal Metastases of Cancer Xin Wang*, Anren Sun, Linkang Xiao and Rong Yang Department of General Surgery, People's Hospital of Chongqing City, ChinaJ Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Wang X, et al.80 Volume 12 Issue 2 8 (CO2) gas to establish the pneumoperitoneum. Make a 10 mm Trocar incision around the navel to insert the laparoscope inside. Make a 10 mm and 5 mm Trocar incision at the lower left and right pneumoperitoneum respectively to insert the intestinal forceps. Pass the colonoscopy camera into the rectum and colon through the anus to locate the tumor site and determine the section to be surgically removed. Mark the tumor with a titanium forceps, and tie both ends of the colon approximately 10-15 cm from the tumor with cotton tapes. For rectal cancer, tie the proximal end first, followed by tying up the distal end during operation. Surgical procedures: For transverse colon cancer, use Harmonic scalpel to cut and separate mesentery from the transverse colon. Based on the location of the tumor, clamp off the colic arteries, and make the hepatic flexure and the splenic flexture free. Remove the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum, and extend the middle-left Trocar incision up to 4-5 cm, take out the transverse colon, remove the tumor. Perform the colonic anastomosis, and put the colon back into the peritoneal cavity. Close off the incisions and reestablish CO2 pneumoperitoneum to finish the operation. For ascending colon cancer, use Harmonic scalpel to cut and separate mesentery from the ascending colon. Make the hepatic flexture, ascending colon, and ilium free. Clamp off the right colic artery and right colic vein. Separate and cut the mesentery from the colon to the root of the right colonic artery. Remove the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum, and extend the middle-right Trocar incision up to 4-5 cm, take out the ascending colon, remove the tumor. Perform the ileum and transverse colon anastomosis, and put the colon back into the peritoneal cavity. Close off the incisions and reestablish CO 2 pneumoperitoneum to finish the operation. For sigmoid colon and rectum cancer, use Harmonic scalpel to cut and separate the mesentery from the sigmoid colon. Clamp off the artery roots of the mesentery. Make a ligation at the region 3-5 cm distal of the tumor using a cotton thread. Make a cut in the rectum. Extend the middle-left Trocar incision up to 4-5 cm, take out the colon, and remove the tumor. Suture the surgical ends together, and put the colon back into the peritoneal cavity. Close off the incisions and reestablish CO 2 pneumoperitoneum, insert the round stapler through the anus, and perform the rectal end anastomosis to complete the operation. Measurement: Tumor cytology analysis: Collect the rinsing liquid of the peritoneal cavity and centrifuged for 10 minutes. Collect the precipitated cells, followed with H&E staining, fixing and conventional smearing under sterile conditions. Analyze the tumor cells under the light microscope. Tumor cytology analysis for the rinsing liquid of the surgical tools: At the end of the operation, rinse the surgical tools with SSPS (150 ml), collect and store the rinsing liquid under sterile conditions. Tumor cytology analysis of the CO 2 gas filtrate: When the CO2 pneumoperitoneum was initially established draws the CO2 through the Trocar, and pass it through the filter bottle with 150 ml SSPS until the end of the operation. Store the filter bottle under sterile conditions. Tumor cytology analysis for shedding tumor cells in the pneumoperitoneum rinsing liquid: Prior to the operation, rinsing the pneumoperitoneum cavity with tumor using 200 ml SSPS, and collect 100 ml rinsing liquid using a sterilized syringe. Post the operation, rinsing the pneumoperitoneum cavity with 500 ml SSPS, and collect 200 ml rinsing liquid using a sterilized syringe. Store the samples under sterile conditions. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 Software. The counting data were analyzed by 2 test and expressed in percentages. The measurement data were analyzed by t test and expressed in x \u00b1 s. Data showed statistic difference whenever p<0.05. Results In this study, a comparison of the patients' sex, age and Dukes classification between the two groups (control group and observation group demonstrated no statistical differences (P>0.05). A comparison of the tumor-positive percentages in the pneumoperitoneum rinsing liquid before and after the operation No positive tumor cells were found in the CO2 filtrate. In the observation group, the tumor-positive percentages in the pneumoperitoneum rinsing liquids before the operation and after the operation were 63.64% and 60.61%, respectively. Also in the observation group, the tumor-positive percentages in the pneumoperitoneum rinsing liquids where tumor was found to be negative prior to the operation but positive post the operation was 6.06%. In the control group, the tumor- positive percentages in the peritoneum rinsing liquids before the operation and after the operation were 69.70% and 45.45% respectively. Also in the control the tumor-positive percentages in the peritoneum rinsing liquids where tumor was found to be negative prior to the operation but positive post the operation was 9.09%. This two groups showed no statistical differences with P>0.05. The results of the tumor-positive percentage in the pneumoperitoneum rinsing liquids before and after the operation were summarized in Table 1. In the observation group, the tumor-positive percentage in the device-rinsing liquid was 12.12%, in comparison to that of 9.09% in the control group. There is no o statistical difference between these two groups (P>0.05). The results of the tumor-positive percentage in the device-rinsing liquids between the observation group and control group were summarized in Table 2. Discussion It has been a clinical hot topic in understanding whether laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer would result in the peritoneal metastases of cancer [5-7]. Related studies have found that during the laparoscopic surgery, the cancer cells might exist in vaporized form when the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum is established [8-10]. In our study, results showed the absence of positive tumor cells in the CO2 filtrate, suggesting that the CO2 pneumoperitoneum during the operation could not increase the rate of cancer metastases. Despite of the wide use of Harmonic scalpel in the laparoscopic surgery to remove cancerous tissues, whether the vaporization of the cancer tissue could increase the peritoneal metastases of the cancer remains to be controversial. When using Harmonic scalpel to remove gastric cancers, the resulting aerosol also contained some living cancer cells. The number of cancer cells is directly proportional to the cutting power and cutting time. Having a cutting time <10s could prevent the peritoneal metastases of cancer cells [11]. Besides, the Harmonic scalpel may seal off the cutting end, causing the veins to be closed off. This would minimize the avenues of cancer cell metastases, preventing the peritoneal migration of cancer cells. This study also demonstrated that the tumor-positive percentage in the device-rinsing liquid from the observation group was 12.12%, in comparison to that of 9.09% in the control group. There was no statistical difference between these two groups. These results suggested that the devices contaminated with cancer cells might be one of the reasons for peritoneal metastases. However there was no significant difference in the metastatic rates between the surgical resection and laparoscopic resection. Post the surgery, the shed cancer cells within the abdomen is one of the main reasons for peritoneal cancer metastases. This study compared the tumor shedding levels from the surgical resection and laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer patients, and assessed their impact of these two surgical operations on the peritoneal cancer metastases. The study demonstrated no statistic differences in the peritoneal rinsing liquids between the control group and the observation group regarding J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Colorectal Carcinoma on the Peritoneal Metastases of Cancer 81 Volume 12 Issue 2 8 the preoperative tumor-positive rates, post-operative tumor- positive rates, and preoperative tumor-negative and postoperative tumor-positive rates. These results suggested that both surgical resection and laparoscopic resection could impact the peritoneal cancer metastases. The postoperative peritoneal rinsing liquids had a lower tumor-positive rate than the preoperative peritoneal rinsing liquids, suggesting that repeated peritoneal rinsing could decrease the tumor cell shedding and cancer metastases. Laparoscopic operation through changing the patient body position could decrease the pulling and dragging on the tumor and surrounding tissues, expand the operative view, lessen the injury to the peritoneal tissues, and avoid the stimulation of the lesions, thus lowering the cancer metastases. Overall, there is no significant difference in the peritoneal cancer metastases between the surgical resection and laparoscopic resection of the colorectal cancer. The application of CO 2 pneumoperitoneum does not increase the rate of peritoneal cancer metastases. Based on this study, we concluded that the laparoscopic resection of the colorectal cancer is safe, effective, and valuable for its clinical applications. Conclusion The surgical resection and laparoscopic resection had no significant difference in their impact on the peritoneal cancer metastases.

The differential diagnosis includes cystic or solid disorders of the female Case presentation: A 44 years old patient, was hospitalized for an giant abdominal tumor formation, pain, weight loss, nausea and vomiting. Laboratory data show changes in the sense of acute renal failure. Ultrasound examination reveals layout of carcinomatous ascites and native CT scanning, a giant cyst, without being able to specify their organ affiliation. The central venous pressure monitoring showed low values (less then 1 cm water), and intra-abdominal pressure, measured indirectly using the urinary catheter, revealed an increased value (25 mmHg). Patient undergone a midline laparotomy and it was found a giant cyst developed from from the left ovary. It was performed cystectomy associated with hysterectomy and controlateral ovariectomyl. The postoperative course was favorable and the patient discharged on day 6. Histopathology confirmed a mucinous cystadenoma Conclusions : Abdominal compartment syndrome is a severe complication of giant abdominal tumors, which must be solved immediatly by medical therapy and/or surgery. Choosing the type of surgery (open or laparoscopic) depends on tumor size and the possibility and establishing the preoperative histopathological diagnosis.Abdominal Compartment Syndrome-Severe Complication of Giant Abdominal of Surgery, University of Medicine and Pharmacy T\u00e2rgu Mure, Romania 2Department of Physiology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy T\u00e2rgu Mure, Romania 3Department of Anatomy, University of an open access journal Murean M, et al.84 Volume 12 Issue 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Severe Complication of Giant Abdominal Tumor 85 Volume 12 Issue 2 9 distan, av\u00e2nd o rat de supravieuire la 10 Cotran RS (1981) Pathology of female genital system and breast.

Familial history, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations, histopathologic type, stage of primary neoplasia and hormone status, is considered risk factors for breast metachronous cancer. The differential diagnosis between a breast contralateral metachronous cancer and a distant metastasis from the primary tumor is difficult and a subject of debate in the literature. We present herein two cases with breast metachronous contralateral tumors; the first is considered as distant metachronous metastasis and the second case, as a second primary tumor. A literature review was also performed.Breast Contralateral Metachronous and Liver Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucureti, Romania 2Department of Pathology, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucureti, Romania 3Department of Thoracic Surgery, of Colea an open access journal Vidu V, et al.88 Volume 12 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Breast Contralateral Metachronous Cancer 89 Volume 12 de de la diagnosticarea primului cancer. 2) Pacienta GI de 43 timp ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Vidu V, et al.90 Volume 12 Issue 2 10 st\u00e2ng, 100).J Surgery ISSN: 1584-9341 JOS, an open access journal Breast Contralateral Metachronous Cancer 91 Volume 12 Issue 2 10 sugereaz o predispoziie genetic la cancer bilateral, comparativ cu cele cu tumor un risc crescut de 4-20% [9] i poate fi general, de numai 4%, dup 10 ani la o tumor unilateral.
